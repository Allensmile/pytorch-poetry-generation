                                            

we came upon scenes like that, 
the world back of a lurid pane of glass.   
like in reno--they have emptied   
hollywood and ordered the extras and   
the stars to go get married and divorced   
in reno, making up their stories as they   
go and letting their little dogs 
decide which machines or churches   
to put nickels and dimes into. 

one day in a cut quick to the bone it was   
white, white and then the world came in.   
i got a tourniquet going, but the snow 
had learned a whole new way to look at the sky,   
as in maryland in the red fields, how the stones   
come startlingly white, on the battlefields,   
the cemeteries, along the gouged-out roads.   
there history blows about on dandelion seeds. 

on the plains near wakeeney, above the ground,   
short of the earth, at the level of the eyes,   
a sunset ray extended for miles. we drove along   
it, and let our thoughts down gingerly   
to touch what happened, where genevieve   
lived. she went out of the world, for death.   
her town holds quiet in the big plain.   
lights witness one by one all over what   
still abides. there was no one better.   
her town, her town, her town, the tires   
repeat as we go by. 

so while the parish priest at her bedside
went hammer and tongs at the prayers for the dying
and some were responding and some crying
i remembered her head bent towards my head,
her breath in mine, our fluent dipping knives--
never closer the whole rest of our lives.

                                               
fear of affectation made her affect 
inadequacy whenever it came to 
pronouncing words 'beyond her'. bertold brek.
she'd manage something hampered and askew 
every time, as if she might betray
the hampered and inadequate by too
well-adjusted a vocabulary.
with more challenge than pride, she'd tell me, 'you
know all them things.' so i governed my tongue
in front of her, a genuinely well-
adjusted adequate betrayal
of what i knew better. i'd naw and aye
and decently relapse into the wrong
grammar which kept us allied and at bay.

                                                
the cool that came off sheets just off the line
made me think the damp must still be in them
but when i took my corners of the linen
and pulled against her, first straight down the hem
and then diagonally, then flapped and shook
the fabric like a sail in a cross-wind,
they made a dried-out undulating thwack.
so we'd stretch and fold and end up hand to hand
for a split second as if nothing had happened
for nothing had that had not always happened
beforehand, day by day, just touch and go,
coming close again by holding back
in moves where i was x and she was o
inscribed in sheets she'd sewn from ripped-out flour sacks.

                                               
in the first flush of the easter holidays
the ceremonies during holy week
were highpoints of our sons and lovers phase.
the midnight fire. the paschal candlestick.
elbow to elbow, glad to be kneeling next
to each other up there near the front
of the packed church, we would follow the text
and rubrics for the blessing of the font.
as the hind longs for the streams, so my soul. . .
dippings. towellings. the water breathed on.
the water mixed with chrism and with oil.
cruet tinkle. formal incensation
and the psalmist's outcry taken up with pride
day and night my tears have been my bread.

                                                
in the last minutes he said more to her
almost than in all their life together.
'you'll be in new row on monday night
and i'll come up for you and you'll be glad
when i walk in the door . . . isn't that right?'
his head was bent down to her propped-up head.
she could not hear but we were overjoyed.
he called her good and girl. then she was dead,
the searching for a pulsebeat was abandoned
and we all knew one thing by being there.
the space we stood around had been emptied
into us to keep, it penetrated
clearances that suddenly stood open.
high cries were felled and a pure change happened.

                                                
i thought of walking round and round a space
utterly empty, utterly a source
where the decked chestnut tree had lost its place
in our front hedge above the wallflowers.
the white chips jumped and jumped and skited high.
i heard the hatchet's differentiated
accurate cut, the crack, the sigh
and collapse of what luxuriated
through the shocked tips and wreckage of it all.
deep-planted and long gone, my coeval
chestnut from a jam jar in a hole,
its heft and hush become a bright nowhere,
a soul ramifying and forever
silent, beyond silence listened for.


the trouble with paradise is you never want to be away from home.

i make what calls me out. 
all gone before you know it.

words may drop passing color yet seeing you here now are born again, and again. 
closing a word in the mouth feels the sound until the tongue can't stay still.

to unmask is to go silent.
language makes no promise to communicate.

an articulated sound has it own dream in the ear.
her presence in the room gives aroma to the syllables i voice.

now she's ready to draw eros from foreign bodies.
it starts by focusing on the sounds beyond hearing, still felt.

by she i mean who speaking animate configures.
this is the time of alternative obscurities to see through.

through thoroughly, as a word weighs.




as if he had been poured
in tar, he lies
on a pillow of turf
and seems to weep

the black river of himself.
the grain of his wrists
is like bog oak,
the ball of his heel

like a basalt egg.
his instep has shrunk
cold as a swan's foot
or a wet swamp root.

his hips are the ridge
and purse of a mussel,
his spine an eel arrested
under a glisten of mud.

the head lifts,
the chin is a visor
raised above the vent
of his slashed throat

that has tanned and toughened.
the cured wound
opens inwards to a dark
elderberry place.

who will say 'corpse'
to his vivid cast?
who will say 'body'
to his opaque repose?



what did he do except lie 

under a pear tree, wrapped in 

a great cloak, and meditate 

on the heavenly bodies?

venerable, the good people of baltimore 

whispered, shocked and more than

a little afraid. after all it was said

he took to strong drink. 

why else would he stay out 

under the stars all night 

and why hadn't he married?



         i
shifting brilliancies. then winter light
in a doorway, and on the stone doorstep
a beggar shivering in silhouette.

so the particular judgement might be set
bare wallstead and a cold hearth rained into--
bright puddle where the soul-free cloud-life roams.

and after the commanded journey, what?
nothing magnificent, nothing unknown.
a gazing out from far away, alone.

and it is not particular at all,
just old truth dawning there is no next-time-round.
unroofed scope. knowledge-freshening wind.

         ii
roof it again. batten down. dig in.
drink out of tin. know the scullery cold,
a latch, a door-bar, forged tongs and a grate.

touch the crossbeam, drive iron in a wall,
hang a line to verify the plumb
from lintel, coping-stone and chimney-breast.

relocate the bedrock in the threshold.
take squarings from the recessed gable pane.
make your study the unregarded floor.

sink every impulse like a bolt. secure
the bastion of sensation. do not waver
into language. do not waver in it.

         iii
squarings? in the game of marbles, squarings
were all those anglings, aimings, feints and squints
you were allowed before you'd shoot, all those

hunkerings, tensings, pressures of the thumb,
test-outs and pull-backs, re-envisagings,
all the ways your arms kept hoping towards

blind certainties that were going to prevail
beyond the one-off moment of the pitch.
a million million accuracies passed

between your muscles' outreach and that space
marked with three round holes and a drawn line.
you squinted out from a skylight of the world.

         v
three marble holes thumbed in the concrete road
before the concrete hardened still remained
three decades after the marble-player vanished

into australia. three stops to play
the music of the arbitrary on.
blow on them now and hear an undersong

your levelled breath made once going over
the empty bottle. improvise. make free
like old hay in its flimsy afterlife

high on a windblown hedge. ocarina earth.
three listening posts up on some hard-baked tier
above the resonating amphorae.

         vi
once, as a child, out in a field of sheep,
thomas hardy pretended to be dead
and lay down flat among their dainty shins.

in that sniffed-at, bleated-into, grassy space
he experimented with infinity.
his small cool brow was like an anvil waiting

for sky to make it sing the perfect pitch
of his dumb being, and that stir he caused
in the fleece-hustle was the original

of a ripple that would travel eighty years
outward from there, to be the same ripple
inside him at its last circumference.

         vii
i misremembered. he went down on all fours,
florence emily says, crossing a ewe-leaze.
hardy sought the creatures face to face,

their witless eyes and liability
to panic made him feel less alone,
made proleptic sorrow stand a moment

over him, perfectly known and sure.
and then the flock's dismay went swimming on
into the blinks and murmurs and deflections

he'd know at parties in renowned old age
when sometimes he imagined himself a ghost
and circulated with that new perspective.

         viii
the annals say when the monks of clonmacnoise
were all at prayers inside the oratory
a ship appeared above them in the air.

the anchor dragged along behind so deep
it hooked itself into the altar rails
and then, as the big hull rocked to a standstill,

a crewman shinned and grappled down the rope
and struggled to release it. but in vain.
'this man can't bear our life here and will drown,'

the abbot said, 'unless we help him.' so
they did, the freed ship sailed, and the man climbed back
out of the marvellous as he had known it.

         ix 
a boat that did not rock or wobble once
sat in long grass one sunday afternoon
in nineteen forty-one or -two. the heat

out on lough neagh and in where cattle stood
jostling and skittering near the hedge
grew redolent of the tweed skirt and tweed sleeve

i nursed on. i remember little treble
timber-notes their smart heels struck from planks,
me cradled in an elbow like a secret

open now as the eye of heaven was then
above three sisters talking, talking steady
in a boat the ground still falls and falls from under.

         x
overhang of grass and seedling birch
on the quarry face. rock-hob where you watched
all that cargoed brightness travelling

above and beyond and sumptuously across
the water in its clear deep dangerous holes
on the quarry floor. ultimate

fathomableness, ultimate
stony up-againstness could you reconcile
what was diaphanous there with what was massive?

were you equal to or were you opposite
to build-ups so promiscuous and weightless?
shield your eyes, look up and face the music.

i was a man
and i was trying to save a woman in danger.

i picked her up in my arms
and flew.

flying like a frog swimming in air
i ditched our nameless pursuer

and landed. there was a guy
waiting for us

who looked
like a king.

caught.
now i have to accept the punishment

for saving the woman.
first,

we have to take a shower.
the effect is to loosen
 
the skin from the muscle
until it peels off.

the woman
picks up the pieces of my skin and

holds them in her hands
and says i will love each of these

as i loved you.
and i thought this is what is called
 
fetish. and suddenly it came to me that the origin
of the word is fe- as in female, soft, loving, silken --

plus -tissue. like tissues flying.
voicing particles waking in waves

over a living body
of water

loose at last


precision clarifying vagueness 
boundary to a wilderness 
of detail chisel voice 
smoothing the flanks of noise 
catalytic making whisper and whisper   
run together like two drops of quicksilver   
factor that resolves 
                        unnoted harmonies 
name of the nameless 
                        stuff that clings 
to frigid limbs 
                        more marble hard 
than girls imagined by mantegna ...   

the sea has no renewal, no forgetting,   
no variety of death, 
is silent with the silence of a single note. 

how can i sing with my love in my bosom?   
unclean, immature and unseasonable salmon.


the adolescent night, breath of the town,   
porchswings and whispers, maple leaves unseen   
deploying moonlight quieter than a man dead   
after the locust's song. these homes were mine   
and are not now forever, these on the steps   
children i think removed to many places, 
lost among hushed years, and so strangely known. 

this business is well ended. if in the dark 
the firefly made his gleam and sank therefrom,   
yet someone's hand would have him, the wet grass   
bed him no more. from corners of the lawn 
the dusk-white dresses flutter and are past. 
before our bed time there were things to say,   
remembering tree-bark, crickets, and the first star 

after, and as the sullenness of time 
went on from summer, here in a land alien   
made i my perfect fears and flower of thought   
sleep being no longer swift in the arms of pain,   
revisitations are convenient with a cough,   
and there is something i would say again   
if i had not forever, if there were time.



for thomas edwards wanning
think of the storm roaming the sky uneasily 
like a dog looking for a place to sleep in, 
listen to it growling.

think how they must look now, the mangrove keys
lying out there unresponsive to the lightning
in dark, coarse-fibred families,

where occasionally a heron may undo his head,
shake up his feathers, make an uncertain comment
when the surrounding water shines.

think of the boulevard and the little palm trees
all stuck in rows, suddenly revealed
as fistfuls of limp fish-skeletons.

it is raining there. the boulevard
and its broken sidewalks with weeds in every crack
are relieved to be wet, the sea to be freshened.

now the storm goes away again in a series
of small, badly lit battle-scenes,
each in another part of the field.

think of someone sleeping in the bottom of a row-boat
tied to a mangrove root or the pile of a bridge
think of him as uninjured, barely disturbed.


the nominalist in me invents 
a life devoid of precedents.
the realist takes a different view 
he claims that all i feel and do 
billions of others felt and did 
in history's pre-me period.

arguing thus, both voices speak 
a partial truth. i am unique, 
yet the unceasing self-distress 
of desire buffets me no less 
than it has other sons of man
who've come and gone since time began.

the meaning, then, of this dispute? 
my life's a nominalreal pursuit,
which leaves identity clear and blurred, 
in which what happens has occurred 
often and never--which is to say, 
never to me, or quite this way.


for robert lowell
this is the time of year
when almost every night
the frail, illegal fire balloons appear.
climbing the mountain height,

rising toward a saint
still honored in these parts,
the paper chambers flush and fill with light
that comes and goes, like hearts.

once up against the sky it's hard
to tell them from the stars--
planets, that is--the tinted ones
venus going down, or mars,

or the pale green one. with a wind,
they flare and falter, wobble and toss
but if it's still they steer between
the kite sticks of the southern cross,

receding, dwindling, solemnly
and steadily forsaking us,
or, in the downdraft from a peak,
suddenly turning dangerous.

last night another big one fell.
it splattered like an egg of fire
against the cliff behind the house.
the flame ran down. we saw the pair

of owls who nest there flying up
and up, their whirling black-and-white
stained bright pink underneath, until
they shrieked up out of sight.

the ancient owls' nest must have burned.
hastily, all alone,
a glistening armadillo left the scene,
rose-flecked, head down, tail down,

and then a baby rabbit jumped out,
short-eared, to our surprise.
so soft--a handful of intangible ash
with fixed, ignited eyes.

too pretty, dreamlike mimicry
o falling fire and piercing cry 
and panic, and a weak mailed fist
clenched ignorant against the sky


i put those things there.--see them burn.
the emerald the azure and the gold
hiss and crack, the blues & greens of the world
as if i were tired. someone interferes
everywhere with me. the clouds, the clouds are torn
in ways i do not understand or love.

licking my long lips, i looked upon god
and he flamed and he was friendlier
than you were, and he was small. showing me
serpents and thin flowers these were cold.
dominion waved & glittered like the flare
from ice under a small sun. i wonder.

afterward the violent and formal dancers
came out, shaking their pithless heads.
i would instruct them but i cannot now,--
because of the elements. they rise and move,
i nod a dance and they dance in the rain
in my red coat. i am the king of the dead.


jamestown 
it kissed us, soft, to cut our throats, this coast,
like a malice of the lazy king. i hunt,
& hunt but find here what to kill?--nothing is blunt,
but phantoming uneases i find. ghost
on ghost precedes of all most scared us, most
we fled. howls fail upon this secret, far air grunt,
shaming for food you must. i love the king
& it was not i who strangled at the toast
but a flux of a free & dying adjutant
god be with him. he & god be with us all,
for we are not to live, i cannot wring,
like laundry, blue my soul--indecisive thing . .
from undergrowth & over odd birds call
and who would starv'd so survive? god save the king.


liar, i thought, kneeling with the others,
 how can he love me and hate what i am?
 the dome of st. peter's shone yellowish
 gold, like butter and eggs. my god, i prayed
 anyhow, as if made in the image
 and likeness of him. nearby, a handsome
 priest looked at me like a stone i looked back,
 not desiring to go it alone.
 the college of cardinals wore punitive red.
 the white spine waved to me from his white throne.
 being in a place not my own, much less
 myself, i climbed out, a beast in a crib.
 somewhere a terrorist rolled a cigarette.
 reason, not faith, would change him.


what is the boy now, who has lost his ball.
what, what is he to do? i saw it go
merrily bouncing, down the street, and then
merrily over--there it is in the water
no use to say 'o there are other balls'
an ultimate shaking grief fixes the boy
as he stands rigid, trembling, staring down
all his young days into the harbour where
his ball went. i would not intrude on him,
a dime, another ball, is worthless. now
he senses first responsibility
in a world of possessions. people will take balls,
balls will be lost always, little boy,
and no one buys a ball back. money is external.
he is learning, well behind his desperate eyes,
the epistemology of loss, how to stand up
knowing what every man must one day know
and most know many days, how to stand up
and gradually light returns to the street,
a whistle blows, the ball is out of sight.
soon part of me will explore the deep and dark
floor of the harbour . . i am everywhere,
i suffer and move, my mind and my heart move
with all that move me, under the water
or whistling, i am not a little boy.


nothin very bad happen to me lately.
how you explain that? --i explain that, mr bones,
terms o' your bafflin odd sobriety.
sober as man can get, no girls, no telephones,
what could happen bad to mr bones?
--if life is a handkerchief sandwich,

in a modesty of death i join my father
who dared so long agone leave me.
a bullet on a concrete stoop
close by a smothering southern sea 
spreadeagled on an island, by my knee.
--you is from hunger, mr bones,

i offers you this handkerchief, now set 
your left foot by my right foot,
shoulder to shoulder, all that jazz,
arm in arm, by the beautiful sea
hum a little, mr bones.
--i saw nobody coming, so i went instead.


i lift--lift you five states away your glass,
wide of this bar you never graced, where none
ever i know came, where what work is done
even by these men i know not, where a brass
police-car sign peers in, wet strange cars pass,
soiled hangs the rag of day out over this town,
a juke-box brains air where i drink alone,
the spruce barkeep sports a toupee alas--

my glass i lift at six o'clock, my darling,
as you plotted . . chinese couples shift in bed,
we shared today not even filthy weather,
beasts in the hills their tigerish love are snarling,
suddenly they clash, i blow my short ash red,
grey eyes light and we have our drink together.


don't allow the lucid moment to dissolve
let the radiant thought last in stillness
though the page is almost filled and the flame flickers
we haven't risen yet to the level of ourselves
knowledge grows slowly like a wisdom tooth
the stature of a man is still notched
high up on a white door
from far off, the joyful voice of a trumpet
and of a song rolled up like a cat
what passes doesn't fall into a void
a stoker is still feeding coal into the fire
don't allow the lucid moment to dissolve
on a hard dry substance
you have to engrave the truth




the day was mild, the light was generous.
the german on the caf terrace
held a small book on his lap.
i caught sight of the title
mysticism for beginners.
suddenly i understood that the swallows
patrolling the streets of montepulciano
with their shrill whistles,
and the hushed talk of timid travelers
from eastern, so-called central europe,
and the white herons standing--yesterday? the day before?--
like nuns in fields of rice,
and the dusk, slow and systematic,
erasing the outlines of medieval houses,
and olive trees on little hills,
abandoned to the wind and heat,
and the head of the unknown princess
that i saw and admired in the louvre,
and stained-glass windows like butterfly wings
sprinkled with pollen,
and the little nightingale practicing
its speech beside the highway,
and any journey, any kind of trip,
are only mysticism for beginners,
the elementary course, prelude
to a test that's been
postponed.




for example, with someone who no longer is,
who exists only in yellowed letters.

or long walks beside a stream,
whose depths hold hidden

porcelain cups--and the talks about philosophy
with a timid student or the postman.

a passerby with proud eyes
whom you'll never know.

friendship with this world, ever more perfect
if not for the salty smell of blood.

the old man sipping coffee
in st.-lazare, who reminds you of someone.

faces flashing by
in local trains--

the happy faces of travelers headed perhaps
for a splendid ball, or a beheading.

and friendship with yourself
--since after all you don't know who you are.


i read your poetry once more,
poems written by a rich man, knowing all,
and by a beggar, homeless,
an emigrant, alone.

you always wanted to go
beyond poetry, above it, soaring,
but also lower, to where our region
begins, modest and timid.

sometimes your tone
transforms us for a moment,
we believe--truly-- 
that every day is sacred,

that poetry--how to put it? --
makes life rounder,
fuller, prouder, unashamed
of perfect formulation.

but evening arrives,
i lay my book aside,
and the city's ordinary din resumes--
somebody coughs, someone cries and curses.


.  without baggage

    to travel without baggage, sleep in the train
    on a hard wooden bench,
    forget your native land,
    emerge from small stations
    when a gray sky rises
    and fishing boats head to sea.


.  in belgium

    it was drizzling in belgium
    and the river wound between hills.
    i thought, i'm so imperfect.
    the trees sat in the meadows
    like priests in green cassocks.
    october was hiding in the weeds.
    no, ma'am, i said,
    this is the nontalking compartment.


.  a hawk circles above the highway

     it will be disappointed if it swoops down
    on sheet iron, on gas,
     on a tape of tawdry music,
    on our narrow hearts.


.  mont blanc

    it shines from afar, white and cautious,
    like a lantern for shadows.


.  segesta

    on the meadow a vast temple--
    a wild animal
    open to the sky.


.  summer

    summer was gigantic, triumphant--
    and our little car looked lost
    on the road going to verdun.


.  the station in bytom

    in the underground tunnel
    cigarette butts grow,
    not daisies.
    it stinks of loneliness.


.  retired people on a field trip

    they're learning to walk
    on land.


.  gulls

    eternity doesn't travel,
    eternity waits.
    in a fishing port
    only the gulls are chatty.


.  the theater in taormina

    from the theater in taormina you spot
    the snow on etna's peak 
    and the gleaming sea.
    which is the better actor?


.  a black cat

    a black cat comes out to greet us
    as if to say, look at me
    and not some old romanesque church.
    i'm alive.


.  a romanesque church

    at the bottom of the valley
    a romanesque church at rest
    there's wine in this cask.


.  light

    light on the walls of old houses,
    june.
    passerby, open your eyes.


.  at dawn

    the world's materiality at dawn--
    and the soul's frailty.


try to praise the mutilated world.
remember june's long days,
and wild strawberries, drops of ros wine.
the nettles that methodically overgrow
the abandoned homesteads of exiles.
you must praise the mutilated world.
you watched the stylish yachts and ships
one of them had a long trip ahead of it,
while salty oblivion awaited others.
you've seen the refugees going nowhere,
you've heard the executioners sing joyfully.
you should praise the mutilated world.
remember the moments when we were together
in a white room and the curtain fluttered.
return in thought to the concert where music flared.
you gathered acorns in the park in autumn
and leaves eddied over the earth's scars.
praise the mutilated world
and the gray feather a thrush lost,
and the gentle light that strays and vanishes
and returns.




simone weil, -
only the stones at first
seem to have a part in this,
and the little height of the grass
as it gains a fraction-inch

by gripping the shallow soil
with all the shocking might
of hunger and of thirst,
as if the soil itself

were all that's left on earth.
i think the grass alone
can hold within its grasp
what matters to it most,

and still it looks bereft,
and famished as the stones.
i watch a stream of moths
proceeding on their ways,

they carve out tortuous paths
as if they were intent
on entering unseen
and ever-smaller doors.

so four years into the war,
and cut off from the ones
whose circumstance you felt
and suffering as yours,

you carved yourself a path
through ever-narrowing doors
of hunger and of thirst,
and entered them day by day,

refusing all at first
but that ration of food
your people could obtain
behind the lines in france,

and then refusing that,
from summer into fall
you cut your ration back
to send your part to them,

your part diminishing
to rations cut in half
and cut in half again,
and then nothing at all

but water at the last
sipped for the nurse's sake,
you finally lacked the strength
even to lift your hands

father, i cannot stand
to think of them and eat.
send it to them, it is theirs.
send this food for them,

for my people still in france.
and turned your face away,
as famished as the grass.
only the stones at first

seem to have a part in this,
and the little height of the grass
as it gains a fraction-inch.
but hidden in the grass

as if the grass itself
were giving out a cry,
i overhear the finch
begin her native rhyme

and toil to paraphrase
her version of your words.
it seems she tries and tries
until the words come clear,

it is theirs, she seems to say,
or that is what i hear,
and again it is theirs, it is theirs.
and the plover joins in praise

with her fluttering, murmured prayers
send it to them, it is theirs.
and the blackbirds breaking wide
take it up in their dialects

to sing you in their way,
i swear i can hear the words,
send it to them, they say,
send it to them, it is theirs,

then all the birds of the air
give thanks above your grave, 
as if they were your cause
and those you meant to save,

as if the birds were there
in attendance at the end,
and, seeing the sacrifice
had borne your body up,

so wasted as it was,
to your chair in paradise,
and saw, before they fled,
your first breathtaking act

before the heavenly feast,
the bread set at your place
to refuse to eat till none
on earth has less than you,

though god in pity take
your hands and lift them toward
his table for your sake.
father, they have no food,

send it to them, it is theirs.
and the birds returning here
give tongue to what they've heard,
they tell the grass and stones

and the stream of moths who carve
their tortuous paths in the air.
but how in giving thanks
can we calculate the worth

of one who chose to starve?
you held within your grasp
our hunger and our thirst.
and the little height of the grass

as it gains a fraction-inch
seems to have a part in this.
it grips with a shocking might
what matters to the last,

as if the soil itself
were all that's left on earth,
and all the earth were held
within its famished grasp.


bethlehem in germany,
glitter on the sloping roofs,
breadcrumbs on the windowsills,
candles in the christmas trees,
hearths with pairs of empty shoes
panels of nativity
open paper scenes where doors
open into other scenes,
some recounted, some foretold.
blizzard-sprinkled flakes of gold
gleam from small interiors,
picture-boxes in the stars
open up like cupboard doors
in a cabinet jesus built.

southern german villagers,
peasants in the mica frost,
see the comet streaming down,
heavenly faces, each alone,
faces lifted, startled, lost,
as if lightning lit the town.

sitting in an upstairs window
patiently the village scholar
raises his nearsighted face,
interrupted by the star.
left and right his hands lie stricken
useless on his heavy book.
when i lift the paper door
in the ceiling of his study
one canary-angel glimmers,
flitting in the candelabra,
peers and quizzes him rabbi,
what are the spheres surmounted by?
but his lips are motionless.
child, what are you asking for?
look, he gazes past the roofs,
gazes where the bitter north,
stretched across the empty place,
opens door by door by door.

this is childhood's shrunken door.
when i touch the glittering crumbs,
when i cry to be admitted,
no one answers, no one comes.

and the tailor's needle flashes
in midair with thread pulled tight,
stitching a baptismal gown.
but the gown, the seventh door,
turns up an interior
hidden from the tailor's eyes
baby presents like the boxes
angels hold on streets and stairways,
wooden soldier, wooden sword,
chocolate coins in crinkled gold,
hints of something bought and sold,
hints of murder in the stars.
baby's gown is sown with glitter
spread across the tailor's lap.
up above his painted ceiling
baby mouse's skeleton
crumbles in the mouse's trap.

leaning from the cliff of heaven,
indicating whom he weeps for,
joseph lifts his lamp above
the infant like a candle-crown.
let my fingers touch the silence
where the infant's father cries.
give me entrance to the village
from my childhood where the doorways
open pictures in the skies.
but when all the doors are open,
no one sees that i've returned.
when i cry to be admitted,
no one answers, no one comes.
clinging to my fingers only
pain, like glitter bits adhering,
when i touch the shining crumbs.


the remnant of a vast, oceanic
bruise wound delivered early and long ago

was in you purity and 
sweetness self-gathered, chosen

                                 

when i tried to find words for the moral sense that unifies
and sweetens the country voices in your collage the friendly way,

you said it's a code.

you were a code
i yearned to decipher.--

in the end, the plague that full swift runs by
took you, broke you--

                                          in the end, could not
                                           take you, did not break you--

you had somehow erased within you not only
meanness, but anger, the desire to punish
the universe for everything

not achieved, not tasted, seen again, touched--

. . . the undecipherable
code unbroken even as the soul

learns once again the body it loves and hates is
made of earth, and will betray it.



three sorts of serpents do resemble thee 
 that dangerous eye-killing cockatrice, 
 the enchanting siren, which doth so entice, 
 the weeping crocodile--these vile pernicious three. 
 the basilisk his nature takes from thee, 
 who for my life in secret wait dost lie, 
 and to my heart sendst poison from thine eye 
 thus do i feel the pain, the cause, yet cannot see. 
 fair-maid no more, but mer-maid be thy name, 
 who with thy sweet alluring harmony 
 hast played the thief, and stolen my heart from me, 
 and like a tyrant makst my grief thy game 
   thou crocodile, who when thou hast me slain, 
   lamentst my death, with tears of thy disdain.


read in my face a volume of despairs,
the wailing iliads of my tragic woe,
drawn with my blood and printed with my cares
wrought by her hand, that i have honor'd so.
who, whilst i burn, she sings at my soul's wrack,
looking aloft from turret of her pride
there my soul's tyrant joys her in the sack
of her own seat, whereof i made her guide.
there do these smokes that from affliction rise,
serve as an incense to a cruel dame
a sacrifice thrice grateful to her eyes,
because their power serve to exact the same.
thus ruins she, to satisfy her will,
the temple where her name was honor'd still.


now, when he and i meet, after all these years, 
i say to the bitch inside me, don't start growling.   
he isn't a trespasser anymore, 
just an old acquaintance tipping his hat. 
my voice says, nice to see you, 
as the bitch starts to bark hysterically. 
he isn't an enemy now, 
where are your manners, i say, as i say, 
how are the children? they must be growing up.   
at a kind word from him, a look like the old days,   
the bitch changes her tone she begins to whimper.   
she wants to snuggle up to him, to cringe. 
down, girl keep your distance 
or i'll give you a taste of the choke-chain. 
fine, i'm just fine, i tell him. 
she slobbers and grovels. 
after all, i am her mistress. she is basically loyal.   
it's just that she remembers how she came running   
each evening, when she heard his step 
how she lay at his feet and looked up adoringly   
though he was absorbed in his paper 
or, bored with her devotion, ordered her to the kitchen   
until he was ready to play. 
but the small careless kindnesses 
when he'd had a good day, or a couple of drinks, 
come back to her now, seem more important 
than the casual cruelties, the ultimate dismissal. 
it's nice to know you are doing so well, i say. 
he couldn't have taken you with him 
you were too demonstrative, too clumsy, 
not like the well-groomed pets of his new friends.   
give my regards to your wife, i say. you gag 
as i drag you off by the scruff, 
saying, goodbye goodbye nice to have seen you again.


at this hour the soul floats weightlessly 
through the city streets, speechless and invisible, 
astonished by the smoky blend of grays and golds 
seeping out of the air, the dark half-tones 

of dusk suddenly filling the urban sky 
while the body sits listlessly by the window 
sullen and heavy, too exhausted to move, 
too weary to stand up or to lie down. 

at this hour the soul is like a yellow wing 
slipping through the treetops, a little ecstatic 
cloud hovering over the sidewalks, calling out 
to the approaching night, amaze me, amaze me, 

while the body sits glumly by the window 
listening to the clear summons of the dead 
transparent as glass, clairvoyant as crystal. 
some nights it is almost ready to join them. 

oh, this is a strange, unlikely tethering, 
a furious grafting of the quick and the slow 
when the soul flies up, the body sinks down 
and all night--locked in the same cramped room-- 

they go on quarreling, stubbornly threatening 
to leave each other, wordlessly filling the air 
with the sound of a low internal burning. 
how long can this bewildering marriage last? 

at midnight the soul dreams of a small fire 
of stars flaming on the other side of the sky, 
but the body stares into an empty night sheen, 
a hollow-eyed darkness. poor luckless angels, 

feverish old loves don't separate yet. 
let what rises live with what descends.


reading in the paper a summary 
of a five-year psychological study 
that shows those perceived as most beautiful   
are treated differently, 

i think they could have just asked me, 
remembering a kind of pudgy kid   
and late puberty, the bloody noses   
and wisecracks because i wore glasses, 

though we all know by now how awful it is   
for the busty starlet no one takes seriously,   
the loveliest women i've lunched with   
lamenting the opacity of the body, 

they can never trust a man's interest   
even when he seems not just out for sex   
eyes focus on me above rim of wineglass,   
and who would want to live like this? 

and what does beauty do to a man?-- 
don juan, casanova, lord byron-- 
those fiery eyes and steel jawlines   
can front a furnace of self-loathing, 

all those breathless women rushing to him   
while hubby's at the office or ball game,   
primed to be consumed by his beauty   
while he stands next to it, watching. 

so maybe the looks we're dealt are best.   
it's only common sense that happiness   
depends on some bearable deprivation   
or defect, and who knows what conflicts 

great beauty could have caused, 
what cruelties one might have suffered 
from those now friends, what unmanageable   
possibilities smiling at every small turn? 

so if i get up to draw a tumbler 
of ordinary tap water and think what if this were   
nectar dripping from delicious burning fingers,   
will all i've missed knock me senseless? 

no. of course not. it won't.


when the fog burns off and the air's pulverized   
diamonds and you can see beyond the islands   
of forever--far too dramatic for me. it hurts   
something behind my eyes near the sphenoid,   
not good. i prefer fog with fog behind it,   
uninflammable fog. then there's no competition   
for brightness, no byron for your shelley,   
no juno eclisping your athena, no big bridge   
statement about bringing unity to landmasses.   
all the thought balloons are blank. the marching   
band can't practice, even a bird's got to get   
within five feet before it can start an argument.   
like dead flies on the sill of an abandoned   
nursery, we too are seeds in the rattle   
of mortality. a foglike baby god   
picks it up, shakes it, laughs insanely   
then goes back to playing with her feet.   
i have felt awful cold and lonely and fog   
has been blotting paper to my tears.   
my dog is fog and i don't have to scoop   
its poop with my hand in a plastic bag.   
there are sensations that begin in the world,   
the mind responding with ideas but then   
those ideas cause other sensations.   
what a mess. we stand at the edge   
of a drop that doesn't answer back,   
fog our only friend although it's hell   
on shrimpboats. there, there, says the fog.   
where, where? you can't see a thing.


before balance, before counting, before   
the record glistens and the needle slides,   
grating, into the overture, there is the end   
of weight, the leaning into nothing and then 

a caught breath, the record listens, the needle slides   
over slowly, and all at once around us a woman's voice   
stretches weightless, leaning into nothing. 
like a clothesline, the taut chorus oh, hilarious 

oh baby, all around us, over slowly, a woman's voice   
gathers above the pick me up, pick me up 
and the desperate put, put me down. first the tightrope,   
then the light foot, and the taunting chorus 

pick me up, pick me up. oh, oh baby. 
the slippery floor shimmers and spins like a record while   
the light is swinging footloose on its rope 
out of time. the shadows 

slip, shimmering black, and spin across the floor, 
then turn back and pick up again. oh seedpod stuck for just   
one moment on the cattail, out of time, out of shadows,   
downy cheek against a beard oh scratches 

on the record, oh baby, oh measure   
oh strange balance that grips us   
on this side of the world.


we could wipe away a fly,
drink, and order that yellow 
thing behind the glass, peach 
or sweet bread. sunlight
is catching on a fork,
toothy wink from a star.
the fan is busy, the waiter is busy, 
and today, in this caf
of two dollars and fifty
cents, we're so important 
dogs are shaking our hands. 
welcome, turistas, they say, 
or might say if they could 
roll their rs. where we sit 
it's three o'clock, and
across the room, where
old men are playing dominos 
it's maybe later, it's maybe 
peru under their hats.
there are toads in this place
--sullen guards by the door--
and the bartender is just another 
uncle fooling with the radio. 
a little to the left,
i shout, and he dials left, 
then right, until it's german 
polkas, accordions by the sea. 
the toads move a little. 
an old man clicks a domino. 
omar, my gypsy friend, puts in--
love is chasing me up my sleeve.
i salute him, he salutes me, 
and together we're so drunk 
we're making sense. little 
by little, with rum the color
of a woman's arm, we're seeing things--
of a dancer, no two,
make that three with one chair. 
and that man--the old one 
over there--is so blurry 
he thinks he's flying.


under the fire escape, crouched, one knee in cinders,   
i pulled the ball-peen hammer from my belt,   
cracked a square of window pane, 
the gummed latch, and swung the window, 
crawled through that stone hole into the boiler room   
of canton elementary school, once canton high,   
where my father served three extra years   
as star halfback and sprinter. 
behind a flashlight's 
cane of light, i climbed a staircase almost a ladder 
and found a door. on the second nudge of my shoulder, 
it broke into a hallway dark as history, 
at whose end lay the classroom i had studied   
over and over in the deep obsession of memory. 

i swept that room with my light--an empty blackboard, 
a metal table, a half-globe lying on the floor   
like a punctured basketball--then followed   
that beam across the rows of desks, 
the various catalogs of lovers, the lists 
of all those who would and would not do what,   
until it stopped on the corner desk of the back row,   
and i saw again, after many years the name 
of my father, my name, carved deep into the oak top. 

to gauge the depth i ran my finger across that scar,   
and wondered at the dreams he must have lived   
as his eyes ran back and forth 
from the cinder yard below the window 
to the empty practice field 
to the blade of his pocket knife etching carefully   
the long, angular lines of his name, 
the dreams he must have laid out one behind another   
like yard lines, in the dull, pre-practice afternoons   
of geography and civics, before he ever dreamed 
of savo sound or guadalcanal. 
                                             in honor of dreams 
i sank to my knees on the smooth, oiled floor,   
and stood my flashlight on its end. 
half the yellow circle lit the underedge of the desk,   
the other threw a half-moon on the ceiling,   
and in that split light i tapped the hammer 
easy up the overhang of the desk top. nothing gave   
but the walls' sharp echo, so i swung again,   
and again harder, and harder still in half anger   
rising to anger at the stubborn joint, losing all fear   
of my first crime against the city, the county,   
the state, whatever government claimed dominion,   
until i had hammered up in the ringing dark   
a salvo of crossfire, and on a frantic recoil glanced   
the flashlight, the classroom spinning black   
as a coma. 
               i've often pictured the face of the teacher   
whose student first pointed to that topless desk,   
the shock of a slow hand rising from the back row,   
their eyes meeting over the question of absence. 
i've wondered too if some low authority of the system   
discovered that shattered window, 
and finding no typewriters, no business machines,   
no audiovisual gear missing, failed to account for it,   
so let it pass as minor vandalism. 
                                                               i've heard nothing. 
and rarely do i fret when i see that oak scar leaning   
against my basement wall, though i wonder what it means   
to own my father's name.


in the early stages of epilepsy there occurs a characteristic dream .... one is  somehow lifted free of one's own body  looking back one sees oneself and feels a  sudden, maddening fear another presence is  entering one's own person, and there is no  avenue of return. --george steiner
outside my window the wasps   
are making their slow circle,   
dizzy flights of forage and return,   
hovering among azaleas 
that bob in a sluggish breeze   
this humid, sun-torn morning. 

yesterday my wife held me here 
as i thrashed and moaned, her hand   
in my foaming mouth, and my son   
saw what he was warned he might. 

last night dreams stormed my brain   
in thick swirls of shame and fear. 
behind a white garage a locked shed   
full of wide-eyed dolls burned, 
yellow smoke boiling up in huge clumps   
as i watched, feet nailed to the ground.   
in dining cars white table cloths 
unfolded wings and flew like gulls.   
an old german in a green homburg   
sang lieder, mein herz ist mde. 
in a garden in pasadena my father   
posed in navy whites while overhead 
silver dirigibles moved like great whales.   
and in the narrowing tunnel   
of the dream's end i flew down   
onto the iron red road 
of my grandfather's farm. 
there was a white rail fence. 
in the green meadow beyond,   
a small boy walked toward me.   
his smile was the moon's rim.   
across his egg-shell eyes 
ran scenes from my future life,   
and he embraced me like a son   
or father or my lost brother. 




although i can see him still-- 
the freckled man who goes 
to a gray place on a hill 
in gray connemara clothes 
at dawn to cast his flies-- 
it's long since i began 
to call up to the eyes 
this wise and simple man.   
all day i'd looked in the face   
what i had hoped it would be   
to write for my own race   
and the reality   
the living men that i hate,   
the dead man that i loved,   
the craven man in his seat,   
the insolent unreproved-- 
and no knave brought to book   
who has won a drunken cheer-- 
the witty man and his joke   
aimed at the commonest ear,   
the clever man who cries   
the catch cries of the clown,   
the beating down of the wise   
and great art beaten down. 

maybe a twelve-month since 
suddenly i began, 
in scorn of this audience, 
imagining a man, 
and his sun-freckled face 
and gray connemara cloth, 
climbing up to a place 
where stone is dark with froth, 
and the down turn of his wrist 
when the flies drop in the stream-- 
a man who does not exist,   
a man who is but a dream   
and cried, before i am old   
i shall have written him one   
poem maybe as cold   
and passionate as the dawn.


force of reason, who shut up the shrill
foul furies in the dungeon of the parthenon,
led whimpering to the cave they live in still,

beneath the rock your city foundered on
who, equivocating, taught revenge to sing
or seem to, or be about to a kindlier tune

mind that can make a scheme of anything--
a game, a grid, a system, a mere folder
in the universal file drawer uncompromising

mediatrix, virgin married to the welfare
of the body politic deific contradiction,
warbonnet-wearing olive-bearer, author

of the law's delays, you who as talisman
and totem still wear the aegis, baleful
with medusa's scowl though shrunken

and self-mummified, a gorgon still cool
guarantor of the averted look, the guide
of perseus, who killed and could not kill

the thing he'd hounded to its source, the dread
thing-in-itself none can elude, whose counter-
feit we halfway hanker for aware gone mad

with clarity we have invented all you stand for,
though we despise the artifice--a space to savor
horror, to pre-enact our own undoing in--
living, we stare into the mirror of the gorgon.


you sway like a crane to the tunes of tossed stones. 
i am what you made to live in 
from what you had hair matted as kelp, bad schools. 

oh, you will never know me. i wave and you go 
on playing in the clouds 
boys clap from erasers. i am the pebble 
you tossed on the chalked space and war- 
danced toward, one-leg two-leg, arms treading air. 

in this, your future, waves rechristen the sea 
after its tiny jeweled lives 
that hiss us us to the shore all day. 
where's the kid called kateydid? the moonfaced 
kewpiedoll? the excitable pouting 
zookie? the somber o-be-joyful? 

lost girl, playing hopscotch, i will do what you could. 
name of father, son, ghost. cross my heart and hope. 
while the sea's jewels build shells and shells 
change to chalk and chalk to loam and gold 
wheat grows where oceans teetered.


the others bent their heads and started in.
confused, i asked my neighbor
to explain--a sturdy, bright-cheeked girl
who brought raw milk to school from her family's
herd of holsteins. ann had a blue bookmark,
and on it christ revealed his beating heart,
holding the flesh back with his wounded hand.
ann understood division. . . .

miss moran sprang from her monumental desk
and led me roughly through the class
without a word. my shame was radical
as she propelled me past the cloakroom
to the furnace closet, where only the boys
were put, only the older ones at that.
the door swung briskly shut.

the warmth, the gloom, the smell 
of sweeping compound clinging to the broom
soothed me. i found a bucket, turned it
upside down, and sat, hugging my knees.
i hummed a theme from haydn that i knew
from my piano lessons. . . .
and hardened my heart against authority.
and then i heard her steps, her fingers
on the latch. she led me, blinking
and changed, back to the class.


for richard hugo
you hear the roadhouse before you see it,   
its four-beat country tunes 
amplified like surf through the woods,   
silencing bullfrog and red-tailed hawk,   
setting beards of moss dancing 
on dim, indeterminate trees 
that border two-lane blacktop. 
docked tonight, you reveal the badge 
of the farmer, that blanched expanse of skin   
where cap shades face, babyhood 
pallor above the sun-blackened jaw   
bulging uneasy with a concrete grin   
and some inevitable need to weep.   
don't you think we live and breathe   
in the meantime, in lockstep 
with dawn, sunset, brawling dawn?   
even now, you await secrets worse   
than the few known ways a seized sky   
will come to survive your pity. 
but on another far field, celebrated   
for its arrivals and evictions, you learn   
to be beautiful, never leading 
a sensible life, playing ball in the early dark,   
fighting for a taste of the sweet spot,   
in this uncut land, this straight-edged air.   
whadya want to know that isn't yet a mystery   
somewhere, a confidential stumble, heat   
lightning, a first-rate backseat turndown?   
so it is that later you track high above   
familiar tamarack and ash, beginning   
the next inaccuracy alone, and again,   
remembering that everything east of you 
has already happened, on the same cold ground, 
in a swarm of time, finally spiked home   
to your surprise, nails flung to the air. 
and us all thumbs to the hot hammer-licks   
you hear from the roadhouse before you see it. 



in those days i thought their endless thrum 
   was the great wheel that turned the days, the nights. 
      in the throats of hibiscus and oleander 

i'd see them clustered yellow, blue, their shells 
   enameled hard as the sky before the rain. 
      all that summer, my second, from city 

to city my young father drove the black coupe 
   through humid mornings i'd wake to like fever 
      parceled between luggage and sample goods. 

afternoons, showers drummed the roof, 
   my parents silent for hours. even then i knew 
      something of love was cruel, was distant. 

mother leaned over the seat to me, the orchid 
   father'd pinned in her hair shriveled 
      to a purple fist. a necklace of shells 

coiled her throat, moving a little as she 
   murmured of alligators that float the rivers 
      able to swallow a child whole, of mosquitoes 

whose bite would make you sleep a thousand years. 
   and always the trance of blacktop shimmering 
      through swamps with names like incantations-- 

okeefenokee, where father held my hand 
   and pointed to an egret's flight unfolding 
      white above swamp reeds that sang with insects 

until i was lost, until i was part 
   of the singing, their thousand wings gauze 
      on my body, tattooing my skin. 

father rocked me later by the water, 
   the motel balcony, singing calypso 
      with the jamaican radio. the lyrics 

a net over the sea, its lesson 
   of desire and repetition. lizards flashed 
      over his shoes, over the rail 

where the citronella burned merging our 
   shadows--father's face floating over mine 
      in the black changing sound 

of night, the enormous florida night, 
   metallic with cicadas, musical 
      and dangerous as the human heart.


the dragon is in the street dancing beneath windows 
   pasted with colored squares, past the man 
who leans into the phone booth's red pagoda, past 
   crates of doves and roosters veiled 

until dawn. fireworks complicate the streets 
   with sulphur as people exchange gold 
and silver foil, money to appease ghosts 
   who linger, needy even in death. i am 

almost invisible. hands could pass through me 
   effortlessly. this is how it is 
to be so alien that my name falls from me, grows 
   untranslatable as the shop signs, 

the odors of ginseng and black fungus that idle 
   in the stairwell, the corridor where 
the doors are blue months ajar. hands 
   gesture in the smoke, the partial moon 

of a face. for hours the soft numeric 
   click of mah-jongg tiles drifts 
down the hallway where languid mai trails 
   her musk of sex and narcotics. 

there is no grief in this, only the old year 
   consuming itself, the door knob blazing 
in my hand beneath the lightbulb's electric jewel. 
   between voices and fireworks 

wind works bricks to dust--hush, hush-- 
   no language i want to learn. i can touch 
the sill worn by hands i'll never know 
   in this room with its low table 

where i brew chrysanthemum tea. the sign 
   for jade palace sheds green corollas 
on the floor. it's dangerous to stand here 
   in the chastening glow, darkening 

my eyes in the mirror with the gulf of the rest 
   of my life widening away from me, waiting 
for the man i married to pass beneath 
   the sign of the building, to climb 

the five flights and say his chinese name for me. 
   he'll rise up out of the puzzling streets 
where men pass bottles of rice liquor, where 
   the new year is liquor, the black bottle 

the whole district is waiting for, like 
   some benevolent arrest--the moment 
when men and women turn to each other and dissolve 
   each bad bet, every sly mischance, 

the dalliance of hands. they turn in lamplight 
   the way i turn now. wai min is in the doorway. 
he brings fish. he brings lotus root. 
   he brings me ghost money.


i had never seen a cornfield in my life, 
i had never been to oklahoma, 
but i was singing as loud as anyone, 
oh what a beautiful morning. . . . the corn   
is as high as an elephant's eye, 
though i knew something about elephants, i thought,   
coming from the same continent as they did,   
and they being more like camels than anything else. 

and when we sang from meet me in st. louis,   
clang, clang, clang went the trolley, 
i remembered the ride from ramleh station 
in the heart of alexandria 
all the way to roushdy where my grandmother lived,   
the autos on the roadways vying 
with mule carts and bicycles, 
the mediterranean half a mile off on the left,   
the air smelling sharply of diesel and salt. 

it was a problem which had dogged me 
for a few years, this confusion of places. 
and when in th grade geography i had pronounced   
des moines as though it were a village in france,   
mr. kephart led me to the map on the front wall,   
and so i'd know where i was, 
pressed my forehead squarely against iowa. 
des moines, he'd said. rhymes with coins. 

now we were singing zippidy-doo-dah, zippidy-ay,   
and every song we'd sung had in it 
either sun or bluebirds, fair weather 
or fancy fringe, o beautiful america 
and one tier below me, 
there was linda deemer with her amber waves 
and lovely fruited plains, 
and she was part of america too 
along with sun and spacious sky 
though untouchable, and as distant 
as purple mountains of majesty. 

this is my country, we sang, 
and a few years ago there would have been   
a scent of figs in the air, mangoes, 
and someone playing the oud along a clear stream. 

but now it was my country 'tis of thee   
and i sang it out with all my heart   
and now with linda deemer in mind.   
land where my fathers died, i bellowed,   
and it was not too hard to imagine
 
a host of my great-uncles and -grandfathers   
stunned from their graves in the turkish interior   
and finding themselves suddenly   
on a rock among maize and poultry   
and squanto shaking their hands. 

how could anyone not think america   
was exotic when it had massachusetts   
and the long tables of thanksgiving?   
and how could it not be home 
if it were the place where love first struck? 

we had finished singing. 
the sun was shining through large windows   
on the beatified faces of all 
who had sung well and with feeling. 
we were ready to file out and march back 
to our room where mr. kephart was waiting.   
already linda deemer had disappeared   
into the high society of the hallway. 
one day i was going to tell her something.   
des moines, i was saying to myself, 
baton rouge. terre haute. boise.


you wept in your mother's arms   
and i knew that from then on   
i was to forget myself. 

listening to your sobs, 
i was resolved against my will   
to do well by us 
and so i said, without thinking,   
in great panic, to do wrong   
in one's own judgment, 
though others thrive by it, 
is the right road to blessedness.   
not to submit to error 
is in itself wrong 
and pride. 

standing beside you, 
i took an oath 
to make your life simpler   
by complicating mine 
and what i always thought   
would happen did 
i was lifted up in joy. 



just when it has seemed i couldn't bear   
   one more friend   
waking with a tumor, one more maniac   

with a perfect reason, often a sweetness   
   has come   
and changed nothing in the world   

except the way i stumbled through it,   
   for a while lost   
in the ignorance of loving   

someone or something, the world shrunk   
   to mouth-size,   
hand-size, and never seeming small.   

i acknowledge there is no sweetness   
   that doesn't leave a stain,   
no sweetness that's ever sufficiently sweet ....   

tonight a friend called to say his lover   
   was killed in a car   
he was driving. his voice was low   

and guttural, he repeated what he needed   
   to repeat, and i repeated   
the one or two words we have for such grief   

until we were speaking only in tones.   
   often a sweetness comes   
as if on loan, stays just long enough   

to make sense of what it means to be alive,   
   then returns to its dark   
source. as for me, i don't care   

where it's been, or what bitter road   
   it's traveled   
to come so far, to taste so good.


like primitives we buried the cat
with his bowl. bare-handed
we scraped sand and gravel
back into the hole. it fell with a hiss
and thud on his side,
on his long red fur, the white feathers
that grew between his toes, and his
long, not to say aquiline, nose.
we stood and brushed each other off.
there are sorrows much keener than these.
silent the rest of the day, we worked,
ate, stared, and slept. it stormed
all night now it clears, and a robin
burbles from a dripping bush
like the neighbor who means well
but always says the wrong thing.


that dusty bubble gum, once ubiquitous as starlings,   
is no more, my love. whistling dinosaurs now populate   
only animation studios, the furious actions of angels   
causing their breasts to flop out in mannerist   
frescos flake away as sleet holds us in its teeth.   
and the bus-station's old urinals go under   
the grindstone and the youthful spelunkers   
graduate into the wrinkle-causing sun. the sea   
seemingly a constant to the naked eye is one   
long goodbye, perpetually the tide recedes,   
beaches dotted with debris. unto each is given   
a finite number of addresses, ditties to dart   
the heart to its moments of sorrow and swoon.   
the sword's hilt glints, the daffodils bow down,   
all is temporary as a perfect haircut, a kitten   
in the lap, yet sitting here with you, my darling,   
waiting for a tuna melt and side of slaw   
seems all eternity i'll ever need   
and all eternity needs of me.


this was gruesome--fighting over a ham sandwich                   
with one of the tiny cats of rome, he leaped 
on my arm and half hung on to the food and half 
hung on to my shirt and coat. i tore it apart 
and let him have his portion, i think i lifted him 
down, sandwich and all, on the sidewalk and sat 
with my own sandwich beside him, maybe i petted 
his bony head and felt him shiver. i have 
told this story over and over some things 
root in the mind his boldness, of course, was frightening 
and unexpected--his stubbornness--though hunger 
drove him mad. it was the breaking of boundaries, 
the sudden invasion, but not only that it was 
the sharing of food and the sharing of space he didn't 
run into an alley or into a cellar, 
he sat beside me, eating, and i didn't run 
into a trattoria, say, shaking, 
with food on my lips and blood on my cheek, sobbing 
but not only that, i had gone there to eat 
and wait for someone. i had maybe an hour 
before she would come and i was full of hope 
and excitement. i have resisted for years 
interpreting this, but now i think i was given 
a clue, or i was giving myself a clue, 
across the street from the glass sandwich shop. 
that was my last night with her, the next day 
i would leave on the train for paris and she would 
meet her husband. thirty-five years ago 
i ate my sandwich and moaned in her arms, we were 
dying together we never met again 
although she was pregnant when i left her--i have 
a daughter or son somewhere, darling grandchildren 
in norwich, connecticut, or canton, ohio. 
every five years i think about her again 
and plan on looking her up. the last time 
i was sitting in new brunswick, new jersey, 
and heard that her husband was teaching at princeton, 
if she was still married, or still alive, and tried 
calling. i went that far. we lived 
in florence and rome. we rowed in the bay of naples 
and floated, naked, on the boards. i started 
to think of her again today. i still 
am horrified by the cat's hunger. i still 
am puzzled by the connection. this is another 
insane devotion, there must be hundreds, although 
it isn't just that, there is no pain, and the thought 
is fleeting and sweet. i think it's my own dumb boyhood, 
walking around with slavic cheeks and burning 
stupid eyes. i think i gave the cat 
half of my sandwich to buy my life, i think 
i broke it in half as a decent sacrifice. 
it was this i bought, the red coleus, 
the split rocking chair, the silk lampshade. 
happiness. i watched him with pleasure. 
i bought memory. i could have lost it. 
how crazy it sounds. his face twisted with cunning. 
the wind blowing through his hair. his jaw working.


your head is still 
restless, rolling 
east and west. 
that body in you 
insisting on living 
is the old hawk 
for whom the world 
darkens. 
if i am not 
with you when you die, 
that is just. 

it is all right. 
that part of you cleaned 
my bones more 
than once. but i 
will meet you 
in the young hawk 
whom i see 
inside both 
you and me he 
will guide 
you to the lord of night, 
who will give you 
the tenderness 
you wanted here.


like all his people he felt at home in the forest.   
the silence beneath great trees, the dimness there,   
the distant high rustling of foliage, the clumps 
of fern like little green fountains, patches of sunlight,   
patches of moss and lichen, the occasional   
undergrowth of hazel and holly, was he aware   
of all this? on the contrary his unawareness   
was a kind of gratification, a sense of comfort   
and repose even in the strain of running day   
after day. he had been aware of the prairies.   
he had known he hated the sky so vast, the wind   
roaring in the grasses, and the brightness that   
hurt his eyes. now he hated nothing nor could he   
feel anything but the urgency that compelled him   
onward continually. may i not forget, may i   
not forget, he said to himself over and over.   
when he saw three ravens rise on their awkward   
wings from the forest floor perhaps seventy-five   
ells ahead of him, he said, three ravens,   
and immediately forgot them. may i not forget,   
he said, and repeated again in his mind the exact   
words he had memorized, the message that was   
important and depressing, which made him feel   
worry and happiness at the same time, a peculiar   
elation. at last he came to his people far   
in the darkness. he smiled and spoke his words,   
and he looked intently into their eyes gleaming 
in firelight. he cried when they cried. no rest 
for his lungs. he flinched and lay down while they   
began to kill him with clubs and heavy stones. 



down the street, someone must be praying, and though i don't 
go there anymore, i want to at times, to hear the diction 
and the tone, though the english pronoun for god is obsolete-- 

what goes on is devotion, which wouldn't change if i heard 
the polished sermon, the upright's arpeggios of vacant notes. 
what else could unite widows, bankers, children, and ghosts? 

and those faces are so good as they tilt their smiles upward 
to the rostrum that represents law, and the minister who 
represents god beams like the white palm of the good hand 

of christ raised behind the baptistry to signal the multitude, 
which i am not among, though i feel the abundance of calm 
and know the beatitude so well i do not have to imagine it, 

or the polite old ones who gather after the service to chat, 
or the ritual linen of sunday tables that are already set. 
more than any other days, sundays stand in unvarying rows 

that beg attention there is that studied verisimilitude 
of sanctuary, so even mud and bitten weeds look dressed up 
for some eye in the distant past, some remote kingdom 

where the pastures are crossed by thoroughly symbolic rivers. 
that is why the syntax of prayers is so often reversed, 
aimed toward the dead who clearly have not gone ahead 

but returned to prior things, a vista of angels and sheep, 
a desert where men in robes and sandals gather by a tree. 
hushed stores, all day that sense a bell is about to ring-- 

i recognized it, waking up, before i weighed the bulk of news 
or saw saturday night's cars parked randomly along the curb, 
and though i had no prayer, i wanted to offer something 

or ask for something, perhaps out of habit, but as the past 
must always be honored unconsciously, formally, and persists 
on this first and singular day, though i think of it as last.


from a documentary on marsupials i learn 
that a pillowcase makes a fine 
substitute pouch for an orphaned kangaroo. 

i am drawn to such dramas of animal rescue. 
they are warm in the throat. i suffer, the critic proclaims, 
from an overabundance of maternal genes. 

bring me your fallen fledgling, your bummer lamb, 

lead the abused, the starvelings, into my barn. 
advise the hunted deer to leap into my corn. 

and had there been a wild child-- 
filthy and fierce as a ferret, he is called 
in one nineteenth-century account-- 

a wild child to love, it is safe to assume, 
given my fireside inked with paw prints, 
there would have been room. 

think of the language we two, same and not-same, 
might have constructed from sign, 
scratch, grimace, grunt, vowel 

laughter our first noun, and our long verb, howl.


when i am asked   
how i began writing poems,   
i talk about the indifference of nature.   

it was soon after my mother died,   
a brilliant june day,   
everything blooming.   

i sat on a gray stone bench   
in a lovingly planted garden,   
but the day lilies were as deaf   
as the ears of drunken sleepers   
and the roses curved inward.   
nothing was black or broken   
and not a leaf fell   
and the sun blared endless commercials   
for summer holidays.   

i sat on a gray stone bench   
ringed with the ingenue faces   
of pink and white impatiens   
and placed my grief   
in the mouth of language,   
the only thing that would grieve with me.

we passed old farmer boothby in the field. 
rugged and straight he stood his body steeled 
with stubbornness and age. we met his eyes 
that never flinched or turned to compromise, 
and luck, he cried, good luck--and waved an arm,
knotted and sailor-like, such as no farm 
in all of maine could boast of and away
he turned again to pitch his new-cut hay... 
we walked on leisurely until a bend
showed him once more, now working toward the end
of one great path wearing his eighty years 
like banners lifted in a wind of cheers.

then we turned off abruptly--took the road 
cutting the village, the one with the commanding
view of the river. and we strode
more briskly now to the long pier that showed 
where the frail boats were kept at indian landing.
in the canoe we stepped our paddles dipped 
leisurely downwards, and the slim bark slipped
more on than in the water. smoothly then 
we shot its nose against the rippling current, 
feeling the rising river's half-deterrent 
pull on the paddle as we turned the blade 
to keep from swerving round while we delayed
to watch the curious wave-eaten locks
or pass, with lazy turns, the picnic-rocks....    
blue eels flew under us, and fishes darted
a thousand ways the once broad channel shrunk.
and over us the wise and noble-hearted 
twilight leaned down the sunset mists were parted,--
and we, with thoughts on tiptoe, slunk 
down the green, twisting alleys of the kennebunk,

motionless in the meadows
   the trees, the rocks, the cows... 
and quiet dripped from the shadows 
   like rain from heavy boughs.

the tree-toads started ringing
   their ceaseless silver bells
a land-locked breeze came swinging
   its censer of earthy smells.

the river's tiny caon
   stretched into dusky lands
like a dark and silent companion
   evening held out her hands.

hushed were the dawn's bravados
   loud noon was a silenced cry--
and quiet slipped from the shadows
   as stars slip out of the sky...

it must have been an hour more, or later, 
when, tramping homeward through the piney wood,
we felt the years fly back the brotherhood 
of forests took us--and we saw the satyr 
there in a pool, up to his neck, he stood 
and grinned to see us stare, incredulous--
too startled to remember fear or flight. 
feeling the menace in the crafty night,
we turned to run--when lo, he called to us
using our very names he called. we drew 
with creaking courage down the avenue 
of birches till we saw, with clearing sight, 
no longer through a tricky, pale-green light 
familiar turns and shrubs, the friendly path,--
and farmer boothby in his woodland bath 
the woods became his background every tree 
seemed part of him, and stood erect, and shared 
the beauty of that gnarled serenity
the quiet vigor of age that smiled and squared 
its shoulders against time ... and even night
flowed in and out of him, as though content 
with such a native element
happy to move about a spirit quite
as old, as placid and as confident...
sideways we turned. still glistening and unclad
he leaped up on the bank, light as a lad,
his body in the moonlight dripping stars...

we went on homeward, through the pasture-bars.


he sits at the table, cloudlight of march
one tone with his hair, gray-silver on silver. 
midday fare in vermont is basic enough.
in west newbury, eggs and toast will do-- 
though our doctor's had his sips of wine as well. 
just don't be fooled. they're not as nice as you 
think they are. live here a few more winters, 
you'll get to know them clearer, and vice-versa. 
three years now, and we're still finding our way 
newcomers need a guide to show them the ropes, 
and he has been explaining township and county 
almost from the sunstruck day we met him 
that very first july in this old house.
i'll cite an instance of community
spirit at work, north country justice--
a case i just happened to be involved in.
no, please--all right, if you are having one. 
he holds his glass aloft and then lets fall
a silence that has grown familiar to us
from other stories told on other days,
the will to recount building its head of steam. 
well, now, you have to know about the victim. 
his name was charlie deudon, no doubt canuck 
stock some generations back, but he
nor no one else could tell you--if they cared. 
deudons had been dirt farmers here as long 
as anybody knew. they never starved
but never had a dime to spare, either.
charlie resolved to change the deudon luck. 
and that's just what he did. or almost did. . . . 
he'd graduated two classes ahead of mine
we knew each other, naturally, but not
on terms of friendship. fact is, he had no friends, 
and only one girlfriend, whom he married 
day after commencement, june of . 
and then he set to work and never stopped 
again, until they made him stop for good. 
a wisp of a smile, half irony, half
bereavement plays about his guileless face-- 
red cheeks, blue eyes, a beardless santa claus 
whose bag contains apart from instruments 
of healing stories, parables and proverbs, 
painkillers, too, for when all else fails.
what kind of work had all that hard work been? 
oh, farming, like his elders, only better. 
all the modern improvements, fancy feed 
and fertilizers, plus machinery--
he was the first in these parts to milk 
his herd in any way but as twas done
since adam's boys first broke ground with a plow. 
and anything machines couldn't handle, 
charlie did himself, from dawn to midnight. 
he never wasted a word or spilled a drop 
of milk or drank a drop of beer or liquor. 
he was unnatural. and he made that farm 
into a showplace, a kind of -h model. 
he made good money, yes, but not a dollar 
would he spend unnecessarily.
do you get the picture? they hated him,
the boys that hung around the package store. 
the most they ever got from tightfist charlie 
deudon was a nod out from under his cap.
his trademark--a baseball cap striped white and red. 
they envied him for getting his hay in first 
and there was more. a boy that he had hired,
by the name of carroll giddens, was their buddy. 
likeable fellow, regulation issue, 
the sort that knocks back a pint or a fifth 
in half a shake and tells off-color stories
till he's got them choked to death with laughing. 
course the wisecracks they loved best were those 
about poor charlie and his gold-plated farm. . . . 
just one more case of what's been often said 
by commentators on democracy-- 
how it helps everyone keep modest. 
teasing mischief has crept into his voice. 
a self-taught anthropologist as well 
as teller of tales, he has other frames 
of reference to place around events 
local or international. he knows
that things can stand for more than what they are 
indeed, says standing for things is why we're here, 
and quotes chapter and verse to prove his point. 
think of the worldwide scapegoat ritual. 
in halfway civilized societies
an animal's the one relieved from life 
duty, am i right? a fellow tribesman
will do in a pinch, if animals are lacking,
or if communal fears get screwed too tight. . . . 
anyhow, it was clear that something more 
than common envy stirred up the lynch law.
their own failure's what they wanted dead. 
seconds pass in silence as he stares
at something--perhaps a knothole in the pine 
floorboard. he looks up, eyebrows raised,
and twirls the glass stem between stubby fingers.
a coil of rope hung on the wall, we see,
has made him pause and heave experienced sighs. 
here. have another. so was charlie punished?
i'm going to tell you--better me than others. 
you see, i was involved--no, no, no, 
not in the deed, lord, no, just as a witness.
it happened this way--hope you're not squeamish. 
charlie had this boy to help with chores, 
the one named carroll. married, two kids, i think. 
not too reliable. but so few are
nor could you call his wages generous.
his buddies must have stood him drinks, is all 
i can say. he'd a skinful half the time--
was certainly drunk that christmas eve morning. 
no reason to doubt what charlie told his wife. 
charlie'd been up to help at six with the milking, 
and carroll, drunk as a fiddler's bitch, was there 
loading a pair of milk cans into the barrow. 
he took a slip and the whole business spilled. 
wooden handle clipped him in the side, 
and he fell, too, right in the puddle of milk. 
and started laughing. charlie, you can guess, 
didn't join in he told him to get on home. 
what about the milk?' go home,' he said,
you're drunk.' but what about the milk?' asks carroll. 
comes out of next week's paycheck,' charlie says. 
and then the trouble starts, with carroll swearing 
and yelping, till charlie gives him a little tap 
and goes indoors. by then carroll could tell 
the barrow handle had cracked a rib or two. 
he drove into town to see his doctor--that 
wasn't me--and word went out that charlie 
had roughed up his innocent assistant. 
that's all they needed, carroll's friends. about 
time that stuck-up bastard got his due,
he's gone too far this time, but we'll show him, 
et cetera . . . . as it was christmas eve,
they had the leisure, the liquor, and the rope.
they hanged him? no, that's not our way up here. 
the honored custom's to dump them in the river. 
you see, the river's new hampshire all the way 
over to the vermont side, and thus, 
if the victim's still alive when he hits the water, 
new hampshire law enforcement and legal justice 
steps in. it tends to confuse the issue, see? 
in wintertime, the river freezes over, 
and you can't hope to fish the bodies out 
till the month of march at the earliest. 
by then, who knows which state the victim died in? 
a trick they've played a hundred years and more 
up in woodsville, where the bridge is. that's where 
the loggers used to go to spend their money 
on booze and hookers--who'd arrange for them 
to get knocked in the head at the right moment, 
and pitched off the bridge into the water. 
a famous local industry, but rather 
fallen on hard days by the early fifties, 
just like others more legitimate. . . . 
well, our local rowdies knew the routine, 
and, when time came to follow up their threats, 
they laid their plans according to tradition. 
they knew that charlie'd have to do the milking 
christmas morning same as every day. 
and when he came into the barn to do it,
they'd be waiting for him. and that's what happened.

we strain forward to hear him tell the rest 
the narrative spell is on him, and on us.
his voice weaves through fine-tuned nuances, 
with sudden leaps in volume and skittish phrases 
that somehow help flesh out what he describes.
we see the sprawling barn across the highway 
from the white-columned porch of the old house. 
see the barn closed up tight against the cold, 
and the blue-gray light of december dawn 
as charlie crosses the road to do his chores. 
the roosters shriek their morning alarm, the big 
doors creak open on the darkness--a darkness 
slit with tight-strung wires of light knifing 
through cracks between the boards of the east wall. 
tufts of hay spill from cribs on both sides. 
the waiting cattle stir and low as daylight 
breaks in on the darkness. their master strides 
in past the parked pickup truck, his pail, 
a battered rath blackhawk lard can swinging 
at his side, a whistled jingle bells
his fight song for the working holiday.
he hears the verses harnessed to his whistling, 
the tune drawing its text along march tempo 
. . . it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh-ay 
and then all changes. smash of the blackjack 
against his skull, exploding carnival
of fire-veined shock that flies to the far corners 
of night. four assailants leap from the back
of the truck and lift him partly erect, the quicker 
to bind his arms behind and truss them to 
his half-bent legs, as you might rope a steer 
or sheep you meant to brand or slaughter. 
they take him out to where the car is waiting 
and throw him in the trunk like a sack of feed. 
another car drives past but doesn't slow. 
the bandits duck and climb inside their own. 
tires screech, the driver slams onto the highway, 
a smile and wink all round as they drive north 
to woodsville. the sun is coming up when they
reach the bridge and stop the car. the lid
of the trunk's sprung open, its cargo discharged. 
he is dragged to the railing, lifted, then heaved over. 
the body falls, seeming almost to pause
in air before it hits the water and slides
below the surface of the floating ice. . . .
five miles back along the highway, the dark 
barn, the herd, a crushed tin pail, and signs 
of struggle in the dirt wait for someone's
startled face, back-lit in the doorway,
to see them, then whip aside with a shout of terror.

he wasn't found until spring thaw he washed 
ashore just south of bradford, still tied up
and looking like they'd tarred and feathered him--
partly decomposed, but not his clothes. 
first thing was an autopsy to test if he 
had died by drowning or was dead before 
going under. conclusion was, he'd died 
on land, so as i said, his death belonged 
to the green mountain state's criminal justice. 
and what about the killers--were they caught? 
several suspects found themselves in jail-- 
and that's where i come in as star witness. 
it happened i was on the road that morning. 
real early. see . . . i'd promised my house guest 
of the night--young marine on leave--i'd drive 
him back to lebanon to grab his bus. 
i always keep my word, especially 
when given in the night hours. nice boy-- 
he's been a good friend ever since. we'd said 
good-bye until the next three-day pass. 
well, i was driving home like merry christmas. 
into the headlights comes the deudon farm
and then i noticed the car. a two-toned kaiser, 
side of the road, beneath a maple tree. 
didn't know whose it was or why it was there. 
i saw one face, calvin renfrew's, that's all. 
he didn't have wheels so far as i knew.
occurred to me right then that something might 
be fishy but locals never meddle till--
till it's too late, sometimes. i should have stopped. 
they might have banged me on the head, but then--. 
well, even as it is they got revenge.
i'm still alive, however, and mean to stay so.
he laughs a low laugh that would chill the devil . . .
then takes up the thread--how when he heard the news 
about charlie's disappearance, he drove down 
to tell the state trooper what he'd seen. 
that was the very next day after christmas. 
by nightfall calvin renfrew and norbert joiner, 
the owner of the car the kaiser, and two 
associates were in custody. but not
for long. someone bailed them out, someone 
rich, it had to be, an enemy
or rival of charlie's. that's often our way, 
you know, to let others fix the person
we secretly hate, then give them secret help 
when they get their paws burned in the process. 
a lot of people coveted that farm,
however much disparaged it was in public. 
when charlie's widow put it up for auction, 
don't imagine nobody came to bid.
i still see things of his on others' farms.
what didn't surprise me either's how the town, 
lord help me, the whole county took the side 
of those arrested against the murdered man. 
they said old charlie had it coming to him,
treating his employee that way. meanwhile, 
carroll had quietly slipped across the border 
to canada no way to prove that he'd 
hardly been hurt at all. so rumor flew.
if words could put you under ground, why carroll 
was dead and buried six times over, a martyr 
hounded to his grave by a maniac
who should have been taken care of years ago. 
these are churchgoing people, too, but they 
figure they have a special insight as
to what the boy upstairs considers right. 
man is born for sorrow, so we're told, 
and some try to make sure he gets a close 
acquaintance with the sorrow that's his due. 
meanwhile, if you can say the things people 
want to hear, then you may lynch at will.
he folds his hands and brings them to his chin. 
the rest of the story you can figure out 
yourself. their lawyer asked the jury be 
directed by the judge to return a verdict 
of not guilty. motion granted--as never 
before for a capital offense in this state. 
they'd do it again, don't worry, if the case 
was dear to their concerns. sounds cynical,
i grant you. . . . but then, you see, they started next 
on me for fingering the guilty parties. 
state trooper drops by to ask some questions. 
why was i on the highway that time of morning? 
oh? and who exactly was this friend? 
oh, really? stayed the night, did he? i see. . . . 
a doubt or two'd been raised before already, 
given that i had never married, and 
was locally famous for my special hobby. 
i'm sure i've told you i play a little pipe
organ at church sometimes--i even travel 
to play it elsewhere. i know organists
all over new england, and the town gazette 
used always to mention when i went to play 
at musicales in other towns and states. 
nobody thought it mattered much beforehand, 
but once the tale about the serviceman 
got out, my friends, well, you can just imagine. 
overnight young dr. stephens was
as musical' as you can be and not
get tarred and feathered. my patients, some of them, 
began to melt away like ice cream. stephens, 
a local name, respected in these parts,
became a byword for things we don't discuss. 
i wondered whether i should move, of course 
some rowdy threw a can of paint at the house 
i still get unsigned letters from time to time. 
things must be better where you two come from. 
but this is where i've always lived, it's what 
i know. if i had had the sense to pitch
someone unpopular from off a bridge
instead of enjoying music, chances are 
i'd be a favorite son. in point of fact,
i've given up the organ, seldom play it
nowadays. i've got a different hobby--
your health, gentlemen no more today, though. 
another call to make this afternoon.
but listen, now if you'll come up to me
next week, i'll play some pump organ for you. 
i can still do a rousing hornpipe'--the one 
by handel. tourist attraction hereabouts. 
i am fairly confident you won't
ever have heard it played my way before. 
he stands to go, consenting to be ushered
out under the black trees of late march, down 
to where his battered station wagon sits.
thunder of engines takes him off. . . . but his words 
stay lodged in us like arrows, arrows aimed 
as carefully as acupuncture and meant 
somehow to warn or counsel. not that warnings 
in the abstract often help stave off 
particular misfortunes, inevitably 
the body of most stories drawn from life. 
misfortunes are the hinges life turns on? 
reprieves as well--along with persons, places, 
passions. a fluent paradox, the realm 
normally termed external, i mean its way 
of overhearing thought and mustering 
fresh evidence. . . . today, for instance, how 
new green on branches and a liquid birdcall 
suffice to announce the chaste approach of spring.


in the warming house, children lace their skates,   
bending, choked, over their thick jackets. 

a franklin stove keeps the place so cozy 
it's hard to imagine why anyone would leave, 

clumping across the frozen beach to the river.   
december's always the same at ware's cove, 

the first sheer ice, black, then white 
and deep until the city sends trucks of men 

with wooden barriers to put up the boys'   
hockey rink. an hour of skating after school, 

of trying wobbly figure-'s, an hour 
of distances moved backwards without falling, 

then--twilight, the warming house steamy   
with girls pulling on boots, their chafed legs 

aching. outside, the hockey players keep   
playing, slamming the round black puck 

until it's dark, until supper. at night, 
a shy girl comes to the cove with her father. 

although there isn't music, they glide 
arm in arm onto the blurred surface together, 

braced like dancers. she thinks she'll never 
be so happy, for who else will find her graceful, 

find her perfect, skate with her 
in circles outside the emptied rink forever?





life's spell is so exquisite, everything conspires to break it.   emily dickinson
it wasn't bliss. what was bliss   
but the ordinary life? she'd spend hours   
in patter, moving through whole days   
touching, sniffing, tasting . . . exquisite   
housekeeping in a charmed world.   
and yet there was always   

more of the same, all that happiness,   
the aimless being there.   
so she wandered for a while, bush to arbor,   
lingered to look through a pond's restive mirror.   
he was off cataloging the universe, probably,   
pretending he could organize   
what was clearly someone else's chaos.   

that's when she found the tree,   
the dark, crabbed branches   
bearing up such speechless bounty,   
she knew without being told   
this was forbidden. it wasn't   
a question of ownership--   
who could lay claim to   
such maddening perfection?   

and there was no voice in her head,   
no whispered intelligence lurking   
in the leaves--just an ache that grew   
until she knew she'd already lost everything   
except desire, the red heft of it   
warming her outstretched palm.


who was my teacher at harvard. did not wear overcoat 
saying to me as we walked across the yard 
cold brittle autumn is you should be wearing overcoat. i said 
you are not wearing overcoat. he said, 
you should do as i say not do as i do. 
just how american it was and how late forties it was 
delmore, but not i, was probably aware. he quoted finnegans wake to me 
in his new york apartment sitting on chair 
table directly in front of him. there did he write? i am wondering. 
look at this photograph said of his mother and father. 
coney island. do they look happy? he couldn't figure it out. 
believed pogo to be at the limits of our culture. 
pogo. walt kelly must have read joyce delmore said. 
why don't you ask him? 
why don't you ask walt kelly if he read finnegans wake or not. 
your parents don't look happy but it is just a photograph. 
maybe they felt awkward posing for photographs. 
maybe it is just a bad photograph. delmore is not listening 
i want to hear him tell me something sad but however true. 
delmore in his tomb is sitting. people say yes everyone is dying 
but here read this happy book on the subject. not delmore. not that rueful man.


we visit by phone as the morphine haze   
retreats, late afternoon, most days.   
our mingled past is set against the pin-   
hole lights of cars cruising the blacked-out streets   

we four in the college smoker popping no-doz,   
honors students carrying heavy course loads   
tipped sideways by sex, one by one discarding   
our virginities on the altar of inverse pride,   

ironing our blouses with peter pan collars   
to wear on dates with those -day wonders,   
ensigns in training for the second world war   
in the business school across the charles river. 

we called ourselves the unholy four.   
whenever any three of us met on campus   
we huddled to bray austria russia prussia 
in unison. it came out sounding like horseshit 

post graduation one year, look at us   
my new husband atop your even newer   
one's car singing the bawdy verses   
of roll me over in a drunken tenor   

while the scandalized uncles and aunties   
--it wasn't enough that you'd wed a chinese--   
wrung their hands. you drove off   
trailing just married in two languages.   

now bj is gone, and hettie. you have, they say,   
only days. it is my plan to go with you   
as far as the border. i've been that far--   
did i come back from there morally improved?   

somehow better equipped to support you   
this side of the douane and wave,   
your two cats curled like commas beside you   
as the barrier lifts and you drive on through?


for longer than by now i can believe 

i assumed that you had nothing to do 

with each other i thought you had arrived 

                  whenever that had been 


more solitary than single snowflakes 

with no acquaintance or understanding 

running among you guiding your footsteps 

                  somewhere ahead of me 


in your own time oh white lakes on the maps 

that i copied and gaps on the paper 

for the names that were to appear in them 

                  sometimes a doorway or 


window sometimes an eye sometimes waking 

without knowing the place in the whole night 

i might have guessed from the order in which 

                  you turned up before me 


and from the way i kept looking at you 

as though i recognized something in you 

that you were all words out of one language 

                  tracks of the same creature


in winter 
    all the singing is in 
         the tops of the trees 
             where the wind-bird 

with its white eyes 
    shoves and pushes 
         among the branches. 
             like any of us 

he wants to go to sleep, 
    but he's restless-- 
         he has an idea, 
             and slowly it unfolds 

from under his beating wings 
    as long as he stays awake. 
         but his big, round music, after all, 
             is too breathy to last. 

so, it's over. 
    in the pine-crown 
         he makes his nest, 
             he's done all he can. 

i don't know the name of this bird, 
    i only imagine his glittering beak 
         tucked in a white wing 
             while the clouds-- 

which he has summoned 
    from the north-- 
         which he has taught 
             to be mild, and silent-- 

thicken, and begin to fall 
    into the world below 
         like stars, or the feathers 
               of some unimaginable bird 

that loves us, 
    that is asleep now, and silent-- 
         that has turned itself 
             into snow.


easter was the old north   
goddess of the dawn.   
she rises daily in the east   
and yearly in spring for the great   

paschal candle of the sun.   
her name lingers like a spot   
of gravy in the figured vestment   
of the language of the britains.   

her totem the randy bunny.   
our very thursdays and wednesdays   
are stained by syllables of thunder   
and woden's frenzy.   

o my fellow-patriots loyal to this   
our modern world of high heels,   
vaccination, brain surgery--   
may they pass over us, the old   

jovial raptors, apollonian flayers,   
embodiments. egg-hunt,   
crucifixion. supper of encrypted   
dishes bitter, unrisen, a platter   

compass of martyrdom,   
ground-up apples and walnuts   
in sweet wine to embody mortar   
of affliction, babies for bricks.   

legible traces of the species   
that devises the angel of death   
sailing over our doorpost   
smeared with sacrifice.


in my great grandmother's time,   
all one needed was a broom   
to get to see places   
and give the geese a chase in the sky.   

                

the stars know everything,   
so we try to read their minds.   
as distant as they are,   
we choose to whisper in their presence.   

                

oh cynthia,   
take a clock that has lost its hands   
for a ride.   
get me a room at hotel eternity   
where time likes to stop now and then.   

                

come, lovers of dark corners,   
the sky says,   
and sit in one of my dark corners.   
there are tasty little zeroes   
in the peanut dish tonight.


i   

one snodgrass, two snodgrass, three snodgrass, four . . . 
       i took my own rollcall when i counted seconds   
one two three, two two three, three . . ., the drum score   
       showed only long rests to the tympani's entrance.   

oh-oh-oh leff leff leff-toh-righ-toh-leff,   
       the sergeant cadenced us footsore recruits   
the heart, poor drummer, gone lame, deaf,   
       then awol, gets frogmarched to the noose.   

ii   

old coots, at the veterans', might catch breath   
       if their cheeks got slapped by a nurse's aide,   
then come back to life just so, at their birth,   
       young rumps had been tendered warm accolades.   

the kick-ass rude attitude, smart-assed insult,   
       the acid-fueled book review just might shock   
us back to the brawl like smelling salts,   
       might sting the lulled heart up off its blocks.   

iii   

i thought i'd always favor rubato   
       or syncopation, scorning fixed rhythms   
               thought my old heartthrobs could stand up to stress   
believed one's bloodpump should skip a few beats   
       if it fell into company with sleek young women   
               believed my own bruit could beat with the best.   

wrong again, snodgrass this new gold gadget,   
       snug as the watch on my wife's warm wrist,   
               drives my pulsetempo near twice its old pace--   
go, nonstop startwatch go, clockwork rabbit,   
       keeping this lame old dog synchronized,   
               steady, sparked up, still in the race.


i've watched his eyelids sag, spring open 
   vaguely and gradually go sliding 
      shut again, fly up 
with a kind of drunken surprise, then wobble 
   peacefully together to send him 
      home from one school early. soon his lashes 
flutter in rem sleep. i suppose he's dreaming 
   what all of us kings and poets and peasants 
      have dreamed of not making the grade, 
of draining the inexhaustible horn cup 
   of the cerebral cortex where ganglions 
      are ganging up on us with more connections 
than atoms in heaven, but coming up once more 
   empty. i see a clear stillness 
      settle over his face, a calming of the surface 
of water when the wind dies. somewhere 
   down there, he's taking another course 
      whose resonance let's hope resembles 
the muttered thunder, the gutter bowling, the lightning 
   of minor minions of thor, the groans and gurgling 
      of feral lovers and preliterate mowglis, the songs 
of shamans whistled through bird bones. a worried neighbor 
   gives him the elbow, and he shudders 
      awake, recollects himself, brings back 
his hands from aboriginal outposts, 
   takes in new light, reorganizes his shoes, 
      stands up in them at the buzzer, barely recalls 
his books and notebooks, meets my eyes 
   and wonders what to say and whether to say it, 
      then keeps it to himself as today's lesson.


jerboa on a triple i was in for it,   
my zither on a double looking feeble   

as a promising first book. oedipal & reckless,   
my scheme would fail keep him a couple drinks   

ahead, & perhaps the muse would smile   
upon me with some ses or some blanks.   

january, vermont snowflakes teased the windows   
of the burlington airport bar. the waitress   

tallied tips & channel-surfed above the amber   
stutter of the snowplow's light it couldn't   

keep up, either. visibility to zero, nothing taking off   
& his dulcimer before me  bonus points   

for bingos like a cautionary tale. the night   
before i'd been his warm up act,   

the audience of expensive preppies   
doubling to twenty when he shambled   

to the podium to give them martial   
& his then-new poems. why do you write   

something nobody reads anymore? queried one   
little trust fund in a blazer. because   

i'm willing to be honestly confused   
& honestly fearful. il miglior fabbro,   

a.k.a. prez sweet & fitting honorifics he has left   
upon the living's lips. sweet & fitting too   

that i could know the poems much better than   
the man, flawed as i am told he was. connoisseur   

of word-root & amphibrach, of coltrane   
solo & of california reds, of box score & horatian loss,   

his garrulousness formidable & masking   
a shyness i could never penetrate, meeting him   

would always find me tongue-tied,   
minding my ps & qs, the latter of which   

i could not play, failing three times to draw a u.   
the dead care nothing for our eulogies   

he wrote this many times & well.   
& yet i pray his rumpled daimonion 

shall guide our letters forward   
as they wend the snow-white notebook leaves,   

the stanzas scrolling down the laptop screens.   
game after game & the snow labored on.   

phalanx, bourboned whiteout & the board aglow   
as he'd best me again & again. qintar 

& prosody, the runway lights enshrouded   
& the wind, endquote, shook the panes.


a fortune cookie 
ominous inscrutable chinese news 
to get just before christmas, 
considering my reasonable health, 
marriage spicy as moo-goo-gai-pan, 
career running like a not-too-old chevrolet. 
not bad, considering what can go wrong 
the bony finger of uncle sam 
might point out my husband, 
my own national guard, 
and set him in afghanistan 
my boss could take a personal interest 
the pain in my left knee could spread to my right. 
still, as the old year tips into the new, 
i insist on the infant hope, gooing and kicking 
his legs in the air. i won't give in 
to the dark, the sub-zero weather, the fog,
or even the neighbors' nativity. 
their four-year-old has arranged 
his whole legion of dinosaurs 
so they, too, worship the child, 
joining the cow and sheep. or else, 
ultimate mortals, they've come to eat 
ox and camel, mary and joseph, 
then savor the newborn babe.


map of terror and pleasure, 
ardent junk, passionate congress 
filled with the arguments of chemicals, 

echo chamber for the fanatical cries 
of stubborn generations, all the quaint invisibles 
death has grown a beard on, 

labyrinth of desire, playing field of impulse, 
factory where decay's silent armies clock in, 
philosopher-clown blowing a horn at each epiphany. 

washed by the rough nurse of morning, 
wheeled into the ward of the afternoon, 
feeds, grateful, on the rich broth of dusk. 

reads the erratic cards of dreams, 
turns on the rack of insomnia, 
steals the two-bit grace of sleep. 

loses its name in foreign embraces, 
forges a passport to the country of   tenderness, 
gestures like a child at the thing that it   wants, 
opaque from its own breath on the glass.


for ira
with the seal of science 

emblazoned 

on your forehead, 

like the old good housekeeping 

seal of approval, 

i believe what you tell me 

about cells and molecules, 

though i can't see them. 


and though the language you speak 

is full of numbers and symbols 

i'll never understand 

though your tie is askew 

and your hair unruly, still i believe 

what you say about the size of the universe, 

which is either expanding or contracting, 

i've forgotten which already. 


so if tomorrow you tell me 

you made a small miscalculation, 

that god indeed created the world 

in  short days, then rested on the th, 

that it was eve who landed us 

in all this trouble, i would believe you. 

i would believe you 

as i've always done before.


my son's been learning time big hand 
and little, powers of sixty 
and of twenty-four, the slow semaphore 
of days. he's brought home paper plates 
from kindergarten, arrows pointing 
at his favorite hours. so far 
the face of every clock has smiled. 

and before we read to sleep each night 
he crosses off another square 
on the calendar above his bed, 
counting down to christmas or to nothing 
in particular, sometimes just a line 
he draws uphill or down, check marks 
like the ones his teacher leaves 

on sheets he's filled with capitals 
and lower cases, other times a pair 
of thick lines like the crossed bones 
on a pirate's flag, an x 
as if to mark the treasure buried 
in some ordinary week, 
no day yet a cross to bear.


day and night, the lake dreams of sky. 
a privacy as old as the mountains 
and her up there, stuck among peaks. the   whole eye 

fastened on hawk, gatherings of cloud or stars, 
so little trespass. an airplane once 
crossed her brow she searched but could not find 

a face. having lived with such strict beauty 
she comes to know how the sun is nothing 
but itself and the path it throws the moon 

a riddled stone. if only a hand 
would tremble along her cheek, would disturb. even the elk 
pass by, drawn to the spill of creeks below-- 

how she cannot help abundance, even as it leaves 
her, as it sings all the way down the mountain.


philosophic 
in its complex, ovoid emptiness, 
a skillful pundit coined it as a sort 
       of stopgap doorstop for those 
                     quaint equations 

                     romans never 
dreamt of. in form completely clever 
and discrete--a mirror come unsilvered, 
       loose watch face without the works, 
                     a hollowed globe 

                     from tip to toe 
unbroken, it evades the grappling 
hooks of mass, tilts the thin rim of no thing, 
      remains embryonic sum, 
                   non-cogito.


as a boy he played alone in the fields   
behind our block, six frame houses   
holding six immigrant families,   
the parents speaking only gibberish   
to their neighbors. without the kids   
they couldn't say good morning and be   
understood. little wonder   
he learned early to speak to himself,   
to tell no one what truly mattered.   
how much can matter to a kid   
of seven? everything. the whole world   
can be his. just after dawn he sneaks   
out to hide in the wild, bleached grasses   
of august and pretends he's grown up,   
someone complete in himself without   
the need for anyone, a warrior   
from the ancient places our fathers   
fled years before, those magic places   
kiev, odessa, the crimea,   
port said, alexandria, lisbon,   
the canaries, caracas, galveston.   
in the damp grass he recites the names   
over and over in a hushed voice   
while the sun climbs into the locust tree   
to waken the houses. the husbands leave   
for work, the women return to bed, the kids   
bend to porridge and milk. he advances   
slowly, eyes fixed, an animal or a god,   
while beneath him the earth holds its breath.


take hold of the bitter end 
pass carefully around 
the standing part, 
being mindful of the bight. 
finish with a round turn, 
make the knot up tight 
and it will not slip under load. 

but you'll find it not 
so easily undone 
dangerous in the dark and cold 
and wet, when it matters most. 
these knots command allegiances. 

the turk's head and midshipman's bend, 
the lighterman's hitch and 
the hangman's noose. 
see what names mean 
knots are men. 

facing page--a simple eye-splice. 
apply a whipping at the end 
so no strands come loose 
in the braid. the knot will hold 
anything you care to bind.


there is a heaviness between us,   
nameless, raised from the void, that counts out the sprung hours.   
what ash has it come to purify?   
what disappearance, like water, does it lift up to the clouds?   

god of my fathers, but not of mine,   
you are a part, it is said, an afterthought, a scattered one.   
there is a disappearance between us as heavy as dirt.   
what figure of earth and clay would it have me become?   

sunday again, january thaw back big time.   
the knock-kneed, overweight boys and girls   
sit on the sun-warmed concrete sidewalk outside the pharmacy   
smoking their dun-filtered cigarettes.   

nothing is bothering them--and their nicotine dreams--   
this afternoon. everything's weightless,   
as insubstantial as smoke.   
nothing is disappearing in their world. arrival is all.   

there is a picture of yves klein leaping out of a window   
above a cobblestone paris street.   
a man on a bicycle peddles away toward the distance.   
one of them's you, the other is me.   

cut out of the doctored photograph, however, the mesh net   
right under the swan-diving body.   
cut out of another print, the black-capped, ever-distancing cyclist, as well as the mesh net.   
hmm . . . and there you have it, two-fingered sleight-of-hand man.   

one loses one's center in the air, trying to stay afloat,   
doesn't one? snowfalling metaphors.   
unbidden tears, the off-size of small apples. unshed.   
and unshedable.   

such heaviness. the world has come and lies between us.   
such distance. ungraspable.   
ash and its disappearance--   
unbearable absence of being,   
                                           tonto, then taken back.


rent a flatbed with a winch. 
with the right leverage 
anything can be hoisted, driven off. 

or the man with a bobcat comes in, 
then the hauler with his enormous truck. 
a leveler or a lawyer does the rest 

experts always are willing to help. 
the structure was old, rotten in spots. 
hadn't it already begun to implode? 

believe you've just sped the process up. 
photographs, toys, the things that break 
your heart--let's trust 

they would have been removed, 
perhaps are safe with the children 
who soon will have children of their own. 

it's over. it's time for loss to build 
its tower in the yard where you 
are merely a spectator now. 

admit you'd like to find something 
discarded or damaged, even gone, 
and lift it back into the world.


what am i to you now that you are no   
longer what you used to be to me?   

who are we to each other now that   
there is no us, now that what we once   

were is divided into me and you   
who are not one but two separate and   

unrelated persons except for that ex-   
that goes in front of the words   

that used to mean me, used to mean   
you, words we rarely used husband, wife   

as when we once posed so young and helpless   
with our hands yours, mine clasped on the knife   

that was sinking into the tall white cake.   
all that sweetness, the layers of one thing

and then another, and then one thing again.


i found it in the wash, the orange 
shell i picked up on the beach 
that last time. one of my girls-- 
the one named after you-- 

must have found it in my room 
and wanted it. clean calcareous 
curve, a palm open to nothing, 
reeking of sunshine 

and your death. for years 
i didn't know what to do with it. 
you would have liked 
this story how a child 

slips grief into a careless pocket. 
breaks it to pieces. lets it go.


i acknowledge my status as a stranger   
inappropriate clothes, odd habits   
out of sync with wasp and wren.   
i admit i don't know how   
to sit still or move without purpose.   
i prefer books to moonlight, statuary to trees.   

but this lawn has been leveled for looking,   
so i kick off my sandals and walk its cool green.   
who claims we're mere muscle and fluids?   
my feet are the primitives here.   
as for the rest--ah, the air now   
is a tonic of absence, bearing nothing   
but news of a breeze.


the leaves had fallen in that sullen place, 
but none around him knew just where they were. 
the sky revealed no sun. a ragged blur 
remained where each man's face had been a face. 

two angels soon crept forth with trays of bread, 
circling among the lost like prison guards. 
love is not love, unless its will affords 
forgiveness for the words that are not said. 

still he could not believe that this was hell, 
that others sent before him did not know 
yet, once his name and memory grew faint, 
it was no worse, perhaps, than a cheap motel. 
it is the love of failure makes a saint. 
he stood up then, but did not try to go.


for carol rigolot
  
        when deeds splay before us 
precious as gold & unused chances 
stripped from the whine-bone, 
we know the moment kindheartedness 
walks in. each praise be 
echoes us back as the years uncount 
themselves, eating salt. though blood 
first shaped us on the climbing wheel, 
the human mind lit by the savanna's 
ice star & thistle rose, 
your knowing gaze enters a room 
& opens the day, 
saying we were made for fun. 
even the bedazzled brute knows 
when sunlight falls through leaves 
across honed knives on the table. 
if we can see it push shadows 
aside, growing closer, are we less 
broken? a barometer, temperature 
gauge, a ruler in minus fractions 
& pedigrees, a thingmajig, 
a probe with an all-seeing eye, 
what do we need to measure 
kindness, every unheld breath, 
every unkind leapyear? 
sometimes a sober voice is enough 
to calm the waters & drive away 
the false witnesses, saying, look, 
here are the broken treaties beauty 
brought to us earthbound sentinels.


pindar, poet of the victories, fitted names   
and legends into verses for the chorus to sing   
names recalled now only in the poems of pindar   

o nearly unpronounceable immortals,   
in the dash, oionos was champion   
oionos, likmynios's son, who came from midea.   
in wrestling, echemos won--the name   
of his home city, tegea, proclaimed to the crowds.   
doryklos of tiryns won the prize in boxing,   
and the record for a four-horse team was set   
by samos from mantinea, halirothios's son.   

and pindar, poet of the olympian and isthmian   
and pythian games, wrote also of the boundless   
and forgetful savannas of time. what is someone? 
the chorus sing in a victory ode--what is a nobody? 

creatures of a day, they chant in answer, creatures   
of a day. so where is the godgiven glory pindar says   
settles on mortals?--bright as gold among the substances,   
say the chorus, paramount as water among the elements.   

not in the victory itself, petty or great,   
of rich young greeks contending in games.   
not in the poetry itself, with its forgotten dances   
and pindar spinning among tiresome or stirring   
myths and genealogies, the chanted names   
of cities and invoked gods and dignitaries--   

striving, o nearly unpronounceable athletes,   
to animate the air with dancing feet raising   
a golden pollen of dust a pervasive blur   
of seedlets in the sunlight, whirling--beyond mere   
victory or applause or performance,   
as victory is beyond defeat.   

the one who threw the javelin furthest   
sang the chorus, chanting pindar's incantation   
against envy and oblivion, was phrastor.   
and when nikeus grunting whirled the stone   
into the air and it flew past the marks   
of all the competitors, nikeus's countrymen   
shouted his name after it, nikeus,   
nikeus, and the syllables so say the lines pindar   
composed for the sweating chorus to chant--radiated   
for a spell like the silvery mirror of the moon.


for the person who obtained my debit card number and spent , in five days
my pale stepdaughter, just off the school bus,   
scowled, well, that's the last time i say my name's   
snodgrass just so, may that anonymous   
mexican male who prodigally claims   

my clan lines, identity and the sixteen   
digits that unlock my bank account,   
think twice. that less than proper name's been   
taken by three ex-wives, each for an amount   

past all you've squandered, each more than pleased   
to change it back. that surname you affect   
may have more consequence than getting teased   
by dumb kids or tracked down by bank detectives.   

don't underrate its history one of ours played   
piano on his prison's weekly broadcast   
one got rich on a scammed quiz show one made   
a bungle costing the world series. my own past   

could subject you to guilt by association   
if you write anything more than false checks,   
abandon all hope of large press publication   
or prizes--critics shun the name like sex 

without a condom. whoever steals my purse   
helps chain me to my writing desk again   
for fun and profit. so take thanks with my curse   
may your pen name help send you to your pen.


as the light goes, go. 
be the rustling in the grass, the fall from 
convention's good graces learn, or someone 
will have you filing files or writing writs, 
demonstrating cutlery or selling knowledge 

door to door someone might even drop 
your lovely life into a factory and have you 
derusting rings on the coolant-spouting 
turntable of a vertical lathe. 
it's best for everyone that what you know 

is generally thought of as general knowledge. 
you can find it in pool rooms and roadside bars, 
in meadows as inviting as beds, in bedrooms 
where it whispers like a ribbon untying 
you can even find it in schools. but be careful 

it's dangerous, inescapable and exact 
down to every atom of everything there is, 
to every name each thing goes by and every 
law each thing obeys. and the best part is, 
you always know more than you know.


aren't you glad at least that the earthworms   
under the grass are ignorant, as they eat the earth,   
of the good they confer on us, that their silence   
isn't a silent reproof for our bad manners,   
our never casting earthward a crumb of thanks   
for their keeping the soil from packing so tight   
that no root, however determined, could pierce it?   

imagine if they suspected how much we owe them,   
how the weight of our debt would crush us   
even if they enjoyed keeping the grass alive,   
the garden flowers and vegetables, the clover,   
and wanted nothing that we could give them,   
not even the merest nod of acknowledgment.   
a debt to angels would be easy in comparison,   
bright, weightless creatures of cloud, who serve   
an even brighter and lighter master.   

lucky for us they don't know what they're doing,   
these puny anonymous creatures of dark and damp   
who eat simply to live, with no more sense of mission   
than nature feels in providing for our survival.   
better save our gratitude for a friend   
who gives us more than we can give in return   
and never hints she's waiting for reciprocity.   

if i had nickel, i'd give it to you,   
the lover says, who, having nothing available   
in the solid, indicative world, scrapes up   
a coin or two in the world of the subjunctive.   
a nickel with a hole drilled in the top   
so you can fasten it to your bracelet, a charm   
to protect you against your enemies.   

for his sake, she'd wear it, not for her own,   
so he might believe she's safe as she saunters   
home across the field at night, the moon above her,   
below her the loam, compressed by the soles of her loafers,   
and the tunneling earthworms, tireless, silent,   
as they persist, oblivious, in their service.


a stay of execution one last day, 
your day, old everydog, then, as they say, 
or as we say a new trick to avoid 
finalities implicit in destroyed, 
you have to be put down, or put to sleep-- 
the very dog who, once, would fight to keep 
from putting down, despite our shouts, a shoe 
until he gnawed it to the sole, and who 
would sit up, through our sleepless nights, to bark 
away some menace looming in the dark. 

can you pick up the sense of all this talk? 
or do you still just listen for a walk, 
or else, the ultimate reward, a car?-- 
my god, tomorrow's ride . . . well, here we are, 
right now. you stare at me and wag your tail. 
i stare back, dog-like, big and dumb. words fail. 
no more commands, ignore my monologue, 
go wander off. good dog. you're a good dog. 
and you could never master, anyway, 
the execution, as it were, of stay


the hounds, you know them all by name. 
you fostered them from purblind whelps 
at their dam's teats, and you have come 
to know the music of their yelps 

high-strung anthee, the brindled bitch, 
the blue-tick coated philomel, 
and freckled chloe, who would fetch 
a pretty price if you would sell-- 

all fleet of foot, and swift to scent, 
inexorable once on the track, 
like angry words you might have meant, 
but do not mean, and can't take back. 

there was a time when you would brag 
how they would bay and rend apart 
the hopeless belling from a stag. 
you falter now for the foundered hart. 

desires you nursed of a winter night-- 
did you know then why you bred them-- 
whose needling milk-teeth used to bite 
the master's hand that leashed and fed them?


i know my friend is going, 
though she still sits there 
across from me in the restaurant,   
and leans over the table to dip 
her bread in the oil on my plate i know   
how thick her hair used to be,   
and what it takes for her to discard 
her man's cap partway through our meal,   
to look straight at the young waiter   
and smile when he asks 
how we are liking it. she eats 
as though starving--chicken, dolmata,   
the buttery flakes of filo-- 
and what's killing her 
eats, too. i watch her lift 
a glistening black olive and peel   
the meat from the pit, watch 
her fine long fingers, and her face,   
puffy from medication. she lowers   
her eyes to the food, pretending 
not to know what i know. she's going.   
and we go on eating.


the message i found on the post-it note 
went thus love truth expect to be found out. 
kid-style capitals proved i wrote it, but 
left no clue why i'd swelled into a fat 

clause no editor could edit then, an entry 
on a shrink's list of patient slang for sex-- 
her desk norwegian teak, the mug of tea 
on which she had affixed her post-it notes 

hot against her knuckle, their lips of stickum 
loosening . . . and yet, i knew the note 
to peel away at hour's end would terminate 
our sessions--cool as the draft her linen 

skirt was lifting to love, just stay benighted,  
given everything i know you've got to hide. 


for fred
i could pick anything and think of you--   
this lamp, the wind-still rain, the glossy blue   
my pen exudes, drying matte, upon the page.   
i could choose any hero, any cause or age   
and, sure as shooting arrows to the heart,   
astride a dappled mare, legs braced as far apart   
as standing in silver stirrups will allow--   
there you'll be, with furrowed brow   
and chain mail glinting, to set me free   
one eye smiling, the other firm upon the enemy.   

this post-postmodern age is all business compact disks   
and faxes, a do-it-now-and-take-no-risks   
event. today a hurricane is nudging up the coast,   
oddly male big bad floyd, who brings a host   
of daydreams awkward reminiscences   
of teenage crushes on worthless boys   
whose only talent was to kiss you senseless.   
they all had sissy names--marcel, percy, dewey   
were thin as licorice and as chewy,   
sweet with a dark and hollow center. floyd's   

cussing up a storm. you're bunkered in your   
aerie, i'm perched in mine   
twin desks, computers, hardwood floors   
we're content, but fall short of the divine.   
still, it's embarrassing, this happiness--   
who's satisfied simply with what's good for us,   
when has the ordinary ever been news?   
and yet, because nothing else will do   
to keep me from melancholy call it blues,   
i fill this stolen time with you.


it may be esoteric and perverse 
 that i consult pythagoras to hear 
 a music tuning in the universe. 
 my interest in his math of star and sphere 
 has triggered theorems too far-fetched to solve. 
 they don't add up. but if i rack and toil 
 more in ether than a mortal coil, 
 it is to comprehend how you revolve, 
 by formulas of orbit, ellipse, and ring. 

 dear son and daughter, if i seem to range 
 it is to chart the numbers spiraling 
 between my life and yours until the strange 
 and seamless beauty of equations click 
 solutions for the heart's arithmetic.


geneticist as driver, down the gene 
codes in, let's say, a topless coupe 
and you keep expecting bends, 

real tyre-testers on tight 
mountain passes, but instead it's dead 
straight, highway as runway, 

helix unravelled as vista, 
as vanishing point. keep your foot 
down. this is a finite desert. 

you move too fast to read it, 
the order of the rocks, the cacti, 
roadside weeds, a blur to you. 

every hour or so, you pass a shack 
which passes for a motel here 
tidy faded rooms with tvs on 

for company, the owner pacing out 
his empty parking lot. and after 
each motel you hit a sandstorm 

thick as fog, but agony. 
somewhere out there are remnants 
of our evolution, genes for how 

to fly south, sense a storm, 
hunt at night, how to harden 
your flesh into hide or scales. 

these are the miles of dead code. 
every desert has them. 
you are on a mission to discover 

why the human heart still slows 
when divers break the surface, 
why mermaids still swim in our dreams.


most of the things you made for me--blanket- 
chest, lapdesk, the armless rocker--i gave 
away to friends who could use them and not 
be reminded of the hours lost there, 
not having been witness to those designs, 
the tedious finishes. but i did keep 
the mirror, perhaps because like all mirrors, 
most of these years it has been invisible, 
part of the wall, or defined by reflection-- 
safe--because reflection, after all, does change. 
i hung it here in the front, dark hallway 
of this house you will never see, so that 
it might magnify the meager light, 
become a lesser, backward window. no one 
pauses long before it. but this morning, 
as i put on my overcoat, then straightened 
my hair, i saw outside my face its frame 
you made for me, admiring for the first 
time the way the cherry you cut and planed 
yourself had darkened, just as you said it would.


i wake to the sound of water, and think, 
mother has died and gone to france, 
she is at un autre htel, speaking french 
better than ever, while i stare at the fog 
that has a river in it--the broad dordogne, 
making its river noise, as if all the faucets 
have been left on all night. the river 
rushing in one direction only, so different 
from blackfish creek, where the sea floods in 
and back, scrubbing the sand both ways. 

well, one travels so things are different. 
american actors speak french on tv here. 
last night they showed accident catastrophe 
about two babies switched in the hospital at birth. 
one dies. the parents discover the dead child 
was someone else's and their child is alive 
in florida with son pre, though sa mre 
est morte de some disease, who knows? 

anyway, ed asner, who plays the lawyer, 
speaks gravelly french, but people have 
an american demeanor, they pull their hair 
on the edge of violence. then each family 
gives up a piece, and the child ends up more 
loved than ever, as if it's inevitable. 
or so the river is telling me 
with its one-way simplicity, 
like gravity. alive in the eternal 
heart of france--that's mother 
i'm thinking about, for some reason, 

maybe the journal my wife's been keeping, 
so like the daily letters mother wrote 
to sa mre et son pre, when her life 
was flowing through her like the broad 
dordogne. and where is she now? 
does she wish my father were with her, 
one of him alive, and one with her? 
a bell is ringing wildly, each of its peals 
like a round boat rolling downstream 
where the river divides around an island 
only to sweep back into itself 
somewhere in the fog.


a history of some sort, one that made us, 
a war and what the war had meant, or since 
meaning eludes war, what it did to the look 
of the trees and the sides of the buildings, 
most of which survived, only to be torn down 
later to widen the street or put up a new 
office complex. there it was on the shelf. 
i was there only a moment, but still, 
i wanted to know what happened to the man 
in the photograph wearing a flat cap 
standing outside the important building 
cheering. he was there. he was part of that 
moment, one of the first into the streets 
when the turn of events came, the declaration 
or pronouncement, words that would change 
the look of everything he smiled on, words 
that may have cost him his life. here it is 
in a book i found on a shelf. the person 
who lives here bought it at a library 
stock reduction sale. no one had read it. 
it looked interesting thirty years ago. 
it was practically new, the back uncracked. 
but the person did what those before her had, 
put it up on a shelf and never found 
a way back to it. the history sits there, 
unread, unbelievable, somebody else's. 
even i have only looked at the pictures, 
at the man smiling between the cold pages. 
maybe ending the world as he knew it 
was ok. maybe it was the only way. 
maybe the world has to come to an end 
in the first place to be the world. and the man? 
he has to smile, though he knows so little 
of what's coming, even looking right at it. 
as we do, who still haven't read the book.


just a shadow. hardly that. but audible. 
coming out of the woods, whispering 
happily ever after. 
                          even in that light-- 
stars with the skeletons of animals 
and old friends-- 
                       visible 
to the eye behind the one always 
left open on the east side of the house, 
downhill. where the coffee trees 
and hemp and the graves of old dogs lie, 
buried themselves in leaves and left 
to the sputtering wind of memory. 

& if that's not enough he says 
to himself in the voice of a black-and-white 
actor whose name is a moth that keeps 
avoiding the tip of his flaming tongue 
to bring you home, well, there 
it is again, 
              already exhausted 
by your efforts to make it 
comfortable 
enough to stay. impatient, 
                                   already headed 
back down into the woods, whispering 
once upon a time . . . 


i go down to the edge of the sea. 
how everything shines in the morning light 
the cusp of the whelk, 
the broken cupboard of the clam, 
the opened, blue mussels, 
moon snails, pale pink and barnacle scarred-- 
and nothing at all whole or shut, but tattered, split, 
dropped by the gulls onto the gray rocks and all the moisture gone. 
it's like a schoolhouse 
of little words, 
thousands of words. 
first you figure out what each one means by itself, 
the jingle, the periwinkle, the scallop 
       full of moonlight. 

then you begin, slowly, to read the whole story.


isn't the moon dark too,   
most of the time?   

and doesn't the white page   
seem unfinished   

without the dark stain   
of alphabets?   

when god demanded light,   
he didn't banish darkness.   

instead he invented   
ebony and crows   

and that small mole   
on your left cheekbone.   

or did you mean to ask   
why are you sad so often?   

ask the moon.   
ask what it has witnessed.


when you are already here 

you appear to be only 

a name that tells of you 

whether you are present or not 


and for now it seems as though 

you are still summer 

still the high familiar 

endless summer 

yet with a glint 

of bronze in the chill mornings 

and the late yellow petals 

of the mullein fluttering 

on the stalks that lean 

over their broken 

shadows across the cracked ground 


but they all know 

that you have come 

the seed heads of the sage 

the whispering birds 

with nowhere to hide you 

to keep you for later 


you 

who fly with them 


you who are neither 

before nor after 

you who arrive 

with blue plums 

that have fallen through the night 


perfect in the dew


if you believe in the magic of language, 
then elvis really lives 
and princess diana foretold i end as car spin. 

if you believe the letters themselves 
contain a power within them, 
then you understand 
what makes outside tedious, 
how desperation becomes a rope ends it. 

the circular logic that allows senator to become treason, 
and treason to become atoners. 

that eleven plus two is twelve plus one, 
and an admirer is also married. 

that if you could just rearrange things the right way 
you'd find your true life, 
the right path, the answer to your questions 
you'd understand how the titanic 
turns into that ice tin, 
and debit card becomes bad credit. 

how listen is the same as silent, 
and not one letter separates stained from sainted.


for kenneth koch
you don't need a pony   
to connect you to the unseeable   
or an airplane to connect you to the sky.   

necessary it is to love to live   
and there are many manuals   
but in all important ways   
one is on one's own.   

you need not cut off your hand.   
no need to eat a bouquet.   
your head becomes a peach pit.   
your tongue a honeycomb.   

necessary it is to live to love,   
to charge into the burning tower   
then charge back out   
and necessary it is to die.   
even for the trees, even for the pony   
connecting you to what can't be grasped.   

the injured gazelle falls behind the   
herd. one last wild enjambment.   

because of the sores in his mouth,   
the great poet struggles with a dumpling.   
his work has enlarged the world   
but the world is about to stop including him.   
he is the tower the world runs out of.   

when something becomes ash,   
there's nothing you can do to turn it back.   
about this, even diamonds do not lie.


we are tender and our lives are sweet 

and they are already over and we are 
visiting them in some kind of endless 
reprieve from oblivion, we are walking 
around in them and after we shatter 
with love for everything we settle in. 

thou tiger on television chowing, 
thou very fact of dreams, thou majestical 
roof fretted with golden fire. thou wisdom 
of the inner parts. thou tintinnabulation. 

is it not sweet to hand over the ocean's 
harvest in a single wave of fish? to bounce 
a vineyard of grapes from one's apron 
and into the mouth of the crowd? to scoop up 
bread and offer up one's armful to the throng? 
let us live as if we were still among 

the living, let our days be patterned after 
theirs. is it not marvelous to be forgetful?


i don't know how it happened, but i fell--   
and i was immense, one dislocated arm   
wedged between two buildings. i felt some ribs   
had broken, perhaps a broken neck, too   
i couldn't speak. my dress caught bunched   
about my thighs, and where my glasses shattered   
there'd spread something like a seacoast, or maybe   
it was a port. where my hair tangled with power lines   
i felt a hot puddle of blood.   
                                                   i must have passed out,   
but when i woke, a crew of about fifty   
was building a winding stairway beside my breast   
and buttressing a platform on my sternum.   
i heard, as through cotton, the noise of hammers,   
circular saws, laughter, and some radio   
droning songs about love. out the corner   
of one eye i could open one eye a bit i saw   
my pocketbook, its contents scattered, my lipstick's   
toppled silo glinting out of reach.   
and then, waving a tiny flashlight, a man   
entered my ear. i felt his boots sloshing   
the blood trickling there. he never came out.   
so some went looking, with flares, dogs, dynamite   
even they burst my middle ear and found   
my skull, its cavern crammed with dark matter   
like a cross between a fungus and a cloud.   
they never found his body, though. and they never   
found or tried to find an explanation,   
i think, for me they didn't seem to need one.   
even now my legs subdue that dangerous   
sea, the water bright enough to cut   
the skin, where a lighthouse, perched on the tip   
of my great toe, each eight seconds rolls   
another flawless pearl across the waves.   
it keeps most ships from wrecking against my feet.   
on clear days, people stand beside the light   
they watch the waves' blue heads slip up and down   
and scan for landmarks on the facing shore.

what's unseen may not exist--   
or so those secret powers insist   
            that prowl past nightfall,   
enabled by the brain's blacklist   
            to fester out of sight,   

so we streak from bad to worse,   
through an expanding universe   
            and see no evil.   
on my rounds like a night nurse   
            or sentry on qui vive,   

i make, through murkier hours, my way   
where the sun patrolled all day   
            toward stone-blind midnight   
to poke this flickering flashlamp's ray   
            at what's hushed up and hidden.   

lacking all leave or protocol,   
things, one by one, hear my footfall,   
            blank out their faces,   
dodge between trees, find cracks in walls   
            or lock down offices.   

still, though scuttling forces flee   
just as far stars recede from me   
            to outmost boundaries,   
i stalk through ruins and debris,   
            graveyard and underground.   

led by their helmetlantern's light   
miners inch through anthracite   
            i'm the unblinking mole   
that sniffs out what gets lost or might   
            slip down the world's black hole.

ending his rounds, the watchman, somewhat tipsy, returns 

what's obscene?--just our obsessed,   
incessant itch and interest   
      in things found frightful   
in bestial tortures, rape, incest   
      in ripe forbidden fruit   

dangling, lush, just out of reach   
dim cellars nailed up under each   
      towering success,   
the loser's envy that will teach   
      a fierce vindictiveness,   

the victors' high court that insures   
pardon for winners and procures   
      little that's needed   
but all we lust for. what endures?--   
      exponential greed   

and trash containers overflowing   
with shredded memos, records showing   
      what, who, when, why   
'til there's no sure way of knowing   
      what's clear to every eye   

the heart's delight in hatred, runny   
as the gold drip from combs of honey   
      the rectal intercourse   
of power politics and money   
      that slimes both goal and source.   

what's obscured?--what's abscessed.   
after inspection, i'd suggest   
      it's time we got our head   
rewired. i plan to just get pissed,   
      shitfaced and brain-dead.


never anymore in a wash of sweetness and awe   
does the summer when i was seventeen come back   
to mind against my will, like a bird crossing   

my vision. summer of moist nights full of girls   
and boys ripened, holy drunkenness and violation   
of the comic boundaries, defiances that never   

failed or brought disaster. days on the backs   
and in the breath of horses, between rivers   
and pools that reflected the cicadas' whine,   

enervation and strength creeping in smooth waves   
over muscular water. all those things accepted,   
once, with unnoticing hunger, as an infant   

accepts the nipple, never come back to mind   
against the will. what comes unsummoned now,   
blotting out every other thought and image,   

is a part of the past not so deep or far away   
the time of poverty, of struggle to find means   
not hateful--the muddy seedtime of early manhood.   

what returns are those moments in the diner   
night after night with each night's one cup of coffee,   
watching an old man, who always at the same hour   

came in and smiled, ordered his tea and opened   
his drawing pad. what did he fill it with?   
and where's he gone? those days, that studious worker,   

hand moving and eyes eager in the sour light,   
that artist always in the same worn-out suit,   
are my nostalgia now. that old man comes back,   

the friend i saw each day and never spoke to,   
because i hoped soon to disappear from there,   
as i have disappeared, into the heaven of better days.


after george herbert 
this tiny ruin in my eye, small 
flaw in the fabric, little speck 
of blood in the egg, deep chip 
in the windshield, north star, 
polestar, floater that doesn't 
float, spot where my hand is not, 
even when i'm looking at my hand, 
little piton that nails every rock 
i see, no matter if the picture 
turns to sand, or sand to sea, 
i embrace you, piece of absence 
that reminds me what i will be, 
all dark some day unless god 
rescues me, oh speck 
that might teach me yet to see.


little has been made   
of the soft, skirting action   
of magnets reversed,   
while much has been   
made of attraction.   
but is it not this pillowy   
principle of repulsion   
that produces the   
doily edges of oceans   
or the arabesques of thought?   
and do these cutout coasts   
and incurved rhetorical beaches   
not baffle the onslaught   
of the sea or objectionable people   
and give private life   
what small protection it's got?   
praise then the oiled motions   
of avoidance, the pearly   
convolutions of all that   
slides off or takes a   
wide berth praise every   
eddying vacancy of earth,   
all the dimpled depths   
of pooling space, the whole   
swirl set up by fending-off--   
extending far beyond the personal,   
i'm convinced--   
immense and good   
in a cosmological sense   
unpressing us against   
each other, lending   
the necessary never 
to never-ending.


put an ear to the light at fall 
of dark and you will hear 
nothing. this pale luminescence 
that drifts in upon them 
makes a blue bole of their caves, 
a scare of their scything 
tails. they tell 
in the bubbling dark of images 
that come in upon them 
when light spreads like an oil slick 
and sea fans 
that once were their refuge 
turn away. 
now there is no dark 
dark enough for their silver tails, 
scatter of color 
like coins massively 
piling in the lap of a miser 
that was, in the day, their pride. 
how hugely here we belong. 
this is their song 
in the silting 
drift of the reef. 
they have never seen the moon 
nor the black scut of night, stars 
spread like plankton 
in their beastly infinities.


there is one mind in all of us, one soul, 
    who parches the soil in some nations 

but in others hides perpetually behind a veil 
    he spills light everywhere, here he spilled 

some on my tie, but it dried before dinner ended. 
    he is in charge of darkness also, also 

in charge of crime, in charge of the imagination. 
    people fucking do so by flicking him 

off and on, off and on, with their eyelids 
    as they ascertain their love's sincerity. 

he makes the stars disappear, but he makes 
    small stars everywhere, on the hoods of cars, 

in the ommatea of skyscrapers or in the eyes 
    of sighing lovers bored with one another. 

onto the surface of the world he stamps 
    all plants and animals. they are not gods 

but it is he who made us worshippers of every   
    bramble toad, black chive we find. 

in idaho there is a desert cricket that makes 
    a clock-like tick-tick when he flies, but he 

is not a god. the only god is the sun, 
    our mind, master of all crickets and clocks.


you change a life 
as eating an artichoke changes the taste 
of whatever is eaten after. 
yet you are not an artichoke, not a piano or cat--
not objectively present at all--
and what of you a cat possesses is essential but narrow 
to know if the distance between two things can be leapt. 
the piano, that good servant, 
has none of you in her at all, she lends herself 
to what asks this has been my ambition as well. 
yet a person who has you is like an iron spigot 
whose water comes from far-off mountain springs. 
inexhaustible, your confident pronouncements flow, 
coldly delicious. 
for if judgment hurts the teeth, it doesn't mind, 
not judgment. teeth pass. pain passes. 
judgment decrees what remains--
the serene judgments of evolution or the judgment 
of a boy-king entering persia burn it, he says, 
and it burns. and if a small tear swells the corner 
of one eye, it is only the smoke, it is no more to him than a beetle 
fleeing the flames of the village with her six-legged children. 
the biologist haldane--in one of his tenderer moments--
judged beetles especially loved by god, 
because he had made so many. for judgment can be tender 
i have seen you carry a fate to its end as softly as a retriever 
carries the quail. yet however much 
i admire you at such moments, i cannot love you
you are too much in me, weighing without pity your own worth. 
when i have erased you from me entirely, 
disrobed of your measuring adjectives, 
stripped from my shoulders and hips each of your nouns, 
when the world is horsefly, coal barge, and dawn the color of winter butter--
not beautiful, not cold, only the color of butter--
then perhaps i will love you. helpless to not. 
as a newborn wolf is helpless no choice but hunt the wolf milk, 
find it sweet.


has crawled out of the ocean

the gray of inner sunset. and so on.   

on the n, one should invent   
intricate fictions for the lives

but first, the long lush green

good-bye now to their owners   
eyeing one another. good-bye

where once a man was found dead,   

his penis shoved into his own mouth.   
the world continues, the engine

down in the blue-green water   
       at nightfall some selving shapes   
float fluorescing, trance-dancing,   
       trembling to the rhythm of   
theodoxical marching-   
       music that they hear over   
the mere noise of the breaking   
       tide. above, stars in certain   
places along the shore roads,   
       cars carrying people on   
uncertain errands, sordid   
       and sacred and all the kinds   
in between. halogen-lit,   
       a woman gets down from her   
all-wheel-drive velocipede,   
       enters through an obeying   
door a cyclopean store   
       to buy unintelligent   
fresh fish and other objects   
       whether formerly alive   
or formerly dead, she comes   
       out again, a poor man calls   
to her, selling his no-news-   
       paper the disastrous head-   
lines smile and nod, they announce   
       the plans of steel patriots   
and undertakers, ad-men   
       and fallen vice-generals,   
doping their stolen crusades.   
       but the woman has learned, as   
i have learned, as all of us   
       must keep learning if we are   
to be good subjects, how to   
       make of a newspaper the   
mask of a locust, calmly   
       put it on, and begin once   
more to eat everything up.


knots, a thousand lights, in   
   sheer dark, aimed at my window,   
tinny crystals, so mother dies   
   in my sleep. the snow turns   
coarse, goes out. an axe sounds   
   where i'd never heard an axe before.   
breathing becomes dangerous. i can't   
   help it, making me her, even   
before i was born, her brain burning   
   out patterns i follow like will   
o' the wisps, sparks popping.   
   i put on heels and find i can balance,   
twist my spine, bend to get my seams   
   straight on my own, no one to   
call on, like she called me, sheer nylon   
   turning on sheer skin under my palms.   
i pull on the ratty musquash coat.   
   i have the body. i move off in it,   
eddying, trying to see who i am now.   
   i totter down the street thinking,   
one day he'll be sorry. and here i am.   
   sorry. i watch her getting smaller   
up the road. i watch us both, till   
   nothing's all there is. 


and blush for a cheek of stone.   

      blush for the lips sewn tight with thread, no speech for the dead   
      maker--   

       
      you've got the razor. you can make each suture snap.   

       
      and watch the mouth    
bloom up with foam,   
      as if he'd drowned himself in soap--   

      you lift the neck and let the head drop back.   
the mouth yawns wide its prize--   

       
      white thrive.   
the larval joy.   
      hot in their gorge on the stew of balms,   
a moist exhale--   
      as if there were a last breath, a taunt   
coiling   
      into your inner ear, good dog, you dig your hands in,   
up-cupping   
      the glossal   
bed--   

       
      saying, graduate   
of the school of flesh,   
      father conspirator--   


      i will learn it.   
      i will bite the tongue from the corpse.


before my first communion, i clung to doubt 
         as satan spider-like stalked 
                the orb of dark surrounding eden 

for a wormhole into paradise. 
       god had formed me from gel in my mother's womb, 
                injected by my dad's smart shoot. 

they swapped sighs until 
         i came, smaller than a bite of burger. 
                quietly, i grew till my lungs were done 

then the lord sailed a soul 
         like a lit arrow to inhabit me. 
                maybe that piercing 

made me howl at birth, 
         or the masked creatures whose scalpel 
                cut a lightning bolt to free me. 

i was hoisted by the heels and swatted, fed 
         and hauled around. time-lapse photos show 
                my fingers grow past crayon outlines, 

my feet come to fill spike heels. 
         eventually, i lurched out 
                to kiss the wrong mouths, get stewed, 

and sulk around. christ always stood 
         to one side with a glass of water. 
                i swatted the sap away. 

when my thirst got great enough to ask, 
         a clear stream welled up inside, 
                some jade wave buoyed me forward, 

and i found myself upright 
         in the instant, with a garden 
                inside my own ribs aflourish. 

there, the arbor leafs. 
         the vines push out plump grapes. 
                you are loved, someone said. take that 

                and eat it.


i see you shuffle up washington street   
whenever i am driving much too fast   
you, chub & bug-eyed, jaw like a loaf   
hands in your pockets, a smoke dangling slack   
from the slit of your pumpkin mouth,   
humped over like the eel-man or geek,   
the dummy paid to sweep out gutters,   

drown the cats. where are you going now?   
though someday you'll turn your gaze    
upon my shadow in this tinted glass   
i know for now you only look ahead   
at sidewalks cracked & paved with trash 
but what are you slouching toward--knee-locked,   
hippity, a hitch in your zombie walk, bighead?


each morning in the little white cabin   
by the river they woke to a raccoon   
clawing under the floorboards or banging   
in the wood stove. they did not discuss this.   
instead they said it was a perfect day   
to pick blueberries on the hill, or that   
a hike to the old glassworks sounded good.   
they were beginning to speak not in meat   
but in the brown paper the butcher wraps   
around it. brown paper around dirty   
magazines. like dirty magazines, they   
only traced the contour of substance silk   
over skin, skin over muscle, muscle over   
bone. what's under bone? marrow? their forks so   
small and dull. as if for dolls. you can tell   
dolls from animals because the latter   
are made of meat. many eat it, also.   
lions are interesting. lions don't eat   
the flesh of their kills right away, but first   
lap up the blood, until the meat is blanched   
nearly white. white as the little cabin   
by the river they stayed in that summer.   
white as the raccoon covered in ashes,   
his black eyes bottomless and bright with hate.

up here as trees
may your branches squirt

my pages please



the wooden horses
are tired of their courses

and plead from head to hoof 
to be fed to a stove--

in leaping lunging flames 
they'd rise again, flared manes

snapping like chains behind them. 
the smoke would not blind them

as do these children's hands 
beyond our cruel commands

the fire will free them then 
as once the artisan when

out of the tree they
were nagged to this neigh.



the generator hums like a distant ding an sich.   
it's early evening, and time, like the dog it is,

something is making the reeds bend and cover their heads.   
something is licking the shadows up,   
and stringing the blank spaces along, filling them in.   
something is inching its way into our hearts,

should we let it in?   
                                       should we greet it as it deserves,   
hands on our ears, mouths open?   
or should we bring it a chair to sit on, and offer it meat?   
should we turn on the radio,   
                                                     should we clap our hands and dance

joy in the day's being done, however    
clumsily, and in the ticked-off lists,    
the packages nestling together,    
no one home waiting for dinner, for    
you, no one impatient for your touch    
or kind words to salve what nightly    
rises like heartburn, the ghost-lump feeling    
that one is really as alone as one had feared.    
one isn't, not really. not really. joy    
to see over the strip mall darkening    
right on schedule a neon-proof pink    
sunset flaring like the roof of a cat's mouth,    
cleanly ribbed, the clouds laddering up    
and lit as if by a match struck somewhere    
in the throat much deeper down.


i try to think of the cup of a hand,   
of legs in a tangle, and not the thistle   

though even it, purpled, spiking away,   
wants to be admired, wants to say, whistle   

a little for me. o every little thing wants 
to be loved, wants to be marked by the cry   

that brings desire to it, even blue-eyed fly   
to the bloated hiss of death. to love is to be remiss   

the horse alone in the wide flat field nods 
its head as if the bridle and bit were missed   

or mocked the cow slung with the unmilked weight   
of her tremendous teats shoots a look back over her shoulder   

at o lonesome me. i want to say to her need                  
as if crooning could be enough,   

sweet, sweet mama . . . truth be told,   
the thousand lisping bees to the milkweeds' honey   

terrifies me. when the stink of slurry season   
is over and the greened fields are slathered, fecund,   

overtall foxgloves tip with the weight of their fruit.   
then i dream a little dream of you   

and me, curled like two grubs on the top of a leaf   
wind-driven and scudding along the lake's surface.   

all night we glide to its blue harbor   
and back again. the fattened slack of us   

singing o darlin' darlin'   darlin'.


sleep, she will not linger
she turns her moon-cold shoulder.
with no ring on her finger,
you cannot hope to hold her.

she turns her moon-cold shoulder
and tosses off the cover.
you cannot hope to hold her
she has another lover.

she tosses off the cover
and lays the darkness bare.
she has another lover.
her heart is otherwhere.

she lays the darkness bare.
you slowly realize
her heart is otherwhere.
there's distance in her eyes.

you slowly realize
that she will never linger,
with distance in her eyes
and no ring on her finger.


everything contains some   
silence. noise gets 
its zest from the 
small shark's-tooth 
shaped fragments 
of rest angled 
in it. an hour   
of city holds maybe   
a minute of these   
remnants of a time   
when silence reigned,   
compact and dangerous   
as a shark. sometimes   
a bit of a tail   
or fin can still   
be sensed in parks.


late august was a pressure drop,   
rain, a sob in the body,   

a handful of air    
with a dream in it,    

summer was desperate    
to paradise itself with blackberry   

drupelets and swarms, everything   
polychromed, glazed, sprinkler caps    

gushing, the stars like sweat   
on a boxer's skin. a voice   

from the day says   
tax cuts    

for the rich or scratch   
what itches or it's a sax   

from bitches brew,   
and i'm a fool    

for these horns   
and hues, this maudlin    

light. it's a currency of feeling    
in unremembered march.   

there's a war on and snow in the 
                        city   
where we've made our desire stop   

and start. in the dying school of bruce   
i'm the student who still believes   

in the bad taste of the beautiful   
and the sadness of songs   

made in the ratio   
of bruise for bruise.


what a fuckup you are.    
what dumbshit you do.    
your father's voice    
still whispers in you,    
    
despite the joys    
that sweeten each day.    
your genius it isn't    
until, dying away,    
    
it worms back through    
the sparkling dream    
where you drown him    
in an inch-deep stream    
    
your knee in his back,    
your strength on his skull,    
it begins singing    
praise for your skill.


ghost i house   
in this old flat--   
your outpost--   
my aftermath


foreplay of obscene graffiti carved   
into trees--foot-long boners   
gouge the bark. beaks and snouts   
on a restroom mirror. slick lips.   
succulent lips. i go out among them   
sometimes. so sweet how they pucker up   
out of pity. a practiced pathos   
in a saloon of woodsmen whose axes   
wait in trucks out back. lips full of yawn   

or yes. lips thick with god-spit   
and god-suck. chapped lips, bloody lips.   
pierced or tattooed, they pout 
into view--here to give, willy-nilly, 
what's been too long held in the body. 
something passes across tongues. it sayeth not   
a name it taketh everyone's turn. mute lips   
of a swift unbuttoner. mouths fording   
frothy streams, vaporous bogs.   
i stumble forth in their midst. maybe   
i am out of bread or in a bad place   
with a book. the streets have an attendant 
caress. moon lapping rumor. fat lip   
approaches hare lip. there go pasty 
lips. all are readied as if for a race   
or to be plucked like rare moths   
by bright wings from the air. betty's lips   
and bobby's and bucky's just before the collision 
and the siren's red wail. laddy, keep 

a light on. i may have to come ashore 
some distance from where i set in. 


after the trumpets, after the incense    
there were nights insomnia fathered gods    
i then rejected as too angry or distracted,    
or whose appetite for submission revealed    
their own lack of faith.   say our names,    
all synonyms for trust. others spoke    
in sugared paradox  to know is to know    
all. to not know all is not to know. to know    
all requires that you know very little,    
but to know that little you have to know    
all . and for a while, it's true,    
i burned in the dark fires of ambivalence,    
my attention consumed like oxygen.    
i'd wake up tired, as i had with the married man    
whose strictures and caprice begat,    
and begat, and begat, and begat    
my love for him, harvesting the same      
silence from my bed. who listens    
to my penitential tune? who accepts    
my petitions for convenient parking,    
for spring, for the self illuminated    
across a kitchen table, for . . . for    
fortitude? i've heard a voice, i'm sure,    
advising me to drop this sentimental farce.    
only to hold the smoke of their names    
again in my mouth i'd resurrect    
the dead, or adopt the gods orphaned    
by atheists, except the gods they've made    
from disbelief no one's faith could tolerate.    
refusing to make the same mistake    
just once, i've cried out to the dark    
many names, most given up as routinely    
as the secrets of friends. if you're a cup      
will my lips profane your own? if a comb      
will i feel your teeth against my neck?      
if a wall i will be darker than your shadow.    
and if a door i will unlatch you, letting in    
all the little foxes from the vineyard.


in appreciation of maxim gorky at the international convention of atheists, 
like gorky, i sometimes follow my doubts   
outside to the yard and question the sky,   
longing to have the fight settled, thinking   
i can't go on like this, and finally i say   

all right, it is improbable, all right, there   
is no god. and then as if i'm focusing   
a magnifying glass on dry leaves, god blazes up.   
it's the attention, maybe, to what isn't there   

that makes the emptiness flare like a forest fire   
until i have to spend the afternoon dragging   
the hose to put the smoldering thing out.   
even on an ordinary day when a friend calls,   

tells me they've found melanoma,   
complains that the hospital is cold, i say god.   
god, i say as my heart turns inside out.   
pick up any language by the scruff of its neck,   

wipe its face, set it down on the lawn,   
and i bet it will toddle right into the godfire   
again, which--though they say it doesn't   
exist--can send you straight to the burn unit.   

oh, we have only so many words to think with.   
say god's not fire, say anything, say god's   
a phone, maybe. you know you didn't order a phone,   
but there it is. it rings. you don't know who it could be.   

you don't want to talk, so you pull out   
the plug. it rings. you smash it with a hammer   
till it bleeds springs and coils and clobbery   
metal bits. it rings again. you pick it up   

and a voice you love whispers hello.


not delft or   
delphinium, not wedgewood 
among the knickknacks, not wide-eyed chicory   
evangelizing in the devil strip-- 

but way on down in the moonless   
octave below midnight, honey, 
way down where you can't tell cerulean   
from teal. 

not mason jars of moonshine, not   
waverings of silk, not the long-legged hunger   
of a heron or the peacock's   
iridescent id-- 

but delilahs of darkness, darling, 
and the muscle of the mind 
giving in. 

not sullen snow slumped   
against the garden, not the first instinct of flame,   
not small, stoic ponds, or the cold derangement 
of a jealous sea-- 

but bluer than the lips of lazarus, baby,   
before sweet jesus himself could figure out 
what else in the world to do but weep.


many believe in the stars.   


   take quinamid   
the son of a dardanian astrologer   
who disregarded what his father said   
and came to troy in a taxi.   

gone.   

    odysseus to greece   

    hector has never fought this far from troy.   
we want him further out. beyond king ilus' tower.   
so walk him to the centre of the plain and, having killed him,   
massacre the trojans there.   

ave   

    immediately beyond the ridge is primrose hill   
where paris favoured aphrodit.   

take it, said hector.   

    greece shouted hurry up   
troy shouted wait for us   

    see,   
far off,   
masts behind the half-built palisade.   
    then   
nearer to yourselves   
scamnder's ford   
from which the land ascends   
then merges with the centre of the plain--   
the tower a ruin its highest point.   

    heaven.   
bad music.   
queen hera is examining her gums.   
looking in through a window   
teenaged athena says   
trouble for greece.   

      they leave.   

      sea.   
      sky.   
      the sunlit snow.   

      two armies on the plain.   
hector, driven by lutie,   
his godchild and his nephew,   
going from lord to trojan lord   

the ships by dark.   

    the ruined tower.   

      in front of it--   
their banners rising one by one.   
one after one, and then another one--   
, greeks.   

      and on a rise in front of greece   
two hero lords   

      ajax the great of salamis   
behind his shield--   
                        
            as fifty trojan shields   
topped with blue plumes, swivelling their points,   
come up the rise--   
      lord teucer five feet high and five feet wide   
loading his bow,   
peering round ajax' shield,   
dropping this trojan plume or that,   
ordering his archers to lie flat,   
promising god as many sheep as there are sheep to count   
if he can put a shaft through hector's neck.   

      prosperity   
beneath the blue, between the sea, the snow, there   
    hector is   
surrendering the urn of one he has just killed   
to one who thought that he had killed the same.   
      lord teucer's eyeprince hector's throat. 
but god would not. the bowstring snaps.   

      outside god's inner court.   
queen hera and athena still in line.   
hera so angry she can hardly speak.   
      a voice   
the wife, the daughter.   
you go. his face will make me   
    heave.   

serene and dignified grandee.   
papa to you.   

papa--his hand--   
i know you do not want the holy family   
    visiting the plain.   
but some of us would like to help the greeks.   
they lost their champion she.   
    thousands of them have died. now they are in retreat.   
    please look. 
      
      the plain.   

you will come back the moment that i call?   
of course, papa.   
then . . . yes. encourage greece.   
but voices only.   
    words. shouts. that sort of thing. a move--and home you come.   
of course, papa.   

      the plain.   

      lord teucer's archers hidden in its grass.   

    chylbborak, lord hector's brother-in-law, to his blue plumes 
move   
move   
      and on their flanks, between the sea and snow,   
led by telspiax' silver yard   
all ilium's masks   

down came their points. out came their battle cry.   
and our cool mr  x  called up.' and up we got   
and sent our arrows into them,   
that made them pirouette,   
topple back down the rise, leaving their dead   
for some of us to strip, and some, the most,   
to pause, to point, to plant, a third, a fourth   
volley into their naked backs. pure joy   

      chylbborak,   
holding his ground   
centre on me.   
more die in broken than in standing ranks.   
apollo aphrodit our gods are here   
you taste the air, you taste their breath   
the greek fleet, ours, by dark   

      then he is ringed.   

      see an imperial pig harassed by dogs.   
      how, like a masterchef his crpes,   
      he tosses them and on their way back down   
      eviscerates, then flips them back into the pack.   
likewise chylbborak the greeks who rushed.   

      hector has seen it. as--   
beneath the blue, the miles of empty air,   
him just one glitter in that glittering   mass--   
the hosts begin to merge.   

      fine dust clouds mixed with beams of light.   
the prince, down from his plate.   
either sides' arrows whingeing by   
cover my back.   
finding a gap   
dismissing blows as gales do slates,   
then at a run, leaping into the ring,   
taking chylbborak's hand   
if you don't mind?   

      agamemnon   
our time has come. god keeps his word.   
fight now as you have never fought.   
we will be at troy's gates by dusk,   
through them by dark,   
by dawn, across our oars,   
as we begin our journey home,   
watching the windmills on its wall   
turn their sails in flames.   

    heaven. the wife. the daughter.   

    hands release black lacquer clasps inlaid with particles of gold.   
silk sheaths--with crashing waves and fishscales woven on a    
            navy ground--   
flow on the pavement.   

      hands take their hands   

      while other hands supply   

      warwear,   

      their car,   

      and put the reins into athena's hands.   

. . . troy's gates by dusk,   
      through them by dark . . .   

      the hours, the undeniable,   
open the gates of paradise.   

      beyond   

      the wastes of space.   

      before   

      the blue.   

      below   

      now near   

      the sea, the snow.   

      all time experts in hand-to-hand action--   
friecourt, okinawa, stalingrad west--   
could not believe the battle would gain.   
but it did.   

      chylbborak's ring is ringed. and then no ring at all.   
some trojans raise their hands in prayer   
      some panachans shout for joy and wait to drag the corpses off. 


      lutie, alone, the reins in one, his other hand   
hacking away the hands that grab his chariot's bodywork,   
rearing his horses, starlight and bertie, through,   
      to,   
      yes,   
      chylbborak up rescued   
prince hector covering. then   

zoo-born wolf front for a family of thieves   
lord diomed, on foot, with sethynos.   
      my lutie answering   
be proud prince hector is your fate.   
which will be so,   
though lutie will not see it.   
      chylbborak and hector do not want to disappoint this oily pair   
here come the sisters karamazof, spark,   
chylbborak said. let's send them home in halves.   
and jumped back down.   

      around the tower,  greeks,  ilians, amid their swirl,   
his green hair dressed in braids, each braid   
tipped with a little silver bell, note   
nyro of simi--the handsomest of all the greeks, save a.   
                  the trouble was, he had no fight. he dashed from fight to fight, 
struck a quick blow, then dashed straight out again.   
save that this time he caught,   
as prince aenas caught his breath,   
that prince's eye who blocked his dash,   
and as lord panda waved and walked away,   
took his head off his spine with a backhand slice--   
beautiful stuff . . . straight from the blade . . .   
      still, as it was a special head,   
mowgag, aenas' minder--   
bright as a box of rocks, but musical--   
spiked it, then hoisted it, and twizzling the pole   
beneath the blue, the miles of empty air,   
marched to the chingaling of its tinklers,   
a knees high majorette   
towards the greeks, the tower.   

      a roar of wind across the battlefield.   

      a pause.   

      and then   

      scattering light,   
the plain turned crystal where their glidepath stopped,   
the queen of heaven shrills typhoid for troy   
and through poor nyro's wobbling mouth   
athena yells   

slew of assiduous mediocrities   
meek greeks   

      it is enough.   

      centre-plain wide,   
lit everywhere by rays of glorious light,   
they rushed their standards into ilium,   
      diomed for once swept forward   
converting shame to exaltation with his cry   

never--to helen's gold without her self   
      never--to helen's self   
    without her gold   

      mowgag well slain.   
hewn through his teeth, his jaw slashed off,   
and nyro's head beside him in the grass.   

      when nyro's mother heard of this   
she shaved her head she tore her frock she went outside   
ripping her fingernails through her cheeks   
then down her neck her chest her breasts   
and bleeding to her waist ran round the shops,   
sobbing   
god, kill troy.   
console me with its death.   
revenge is all i have.   
my boy was kind. he had his life to live.   
i will not have the chance to dance in hector's blood,   
but let me hear some have before i die.   

i saw her running round.   
      i took the photograph.   
      it summed the situation up.   
      he was her son.   
      they put it out in colour. right?   
      my picture went around the   
    world.   

      down the shaft of the shot in his short-staved bow   
      lord panda has been follow-spotting diomed.   

      between her self   her gold he shoots.   
it hits. and as its barbs protrude through dio's back   
aenas hears lord panda shout   
he bleeds the totem greek right-shoulder-front 
how wise of artemis to make   
panda her matador her numero uno moi   

      diomed hit,   
the heart went out of those who followed him   
and they fell back.   

    shields all round   

diomed on his knees   

lifting his hands   

sister and wife of god   

as sethynos breaks off the arrowhead   

eliminate my pain.   

settles his knee beneath his hero's shoulderblades   

let me kill that oaf who claims my death   

bridges his nape with one hand   

before it comes with honour to my name.   

    then with his other hand   
in one long strong slow pull   
drew the shank back, and out.   

    she heard his prayer.   

    before their breathless eyes   
his blood ran back into the pout the shank had left,   
and to complete her miracle   
lord diomed rose up between them, stood in the air,   
then hovered down onto his toes   
brimming with homicidal joy,   
imparting it to greece.   

    then troy was driven back,   
trampling the half-stripped still-masked carcasses   
hatching the centre of the plain.   

      aenas  panda.   
      

get him.   

get him i got him. he is dead. but there he is.   

      and diomed has spotted them.   

calm down, aenas said. perhaps he is possessed.   

what god would visit him?   

so pray to yours--and try another shot.   

huntress, lord panda prays,   
      bright-ankled   god of nets and lines,  
      of tangled mountains, ilex groves and dark cascades . . .   

      but artemis was bored with him   
and let him rise, still praying hard,   
into the downflight of the javelin   
diomed aired at prince aenas.   

    sunlit, it went through panda's lips, out through his neck, and then 
through biblock's neck.   
      and so they fell the lord, face up the friend, face down   
gripping the blood-smeared barb between his teeth,   
between the sea and snow.   

      aenas covers them.   

      eyeing his plate   
--technology you can enjoy--   
diomed found, and threw, a stone   
as heavy as a cabbage made of lead,   
that hit, and split, aenas' hip.   
who went down on one knee   
and put his shield hand on the grass   
and with his other hand covered his eyes.   
dido might have become a grandmother   
and rome not had its day, except   
as diomed came on to lop his top   
aenas' mama, aphrodit dressed   
in grey silk lounge pyjamas piped with gold   
and snake-skin flip-flops stepped   
between him and the greek.   
a glow came from her throat, and from her hair   
a fragrance that betokened the divine.   
stooping, she kissed him better, as   
queen hera whispered greek, cut that bitch.   
and, diomed, you did nicking love's wrist.   

    studying the ichor as   
it seeped across her pulse into her palm   
our lady of the thong lifted her other hand   
removed a baby cobra from her hair   
and dropped it, diomed, onto your neck,   
and saw its bite release its bane into your blood.   
      then nobody could say   
who diomed fought for, or for what he fought.   

      rapt through the mass   
      now shouting at the sky, now stomping on the plain,   
      he killed and killed and killed, greek, trojan, greek, 
lordless, shamefame, both gone and gone   
loyalty nurtured in the face of death,   
the duty of revenge, the right to kill,   
to jeer, to strip, to gloat, to be the first   
to rally but the last to run, all gone--   
and gone, our lady aphrodit, giggling.   

      while everywhere,   

driving your fellow greeks   
    back down the long incline that leads to the scamnder's ford, 
surely as when   
lit from the dark part of the sky by sudden beams,   
a bitter wind   
detonates line by line of waves against the shore.   

    no mind. even as teucer backed away   
he kept his eyes on you.   
you feel the stress? you feel the fear?   
behold your enemy the prince god loves   
    see   teucer's bow. hear teucer's this time lucky.   
    his--   
but this time it was not our father, god,   
who saved your life, my prince.   
    as agamemnon cried   
the ships are safe.   
stand at the riverside's far bank.   
telspiax heard the rustle of lord teucer's shot   
and stood between yourself and it.   

    his head was opened, egglike, at the back,   
mucked with thick blood, blood trickling from his mouth.   
his last words were   
prince, your trumpeter has lost his breath.   

    our worst fear was his face would fade,   
    telspiax's father said. 
but it did not. we will remember it until we die.   

    give his instrument to hogem, hector said, and went--   
lutie on reins--between the sea and snow,   
throwing his chariots wide, scamnderwards,   
as easily as others might a cloak.   

    diomed among this traffic, on his own,   
among his dead,   
their pools of blood, their cut-off body-parts,   
their cut-off heads,   
ashamed as his head cleared   
to see odysseus, idomeneo, the ajax--big and small--   
whipping away downslope, shouting towards odysseus   
where are you going with your back to the battle?   
who shouted back, although he did not turn   
look left   
and there was lutie driving hector onto him,   

sure they would trample him, for sure   
queen hera's human, diomed,   
would stand and die, except   
arms up, young king-- nestor, full tilt,   
reins round his tummy, leaning out --and   
jump . . . wrists locked . . . you young are just . . .   
swinging him up onto the plate . . . too much.   

with your permission, da?   
nod. drew. then threw the chariot's javelin   
as lutie spun his wheels, and hector threw--    
those skewers trading brilliance as they passed--   
and missed--both vehicles slither-straightening,   
regaining speed, close, close, then driven apart   
by empty cars careering off the incline,   
or stationary cars, their horses cropping grass.   

daddy, go slow. hector will say i   ran.   
but not the widows you have made.   

    and slow   
    and low   
cruising the blue above this mix   
heaven's queen and ringsight-eyed athena   
trumpeting down huge worms of sound   
as hector's car rereached king nestor's,   and   
what kept you, prince? diomed offered as they came abreast   
you went for a refreshing towel?   
and threw his axe, that toppled through the air, and, oh,   
hector, my hector, as you thought   
if heaven helps me heaven shows it loves the best,   
parted your lutie's mesh and smashed into his heart.   

    what did you say as god called you to death   
dear lutie?   

king prince, i leave you   driverless.   

    and put the reins into his hands, and fled   
into oblivion   

      as hector with his other hand   
held what his lutie was, upright, face forwards, in between   
the chariot's basket and himself,   
shouting as he drove after them   

loathsome greek,   
your loathsome hair, your loathsome blood,   
your loathsome breath, your loathsome heart,   
jump in your loathsome ships,   
i will come after you,   
come over the aegean after you,   
and find you though you hide inside   
your loathsome father's grave   
and with my bare hands twist your loathsome head   
off your loathsome neck.   

      there was a greek called themion.   
mad about armour. if not armour, cars.   
of course he went to troy. and troy   
saw a stray spear transfix him as he drove.   
      companionably, his horses galloped up   
on starlight's side, and muddled starlight down,   
and bertie down, and brought the prince   
still holding lutie down, as all the world   
hurried, as if by windheads, on towards   scamnder's ford.   


hether you reach it from the palisade   
or through the trees that dot the incline's last stretch 
you hear scamnder's voice before you see   
what one may talk across on quiet days   
its rippling sunspangled breadth   
streaming across the bars of pebbly sand   
that form its ford   
--though on the fleet's side deeper, darkly bright.   

      and here   
tiptoeing from this bar to that,   
settling the cloudy sunshine of her hair,   
her towel retained by nothing save herself,   
the god of tops and thongs   
our lady aphrodit came,   
her eyes brimfull with tears.   

    scamnder is astonished by his luck.   

beauty of beauties, why are you weeping?   
i have been hurt, scamnder.   
no . . .   
humiliated.   
no . . .   
me. a god. just like yourself. touched . .   .   
touched   
by a man.   
a man   
a greek.   
death to all greeks   
he cut me   
sacrilege   
. . . but where?   
i need your healing touch.   
how can i help you if you do not show me where?   
moisten its lips and my wound will be healed.   
you must say where   
well . . .   
    the towel has slipped an inch.   
i am afraid you will be disappointed.   
never.   
are you sure?   
yes   
you will not criticize me?   
no   
    her wrist upturned.   
    out-turned.   
    her opened palm.   
    fanning the fingers of her other hand,   
stroking his spangles with her fingertips.   
goddess, i love you.   
i have always loved you.   
say that you love me. even a little.   
i beg you. god grant it.   
i need your help, scamnder.   
take pity on me. come into me.   
you have your nymphs.   
bores bores   
i might be nibbled by an eel   
death to all eels   
    the towel is down.   
step into me . . .   
i love your toes . . . please let me kiss your toes . . .   
your little dinkum-inkum toes . . .   
no one has kissed them so nicely, scamnder.   
and now your knees . . .   
you tickle me . . .   
and now your thighs   
oh, oh, go on . . .   
and now your bum   
    your holy bum your sacred bum   
    the bum of paradise   
oh, my scamnder, i must have your help . . .   
anything   
    the towel goes curling off,   
and as she floated on his stream   
our lady aphrodit said   
at any moment now the greeks will reach your    
         troy-side bank . . .   

    recall those sequences   
    when horsemen ride out of the trees and down into a   stream   
somewhere in kansas or missouri, say.   
    so--save they were   thousands--greece   
into scamnder's ford.   

    coming downstream,   
a smallish wave   

    that passes   

    but   

    scamnder's flow does not relapse.   

    indeed   

    almost without a sound   
its murmuring radiance rose   
into a dark, torrential surge,   
clouded with boulders, crammed with trees, as clamorous    
         as if it were a sea,   
that lifted greece, then pulled greece down,   
cars gone, masks gone, gone under, reappearing, gone   

onto your knees praise hector for this flood   
the prince god loves prince hector claims   
as he comes through the trees.   

    they do.   
then up and run, run, thousands of them,   
to hold those greeks who got back out   
under until their bubbles stopped while those swept off   
turned somersaults amid scamnder's undertow.   

    the flat--   

     yards of it between the river and the palisade.   

    the king   

the lord has not abandoned us.   
to cross will be as bad for them.   

    but it was not to be as bad for them.   

    indeed,   
as hector drove towards scamnder's brink,   
and as--their banners rising one by one,   
one after one and then another one--   
he and all ilium began to enter it,   
    the river reassumed its softly-spoken, smooth, sunspangled way.   

    and agamemnon cried   

god, what are you for?   
what use are you to me?   

    as hector cries   

two miracles   
your prince is close to god   

    and hera to athena   

fog?   

    and fog came down.   

    and most of greece got out.   

    troy holding hands midstream.   
an army peering through its masks.   

    miss tops and thongs to god   

your hera has . . .   

    and with a wish he turned the fog to light   

    and with a word he called them back to heaven.   

    sky.   
    snow.   
    the  yards.   
    the palisade.   

    hector   
i am your prince.   
my name means he-who-holds.   
troy. and the plain. and now the ships.   
    for troy his battle cry,   
rising into a common cry, that cry   
into a clamour, and that clamour to   
bayings of hatred.   

     yards.   

    the child   
we are the greeks. we fight to win. if one is lost,   
close his eyes, step over him, and kill his enemy.   

     yards.   

    the greeks are tiring.   
    nestor is on his knees   

god of all gods, most holy and most high,  
      if greece has ever sacrificed fresh blood to you,  
      protect our ships.   

    heaven.   
soft music. summertime. queen hera and athena? yes . . .   

    some lesser gods   
observing their approach, approach,   
salaam, and then   
lead them--   
now both in black wraparound tops--   
to god   

darling daddy, here we are.   
and hera here we stay   
until you stop that worthless hector killing greeks.   
    up steps love.   
    hera why is she wearing a tent?   
    love father, see this. her wrist.   
human strikes god communism the end of everything   

darlings, he said,   
you know that being a god means being blamed.   
do this--no good. do that--the same. the answer is   
avoid humanity.   
    remember--i am god.   
i see the bigger picture.   

and i am hera, heaven's queen,   
greece worships me.   

stuff greece, love said.   
your blubber-bummed wife with her gobstopper nipples   
hates troy because troy's paris put her last   
when we stripped off for him.   
    as for the ithacan boat-boy's undercurved preceptatrix,   
she hates troy because my statue stands on its acropolis.   

      hera the cities' whores were taxed to pay for it.   
      love dropping onto her knees before himself   
please . . . stop them harming troy. the greatest city   
                in the world.   

      while hera and athena sang   

cleavage cleavage   
      queen of the foaming hole.   
      mammoth or man or midge   
      she sucks from pole to pole.   

      and god has had enough of it.   

      lifting his scales he said   

hector will have his day of victory.   
then crashed them to the ground.   

       yards.   

      the palisade.   

      its gate.   

      late sunlight on gilt beaks.   

there's no escape from troy.   
or from the plain at troy.   

      begging for ransom, trojan hoti,   
his arms around king menelaos' knees.   

      king agamemnon off.   

      then he punched hoti in the face.   
then punched him in the face again.   
and then again. and when he fell   
king agamemnon kicked him in the groin.   
kicking him in the groin with so much force   
it took a step to follow up each kick.   
then pulled him up,   
then dragged him by his hair   
this way and that,    
then left him, calling   
finish him off.   
and someone did.   

i was sixteen. i said where is achilles?'   
hard as it is to share another's troubles when your own are pressing   
great ajax took my hands in his and said   
he loves us. he is with us. he will come.'   

      but he did not.   

      then ajax to himself   
dear lord, you made me straight.   
give me the strength to last till dark.   

      the prince i get past   everything i see.   
their war is lost.   

      it was.   

      aenas, bassee, sarpdon, gray,   
calling to one another down the line.   
      then, with a mighty wall of sound,   
as if a slope of stones   
rolled down into a lake of broken glass   
we ran at them.   

    and now the light of evening has begun   
to shawl across the plain   
blue gray, gold gray, blue gold,   
translucent nothingnesses   
readying our space,   
within the deep, unchanging sea of space,   
for hesper's entrance, and the silver wrap.   

    covered with blood, mostly their own,   
loyal to death, reckoning to die   
odysseus, ajax, diomed,   
idomeneo, nestor, menelaos   
and the king   

do not die because others have died.   
do not show them the palms of your hands.   

achil   
achil   
if he won't help us, heaven help us.   

stand still and fight.   
feel shame in one another's eyes.   
i curse you, god. you are a liar, god.   
troy will be yours by dark--immortal lies.   
home   
home   
there's no such place.   
you can't launch burning ships.   
more men survive if no one runs.   

    but that is what greece did.   

    dropping their wounded,   
throwing down their dead,   
their shields, their spears, their swords,   
they ran.   

    leaving their heroes tattered, filthy, torn   

    and ran   

    and ran   

    above their cries   

i am the prince the victory is mine   

    chylbborak   

do not take cowardice for granted.   

    scarce had he said it, when   
his son, kykon, standing next to him   
took ajax' final spear cast in his chest.   

i shall not wear your armour, sir, he said.   
and died.   

my son is dead.   

    the prince   

hector is loved by god.   

    and greece, a wall of walking swords,   
but walking backwards,   
leaving the plain in silence   
and in tears.   

    idomeneo,   
running back out at those trojans who came too close   
      

you know my name. come look for me. and boy,   
the day you do will be the day you die.   

    hector to troy   
soldiers--   
unmatched my force, unconquerable my will.   
after ten years of days, in one long day   
to be remembered for as many days   
as there are days to come, this is my day,   
your hector's day. troy given back to troy.   
my day of victory   
      and when the cheering died   
some say destroy greece now. but i say no.   
out of your cars. eat by your fires.   
two hundred fires around each fire   
five hundred men   
the sound of grindstones turning through the night,   
the firelight that stands between our blades,   
so let king agamemnon's own hold hands   
and look into each other's frightened eyes.   
true god great master of the widespread sky   
if only you would turn   
me into a god,   
as you, through me,   
tomorrow by their ships   
will see greece die.   

    silence.   

    a ring of lights.   

    within   

    immaculate   

    in boat-cloaks lined with red   

    king agamemnon's lords--   

    the depression of retreat.   
the depression of returning to camp.   
him at the centre of their circle   
sobbing,   
then shouting   

we must run for it   

    dark glasses in parked cars.   

king agamemnon of mycenae,   
god called, god raised, god recognized,   
you are a piece of shit, diomed said.   

    silence again.   

let us praise god, lord ajax said,   
that hector stopped before he reached the ships.   

    silence again.   

    then   

    nestor   
putting his knee back in   

paramount agamemnon, king of kings,   
lord of the shore, the islands and the sea   
i shall begin, and end, with you.   
    greece needs good words. like them or not, the credit    
            will be yours.   
determined. keen to fight, that is our diomed--   
as i should know. when just a boy of ten i fought   
blowback of missolonghi, a cannibal, drank blood,   
he captured you, he buggered you, you never walked again.   
but diomed lacks experience.   
    god has saved us, momentarily.   
god loves achilles.   
you took, and you have kept, achilles' ribband she.   

i was a fool   

and now you must appease him, agamemnon.   
humble words. hands shaken. gifts.   

    the king--wiping his eyes   

as usual,   
pylos has said the only things worth hearing.   
i was mad to take the she.   
i shall pay fitting damages.   
plus her, i offer him   
the corfiot armour that my father wore.   

    silence.   

    the sea.   

    its whispering.   

to which i add a set of shields.   
posy, standard, ceremonial.   
the last, cut from the hide of a one ton lesbian bull.   

    silence.   

    the sea.   

and . . . a chariot   
from my own quipe   
they smoke along the ground . . .   
they ride its undulations like a breeze . . .   

    the sea.   

plus six horses--saddled, bridled and caparisoned,   
their grooms and veterinarians . . .   

    . . . and six tall shes   
two good dancers, two good stitchers, two good cooks.   
all capable of bearing boys . . .   

oh, very well then twenty loaves of gold,   
the same of silver, and the same of iron.   

    masks. lights.   
behind the lords   
some hundreds from the army have walked up.   
    lord nestor smiles.   
lord menelaos smiles.   

plus--   
though it may well reduce your king to destitution   
    a'kimi'kriex,   
my summer palace by the argive sea,   
its lawns, its terraces, its curtains in whose depths   
larks dive above a field of waving lilies   
and fishscale-breakers shatter on blue rocks.   
then, as he draws their silky heights aside,   
standing among huge chests of looted booty,   
long necked, with lowered lids, but candid eyes,   
my living daughter, phaniss, a diamond   
big as a cheeseball for her belly stud.   
his wife to be minus--i need not say--her otherwise huge    
          bride-price.   

more   
more   
more   

    lord ajax almost has to hold him up.   

the whole of eastern pel'po'nesia--   
an area of outstanding natural beauty--   
its cities, epi'dvros, trw''zen,   
their fortresses, their harbours and their fleets,   
their taxpayers--glad to accept his modest ways--   
all this, the greatest benefaction ever known,   
if he agrees to fight. and he admits i am his king.   

    instantly, nestor   

an offer god himself could not refuse.   
all that remains to say is   
who shall take it to achilles?   

    agamemnon you will.   

    starlight.   

    the starlight on the sea.   

    the sea.   

    its whispering   

    mixed with the prayers   
of ajax and of nestor as they walk   
along the shore towards achilles' gate.   

my lords?   

your lord.   

this way.   

    they find him, with guitar,   
singing of gilgamesh.   

take my hands. here they are.   

    you cannot take your eyes away from him.   
his own so bright they slow you down.   
his voice so low, and yet so clear.   
you know that he is dangerous.   

patroclus?    
friends in need.   
    still,   
friends.   
    that has not changed,   
i think.   
    autmedon? wine.   

dear lord and master of the widespread sky,  
      accept ourselves, accept our prayers.   

    their cups are taken.   

father friend?   

    king nestor for his life   

you know why we are here.   
    we face death.   
the mass choose slavery.   
mycenae has admitted he was wrong to wrong yourself.   
in recompense he offers you   
the greatest benefaction ever known.   
take it, and fight. or else hector will burn the ships   
then kill us randomly.   
    remember what your father said   
the day when ajax and myself drove up to ask   
if you could come with us to troy?   
that you should stand among the blades where honour grows.   
and secondly, to let your anger go.   
    spirit, and strength, and beauty have combined   
such awesome power in you   
a vacant heaven would offer you its throne.   
think of what those who will come after us will say.   
    save us from hector's god, from hector, and from hector's force.   
i go down on my knees to you, achilles.   

i must admire your courage, father friend,   
for treating me as if i was a fool.   
i shall deal with hector as i want to.   
you and your fellow countrymen will die   
for how your king has treated me.   

    i have spent five years fighting for your king.   
my record is ten coastal and ten inland cities   
burnt to the ground. their males, massacred.   
their cattle, and their women, given to him.   
among the rest, briseis the beautiful, my ribband she.   
not that i got her courtesy of him.   
she joined my stock in recognition of   
my strength, my courage, my superiority,   
courtesy of yourselves, my lords.   
    i will not fight for him.   
he aims to personalise my loss.   
briseis taken from achilles--standard practice   
helen from menelaos--war.   
    lord busy busy, building his palisade, mounting my she,   
one that i might have picked to run my house,   
raising her to the status of a wife.   
    do i hate him? yes, i hate him. hate him.   
and should he be afraid of me? he should.   
i want to harm him. i want him to feel pain.   
in his body, and between his ears.   
    i must admit,   
some of the things that you have said are true.   
but look what he has done to me to me   
the king on whom his kingliness depends   
i will not fight for him.   
    hearing your steps, i thought at last,   
my friends have come to visit me.   
they took their time about it, true--   
after he took my she none of you came--   
now, though--admittedly they are in trouble,   
serious trouble--they have arrived as friends,   
and of their own accord.   
    but you have not come here as friends.   
and you have not come of your own accord.   
you came because your king told you to come.   
you came because i am his last resort.   
and, incidentally, your last resort.   

    at least he offers stuff.   
all you have offered is advice   
keep your temper . . .   
    mind your tongue . . .   
    think what the world will say . . .'   
no mention of your king's treatment of me.   
no sign of love for me behind your tears.   
    i will not fight for him.   
    i can remember very well indeed   
the day you two grand lords came visiting my father's house, 
how i ran out to you, and took your hands--   
the greatest men that i had ever seen   
ajax, my fighting cousin, strong, brave, unafraid to   die   
nestor, the king of sandy pylos, wisdom's sword.   
and then, when all had had enough to eat and drink   
and it was sealed that i should come to troy,   
then my dear father said that lordship knows   
not only how to fight, and when to hold its tongue,   
but of the difference between a child enraged   
and honour bound lords.   
    i will not fight for him.   
    there is a king to be maintained. you are his lords.   
my fighting powers prove my inferiority.   
whatever he, through you, may grant,   
i must receive it as a favour, not of right,   
go back to him with downcast looks, a suppliant tone,   
acknowledge my transgressions--i did not   
applaud his sticky fingers on my she's meek flesh.   
    my mother says i have a choice   
live as a happy backwood king for aye   
or give the world an everlasting murmur of my name,   
and die.   
    be up tomorrow sharp   
to see me sacrifice to lord poseidon and set sail.   
    oh, yes, his gifts   
the greatest benefaction ever known.'   
    if he put heaven in my hand i would not want it.   
his offers magnify himself.   
    likewise his child.   
i do not want to trash the girl.   
she is like me. bad luck to have poor friends.   
bad luck to have his kingship as your sire.   
    my father will select my wife.   
each spring a dozen local kings drive up   
and lead their daughters naked round our yard.   
some decent local girl. my father's worth   
is all the wealth we will require.   
    you greeks will not take troy.   
you have disintegrated as a fighting force.   
troy is your cemetery. blame your king.   
the man who you say has done all he can.   
the man who has admitted he was wrong.   
but he has not done all he can.   
and he has not admitted he was wrong.   
or not to me.   
    i want him here, your king.   
his arms straight down his sides, his shoulders back,   
announcing loud and clear that he was wrong to take my she.   
apologising for that wrong, to me, the son of pleus.   
before my followers, with you, pylos and salamis,   
crete. sparta. tyrins, argos, calydon, the islands, here,   
stood to attention on either side of him.   
      that is my offer. take it, or die.   

    nestor may stay the night.   
you, dear cousin ajax, tell your king what i have said.   
preferably, in front of everyone.   
                      
                                    
                      who said,   
as my achilles lifted his guitar   

lord, i was never so bethumped with words   
since first i called my father dad.   

    the sea.   
their feet along the sand to agamemnon's gate.   
and in starlit air   
the trojans singing   

i love my wife, i love her dearly,   
      i love the hole she pisses through,   
      i love her lily-white tits   
      and her nut-brown arsehole,   
      i could eat her shit with a wooden spoon.


just then, encountering my ruddy face    
in the grand piano's cold black craquelure,    
it conjured the jack-o'-lantern moon    
dipping up over the roofs of the tenderloin.    
    
only when i have done with the myths--    
the inner spill that triggers us to flame,    
breasts so sensitive a moment's touch             
will call down fever the dark sea-lane    
    
between limbic squall and the heart's harbour--    
will i picture you, just beyond innocence,    
lying stripped by a thrown-wide window,    
letting the cool breeze covet your ardour.


it was winter, near freezing,   
i'd walked through a forest of firs   
when i saw issue out of the waterfall   
a solitary bird.   

it lit on a damp rock,   
and, as water swept stupidly on,   
wrung from its own throat   
supple, undammable song.   

it isn't mine to give.   
i can't coax this bird to my hand   
that knows the depth of the river   
yet sings of it on land.


can the bald lie? the nature of the skin says not 
it's newborn-pale, erection-tender stuff, 
every thought visible,--pure knowledge, 
mind in action--shining through the skull. 
i saw one, a woman, hairless absolute, cleaning. 
she mopped the green floor, dusted bookshelves, 
all cloth and concentration, queen of the moon. 
you can tell, with the bald, that the air 
speaks to them differently, touches their heads 
with exquisite expression. as she danced 
her laundry dance with the motes, everything 
she ever knew skittered under her scalp. 
it was clear just from the texture of her head, 
she was about to raise her arms to the sky 
i covered my ears as she prepared to sing, roar, 
to let the big win resonate in the little room.


our business is with fruit and leaf and bloom    
though they speak with more than just the season's tongue--    
the colours that they blaze from the dark loam    
all have something of the jealous tang    
    
of the dead about them. what do we know of their part    
in this, those secret brothers of the harrow,    
invigorators of the soil--oiling the dirt    
so liberally with their essence, their black marrow?    
    
but here's the question. are the flower and fruit    
held out to us in love, or merely thrust    
up at us, their masters, like a fist?    
    
or are they the lords, asleep amongst the roots,    
granting to us in their great largesse    
this hybrid thing--part brute force, part mute kiss?


when he had suckled there, he began    
to grow first, he was an infant in her arms,    
but soon, drinking and drinking at the sweet    
milk she could not keep from filling her,    
from pouring into his ravenous mouth,    
and filling again, miraculous pitcher, mercy    
feeding its own extinction . . . soon he was    
huge, towering above her, the landscape,    
his shadow stealing the color from the fields,      
even the flowers going gray. and they came    
like ants, one behind the next, to worship    
him--huge as he was, and hungry it was    
his hunger they admired most of all.    
so they brought him slaughtered beasts    
goats, oxen, bulls, and finally, their own    
kin whose hunger was a kind of shame      
to them, a shrinkage even as his was      
beautiful to them, magnified, magnificent.      
    
the day came when they had nothing left    
to offer him, having denuded themselves    
of all in order to enlarge him, in whose    
shadow they dreamed of light and that      
is when the thought began to move, small    
at first, a whisper, then a buzz, and finally,    
it broke out into words, so loud they thought    
it must be prophecy they would kill him,      
and all they had lost in his name would return,    
renewed and fresh with the dew of morning.    
hope fed their rage, sharpened their weapons.    
    
and who is she, hooded figure, mourner now    
at the fate of what she fed? and the slow rain,      
which never ends, who is the father of that?      
and who are we who speak, as if the world    
were our diorama--its little figures moved    
by hidden gears, precious in miniature, tin soldiers,    
spears the size of pins, perfect replicas, history    
under glass, dusty, old fashioned, a curiosity    
that no one any longer wants to see,    
excited as they are by the new giant, who feeds    
on air, grows daily on radio waves, in cyberspace,      
who sows darkness like a desert storm,    
who blows like a wind through the boardrooms, 
 who touches the hills, and they smoke.


it was so simple you came back to me 
and i was happy. nothing seemed to matter 
but that. that you had gone away from me 
and lived for days with him--it didn't matter. 
that i had been left to care for our old dog 
and house alone--couldn't have mattered less 
on all this, you and i and our happy dog 
agreed. we slept. the world was worriless. 

i woke in the morning, brimming with old joys 
till the fact-checker showed up, late, for work 
and started in item it's years, not days. 
item you had no dog. item she isn't back, 
in fact, she just remarried. and oh yes, item you 
left her, remember? i did? i did. i do.


never mind thick night darkness move quick   
madness engulf me like jacob's coat   
colors tighten like sickness 'round me throat.   
wha it is do already can't tek back   
but it still got me a wash me hand   
til they sour and callus, de visions

when me could grin up and skin teet     
inna company of great men   
who smile up smile up wid me   
an looking fava   inna secret eyes an backdoor smiles.   
i know say woman like me plain wicked an conniving   
stinkin' wid ambition, smilin' close against you skin,   
seeking confession wid de devil.   

now so, me lay up inna bed wid death   
a-write me love letter. got me   
a crave colors to soothe me spirit

and white--mek me breast feel weight down   
wid milk, got me head swirling like inna hurricane.   
i chew down me bitter nails til i taste de poison

twilight folds over houses on our street   
its hazy gold is gilding our front lawns,   
delineating asphalt and concrete   
driveways with shadows. evening is coming on,   
quietly, like a second drink, the beers   
men hold while rising from their plastic chairs   
to stand above their sprinklers, and approve.   

soon the fireflies will rise in lucent droves--   
for now, however, everything seems content   
to settle into archetypal grooves   
the toddler's portraits chalked out on cement,   
mothers in windows, finishing the dishes.   
chuck connelly's cigarette has burned to ashes   
he talks politics to roger in the drive.   

it's all someone can do just to survive,   
he says, and nods--both nod--and pops another   
beer from the cooler. no rain. would you believe--   
says chuck, checking the paper for the weather.   
at least a man can keep his yard in shape.   
somewhere beyond this plotted cityscape   
their sons drive back and forth in borrowed cars   

how small their city seems now, and how far   
away they feel from last year, when they rode   
their bikes to other neighborhoods, to score   
a smoke or cop a feel in some girl's bed.   
they tune the radio to this summer's song   
and cruise into the yet-to-exhale lung   
of august night. nothing to do but this.   

these are the times they'd never dream they'll miss--   
the hour spent chasing a party long burned out,   
graphic imagined intercourse with denise.   
this is all they can even think about,   
and thankfully, since what good would it do   
to choke on madeleines of   temps perdu    
when so much time is set aside for that?   

not that their fathers weaken with regret   
as nighttime settles in--no, their wives   
are on the phone, the cooler has labatt   
to spare at nine the giants play the braves.   
there may be something to romanticize   
about their own first cars, the truths and lies   
they told their friends about some summer fling,   

but what good is it now, when anything   
recalled is two parts true and one part false?   
when no one can remember just who sang   
that song that everybody loved? what else?   
it doesn't come to mind. the sprinkler spits   
in metronome they're out of cigarettes.   
roger folds up his chair, calls it a day.   

the stars come out in cosmic disarray,   
and windows flash with television blues.   
the husbands come to bed, nothing to say   
but   'night . two hours late--with some excuse--   
their sons come home, too full of songs and girls   
to notice dew perfect its muted pearls   
or countless crickets singing for a mate.


families when a child is born
hope it will turn out intelligent.
i, through intelligence
having wrecked my whole life,
only hope that the baby will prove
ignorant and stupid.
then he'll be happy all his days
and grow into a cabinet minister.



my candle burns at both ends
    it will not last the night
 but ah, my foes, and oh, my friends--
    it gives a lovely light


the great gold apples of night
hang from the street's long bough
       dripping their light
on the faces that drift below,
on the faces that drift and blow
down the night-time, out of sight
       in the wind's sad sough.

the ripeness of these apples of night
distilling over me
       makes sickening the white
ghost-flux of faces that hie
them endlessly, endlessly by
without meaning or reason why
       they ever should be.


there's a flutter of grey through the trees
   ah, the exquisite curves of her dress as she passes
   fleet with her feet on the path where the grass is

i see not her face, i but see
   the swift re-appearance, the flitting persistence--
   there--of that flutter of grey in the distance.

it has flickered and fluttered away
   what a teasing regret she has left in my day-dream,
   and what dreams of delight are the dreams that one may 
         dream

it was only a flutter of grey
   but the vaguest of raiment's impossible chances
   has set my heart beating the way of old dances.


                                  i

to dream of love, and, waking, to remember you
as though, being dead, one dreamed of heaven, and woke
      in hell.
at night my lovely dreams forget the old farewell
ah wake not by his side, lest you remember too

                                  ii

i set all rome between us with what joy i set
the wonder of the world against my world's delight
rome, that hast conquered worlds, with intellectual might
capture my heart, and teach my memory to forget


from tablet writing, babylonian excavations of the th millennium b.c.
bilbea, i was in babylon on saturday night.
i saw nothing of you anywhere.
i was at the old place and the other girls were there, 
but no bilbea.

have you gone to another house? or city?
why don't you write?
i was sorry. i walked home half-sick.

tell me how it goes.
send me some kind of a letter.
and take care of yourself.



love faded in my heart--
i thought it was dead.
now new flowers start,
fresh leaves outspread.
why do these flowers upstart
and again the leaves spread?
oh, when will it be dead--
this root that tears my heart



the man moves earth 
to dispel grief. 
he digs holes 
the size of cars. 
in proportion to what is taken 
what is given multiplies-- 
rain-swollen ponds 
and dirt mounds 
rooted with flame-tipped flowers. 
he carries trees like children 
struggling to be set down. 
trees that have lived 
out their lives, 
he cuts and stacks 
like loaves of bread 
which he will feed the fire. 
the green smoke sweetens 
his house. 

the woman sweeps air 
to banish sadness. 
she dusts floors, 
polishes objects 
made of clay and wood. 
in proportion to what is taken 
what is given multiplies-- 
the task of something 
else to clean. 
gleaming appliances 
beg to be smudged, 
breathed upon by small children 
and large animals 
flicking out hope 
as she whirls by, 
flap of tongue, 
scratch of paw, 
sweetly reminding her. 

the man moves earth, 
the woman sweeps air. 
together they pull water 
out of the other, 
pull with the muscular 
ache of the living, 
hauling from the deep 
well of the body 
the rain-swollen, 
the flame-tipped, 
the milk-fed-- 
all that cycles 
through lives moving, 
lives sweeping, water 
circulating between them 
like breath, 
drawn out of leaves by light.


we were very tired, we were very merry--

we had gone back and forth all night on the ferry.

it was bare and bright, and smelled like a stable--

but we looked into a fire, we leaned across a table,

we lay on a hill-top underneath the moon

and the whistles kept blowing, and the dawn came soon. 


we were very tired, we were very merry--

we had gone back and forth all night on the ferry 

and you ate an apple, and i ate a pear, 

from a dozen of each we had bought somewhere 

and the sky went wan, and the wind came cold, 

and the sun rose dripping, a bucketful of gold. 


we were very tired, we were very merry,

we had gone back and forth all night on the ferry.

we hailed, good morrow, mother to a shawl-covered head, 

and bought a morning paper, which neither of us read

and she wept, god bless you for the apples and pears,

and we gave her all our money but our subway fares.


eleven o'clock, and the curtain falls.
the cold wind tears the strands of illusion 
the delicate music is lost
in the blare of home-going crowds
and a midnight paper.

the night has grown martial
it meets us with blows and disaster. 
even the stars have turned shrapnel, 
fixed in silent explosions.
and here at our door 
the moonlight is laid 
like a drawn sword.



once, in the city of kalamazoo,   
the gods went walking, two and two,   
with the friendly phoenix, the stars of orion,   
the speaking pony and singing lion.   
for in kalamazoo in a cottage apart   
lived the girl with the innocent heart. 

thenceforth the city of kalamazoo   
was the envied, intimate chum of the sun.   
he rose from a cave by the principal street.   
the lions sang, the dawn-horns blew,   
and the ponies danced on silver feet.   
he hurled his clouds of love around   
deathless colors of his old heart 
draped the houses and dyed the ground.   
o shrine of the wide young yankee land,   
incense city of kalamazoo,   
that held, in the midnight, the priceless sun   
as a jeweller holds an opal in hand 

from the awkward city of oshkosh came 
love the bully no whip shall tame, 
bringing his gang of sinners bold. 
and i was the least of his oshkosh men 
but none were reticent, none were old. 
and we joined the singing phoenix then, 
and shook the lilies of kalamazoo   
all for one hidden butterfly.   
bulls of glory, in cars of war   
we charged the boulevards, proud to die   
for her ribbon sailing there on high.   
our blood set gutters all aflame,   
where the sun slept without any heat-- 
cold rock till he must rise again.   
she made great poets of wolf-eyed men-- 
the dear queen-bee of kalamazoo,   
with her crystal wings, and her honey heart.   
we fought for her favors a year and a day   
oh, the bones of the dead, the oshkosh dead,   
that were scattered along her pathway red   
and then, in her harum-scarum way,   
she left with a passing traveller-man-- 
with a singing irishman   
went to japan. 

why do the lean hyenas glare 
where the glory of artemis had begun-- 
of atalanta, joan of arc, 
cinderella, becky thatcher, 
and orphant annie, all in one? 
who burned this city of kalamazoo 
till nothing was left but a ribbon or two-- 
one scorched phoenix that mourned in the dew, 
acres of ashes, a junk-man's cart, 
a torn-up letter, a dancing shoe, 
and the bones of the dead, the dead? 
who burned this city of kalamazoo-- 
love-town, troy-town kalamazoo? 

a harum-scarum innocent heart.


a chant for boys with manly voices
every line sung one step deeper than the line preceding
any sky-bird sings,
         ring, ring
any church-chime rings,
         dong ding
any cannon says,
         boom bang
any whirlwind says,
         whing whang
the bell-buoy hums and roars,
         ding dong
and way down deep,
where fishes throng,
by davy jones' big deep?sea door,
shaking the ocean's flowery floor,
his door-bell booms
         dong dong,
         dong dong,
deep, deep down,
         clang boom,
         boom dong.


there's machinery in the butterfly
         there's a mainspring to the bee
there's hydraulics to a daisy,
         and contraptions to a tree.

if we could see the birdie
         that makes the chirping sound
with x-ray, scientific eyes,
    we could see the wheels go round.

and i hope all men 
who think like this 
will soon lie 
underground.


why do you subdue yourself in golds and purples?   
why do you dim yourself with folded silks? 
do you not see that i can buy brocades in any draper's shop,   
and that i am choked in the twilight of all these colors. 
how pale you would be, and startling--   
how quiet 
but your curves would spring upward   
like a clear jet of flung water, 
you would quiver like a shot-up spray of water,   
you would waver, and relapse, and tremble.   
and i too should tremble, 
watching. 

murex-dyes and tinsel-- 
and yet i think i could bear your beauty unshaded.


all day i have watched the purple vine leaves
fall into the water.
and now in the moonlight they still fall,
but each leaf is fringed with silver.


barque of phosphor
 on the palmy beach,
  
 move outward into heaven,
 into the alabasters
 and night blues.
  
 foam and cloud are one.
 sultry moon-monster
 are dissolving.
  
 fill your black hull
 with white moonlight.
  
 there will never be an end
 to this droning of the surf.



i placed a jar in tennessee,   
and round it was, upon a hill.   
it made the slovenly wilderness   
surround that hill. 

the wilderness rose up to it, 
and sprawled around, no longer wild.   
the jar was round upon the ground   
and tall and of a port in air. 

it took dominion everywhere.   
the jar was gray and bare. 
it did not give of bird or bush,   
like nothing else in tennessee.


once more the storm is howling, and half hid   
under this cradle-hood and coverlid   
my child sleeps on. there is no obstacle   
but gregory's wood and one bare hill   
whereby the haystack and roof-levelling wind,   
bred on the atlantic, can be stayed   
and for an hour i have walked and prayed   
because of the great gloom that is in my mind. 

i have walked and prayed for this young child an hour, 
and heard the sea-wind scream upon the tower, 
and under the arches of the bridge, and scream 
in the elms above the flooded stream 
imagining in excited reverie 
that the future years had come   
dancing to a frenzied drum   
out of the murderous innocence of the sea. 

may she be granted beauty, and yet not   
beauty to make a stranger's eye distraught,   
or hers before a looking-glass for such,   
being made beautiful overmuch,   
consider beauty a sufficient end,   
lose natural kindness, and maybe   
the heart-revealing intimacy   
that chooses right, and never find a friend. 

helen, being chosen, found life flat and dull,   
and later had much trouble from a fool   
while that great queen that rose out of the spray,   
being fatherless, could have her way,   
yet chose a bandy-leggd smith for man.   
it's certain that fine women eat   
a crazy salad with their meat   
whereby the horn of plenty is undone. 

in courtesy i'd have her chiefly learned   
hearts are not had as a gift, but hearts are earned   
by those that are not entirely beautiful.   
yet many, that have played the fool 
for beauty's very self, has charm made wise   
and many a poor man that has roved,   
loved and thought himself beloved,   
from a glad kindness cannot take his eyes. 

may she become a flourishing hidden tree,   
that all her thoughts may like the linnet be,   
and have no business but dispensing round   
their magnanimities of sound   
nor but in merriment begin a chase,   
nor but in merriment a quarrel.   
oh, may she live like some green laurel   
rooted in one dear perpetual place. 

my mind, because the minds that i have loved,   
the sort of beauty that i have approved,   
prosper but little, has dried up of late,   
yet knows that to be choked with hate   
may well be of all evil chances chief.   
if there's no hatred in a mind   
assault and battery of the wind   
can never tear the linnet from the leaf. 

an intellectual hatred is the worst,   
so let her think opinions are accursed.   
have i not seen the loveliest woman born 
out of the mouth of plenty's horn,   
because of her opinionated mind   
barter that horn and every good   
by quiet natures understood   
for an old bellows full of angry wind? 

considering that, all hatred driven hence,   
the soul recovers radical innocence   
and learns at last that it is self-delighting, 
self-appeasing, self-affrighting,   
and that its own sweet will is heaven's will,   
she can, though every face should scowl   
and every windy quarter howl   
or every bellows burst, be happy still. 

and may her bridegroom bring her to a house   
where all's accustomed, ceremonious   
for arrogance and hatred are the wares   
peddled in the thoroughfares.   
how but in custom and in ceremony   
are innocence and beauty born?   
ceremony's a name for the rich horn,   
and custom for the spreading laurel tree.


there is the sudden silence of the crowd 

above a player not moving on the field, 

and the silence of the orchid. 


the silence of the falling vase 

before it strikes the oor, 

the silence of the belt when it is not striking the child. 


the stillness of the cup and the water in it, 

the silence of the moon 

and the quiet of the day far from the roar of the sun. 


the silence when i hold you to my chest, 

the silence of the window above us, 

and the silence when you rise and turn away. 


and there is the silence of this morning 

which i have broken with my pen, 

a silence that had piled up all night 


like snow falling in the darkness of the house-- 

the silence before i wrote a word 

and the poorer silence now.


the sea-wash never ends.
the sea-wash repeats, repeats.
only old songs? is that all the sea knows?
             only the old strong songs?
             is that all?
the sea-wash repeats, repeats.



sorrow is my own yard 
where the new grass 
flames as it has flamed 
often before, but not 
with the cold fire 
that closes round me this year. 
thirty-five years 
i lived with my husband. 
the plum tree is white today 
with masses of flowers. 
masses of flowers 
load the cherry branches 
and color some bushes 
yellow and some red, 
but the grief in my heart 
is stronger than they, 
for though they were my joy 
formerly, today i notice them 
and turn away forgetting. 
today my son told me 
that in the meadows, 
at the edge of the heavy woods 
in the distance, he saw 
trees of white flowers. 
i feel that i would like 
to go there 
and fall into those flowers 
and sink into the marsh near them.


i do not know where either of us can turn 
just at first, waking from the sleep of each other. 
i do not know how we can bear 
the river struck by the gold plummet of the moon, 
or many trees shaken together in the darkness. 
we shall wish not to be alone 
and that love were not dispersed and set free-- 
though you defeat me, 
and i be heavy upon you. 

but like earth heaped over the heart 
is love grown perfect. 
like a shell over the beat of life 
is love perfect to the last. 
so let it be the same 
whether we turn to the dark or to the kiss of another 
let us know this for leavetaking, 
that i may not be heavy upon you, 
that you may blind me no more. 



the dark is thrown 
back from the brightness, like hair 
cast over a shoulder. 
i am alone, 

four years older 
like the chairs and the walls 
which i once watched brighten 
with you beside me. i was to waken 
never like this, whatever came or was taken. 

the stalk grows, the year beats on the wind. 
apples come, and the month for their fall. 
the bark spreads, the roots tighten. 
though today be the last 
or tomorrow all, 
you will not mind. 

that i may not remember 
does not matter. 
i shall not be with you again. 
what we knew, even now 
must scatter 
and be ruined, and blow 
like dust in the rain. 

you have been dead a long season 
and have less than desire 
who were lover with lover 
and i have life--that old reason 
to wait for what comes, 
to leave what is over. 



a poem should be palpable and mute   
as a globed fruit, 

dumb 
as old medallions to the thumb, 

silent as the sleeve-worn stone 
of casement ledges where the moss has grown-- 

a poem should be wordless   
as the flight of birds. 

                                        

a poem should be motionless in time   
as the moon climbs, 

leaving, as the moon releases 
twig by twig the night-entangled trees, 

leaving, as the moon behind the winter leaves,   
memory by memory the mind-- 

a poem should be motionless in time   
as the moon climbs. 

                                        

a poem should be equal to 
not true. 

for all the history of grief 
an empty doorway and a maple leaf. 

for love 
the leaning grasses and two lights above the sea-- 

a poem should not mean   
but be. 



farmhouses curl like horns of plenty, hide   
scrawny bare shanks against a barn, or crouch   
empty in the shadow of a mountain. here   
there is no house at all-- 

only the bones of a house, 
lilacs growing beside them, 
roses in clumps between them,   
honeysuckle over 
a gap for a door, a chimney 
mud-chinked, an immense fireplace,   
the skeleton of a pine, 

and gandy dancers working on the rails 
that run not thirty yards from the once door. 

i heard a gandy dancer playing on a jew's harp   
where is now that merry party i remember long ago?   
nelly was a lady ... twice ... old black joe, 
as if he laid his right hand on my shoulder, 
saying, your father lived here long ago, 
your father's father built the house, lies buried   
under the pine-- 
                         sing nelly was a lady   
... blue juniata ... old black joe 

for sometimes a familiar music hammers 
like blood against the eardrums, paints a mist   
across the eyes, as if the smells of lilacs,   
moss roses, and the past became a music   
made visible, a monument of air.


these lovers' inklings which our loves enmesh,   
lost to the cunning and dimensional eye,   
though tenemented in the selves we see,   
not more perforce than azure to the sky,   
were necromancy-juggled to the flesh,   
and startled from no daylight you or me. 

for trance and silvemess those moons commend,   
which blanch the warm life silver-pale or look   
what ghostly portent mist distorts from slight   
clay shapes the willows that the waters took   
liquid and brightened in the waters bend,   
and we, in love's reflex, seemed loved of right. 

then no more think to net forthwith love's thing,   
but cast for it by spirit sleight-of-hand 
then only in the slant glass contemplate,   
where lineament outstripping line is scanned,   
then on the perplexed text leave pondering,   
love's proverb is set down transliterate.


i met a man in south street, tall-- 
a nervous shark tooth swung on his chain.   
his eyes pressed through green glass   
--green glasses, or bar lights made them   
so-- 
      shine-- 
                green-- 
                           eyes-- 
stepped out--forgot to look at you 
or left you several blocks away-- 

in the nickel-in-the-slot piano jogged 
stamboul nights--weaving somebody's nickel--sang-- 

      o stamboul rose--dreams weave the rose 

            murmurs of leviathan he spoke,   
            and rum was plato in our heads . . . 

it's s.s. ala--antwerp--now remember kid   
to put me out at three she sails on time.   
i'm not much good at time any more keep 
weakeyed watches sometimes snooze-- his bony hands   
got to beating time . . . a whaler once-- 
i ought to keep time and get over it--i'm a   
democrat--i know what time it is--no   
i don't want to know what time it is--that   
damned white arctic killed my time . . .  

      o stamboul rose--drums weave-- 

i ran a donkey engine down there on the canal   
in panama--got tired of that-- 
then yucatan selling kitchenware--beads-- 
have you seen popocatepetl--birdless mouth   
with ashes sifting down--? 
                                          and then the coast again . . .  

      rose of stamboul o coral queen-- 
      teased remnants of the skeletons of cities-- 
      and galleries, galleries of watergutted lava   
      snarling stone--green--drums--drown-- 

sing 
--that spiracle he shot a finger out the door . . .   
o life's a geyser--beautiful--my lungs-- 
no--i can't live on land-- 

i saw the frontiers gleaming of his mind 
or are there frontiers--running sands sometimes   
running sands--somewhere--sands running . . . 
or they may start some white machine that sings.   
then you may laugh and dance the axletree-- 
steel--silver--kick the traces--and know-- 

      atlantis rose drums wreathe the rose,   
      the star floats burning in a gulf of tears   
      and sleep another thousand-- 

                                              interminably 
long since somebody's nickel--stopped-- 
playing-- 

a wind worried those wicker-neat lapels, the   
swinging summer entrances to cooler hells . . .   
outside a wharf truck nearly ran him down   
--he lunged up bowery way while the dawn 
was putting the statue of liberty out--that   
torch of hers you know-- 

i started walking home across the bridge . . . 

                  .         .         .         .         .

those bright designs the trade winds drive . . .

      fins whip the breeze around japan 

bright skysails ticketing the line, wink round the horn

                                       pennants, parabolas--

o carib isle 

the tarantula rattling at the lily's foot 
across the feet of the dead, laid in white sand   
near the coral beach--nor zigzag fiddle crabs   
side-stilting from the path that shift, subvert 
and anagrammatize your name--no, nothing here   
below the palsy that one eucalyptus lifts   
in wrinkled shadows--mourns. 

                                        and yet suppose 
i count these nacreous frames of tropic death,   
brutal necklaces of shells around each grave   
squared off so carefully. then 

to the white sand i may speak a name, fertile 
albeit in a stranger tongue. tree names, flower names   
deliberate, gainsay death's brittle crypt. meanwhile   
the wind that knots itself in one great death-- 
coils and withdraws. so syllables want breath. 

but where is the captain of this doubloon isle 
without a turnstile? who but catchword crabs 
patrols the dry groins of the underbrush? 
what man, or what 
is commissioner of mildew throughout the ambushed senses?   
his carib mathematics web the eyes' baked lenses 

under the poinciana, of a noon or afternoon 
let fiery blossoms clot the light, render my ghost   
sieved upward, white and black along the air   
until it meets the blue's comedian host. 

let not the pilgrim see himself again 
for slow evisceration bound like those huge terrapin   
each daybreak on the wharf, their brine-caked eyes 
--spiked, overturned such thunder in their strain   
and clenched beaks coughing for the surge again 

slagged of the hurricane--i, cast within its flow,   
congeal by afternoons here, satin and vacant. 
you have given me the shell, satan,--carbonic amulet   
sere of the sun exploded in the sea.


i 

he whom we anatomized 
whose words we gathered as pleasant flowers 
and thought on his wit and how neatly he described things'   
speaks 
to us, hatching marrow, 
broody all night over the bones of a deadman. 

my tongue is a curve in the ear. vision is lies. 
we saw is so and it was not so, 
the emperor with the golden hands, the virgin in blue.   
--a blazing parchment, 
matthew paris his kings in blue and gold. 

it was not so, 
scratched on black by god knows who,   
by god, by god knows who. 

in the dark in fetters 
on bended elbows i supported my weak back 
hulloing to muffled walls blank again 
unresonant. it was gone, is silent, is always silent. 
my soundbox lacks sonority. all but inaudible 
i stammer to my ear 
naked speech naked beggar both blind and cold 
wrap it for my sake in paisley shawls and bright soft fabric,   
wrap it in curves and cover it with sleek lank hair. 

what trumpets? what bright hands? fetters, it was the emperor   
with magic in darkness, i unforewained. 
the golden hands are not in averrhoes, 
eyes lie and this swine's fare bread and water 
makes my head wuzz. have pity, have pity on me 

to the right was darkness and to the left hardness   
below hardness darkness above 
at the feet darkness at the head partial hardness   
with equal intervals without 
to the left moaning and beyond a scurry.   
in those days rode the good lorraine 
whom english burned at rouen, 
the day's bones whitening in centuries' dust. 

then he saw his ghosts glitter with golden hands,   
the emperor sliding up and up from his tomb   
alongside charles. these things are not obliterate.   
white gobs spitten for mockery 
and i too shall have cy gist, written over me. 

remember, imbeciles and wits,   
sots and ascetics, fair and foul,   
young girls with little tender tits,   
that death is written over all. 

worn hides that scarcely clothe the soul   
they are so rotten, old and thin, 
or firm and soft and warm and full--   
fellmonger death gets every skin. 

all that is piteous, all that's fair,   
all that is fat and scant of breath,   
elisha's baldness, helen's hair,   
is death's collateral 

three score and ten years after sight   
of this pay me your pulse and breath   
value received. and who dare cite,   
as we forgive our debtors, death? 

abelard and eloise, 
henry the fowler, charlemagne,   
gene, lopokova, all these 
die, die in pain. 

and general grant and general lee,   
patti and florence nightingale,   
like tyro and antiope 
drift among ghosts in hell, 

know nothing, are nothing, save a fume   
driving across a mind 
preoccupied with this our doom   
is, to be sifted by the wind, 

heaped up, smoothed down like silly sands.   
we are less permanent than thought. 
the emperor with the golden hands 

is still a word, a tint, a tone, 
insubstantial-glorious, 
when we ourselves are dead and gone   
and the green grass growing over us.

let his days be few and let 
his bishoprick pass to another, 
for he fed me on carrion and on a dry crust,   
mouldy bread that his dogs had vomited, 
i lying on my back in the dark place, in the grave,   
fettered to a post in the damp cellarage. 
            whereinall we differ not. but they have swept the floor,   
there are no dancers, no somersaulters now,   
only bricks and bleak black cement and bricks,   
only the military tread and the snap of the locks. 
            mine was a threeplank bed whereon   
i lay and cursed the weary sun. 
they took away the prison clothes 
and on the frosty nights i froze. 
i had a bible where i read 
that jesus came to raise the dead-- 
i kept myself from going mad 
by singing an old bawdy ballad 
and birds sang on my windowsill 
and tortured me till i was ill, 
but archipiada came to me 
and comforted my cold body 
and circe excellent utterer of her mind 
lay with me in that dungeon for a year 
making a silk purse from an old sow's ear 
till ronsard put a thimble on her tongue. 
    whereinall we differ not. but they have named all the stars,   
trodden down the scrub of the desert, run the white moon to a schedule,   
joshua's serf whose beauty drove men mad. 
they have melted the snows from erebus, weighed the clouds,   
hunted down the white bear, hunted the whale the seal the kangaroo,   
they have set private enquiry agents onto archipiada 
what is your name? your maiden name? 
go in there to be searched. i suspect it is not your true name.   
distinguishing marks if any? o anthropometrics 
now the thumbprints for filing. 
colour of hair? of eyes? of hands? o bertillon 
how many golden prints on the smudgy page? 
homer? adest. dante? adest. 
adsunt omnes, omnes et 
villon. 
villon? 
blacked by the sun, washed by the rain, 
hither and thither scurrying as the wind varies.

under the olive trees   
walking alone 
on the green terraces   
very seldom 
over the sea seldom 
where it ravelled and spun 
blue tapestries white and green 
gravecloths of men   
romans and modern men   
and the men of the sea 
who have neither nation nor time 
on the mountains seldom   
the white mountains beyond 
or the brown mountains between 
and their drifting echoes 
in the clouds and over the sea 
in shrines on their ridges 
the goddess of the country 
silverplated in silk and embroidery 
with offerings of pictures 
little ships and arms   
below me the ports   
with naked breasts   
shipless spoiled sacked   
because of the beauty of helen 

precision clarifying vagueness 
boundary to a wilderness 
of detail chisel voice 
smoothing the flanks of noise 
catalytic making whisper and whisper   
run together like two drops of quicksilver   
factor that resolves 
                        unnoted harmonies

                        stuff that clings 
to frigid limbs 
                        more marble hard 
than girls imagined by mantegna ...   

the sea has no renewal, no forgetting,   
no variety of death, 
is silent with the silence of a single note. 

how can i sing with my love in my bosom?   
unclean, immature and unseasonable salmon.


the adolescent night, breath of the town,   
porchswings and whispers, maple leaves unseen   
deploying moonlight quieter than a man dead   
after the locust's song. these homes were mine   
and are not now forever, these on the steps   
children i think removed to many places, 
lost among hushed years, and so strangely known. 

this business is well ended. if in the dark 
the firefly made his gleam and sank therefrom,   
yet someone's hand would have him, the wet grass   
bed him no more. from corners of the lawn 
the dusk-white dresses flutter and are past. 
before our bed time there were things to say,   
remembering tree-bark, crickets, and the first star 

after, and as the sullenness of time 
went on from summer, here in a land alien   
made i my perfect fears and flower of thought   
sleep being no longer swift in the arms of pain,   
revisitations are convenient with a cough,   
and there is something i would say again   
if i had not forever, if there were time.


i woke up this mornin'   
'bout half-past three.   
all the womens in town   
was gathered round me. 

sweet gals was a-moanin',   
sylvester's gonna die 
and a hundred pretty mamas   
bowed their heads to cry. 

i woke up little later 
'bout half-past fo', 
the doctor n' undertaker's   
both at ma do'. 

black gals was a-beggin', 
you can't leave us here   
brown-skins cryin', daddy   
honey baby don't go, dear 

but i felt ma time's a-comin',   
and i know'd i's dyin' fast. 
i seed the river jerden 
a-creepin' muddy past-- 
but i's still sweet papa 'vester,   
yes, sir long as life do last 

so i hollers, com'ere, babies,   
fo' to love yo' daddy right 
and i reaches up to hug 'em-- 
when the lawd put out the light. 

then everything was darkness   
in a great ... big ... night.

kamo-no-chomei, born at kamo , died at toyama on mount hino, th june   
swirl sleeping in the waterfall 
on motionless pools scum appearing   
                     disappearing 

eaves formal on the zenith,   
lofty city kyoto, 
wealthy, without antiquities 

housebreakers clamber about,   
builders raising floor upon floor   
at the corner sites, replacing   
gardens by bungalows. 

in the town where i was known   
the young men stare at me.   
a few faces i know remain. 

whence comes man at his birth? or where   
does death lead him? whom do you mourn?   
whose steps wake your delight? 
dewy hibiscus dries though dew 
outlast the petals. 

i have been noting events forty years. 

on the twentyseventh may eleven hundred   
and seventyseven, eight p.m., fire broke out   
at the corner of tomi and higuchi streets.   
in a night 
palace, ministries, university, parliament   
were destroyed. as the wind veered 
flames spread out in the shape of an open fan.   
tongues torn by gusts stretched and leapt. 
in the sky clouds of cinders lit red with the blaze. 
some choked, some burned, some barely escaped.   
sixteen great officials lost houses and 
very many poor. a third of the city burned   
several thousands died and of beasts, 
limitless numbers. 

men are fools to invest in real estate. 

three years less three days later a wind 
starting near the outer boulevard 
broke a path a quarter mile across 
to sixth avenue. 
not a house stood. some were felled whole, 
some in splinters some had left 
great beams upright in the ground 
and round about 
lay rooves scattered where the wind flung them. 
flocks of furniture in the air, 
everything flat fluttered like dead leaves. 
a dust like fog or smoke, 
you could hear nothing for the roar, 
                      bufera infernal 
lamed some, wounded some.   
this cyclone turned southwest. 

massacre without cause.   

portent? 

the same year thunderbolted change of capital,   
fixed here, kyoto, for ages. 
nothing compelled the change nor was it an easy matter 
but the grumbling was disproportionate.   
we moved, those with jobs 
or wanting jobs or hangers on of the rest,   
in haste haste fretting to be the first.   
rooftrees overhanging empty rooms   
dismounted floating down the river.   
the soil returned to heath. 

i visited the new site narrow and too uneven, 
cliffs and marshes, deafening shores, perpetual strong winds 
the palace a logcabin dumped amongst the hills   
yet not altogether inelegant. 
there was no flat place for houses, many vacant lots,   
the former capital wrecked, the new a camp, 
and thoughts like clouds changing, frayed by a breath   
peasants bewailing lost land, newcomers aghast at prices.   
no one in uniform the crowds 
resembled demobilized conscripts. 

there were murmurs. time defined them.   
in the winter the decree was rescinded,   
we returned to kyoto 
but the houses were gone and none 
could afford to rebuild them. 

i have heard of a time when kings beneath bark rooves   
watched chimneys. 
when smoke was scarce, taxes were remitted. 

to appreciate present conditions   
collate them with those of antiquity. 

drought, floods, and a dearth. two fruitless autumns.   
empty markets, swarms of beggars. jewels 
sold for a handful of rice. dead stank 
on the curb, lay so thick on 
riverside drive a car couldnt pass. 
the pest bred. 
that winter my fuel was the walls of my own house. 

fathers fed their children and died, 
babies died sucking the dead. 
the priest hoshi went about marking their foreheads   
a, amida, their requiem 
he counted them in the east end in the last two months,   
fortythree thousand a's. 

crack, rush, ye mountains, bury your rills 
spread your green glass, ocean, over the meadows 
scream, avalanche, boulders amok, strangle the dale   
o ships in the sea's power, o horses 
on shifting roads, in the earth's power, without hoofhold 
this is the earthquake, this was   
the great earthquake of genryaku 

the chapel fell, the abbey, the minster and the small shrines   
fell, their dust rose and a thunder of houses falling.   
o to be birds and fly or dragons and ride on a cloud   
the earthquake, the great earthquake of genryaku 

a child building a mud house against a high wall   
i saw him crushed suddenly, his eyes hung   
from their orbits like two tassels. 
his father howled shamelessly--an officer.   
i was not abashed at his crying. 

such shocks continued three weeks then lessening,   
but still a score daily as big as an average earthquake   
then fewer, alternate days, a tertian ague of tremors.   
there is no record of any greater. 
it caused a religious revival. 
months ...   
years ...   
........... 
nobody mentions it now. 

this is the unstable world and   
we in it unstable and our houses. 

a poor man living amongst the rich 
gives no rowdy parties, doesnt sing. 
dare he keep his child at home, keep a dog?   
he dare not pity himself above a whimper. 

but he visits, he flatters, he is put in his place,   
he remembers the patch on his trousers.   
his wife and sons despise him for being poor.   
he has no peace. 

if he lives in an alley of rotting frame houses 
he dreads a fire. 
if he commutes he loses his time 
and leaves his house daily to be plundered by gunmen. 
the bureaucrats are avaricious. 
he who has no relatives in the inland revenue,   
poor devil 

whoever helps him enslaves him 
and follows him crying out gratitude   
if he wants success he is wretched.   
if he doesnt he passes for mad. 

where shall i settle, what trade choose   
that the mind may practise, the body rest? 

my grandmother left me a house 
but i was always away 
for my health and because i was alone there. 
when i was thirty i couldnt stand it any longer,   
i built a house to suit myself 
one bamboo room, you would have thought it a cartshed,   
poor shelter from snow or wind. 
it stood on the flood plain. and that quarter 
is also flooded with gangsters. 

one generation 
i saddened myself with idealistic philosophies, 
but before i was fifty 
i perceived there was no time to lose, 
left home and conversation. 
among the cloudy mountains of ohara 
spring and autumn, spring and autumn, spring and autumn,   
emptier than ever. 

the dew evaporates from my sixty years,   
i have built my last house, or hovel,   
a hunter's bivouac, an old 
silkworm's cocoon 
ten feet by ten, seven high and i, 
reckoning it a lodging not a dwelling,   
omitted the usual foundation ceremony. 

i have filled the frames with clay,   
set hinges at the corners 
easy to take it down and carry it away 
when i get bored with this place. 
two barrowloads of junk 
and the cost of a man to shove the barrow,   
no trouble at all. 

since i have trodden hino mountain 
noon has beaten through the awning 
over my bamboo balcony, evening 
shone on amida. 
i have shelved my books above the window, 
lute and mandolin near at hand, 
piled bracken and a little straw for bedding, 
a smooth desk where the light falls, stove for bramblewood.   
i have gathered stones, fitted 
stones for a cistern, laid bamboo 
pipes. no woodstack, 
wood enough in the thicket. 

toyama, snug in the creepers 
toyama, deep in the dense gully, open   
westward whence the dead ride out of eden   
squatting on blue clouds of wistaria. 
its scent drifts west to amida. 

summer? cuckoo's follow, follow--to   
harvest purgatory hill 
fall? the nightgrasshopper will 
shrill fickle life 
snow will thicken on the doorstep, 
melt like a drift of sins. 
no friend to break silence, 
no one will be shocked if i neglect the rite.   
there's a lent of commandments kept   
where there's no way to break them. 

a ripple of white water after a boat,   
shining water after the boats mansami saw   
rowing at daybreak 
at okinoya. 
between the maple leaf and the caneflower   
murmurs the afternoon--po lo-tien   
saying goodbye on the verge of jinyo river.   
i am playing scales on my mandolin. 
be limber, my fingers, i am going to play autumn wind 
to the pines, i am going to play hastening brook 
to the water. i am no player 
but there's nobody listening, 
i do it for my own amusement. 

sixteen and sixty, i and the gamekeeper's boy,   
one zest and equal, chewing tsubana buds,   
one zest and equal, persimmon, pricklypear,   
ears of sweetcorn pilfered from valley farm. 

the view from the summit sky bent over kyoto,   
picnic villages, fushimi and toba 
a very economical way of enjoying yourself.   
thought runs along the crest, climbs sumiyama   
beyond kasatori it visits the great church, 
goes on pilgrimage to ishiyama no need to foot it   
or the graves of poets, of semimaru who said 
                      somehow or other 
                      we scuttle through a lifetime.   
                      somehow or other 
                      neither palace nor straw-hut   
                      is quite satisfactory. 

not emptyhanded, with cherryblossom, with red maple   
as the season gives it to decorate my buddha   
or offer a sprig at a time to chancecomers, home 

a fine moonlit night, 
i sit at the window with a headful of old verses. 

whenever a monkey howls there are tears on my cuff. 

those are fireflies that seem   
the fishermen's lights   
off maki island. 

a shower at dawn   
sings 
like the hillbreeze in the leaves. 

at the pheasant's chirr i recall 
my father and mother uncertainly. 

i rake my ashes. 
                         chattering fire, 
soon kindled, soon burned out,   
fit wife for an old man 

neither closed in one landscape   
nor in one season 
the mind moving in illimitable   
recollection. 

i came here for a month   
five years ago. 
there's moss on the roof. 

and i hear soanso's dead   
back in kyoto. 
i have as much room as i need. 

i know myself and mankind.   
........ 
i dont want to be bothered. 

you will make me editor   
of the imperial anthology?   
i dont want to be bothered. 

you build for your wife, children,   
cousins and cousins' cousins.   
you want a house to entertain in. 

a man like me can have neither servants nor friends   
in the present state of society. 
if i did not build for myself 
for whom should i build? 

friends fancy a rich man's riches,   
friends suck up to a man in high office. 
if you keep straight you will have no friends 
but catgut and blossom in season. 

servants weigh out their devotion 
in proportion to their perquisites   
what do they care for peace and quiet?   
there are more pickings in town. 




if on your grandmother's birthday you burn a candle   
to honor her memory, you might think of burning an extra   
to honor the memory of someone who never met her,   
a man who may have come to the town she lived in   
looking for work and never found it.   
picture him taking a stroll one morning,   
after a month of grief with the want ads,   
to refresh himself in the park before moving on.   
suppose he notices on the gravel path the shards   
of a green glass bottle that your grandmother,   
then still a girl, will be destined to step on   
when she wanders barefoot away from her school picnic   
if he doesn't stoop down and scoop the mess up   
with the want-ad section and carry it to a trash can.   

for you to burn a candle for him   
you needn't suppose the cut would be a deep one,   
just deep enough to keep her at home   
the night of the hay ride when she meets helen,   
who is soon to become her dearest friend,   
whose brother george, thirty years later,   
helps your grandfather with a loan so his shoe store   
doesn't go under in the great depression   
and his son, your father, is able to stay in school   
where his love of learning is fanned into flames,   
a love he labors, later, to kindle in you.   

how grateful you are for your father's efforts   
is shown by the candles you've burned for him.   
but today, for a change, why not a candle   
for the man whose name is unknown to you?   
take a moment to wonder whether he died at home   
with friends and family or alone on the road,   
on the look-out for no one to sit at his bedside   
and hold his hand, the very hand   
it's time for you to imagine holding.


sure, she says, why not,   
we buy the ground lamb from the market   
we buy parsley, fresh tomatoes, garlic   
we cut, press, dice, mix   

make the yeasty dough   
the night before, kneading it   
until our knuckles feel the hardness   
of river beds or rocks in the desert   

we tell tante lola to come   
with her rolling pins we tell   
zaven and maroush, hagop and arpin   
to bring their baking sheets   

we sprinkle the flour on the kitchen table   
and it is snowing on ararat   
we sprinkle the flour and the memory   
of winter is in our eyes   

we roll the dough out   
into small circles   
pale moons over   
every empty village   

kevork is standing on a chair   
and singing   
o my armenian girl  
my spirit longs to be nearer  

nevrig is warming the oven   
and a dry desert breeze   
is skimming over the rooftops   
toward the sea   

we are spreading the lahma 
on the ajoun with our fingers   
whispering into it the histories   
of those who have none   

we are baking them   
under the heat of the sun   
the dough crispening   
so thin and delicate   

you would swear   
it is valuable parchment   
we are taking out   
and rolling up in our hands   

and eating and tasting again   
everything that has already   
been written   
into the body.


the land is full of what was lost. what's hidden 
rises to the surface after rain 
in new-ploughed fields, and fields stubbled again 
the clay shards, foot and lip, that heaped the midden, 

and here and there a blade or flakes of blade, 
a patient art, knapped from a core of flint, 
most broken, few as coins new from the mint, 
perfect, shot through time as through a glade. 

you cannot help but think how they were lost 
the quarry, fletched shaft in its flank, the blood 
whose trail soon vanished in the antlered wood, 
not just the meat, but what the weapon cost-- 

o hapless hunter, though your aim was true-- 
the wounded hart, spooked, fleeting in its fear-- 
and the sharpness honed with longing, year by year 
buried deeper, found someday, but not by you.


the relationship between   
       blackbird and fencepost, between   
the cow and its egret, the field   
       and wildflowers overrunning the field--   
so little depends upon their trust.   

       here, in god we trust   
to keep our cash and thoughts in line--   
       in the sky, an unexplained white line   
could be the first of many omens.   
       but this is no country for omens,   

the line as chalky as the moon,   
       bleak and useless as the moon   
now rising like a breath of cold air . . .   
       there is gullibility in the air.


in the beginning, a word, move 
then a plan and then the reasons, 
which i do not remember exactly. 
i remember clearly only the clothes 
we were given for the journey 
and the last, silent meal we ate. 
we left the place as lightly as we 
had come, so many years before. 

from a sunlit state of innocence 
where white sheets were hung 
to dry like clouds over paradise 
from eucalyptus-scented earth, 
a red house with a yard swung 
between dreaming hills, pillaged 
by raccoons, framed with lilies 
like trumpets of the archangels, 

we moved into history, a river 
slowed by many bends, a village 
of peacocks with a hundred eyes 
a low house among fields, with 
an iron stove, a winter shrine 
a fireplace blackened by time, 
the fragile bones of a sparrow 
frozen in the shape of its flight. 

when father played his trombone 
in the attic, schoolchildren tittered 
in the street. in the late afternoon, 
the cows assembled at the gate, 
witless, waiting for a farmer's son. 
home, the children conjugated 
verbs, found variables and drew 
diagrams of the human heart. 

evenings, the round kitchen table, 
lit by a low dutch lamp, summoned 
poets, players, horsethieves, to glasses 
of jenever. an incense of gossip rose 
slowly, blackening the walls. outside, 
horses pawed the darkness, breathing 
delicate feathers of ice. we courted 
the favors of spiders, mice and moles. 

our words grew small and porous as 
fossiled bones, our gestures groaned 
with the cold. the will-less world of 
water, wood and stone taught us when 
to yield. when it came time to move 
along again, we were four strangers 
waving at each other, in slow motion, 
across a deafening expanse of ocean.


the dance shoes, seduction 
and coercion, owned by male feet, 
roam floors that beg for chandeliers. 
in search of flat-footed beauty 

and a bed, where ever they might be, 
the handsome conversation attracts 
female followers trading on the smiles 
of curves. the next steps are dizzying 

and leave dresses dipped and hung over 
with a purse and heart opened at 
their tops. the wallflowers can't say 
when the tango with the rag doll began, 

but witnesses toasted a conga line 
of would-be brides that transcend 
a retirement community in florida, 
each giving up their precious moments 

on earth to fandango's flimflam.


i hope you'll pardon the informality   
of this letter, postmarked olympia   
greece, not washington, its task not simple   
crossing lines you've crossed, time, mortality,   
to find you, who spent a lifetime crossing lines   
out, twisting, polishing them to shine   

cool and lustrous as the statue i fell in   
love with yesterday. i'm sure you saw him   
too, that perfect hermes by praxitelis,   
full lips, hips contrapposto. i wished to draw him   
down, latter-day pygmalion, and embrace   
him. or barring eros and the guards i'd trace   

his face, the supple muscle of the marble.   
i had a student who resembled him--   
yes, angelos--arrogant and beautiful.   
i never touched him though he touches me in dreams.   
eros dangles his perfection in our faces   
like one-armed hermes with his promise of the grapes.   

i was certain i'd dream of him last night.   
instead i dreamed another in the growing chain   
of others with whom it ended not quite   
right. but the thirst was perfect, if its price pain   
and shattered crystal, spilling wine, all part   
and parcel of our imperfect lives. then art   

startles out of heartache, marble or page.   
you learned this long ago. now i too see   
the wildest things require the strongest cages,   
the panther's double bars, or the seeds,   
bloodysweet and bitter, in the pomegranate's   
rind. love held tight in a sonnet.


it is not poetry you fear, but poets, 
their indelible brand 
of words. how will your daughter 
escape the mark men hanged 
young women for in salem? 
i am nothing more than a teacher, 
like you. see, i have removed 
my shoes and socks. i am rolling 
my trousers above my ankles. 
no cloven hooves. long feet and toes 
like you and your beautiful daughter. 

it is language that has won 
her over, earth-bound words 
walking orderly across the page 
like children holding to 
the rope attached to your wrist, 
teacher and students 
traversing the noisy street 
at the crosswalk, with the light 
of your fingers composing 
the line your children read, 
each syllable's afterimage trailing 
your quick passage of hands 
conducting the boys and girls 
safely from one curb to the other.


doors opened and shut,   
the director shouted orders   
through a bullhorn,   
or babbled just   
                              out of the frame.   
a carpenter hammered flats nearby   
for the next production.   
all of this, and more,   
while the actors blocked it out,   
already living   
in that small square of light   
where silence reigned   
like a tiny theatre for the deaf.   

now, almost a century later,   
it's peaceful, far   
from the center of action,   
the last voice on the street   
reduced to a whisper,   
                              then gone.   
not even birdsong   
as evening's opening credits   
begin to roll.   

only the film,   
shimmering out of a disc   
thinner than sound,   
characters moving   
like fish in their gray element--   
less than fish--   
not a hiss, not a bubble,   
not even a cry   
from that dim world of silence   
doubled by time.


forgiving the living is hard 
enough, shrugging away all the wounds 
delivered with kisses and curses, 
the thousand and one petty slights 
that bled me to an albino shade, 
that shadow me even in dreams. 

but the dead are altogether 
another matter, not easily to be 
enlightened and quite beyond regretting 
anything as far as we can tell 
and most likely indifferent to 
our common currency of tears. 

and so it is that pissing on your grave 
doesn't please me as much as it ought to. 
now that you have passed beyond 
all blaming and shaming, what can i do 
but rise and proclaim sincere admiration 
when my turn comes around to speak?


they grow up together 
but they aren't even fraternal 

twins, they quarrel a lot 
about where to go and what 

to do, the body complains 
about having to carry 

the soul everywhere as if 
it were some helpless cripple, 

and the soul snipes that it can go 
places the body never dreamed of, 

then they quarrel over which one of them 
does the dreaming, but the truth is, 

they can't live without each other and 
they both know it, anima, animosity, 

the diaphragm pumps like a bellows 
and the soul pulls out all the stops-- 

sings at the top of its lungs, laughs 
at its little jokes, it would like 

to think it has the upper hand 
and can leave whenever it wants-- 

but only as long as it knows 
the door will be unlocked 

when it sneaks back home before 
the sun comes up, and when the body 

says where have you been, the soul 
says, with a smirk, i was at the end 

of my tether, and it was, like a diver 
on the ocean floor or an astronaut 

admiring the view from outside 
the mother ship, and like them 

it would be lost without its air 
supply and protective clothing, 

the body knows that and begins 
to hum, i get along without you 

very well, and   the soul says, listen 
to that, you can't sing worth a lick 

without me, they'll go on bickering 
like this until death do them part-- 

and then, even if the soul seems to float 
above the body for a moment, 

like a flame above a candle, pinch 
the wick and it disappears.


a reflection on my students
they are so beautiful, and so very young 
they seem almost to glitter with perfection, 
these creatures that i briefly move among. 

i never get to stay with them for long, 
but even so, i view them with affection 
they are so beautiful, and so very young. 

poised or clumsy, placid or high-strung, 
they're expert in the art of   introspection, 
these creatures that i briefly move among-- 

and if their words don't quite trip   off the tongue 
consistently, with just the right inflection, 
they remain beautiful. and very young. 

still, i have to tell myself it's   wrong 
to think of them as anything but fiction, 
these creatures that i briefly move   among-- 

because, like me, they're traveling   headlong 
in that familiar, vertical direction 
that coarsens beautiful, blackmails young-- 
the two delusions we all move among.


surprised by a frill of white flower 
where i'd never planted an eye, 
i decided to fence it with sticks 

and let the renegade live 
in undoctored soil where the garden 
gave way to volunteer poplars 

and acidic white pine. why not? 
after all, away from the tribe, 
in clay where beetles drill 

and weeds emerge inspired, 
it might grow eccentric, proliferate 
and thrive. 
                when autumn air 

said disinter, to fill the bin 
for winter, i troweled under 
and pulled the stem 

until a rabble of rough spuds 
red as etruscan urns emerged 
as if to prove 

that whatever urge drove 
the rogue to sow itself and strive 
beyond all cultivation 

might offer a vital lesson 
to any apostate instinct 
aspiring to survive.


we gave our dogs a button to sniff,   
or a tissue, and they bounded off   
confident in their training,   
in the power of their senses   
to recreate the body,   

but after eighteen hours in rubble   
where even steel was pulverized   
they curled on themselves   
and stared up at us   
and in their soft huge eyes   
we saw mirrored the longing for death   

then we had to beg a stranger   
to be a victim and crouch   
behind a girder, and let the dogs   
discover him and tug him   
proudly, with suppressed yaps,   
back to command and the rows   
of empty triage tables.   

but who will hide from us?   
who will keep digging for us   
here in the cloud of ashes?


right after the bomb, even before the ceiling 
   and walls and floor are rearranging 
      you and themselves into a different world, 
you must hold still, must wait for them 
   to settle down in unpredictable ways, 
      to bring their wars, shuddering, 
to an end, and only then should you begin 
   numbly to feel what freedom may be left 
      to your feet or knees, to your elbows 
or clenched fingers. where you used to walk 
   or lean or lie down or fix your attention 
      at a whim or stomp your foot 
or slump in a chair, you'll find a new 
   architecturally unsound floor-plan 
      to contend with, if you can move 
at all. now you may remember others 
   who were somewhere near you before 
      this breakdown of circumstances. caught by surprise 
like you, they may be waiting separately 
   at their own levels, inside their own portions 
      of your incoherent flat. they may be thinking 
of you, as you are of them, and wondering 
   whether some common passageway, no matter 
      how crooked or narrow, might still exist 
between you, through which you might share the absence 
   of food and water and the cold comfort 
      of daylight. they may be expecting you 
to arrive at any moment, to crawl through dust 
   and fire to their rescue as they find their bodies 
      growing more stiff, assuming even more 
unusual attitudes at every turn 
   of a second hand, at every sound 
      of a bell or an alarm, at every pounding 
of a door or a heart, so if you can't reach them 
   now and they can't reach you, remember, please 
      remember, whatever you say, 
whatever you hear or keep to yourself, whatever 
   you scream or whisper, will need to make 
      some kind of sense, perhaps for days and days.


in the beginning we could hear their swords cutting jewels 
from the protected orchard while our children heard fine teeth 
dragging along empty granary floors. between us and them 
stands the great wound, swallowing all tears, all voices. 

transfixed or transformed by this pain? we never know because 
who can slip through the gate without throwing a shadow 
toward both the past and present? fire, flood, famine-- 
all we've wished upon them a thousand times, still they inch 

back and taunt us with their persistence. we track them down 
to a quick end. more come. and the old memories grow new. 
the future seems already written with a pen of iron. the book 
unreadable, immense. the enemy has become our masterpiece.


d


					
					there will be no deafening noise. no hornblow of thunder. 
 the small plants of the earth will not tremble on the hillside as grace is prepared. 
 the sky will neither drown us in its plenty, nor the ground crack and consume feet in its hunger. 
 no, bodies will not, in their last rags of flesh, creep from under the earth, and with breath once torn from them, choke and expel the old mud of the world. 
 adam and eve, incredulous, will not embrace again in their poverty, not knowing whether to shield themselves, or to emerge shameless from the past's shadow, astonished to again greet terra firma. 
 the book of the world, encrusted with deep-sea pearls and the blood of the lamb, will not open up its pages in which all deeds have been inscribed. 
 and the totality of history will not roll back together, all events fusing, once and for all, into the great blazing sphere of time. 
 none will sit on the right hand. there will be no right hand. 
 and the figure of sorrow and grace, with his staff upright, its purple pennant caught in that final wind, will not be there to greet us, with the mercy of justice in his eyes. 
 no, never judgment. just the abyss into which all acts are thrown down, and the terrible white silence in which judgment either endures or burns.
				

 

i imagined the atmosphere would be clear, 

shot with pristine light, 

not this sulphurous haze, 

the air ionized as before a thunderstorm. 


many have pictured a river here, 

but no one mentioned all the boats, 

their benches crowded with naked passengers, 

each bent over a writing tablet. 


i knew i would not always be a child 

with a model train and a model tunnel, 

and i knew i would not live forever, 

jumping all day through the hoop of myself. 


i had heard about the journey to the other side 

and the clink of the final coin 

in the leather purse of the man holding the oar, 

but how could anyone have guessed 


that as soon as we arrived 

we would be asked to describe this place 

and to include as much detail as possible-- 

not just the water, he insists, 


rather the oily, fathomless, rat-happy water, 

not simply the shackles, but the rusty, 

iron, ankle-shredding shackles-- 

and that our next assignment would be 


to jot down, off the tops of our heads, 

our thoughts and feelings about being dead, 

not really an assignment, 

the man rotating the oar keeps telling us-- 


think of it more as an exercise, he groans, 

think of writing as a process, 

a never-ending, infernal process, 

and now the boats have become jammed together, 


bow against stern, stern locked to bow, 

and not a thing is moving, only our diligent pens.






this sweater is made from only the finest, softest underhairs of the mongolian camel.
fancy-schmancy, my father would have said,   
whose snazziest sweater was still a declass   
synthetic from the sweatshops of taiwan. my friend   
deloris, however, who really owns such clothes,   
would say exquisite or sublime--her opened closet's   
row of shoulders teases late-day bedroomlight   
along such textures, there are days when the laboring brain   
and throbbing crotch appear to us to be not much more   
than her wardrobe's tasteful accessories. . . . woven   
from genital-down of prepubescent yeti, and then   
hand-sewn in our undersea domes. untouched   
by anyone other than albino elves, this wool is . . . . 

 


rarefied--to helthi hart, the diet guru, it's   
a cup of clear organic cauliflower broth. and for   
the emperor excessia, it's a mad dessert of swans' tongues   
--there were, what? ten thousand?--dipped in a slip   
of stiffening honey and set out to await the banqueteers   
like a field of fresh shoots they could graze.   
some roman party hosts had great roped bowls of snow   
brought from the mountaintops to entertain their guests   
with dishes of rose-petal sherbet and chilled roe.   
they might even allow the household slaves to slide   
leftover snow along the burning welts the ropes ate   
into their shoulders all down the mountainside.   

 
    
afterwards it was an unrecognizable tatter.   
but an image of my father's worn-thin bargain city   
all-weather jacket is still whole in its polyester glory.   
this is what happened the alley dog he later called the thing   
a cur had cornered livia, and she screamed once,   
with a seven-year-old's unselfconscious terror.   
and then my father was there, with his jacket wound around his arm,   
and a rock. when it was over, he tore the sleeves off, tied the poor dog   
quiet and, after comforting livia, they both kneeled down   
to comfort the dog. he was like that. and the jacket   
that served as weapon and restraint?--was like him,   
every day of his life. it did what was needed.   

 


i misread migraine. which of the two   
would we call the most rarefied? margarine?   
or maybe comparison isn't the point. a ghost   
is a person rarefied through the fine, fine colander   
death that doesn't make, for most of us, extinction   
an ideal. it was hard to think of frank and deloris   
divorcing, since it was hard to imagine the two of them   
engaging in anything so mundane as sex or rage or envy   
with the rest of the hoi polloi. they seemed unearthly   
in close to a literal way, like radio waves. and yet divorce 
they did. they found something real they could unjoin,   
hertz from hertz until there just was air.   

 

a dream we own the softest of the soft   
mongolian camel underhair sweaters. one day   
we think we're doing the right thing we release it   
into the wild, to romp with its brother and sister   
desert sweaters, out where it belongs. 
you know, however, what happens by now it's unfit   
to fend for itself amid that hardened herd.   
they beat it. it's hungry. it crawls back   
into the city, mewing, curling up at night against a door   
my father opens and, seeing something in need, brings it inside,   
wraps it in flannel. that's how he was.   
he'd give you the cheap shirt off his back.


for hayden carruth
thought thrusts up, homely as a hyacinth    
wrapped in its bulb like a root-vegetable,    
a ninth-month    
belly, where the green indelible    
pattern's inscribed into the labyrinth.    
thrust into light, it's air's inhabitant    
with light and air as food and drink.    
a hyacinth, tumescent pink    
on the low wooden mexican chest    
confronts the wintry dusk    
with informed self-interest.    
leaf-spears extravagantly ask    
what idea, still gnarled up in a knot    
of ganglions, will break through the husk    
shaped at last, recognizable as thought.    


    
trace, on a city map, trajectories    
of partially-forgotten words    
along the river's arteries,    
volatile substance of a sentient world.    
mauve heather crowds the window-grill. the light    
lingers a little later, with a slight    
vernal inflection. in a moon-glazed vase    
bloom yellow freesias, like some rainy day's    
brook-bank, in someone else's memory.    
small whirlpools of perception widen, ring    
an infant's numinous discoveries    
of syllables for animals, toys, trees    
a lab's thick coat, the dusty birds    
in claremont park each tardy urban spring,    
a stuffed pink leather horse with button eyes.    


    
a question-mark in yellow overalls,    
i could read. i was three.    
i slept with that pink horse. my one doll's    
name was v. j. she'd been given to me    
to celebrate the victory    
over japan, that is to say, the bomb    
i'd spend my schooldays taking shelter from.    
i couldn't tie my shoes. but reddy the fox,    
tootle the engine who jumped off the tracks,    
spelled me their stories on my mother's lap    
despite weak eyes and poor small-motor skills.    
my grandparents were dead not in pogroms,    
not in the camps--of strokes and heart attacks,    
merely immigrants, not deportees.    
when you die, does everything just stop?    


    
i'm four, in itchy woolen leggings,    
the day that i can't recognize the man    
down at the park entrance, waving,    
as my father. he has ten    
more years to live, that spring. dapper and balding    
he walks toward me then i run toward him, calling    
him, flustered by my flawed vision.    
underfoot, the maples' green-    
winged seeds splay on mica-specked octagons.    
his round face, thin nose, moustache silvered gray    
at thirty-eight look i think now hungarian.    
i like his wood-smell of two packs a day    
as he swings me up to his shoulder    
and i say, things look blurry far away    
--one saturday, two years after the war.


if you're one of seven 

downfalls, up in your kingdom 

of mulberry leaves, there are men 

betting you aren't worth a bullet, 

that your skin won't tan into a good 

wallet. as if drugged in the womb 

& limboed in a honeyed languor, 

by the time you open your eyes 

a thousand species have lived 

& died. born on a sunday 

morning, with old-world algae 

in your long hair, a goodness 

disguised your two-toed claws 

bright as flensing knives. in this 

upside-down haven, you're reincarnated 

as a fallen angel trying to go home.


january


contorted by wind,

mere armatures for ice or snow,

the trees resolve

to endure for now,


they will leaf out in april.

and i must be as patient

as the trees--

a winter resolution


i break all over again,

as the cold presses

its sharp blade 

against my throat.

february


after endless

hibernation

on the windowsill,

the orchid blooms--


embroidered purple stitches

up and down

a slender stem.

outside, snow


melts midair

to rain.

abbreviated month.

every kind of weather.

march


when the earl king came

to steal away the child

in goethe's poem, the father said

don't be afraid,


it's just the wind. . .

as if it weren't the wind

that blows away the tender

fragments of this world--


leftover leaves in the corners

of the garden, a lenten rose

that thought it safe

to bloom so early.

april


in the pastel blur

of the garden, 

the cherry 

and redbud


shake rain

from their delicate

shoulders, as petals

of pink


dogwood

wash down the ditches

in dreamlike

rivers of color.

may


may apple, daffodil,

hyacinth, lily,

and by the front

porch steps


every billowing

shade of purple

and lavender lilac,

my mother's favorite flower,


sweet breath drifting through

the open windows

perfume of memory--conduit

of spring.

june


the june bug

on the screen door

whirs like a small,

ugly machine,


and a chorus of frogs

and crickets drones like musak

at all the windows.

what we don't quite see


comforts us.

blink of lightning, grumble

of thunder--just the heat

clearing its throat.

july


tonight the fireflies

light their brief

candles

in all the trees


of summer--

color of moonflakes,

color of fluorescent

lace


where the ocean drags

its torn hem

over the dark

sand.

august


barefoot 

and sun-dazed, 

i bite into this ripe peach

of a month,


gathering children

into my arms

in all their sandy

glory,


heaping

my table each night

with nothing

but corn and tomatoes.

september


their summer romance 

over, the lovers 

still cling 

to each other 


the way the green 

leaves cling 

to their trees 

in the strange heat 


of september, as if 

this time 

there will be 

no autumn. 

october


how suddenly 

the woods 

have turned 

again. i feel 


like daphne, standing 

with my arms 

outstretched 

to the season, 


overtaken 

by color, crowned 

with the hammered gold 

of leaves. 

november 


these anonymous 

leaves, their wet 

bodies pressed 

against the window 


or falling past-- 

i count them 

in my sleep, 

absolving gravity, 


absolving even death 

who knows as i do 

the imperatives 

of the season. 

december


the white dove of winter 

sheds its first 

fine feathers 

they melt 


as they touch 

the warm ground 

like notes 

of a once familiar 


music the earth 

shivers and 

turns towards 

the solstice.




sarouk 

we buy what we cannot control, the rugs, 
   rhythm-makers, containing refrains of 
the oldest story a man takes a journey. 
   i have no stories inside me, he says, 
so travels on, to rest beneath a carpet 
   of blue constellations, star patterns 
at the edges of disordered border walls. 
   at the center, a meditative medallion 
makes a moving immortal-flowered ground 
   to live there is to give oneself over 
to greenness, redness, occasional blues, 
   holding those spirits of woollen dyes 
rising from the knots within to breathe 
   against the woven, multi-colored air. 


bidjar 

now there is a coat of many colors hung 
   around the wanderer's shoulders where 
he climbs out from that pit, down which 
   he flung himself, or was thrown into. 
reaching to soothe his wounds, he finds 
   the dusts of centuries residing there 
beneath his feet, the hopeful travelers 
   passing, wearing thin, fighting about 
how best to articulate the names of gods 
   for whom they yearn--accursed by wars' 
helmet curves, shields, chained stitches 
   of unmediated reds and yellowed husks 
of blood--broken lines marking a garden 
   in whose precincts his journey began. 


kazak 

three sunbursts spin, enigmatic energies 
   through golden latchhooks, surrounding 
cloudbanks three eagles, darting within 
   their shifting images they return him 
to streets of lit porches in summer dark, 
   a boy stuttering over random syllables, 
a blindfolded man pleading for his life-- 
   whose fate is in the hands of some men 
whose fate is in the hands of other men, 
   whose fate . . . until the whole pattern 
emerges, and the language becomes clear. 
   on the floor lies his mother, moaning, 
until he comes out, guilty, before her-- 
   amid the mud of his own frozen blood. 


shirvan 

to live inside such squares as the weaver 
   of this green, becoming golden, labor 
to pull back old skins and try to emerge, 
   victorious, from that old prison after 
so many years, is to find a path back to 
   harmonious designs, surely centered on 
the search--yet still speaking of a life 
   with knotted figures seen as suffering 
variations on themes that can be inferred 
   from small vibrations of weft and warp, 
the snakes' within the threads worn down 
   to the shapes of ribbons, even rhythms 
writhing in a loom of days those humming 
   ancient instruments whose music seems 


shiraz 

raw as colors governed by the earth, pink 
   as brick, or deserts scraped from rock, 
rough clay slowly grinding, then drifting 
   down the slopes of the central plateaus 
to fresh respites from thinner regions of 
   dessication fixed at the fringes below. 
these lands lie under the ache of desire, 
   which calls feet out to play upon sand, 
to fill each new hollow, and dance about, 
   tongues turning on the knots of umber, 
ochre, woven into those undulating waves 
   others might summon in flowery manners 
to escape from bitter orange, still held 
   by recalcitrant fingers, to the purple 


kerman 

empowering all those who try to hold on-- 
   as all things will hold to themselves 
an idea of themselves--to an aspiration 
   towards good fortune, unwavering even 
unto death. yet here are dusky passages, 
   canopies of clearness, an everlasting 
understanding of the earth as cancerous 
   points of coloration, acid starbursts, 
or dangerous blots--all blurring the way 
   to move past sight perspectives lost 
and found again, symmetrical, surrounded 
   by the momentos one saves from travel, 
old friends, like hues that may betoken, 
   in hopefulness, some changes of heart. 


senneh 

this creates a powerful language about 
   how to levitate a plane--for even as 
the occasional murmurs of new machines 
   are heard in the land, as old cyclic 
gardens arrange themselves in the whorls 
   and tendrils throughout tilled fields, 
snakes hold up this world in variations 
   of light blue skies above temptation. 
even when an illiterate weaver mistakes 
   an old date for the design, then dyes 
and binds strange numbers into a ground, 
   the change of the serif, for instance, 
in a calligraphy of days marks the date 
   of cartouches as mysterious, unknown. 


kashan 

yet the signals from the borders suggest 
   a different tale lozenges are bottles 
strewn along mauve and terra cotta roads, 
   shaped like a woman found lying along 
the side of those same roads--the figure 
   of flesh, going nowhere but endlessly 
back on itself--as a web of years frames 
   a dying kind of certitude, innocence. 
the birds in these cages signify singing, 
   as the tapestries of perfected threads 
suggest reticence, chosen intermediaries 
   to the indeterminancy of all creation

and we can buy it yet, articulate or not, 
   with each new freeing of our hearts.


a recent piece in pravda gives the library books checked out by stalin between april and december, . much has been made of their oddity...

the essence of hypnosis 
paris legrande,  

the woman has agreed to swallow pins, 
and here, white-robed, 
                                  stands great dr. charcot, 

pointing to the needles in her palm. the photo 
makes them gleam. the stovepipe-hatted amphitheatre strains, 

heads abob for better looks. she's about 
to lap them like sugar, but the doctor's minion 

stays her hand down her dress they glitter and rain. 
and now from the murmuring crowd he procures a hat, 

placing it upon her lap. 
                                       your child is crying. 
can you soothe him? tenderly the hat's caressed. 

to and fro she rocks it as she sings--a case 
of simple congestive hysteria. he is dying, 

woman, your child is dying the tears cascade, 
her shoulders twitch and tremble. diagnosis confirmed.

signalling generally the advent of paresis. 

comrade stalin tamps his pipe and struts 
the carpet to the phone, having marked another passage 

with red pen. do not put him through, i said. 
i am trying to relax. the receiver's slammed down 

collectivization can wait. 
                                          he re-cracks the spine, 
relights the merscham to nietzsche gone mad, 

to schumann demented, to sepias of six noseless 
neopolitans, an aged whore whose arms are candlewax, 

spirochettes that marinate the blood, x-es 
and arrows to mark their swim. his pulse 

crescendos and his forehead glistens, 
x and asterisks-- 
                            all night the margins redden.

the right to kill
moscow bezbozhnik, third ed.,  

x and asterisk shorthand all night flowing
out the stenographer's hand. agent shivarov

why do you think we've arrested you? he   cups
his face in his hands while mandelstam fidgets, blowing

on his tea to cool it.
                              could it be your poems? 
the bulb's faint hum, the stenographer's cough.

on the desk a bulging file, from which shivarov
removes a smudged carbon, sliding it toward mandelstam

along the tabletop. a recitation, please? 
the hand begins to quiver as the carbon blues

his palm--
               the kremlin mountaineer ... the thick worms
of his fingers ... executions on his tongue like berries.

do you recognize yourself as guilty of composing tracts
of counter-revolutionary nature? and the blue hand shakes.

is resurrection of the dead possible?
london theosophy international, 

against the table the cadaver thrashes its blue arms quiver--
a little. more voltage to the genitals.

and a kind of erection is achieved, which dr. lysenko
duly notes, yet lazarus does not stir,

exactly.
               one week to comrade stalin's visit,
and the demonstrations must impress

too much voltage and the corpses combust,
too little and the limbs remain inert

as noodles. notes scratched on his clipboard, the doctor
scowls to his humpbacked assistant, who hits

the switch.
                   and lazarus sizzles--flames emit
from the electroded temples. the good doctor swears

and flails his arms, as the corpse performs
its own suttee. the corpse has the final word.

                                  precise as a slide rule

and always natural as the smell of dill--
interrogation, too, is art. babel sways

upon his stool, his neck goes limp. the aesthetics
of confession must be formalist

the trotskyist babel will weep and stutter but list
in the end his cohort spies.
                                             yet first he must wake.

cold water to the face, a truncheon to the legs
and the writer's block is over. the singing

commences with the truncheon's sting,
the singing and the singing and the singing--

its own dark kaddish, its own crematorium smoke.
the verdict is final, the case is closed.

practical versification
moscow nova mysl,

all the endless signatures.
                                           a photo shoot he poses

with pen in hand, the pravda newsman on his knees.
should the couplets be open or should they be closed?

signatures of every sort, the pace never slows.
the state revised, rewritten endlessly.

he hungers for verse but lives by prose,
redrafted, retouched. the coffins set in rows

like red square parades, marching to infinity.
should the couplets be open
                                          or should they be closed?

late in the kremlin, his desk lamp glows.
so much to excise, he's up until three.

o to live by verse instead of prose.
the drafts soar upward. on his desk the pile grows

skyscraper high, babel tower and gallows tree.
o sentence in verse, o sentence in prose.

should the couplets be open or should they be closed?

of the secret police, has been shot. he will
now require closure, require editing.

his service to the party, his trotskyite past,
all must now be excised, even his birth

converted to white space.
                                        and first
his face must pentimento down to nothingness.

no longer can he pose with comrade stalin
admiring the moscow-volga canal. now he is water.

no longer at his right in parades at red square.
now he is air, is brickwork on the viewing stand.

and now the past itself is air, is water, and finally fire,
whitening to ash.
                           in his fat fingers its pages flare. 




i sit where i always sit, in back of the buddha, 
red leather wing chair, pony skin trunk 
                                                         under my feet, 
sky light above me, chinese and indian rugs on the floor. 
 march, , where to begin again? 

over there's the ur-photograph, 
          giorgio morandi, glasses pushed up on his forehead, 
looking hard at four objects-- 
two olive oil tins, one wine bottle, one flower vase, 
a universe of form and structure, 

the universe constricting in front of his eyes, 
                                                                   angelic orders 
and applications scraped down 
to paint on an easel stand, some in the frame, some not. 
bologna, my friend, bologna, world's bit and world's end. 
                                            

it's only in darkness you can see the light, only 
from emptiness that things start to fill, 
i read once in a dream, i read in a book 
                                                             under the pink 
redundancies of the spring peach trees. 
old fires, old geographies. 
in that case, make it old, i say, make it singular 
in its next resurrection, 
white violets like photographs on the tombstone of the yard. 

each year it happens this way, each year 
something dead comes back and lifts up its arms, 
                                                                      puts down its luggage 
and says--in the same costume, down-at-heels, badly sewn-- 
i bring you good news from the other world. 
                                            

one hand on the sun, one hand on the moon, both feet bare,    
god of the late 
                        mediterranean renaissance 
breaststrokes across the heavens. 
easter, and all who've been otherwised peek from their shells, 

thunderheads gathering at the rear 
                                                    abyss of things, 
lightning, quick swizzle sticks, troubling the dark in-between. 
you're everything that i'm not, they think, 
i'll fly away, lord, i'll fly away. 

april's agnostic and nickel-plated and skin deep, 
glitter and bead-spangle, haute couture, 
the world its runway, slink-step and glide. 
roll the stone slowly as it vogues and turns, 
                                                                  roll the stone slowly. 
                                            

well, that was a month ago. may now, 
what's sure to arrive has since arrived and been replaced, 
snick-snack, lock and load, grey heart's bull's-eye, 
a little noon music out of the trees, 
                                                         a sonatina in green. 

spring passes. across the room, on the opposite wall, 
a th century photograph 
of the roman arena in verona. inside, 
                                                             stone tiers and stone gate. 
over the outer portico, the ghost of catullus at sky's end. 
the morning and evening stars never meet, 
                                                               nor summer and spring 
beauty has been my misfortune, 
                                             hard journey, uncomfortable resting place. 
whatever it is i have looked for 
is tiny, so tiny it can dance in the palm of my hand. 
                                            

this is the moment of our disregard-- 
                                                       just after supper, 
unseasonable hail in huddles across the porch, 
the dogs whimpering, 
                         thunder and lightning eddying off toward the east, 
nothing to answer back to, nothing to dress us down. 

thus do we slide into our disbelief 
                                                      and disaffection, 
caught in the weeds and understory of our own lives, 
bad weather, bad dreams. 
proper attention is our refuge now, our perch and our praise. 

so? so. the moon has its rain-ring auraed around it-- 
the more that we think we understand, the less we see, 
back yard becoming an obelisk 
of darkness into the sky, 
                                     no hieroglyphs, no words to the wise.


standing in line at the supersave, it all falls   
into place, princess di and the aliens and diet   
tips from outer space, king tut and king elvis,   
   out of the subfusc air, the rank urgency of dusk,   
   among the heavy odors of differing dungs,   
   acrid signatures of urine, the bold perfume of musk . . . 
nostradamus, this year's senate race, unforeseen   
links between absolutely everything and sex,   
conspiracies requiring conspiracy to be detected,   
   from a sibilance of scattered leaves, the sudden   
   snap of twig, inflections of a gabbling breeze,   
   horizons stained with dust, the attitude of trees . . . 
and o my fellow shoppers waiting to check out,   
what appetite is this that drives such dim belief,   
what thirst for intercourse between these banal bits?   
   from the cacophony of birds as from abrupt silence,   
   odd sounds of usual insects, subliminal presence   
   of added shadow, faintest trembling in the ground . . .   
when greed and accident stand ever ready to explain,   
whence this convolvulus of tenuous connection?   
what need for the devious when the obvious will do?   
   from remarkable weeds, from a slight imbalance   
   in the normal proportion of game, from distressed bark,   
   out of the bewildering swirl of importunate sense . . .   
attention, shoppers, there lies a veldt within us each,   
its grasses rustle with intent, and on that plain   
was born the fine suspicion that has carried us so far,   
   to behold the unassuming fact and comprehend design,   
   to look upon confusion and construct its plot and act,   
 to leap at merest notion found floating in the mind . . .   
has brought us to these sheltered aisles under thin gray light,   
where in boredom and abundance we seek our narrative, 
whatever tale comes now to kill us and can creep.


from the kindness of my parents   
i suppose it was that i held   
that belief about suffering   

imagining that if only   
it could come to the attention   
of any person with normal   
feelings certainly anyone   
literate who might have gone   

to college they would comprehend   
pain when it went on before them   
and would do something about it   
whenever they saw it happen   
in the time of pain the present   
they would try to stop the bleeding   
for example with their own hands   

but it escapes their attention   
or there may be reasons for it   
the victims under the blankets   
the meat counters the maimed children   
the animals the animals   
staring from the end of the world


the night the world was going to end
when we heard those explosions not far away
and the loudspeakers telling us
about the vast fires on the backwater
consuming undisclosed remnants
and warning us over and over
to stay indoors and make no signals
you stood at the open window
the light of one candle back in the room
we put on high boots to be ready 
for wherever we might have to go
and we got out the oysters and sat
at the small table feeding them
to each other first with the fork
then from our mouths to each other
until there were none and we stood up
and started to dance without music
slowly we danced around and around
in circles and after a while we hummed
when the world was about to end
all those years all those nights ago


leo bends over his desk    
gazing at a memorandum    
while stuart stands beside him    
with a smile, saying,    
leo, the order for those desks    
came in today    
from youngstown needle and thread    
c. loth inc., there you are    
like balboa the conqueror    
of those who want to buy office furniture    
or bar fixtures    
in nineteen forty in cincinnati, ohio    
secretaries pound out    
invoices on antique typewriters--    
dactyllographs    
and fingernail biters.    
i am sitting on a desk    
looking at my daddy    
who is proud of but feels unsure about    
some aspects of his little laddie.    
i will go on to explore    
deep andor nonsensical themes    
while my father's on the dark hardwood floor    
hit by a couple of ohio sunbeams.    
kenny, he says, some day you'll work in the store.    
but i felt never more or never ever    
harvard was far away    
world war two was distant    
psychoanalysis was extremely expensive    
all of these saved me from you.    
c. loth you made my father happy    
i saw his face shining    
he laughed a lot, working in you    
he said to miss ritter    
his secretary    
ritt, this is my boy, kenny    
hello there kenny, she said    
my heart in an uproar    
i loved you but couldn't think    
of staying with you    
i can see the virtues now    
that could come from being in you    
a sense of balance    
compromise and acceptance--    
not isolated moments of brilliance    
like a girl without a shoe,    
but someone that you    
care for every day--    
need for customers and the economy    
don't go away.    
there were little pamphlets    
distributed in you    
about success in business    
each about eight to twelve pages long    
one whole series of them    
all ended with the words    
p.s. he got the job    
one a story about a boy who said,    
i swept up the street, sir,    
before you got up. or    
there were five hundred extra    catalogues    
so i took them to people in the city who have a dog--    
p.s. he got the job.    
i didn't get the job    
i didn't think that i could do the job    
i thought i might go crazy in the job    
staying in you    
you whom i could love    
but not be part of    
the secretaries clicked    
their smith coronas closed at five p.m.    
and took the streetcars to kentucky then    
and i left too.


i'm ramn gonzlez barbagelata from anywhere,    
from cucuy, from paran, from rio turbio, from oruro,   
from maracaibo, from parral, from ovalle, from loconmilla,    
i'm the poor devil from the poor third world,    
i'm the third-class passenger installed, good god    
in the lavish whiteness of snow-covered mountains,    
concealed among orchids of subtle idiosyncrasy.    

i've arrived at this famous year , and what do i get? 
with what do i scratch myself? what do i have to do with    
the three glorious zeros that flaunt themselves    
over my very own zero, my own non-existence?    
pity that brave heart awaiting its call    
or the man enfolded by warmer love,    
nothing's left today except my flimsy skeleton,    
my eyes unhinged, confronting the era's beginning.    

the era's beginning are these ruined shacks,    
these poor schools, these people still in rags and tatters,    
this cloddish insecurity of my poor families,    
is all this the day? the century's beginning, the golden door?    

well, enough said, i, at least, discreet,    
as in office, patched and pensive,    
i proclaim the redundancy of the inaugural    
i've arrived here with all my baggage,    
bad luck and worse jobs,    
misery always waiting with open arms,    
the mobilization of people piled up on top of each other,    
and the manifold geography of hunger.


one of the objects i've treasured most in my life 
is this letter scale which, long ago, you gave me. 
i was an active correspondent at the time, 
even sending lots of letters overseas. 
while still enjoying the pleasure of going to the post, 
i now had another assessing exactly, in advance, 
at my counter, the cost of packets and envelopes, 
to which, price list in hand, i stuck my stamps. 
i use it less these days, this quite simple device 
graded with little marks up to a whole pound, 
for my mailings rarely still exceed the price 
of an ordinary stamp. the tray of polished metal's now 
covered with dust, without the slightest hint 
that the red pointer marking the weight on the front 
has budged. but in the long run, one would, i think, 
discern a difference and see how much the months 
were worth in terms of dust, the seasons elapsed 
since the previous weighing. but having been seized, 
suddenly, just this morning, by a tremendous attack 
annual of cleaning, from which nothing is released, 
i restored to the tray's slightly concave stainless steel, 
that ever so slightly distorted mirror, its polished shine. 
it reflected all of the sky, through which clouds reeled, 
and i could confirm that space does not weigh more than time.


they come down to us   
rounding the corners of centuries   
at an innocent jog, shedding letters   
and most of the grand old meanings   
to take on the sleek new hide   
our day demands, a snappier   
nap that can repel the stare   
of a rather less tactful sun   

they come down to us com-   
pounding, bounding in idiot   
joy, they come with that trustful   
tired old mutt look, that soft woof,   
warm doggie sigh on the knee,   
hoping for what? some reason,   
no doubt, to continue sounding.   
give me one good reason,   

they come down to us saying,   
as if we could have one without them.


on some fundless expedition, 
you discover it beneath 
a pyracantha bush 
carved from the hip bone 
of a long-extinct herbivore 
that walked the plains on legs 
a story tall. an ocarina of bone 
drilled and shaped laboriously 
with tools too soft to be efficient 
by one primitive musician 
spending night after night 
squatting by the fire. 
no instrument of percussion 
place this against your lips, 
fill it from your lungs to sound 
a note winding double helix, solo 
and thready calling to the pack.


for a tree, you're the worst kind 
of friend, remembering everything. 
pale-skinned, slightly brailled, blank 
page of pre-adolescence. the way 
the smallest knife-slice would darken 
with time, rise and widen. 

mark was here. left his. 
but these are the digs you're used to, 
sufferer of mere presence, 
scratched years, scratched loves 
we wanted to write on the world 
and couldn't trust to an eardrum. 

i scarred you myself long ago with 
my own jack-knife, jill-name. 
you took her as the morning 
unsteamed around me. took us 
as we had to be taken, in. old relief, 
new reminder, i was young, what could 

i have written? didn't care then, had               
to see it scraped out, big letters beneath 
your erotic nubs and crotches. o beech, 
it's no big riddle we fell in the forest, 
you heard. quiet, in your own way. 
in your own way, spreading the word.


what could have been the big to-do 
that caused him to push me aside 
on that platform? was a woman who knew 
there must be some good even inside 
an ass like him on board that train? 
charity? frances? his last chance 
in a ratty string of last chances? jane? 
surely in all of us is some good. 
better love thy neighbor, buddy, 
lest she shove back. maybe i should. 
it's probably just a cruddy 
downtown interview leading to 
some cheap-tie, careerist, dull 
cul-de-sac he's speeding to. 
can he catch up with his soul? 
really, what was the freaking crisis? 
did he need to know before me 
if the lights searching the crowd's eyes 
were those of our train, or maybe 
the train of who he might have been, 
the person his own-heart-numbing, 
me-shoving anxiety about being 
prevents him from ever becoming? 
how has his thoughtlessness defiled 
who i was before he shoved me? 
how might i be smiling now if he'd smiled, 
hanging back, as though he might have loved me?


butter, like love, 
seems common enough 
yet has so many imitators. 
i held a brick of it, heavy and cool, 
and glimpsed what seemed like skin 
beneath a corner of its wrap 
the dcolletage revealed 
a most attractive fat 

and most refined. 
not milk, not cream, 
not even crme de la crme. 
it was a delicacy which assured me 
that bliss follows agitation, 
that even pasture daisies 
through the alchemy of four stomachs 
may grace a king's table. 

we have a yellow bowl near the toaster 
where summer's butter grows 
soft and sentimental. 
we love it better for its weeping, 
its nostalgia for buckets and churns 
and deep stone wells, 
for the press of a wooden butter mold 
shaped like a swollen heart.


today the cloud shapes are terrifying,   
and i keep expecting some enormous   
black-and-white b-movie cyclops   
to appear at the edge of the horizon, 

to come striding over the ocean   
and drag me from my kitchen   
to the deep cave that flickered   
into my young brain one saturday 

at the baronet theater where i sat helpless   
between my older brothers, pumped up   
on candy and horror--that cave, 
the litter of human bones 

gnawed on and flung toward the entrance,   
i can smell their stench as clearly 
as the bacon fat from breakfast. this   
is how it feels to lose it-- 

not sanity, i mean, but whatever it is   
that helps you get up in the morning 
and actually leave the house 
on those days when it seems like death 

in his brown uniform 
is cruising his panel truck 
of packages through your neighborhood.   
i think of a friend's voice 

on her answering machine-- 
hi, i'm not here-- 
the morning of her funeral,   
the calls filling up the tape 

and the mail still arriving, 
and i feel as afraid as i was 
after all those vampire movies   
when i'd come home and lie awake 

all night, rigid in my bed, 
unable to get up 
even to pee because the undead   
were waiting underneath it 

if i so much as stuck a bare 
foot out there in the unprotected air   
they'd grab me by the ankle and pull me   
under. and my parents said there was 

nothing there, when i was older   
i would know better, and now   
they're dead, and i'm older,   
and i know better.


of course they are empty shells, without hope of animation. 
of course they are artifacts. 

even if my sister and i should wear some, 
or if we give others away, 

they will always be your clothes without you, 
as we will always be your daughters without you.


                                             from the cliff's edge, 
kicking her feet in panic and despair 
as the circle of light contracts and blackness 
takes the screen. and that 
is how we leave her, hanging--though we know 
she will be rescued, only to descend 
into fresh harm, the story flowing on, 
disaster and reprieve--systole, diastole--split 
rhythm of a heart that hungers 

only to go on. so why is this like my mother, 
caged in a railed bed, each breath, 
a fresh installment in a tortured tale 
of capture and release? nine days 
she dangled, stubborn, 
over the abyss, the soft clay crumbling 
beneath her fingertips, until she dropped 
with a little bird cry of surprise 
into the swift river below. 

here metaphor collapses, for there was no love 
to rescue her, no small boat 
waiting with a net to fish her out, 
although the water carried her, 
and it was april when we buried her 
among the weeping cherries and the waving 
flags and in the final fade, a heron 
breasted the far junipers 
to gain the tremulous air and swim away.


wake me in south galway, or better yet 
in clare. you'll know the pub i have in mind. 
improvise a hearse--one of those decrepit 
postal vans would suit me down to the ground-- 
a rust-addled renault, kelly green with a splash 
of oscar wilde yellow stirred in to clash 
with the dazzling perfect meadows and limestone 
on the coast road from kinvara down toward ballyvaughan. 

once you've got in off the road at newquay 
push aside some barstools and situate me 
up in front by the door where the musicians sit, 
their table crowded with pints and a blue teapot, 
a pouch of drum, some rolling papers and tin 
whistles. ask charlie piggott to play a tune 
that sounds like loss and guinness, turf smoke and rain, 
while brenda dips in among the punters like a hedge-wren. 

will i hear it? maybe not. but i hear it now. 
the smoke of the music fills my nostrils, i feel the attuned 
box and fiddle in harness, pulling the plough 
of the melody, turning the bog-dark, root-tangled ground. 
even the ceramic collie on the windowsill 
cocks an ear as the tune lifts and the taut sail 
of the galway hooker trills wildly in its frame on the wall, 
rippling to the salt pulse and seabreeze of a west clare reel. 

many a night, two octaves of one tune, 
we sat here side by side, your body awake 
to a jig or slide, me mending the drift of a line 
as the music found a path to my notebook. 
lost in its lilt and plunge i would disappear 
into the heathery freedom of a slow air 
or walk out under the powerful stars to clear 
my head of thought and breathe their cooled-down fire. 

when my own session ends, let me leave like that, 
porous to the wind that blows off the ocean. 
goodbye to the company and step into the night 
completed and one-off, like a well-played tune-- 
beyond the purified essence of hearth fires 
rising from the life of the parish, past smoke and stars, 
released from everything i've done and known. 
i won't go willingly, it's true, but i'll be gone.


if ever there were a spring day so perfect, 

so uplifted by a warm intermittent breeze 


that it made you want to throw 

open all the windows in the house 


and unlatch the door to the canary's cage, 

indeed, rip the little door from its jamb, 


a day when the cool brick paths 

and the garden bursting with peonies 


seemed so etched in sunlight 

that you felt like taking 


a hammer to the glass paperweight 

on the living room end table, 


releasing the inhabitants 

from their snow-covered cottage 


so they could walk out, 

holding hands and squinting 


into this larger dome of blue and white, 

well, today is just that kind of day.


how do they survive, riven   
as they are, the one undoing   
the other's desire?   

tell the body to outrun   
the mind, and the mind smirks,   
whispering too loudly 
this way   this way,   
blocking all the exits.   

and the body, luxurious   
sensualist by pool side or in bed,   
doesn't it hear the mind's   
impatient machinery ticking 
it's time   it's time? 

and only in our mind's eye,   
as we're fond of saying,   
someone else's body leaping nimbly   
in jets of thought, or revealing   
to us act v, scene iii   
in one gestural flourish,   
body and mind beautifully   
synchronous.   

oh, the mind is eely, slipping   
out of its puzzle boxes,   
loving its own wit.   

and the earnest body speak of it   
with the least irony, and already   
you've begun to unnerve it.   

better to let them have their way,   
forgetting about them both   
until they meet again sometime   
as if for the first time   
in library or steam room   
ready to shake hello 

or lead you to whatever door there is   
and always the two sets of stairs.


john-o was given a key to the apartment. the deal   
was this if phil died suddenly, and john-o heard,   
he would rush on over, enter the apartment, leave   
unseen with phil's brown suitcase, and secretly pitch it   
into the mounded deeps of the city dump.   
simply, there were things that phil didn't want   
to hurt his family with. do you have yours?   
i have mine. the brown suitcase. sasha's sister,   
on her deathbed--dinky, frail, just a mild   
skim-milk trickle of a hospice patient-- 
tensed, sat up, and unloosed   
such confessional invective that it seemed the walls   
and the sheets would have to be splattered in shit,   
her cancer having acted with the harsh, disbursing   
force of a tornado on the brown and hard-shelled   
suitcase in her electrochemical memory webs.   
is yours secure? from love? from sodium pentathol?   
last year, when a tornado hit our fringe   
of downtown businesses, the air was alive for counties around   
with the downward dance of naked canceled checks,   
handwritten notes, hotel receipts, e-mail transcripts,   
smeary polaroids, a swirl of lacy underwisps   
that jellyfished the skies, and from the g-spot shoppe   
a rain of plastic pleasure aids, of which one prime example   
pierced a cow between the eyes and struck her dead.   

maybe aids--i wasn't sure. but he was dying,   
that was sure as dry as a stick of human chalk,   
and making the terrible scritch-sound of a stick of chalk,   
in his throat, in the community air, in the room   
across from sasha's sister. something . . . hidden 
in the trace of rundown aura still around him   
as we chatted there one morning . . . a tv? a sissyboy tv?   
i wasn't sure, but it was obvious   
his life-chalk held a story not yet written,   
not confessed yet   
for this storyniverous planet.   
and when i remembered my mother's own   
last days . . . the way a person is a narrative,   
the strength of which is either   
revelation or withholding. it was summer, and the garden   
at the nursing home was fat with summer's pleasures   
flowered mounds like reefs of coral,   
bees as globular as whole yolks.   
in her room, my mother disappeared a breath   
at a time, and everything else was only a kind of scenery for that.   
the wink of pollen in the light. the birds. their feather-lice.   
the bursting spores. those opened-up   
cicada husks abandoned on the patio   
--the small, brown, unlocked luggage   
that's completed its work in this world.


two wandering across the porcelain 

siberia, one alone on the window sill, 


four across the ceiling's senseless field 

of pale yellow, one negotiating folds 


in a towel tiny, bronze-colored, antennae 

'strongly elbowed,' crawling over antony 


and cleopatra, face down, unsurprised, 

one dead in the mountainous bar of soap. 


sub-family formicinae a single 

segment behind the thorax, the sickle 


moons of their abdomens, one trapped in bubbles 

i soak in the tub with no clear purpose 


they come in by the baseboard, do not bite, 

crush bloodless beneath a finger. peterson's


calls them 'social creatures,' yet what grim 

society identical pilgrims, 


seed-like, brittle, pausing on the path 

only three seconds to touch another's 


face, some hoisting the papery carcasses 

of their dead in their jaws, which open and close 


like the clasp of a necklace. 'mating occurs 

in flight'-- what better way? weightless, reckless 


rapture the winged queen and her mate, quantum 

passion spiraling near the kumquat, 


and then the queen sheds her wings, plants 

the pearl-like larvae in their cribs of sand 


more anvil-headed, creeping attentions 

to follow cracks in the tile, the lip of the tub, 


and one starting across the mirror now, doubled.


the afternoon slows down, the town in steady rain.   
that one with the trendy chicken-plucked look--   
hair a tufted circle on top, the rest shaved all around--   
i can't really care about. of course i hope   
he grows up without totalling himself and his car,   
but he's the clown in this act. he seems even   
to know his place as unworthy twerpy follower   
of the one no one would look away from for long,   
whose james dean stance, hands deep in pockets   
of a rattily natty maroon corduroy blazer,   
shoves his shoulders nearly to his ears.   
beneath the blazer, long sulked-in jeans,   
oversized black boots. he lifts one   
to kick a milkshake someone couldn't finish   
standing on the sidewalk, and it lands on   
its side, explodes and rolls a vanilla graffito,   
expletive unfurling. expressionless himself.   
the other boy smirks before the rain douses   
and sweeps it stupidly into the gutter.   

even if i were not invisible through this darkish window,   
they would know how to erase me. well,   he  would.   
i would enjoy that, just to see how he would do it,   
what sort of panache he'd pack in his shrug.   

raining harder, and the tuft-headed one shifts   
unhappily under the revco awning, pivoting   
his whole body now and then to see what the one   
i'm half in love with's doing, fifteen, maybe sixteen   
he's twitching in sublime irritation, lighting up   
again, hard to do with both hands in your pockets   
but he pretty much manages no problem, and now   
comes the move that gets me. he strides out   
from under the awning, a spotted lucky sticking straight   
from his lip, walks two buildings down and turns   
at the corner so his back's to main street and me,   
stands, his twitch becalmed at last, stands   
without heeding his friend's pleading   
jeering calls, you idiot,  you idiot, you 
idiot, stands hunched, not looking up or down,   
and i can tell this is his moment, this is where   
he'll break off, he's going to unload everyone,   
he doesn't blink as he hawks up their nothingness   
and spits, feeling himself filling with what's left   
he takes possession of his spirited bad luck for good   
and mounts and rides it without moving a muscle, stands   
letting the rain collect behind his collar and drench   
his gloriously inappropriately maroon corduroy   
and his hair that looks not combable by anyone   
alive, wild and bunched even when the rain   
has patted keeps patting at it harder and harder   
like an obsolete humiliated hand that wants to   
feed and fend for and in general do for him,   
and he has turned his back at last on the clown,   
and on main street full of clowns you can both see   
and not see, who wouldn't dare try to keep an eye on him   
or try to follow him from now on.


					
					   someone called in a report that she had 
seen a man painting in the dark over by the 
pond. a police car was dispatched to go in- 
vestigate. the two officers with their big 
flashlights walked all around the pond, but 
found nothing suspicious. hatcher was the 
younger of the two, and he said to johnson, 
what do you think he was painting? johnson 
looked bemused and said, the dark, stupid. 
what else could he have been painting? hatcher, 
a little hurt, said, frogs in the dark, lily- 
pads in the dark, pond in the dark. just as 
many things exist in the dark as they do in
the light. johnson paused, exasperated. then 
hatcher added, i'd like to see them. hell, 
i might even buy one. maybe there's more out 
there than we know. we are the police, after- 
all. we need to know.
				

 

back when i used to be indian
i am standing outside the
pool hall with my sister.
she strawberry blonde. stale sweat
and beer through the
open door. a warrior leans on his stick,
fingers blue with chalk.
another bends to shoot.
his braids brush the green
felt, swinging to the beat
of the jukebox. we move away.
hank williams falls again
in the backseat of a cadillac.
i look back.
a wind off the distant hills lifts my shirt,
brings the scent
of wounded horses.




that child was dangerous. that just-born 
    newly washed and silent baby 
         wrapped in deerskin and held warm 
against the side of its mother could understand 
    the language of birds and animals 
         even when asleep. it knew why bluejay 
was scolding the bushes, what hawk was explaining 
   to the wind on the cliffside, what bittern had found out 
         while standing alone in marsh grass. it knew 
what the screams of fox and the whistling of otter 
    were telling the forest. that child knew 
         the language of fire 
as it gnawed at sticks like beaver 
    and what water said all day and all night 
         at the creek's mouth. as its small fingers 
closed around stone, it held what stone was saying. 
    it knew what bear mother whispered to herself 
         under the snow. it could not tell 
anyone what it knew. it would laugh 
    or cry out or startle or suddenly stare 
         at nothing, but had no way 
to repeat what it was hearing, what it wanted most 
    not to remember. it had no way to know 
         why it would fall under a spell 
and lie still as if not breathing, 
    having grown afraid 
         of what it could understand. that child would learn 
to sit and crawl and stand and begin 
    putting one foot forward and following it 
         with the other, would learn to put one word 
it could barely remember slightly ahead 
    of the other and then walk and speak 
         and finally run and chatter, 
and all the tillamook would know that child 
    had forgotten everything and at last could listen 
         only to people and was safe now. 




i like the generosity of numbers.
the way, for example,
they are willing to count
anything or anyone
two pickles, one door to the room,
eight dancers dressed as swans.

i like the domesticity of addition--
add two cups of milk and stir--
the sense of plenty six plums
on the ground, three more
falling from the tree.

and multiplication's school
of fish times fish,
whose silver bodies breed
beneath the shadow
of a boat.

even subtraction is never loss,
just addition somewhere else
five sparrows take away two,
the two in someone else's 
garden now.

there's an amplitude to long division,
as it opens chinese take-out
box by paper box,
inside every folded cookie
a new fortune.

and i never fail to be surprised
by the gift of an odd remainder,
footloose at the end
forty-seven divided by eleven equals four,
with three remaining.

three boys beyond their mother's call,
two italians off to the sea,
one sock that isn't anywhere you look.


for james richardson
gerard, juke-step jerry, little wrestler, soul-mess 
of sinew and mind-sight, fired spark, joyed jesuit, 
grief-clog too, but a pan-flute in every ave, you half-nelson 
the syntax dandies, ram them to canvas, sit upon and pin 

the god-fops, minions of ghost tomes, trite chimes, 
though you walk among them, too, jig and roar 
of black-robed stroll in golden-grove and choral iambs. 
you were, yes, that falcon flight, the labor, soar, and 

dive, but buzzard nose for carrion, too, sniffed your own, 
knew, alone, the rot, rope-knot or buckle of roots under-on 
rock, your gowned back to roses, rosaries, but eyes a song gone 
up, too, sickly little wings stuck in god-glue air how long? 

you sang one dialectic flight, sir--the only kind. how high 
can the swallow swoop, how low the falcon grieve, relieve, 
in fall till pinions hold him, there, to kill? light- 
weight, mutt, heaver of iron, scrap,feather i believe 

the hurt, believe you saw what you saw.


it is very stretchy.   
we know that, even if   
many details remain   
sketchy. it is complexly   
woven. that much too   
has pretty well been   
proven. we are loath   
to continue our lessons   
which consist of slaps   
as sharp and dispersed   
as bee stings from   
a smashed nest   
when any strand snaps-- 

hurts working far past   
the locus of rupture,   
attacking threads   
far beyond anything   
we would have said   
connects.


unwavering noon, self-minus 
sun flake on the levels of gold

there are names for these things rose, brick, plate glass

the annunciation of the sparrow 
a gene for anxiety

add hope, fear, greed, desire

no rest but the shade 
to which a sun implodes

perhaps on other worlds others walk streets 
muse on the weather

psyches built, say, on a double sun of unwavering noon

the balm of such congruence 

 

thick, white, stick bicyclists painted on the esplanade to chambers

glinting jersey cars 
helicopter blades under a ledge of cloud

alien first descent past the trade towers 
drifting in on the flyway to laguardia

landscape, local, locale the man-made made man

trying to open to something like days' unraveling waves

blue pulled toward fire out toward the skyscraper lights

ancient mausoleums 
upheavals from personal terror

dark pier jut into dark water

turquoise, indigo, aqua, lapis under the molten, under the bruise of night

blood in your lips
as a man i violated the boundary of your mouth

i say this because in the phantasmagoria 
i was woman and man

in another story you turn men to stone

though here, out of narrative, poignant at morton street against the twilight

incomprehensible rain under sun

heap-leached haze-gold fused into evening 
water's green-grey dense pliance

shadowed face that bends to the shadows to drink and be salvaged

tiered buildings like vast titanics 
yellow truck-trailer's anonymous corpse conjoined to the numberless

a boy swept from the rocks at the verrazano stanchion 
tomb cold draining past liberty

it need not cohere but how could it not? 
without context, for which all are accountable

this is for you of the future one was here who is gone, into the eigen levels


something expired. at the turning, 
a spirit was gone. that which was 
turned to sepia high collars, punting, 
waxed mustaches, parasols. 

from bridges, children stared in the river 
and felt themselves, also, halved. 
old manners were patently over. 
new manners had not yet arrived. 

the old, without waiting to speak 
their parting lines in the act, 
learned to exit the way of pipe-smoke. 
uttered nothing. utter tact. 

steamy ghosts rose from horses' 
maws as they champed at their bits. 
the ladies reached for their purses. 
the gentlemen tipped their hats.


my notebook has remained blank for months 
thanks to the light you shower 
around me. i have no use 
for my pen, which lies 
languorously without grief. 

nothing is better than to live 
a storyless life that needs 
no writing for meaning-- 
when i am gone, let others say 
they lost a happy man, 
though no one can tell how happy i was.


        after the fourth of july

on this night of the mid-   
summer festival of fire,   
where liquid explosives   
look like the arch and ache   
of the willow tree   

so near your grave, on this   
night of the awaiting mid-   
wife who lulled you in-   
to this world, the light   
all violet because the earth and stars   
inclined toward each other,   
she also sleeps, she who was   
your first deliverer, guiding you out   

of your mother--her bluing   
skin no small sign of the future   
cyanosis of her spirit for no   
small journey was it to this   
country to bring you to birth   
in this torch   

song heat and an anthem of a free 
nation's conception of combustions   
rosins, petroleum, tallow, arsenic   
and worse, as you, too, fell from the sky   

of her body with me   
a microscopic egg inside--   
half the composition   
that made up my own   
toss and tumble to this crash   
of ground i sit over and bless   
while you lie under, under   
the willow, under this world   
that no midwife   
nor wavelength can under-   
standably reach. so i stand   

in this over-   
determined fire forced out   
like bullets upon a target--   
the pulled trigger releasing   
the hammer that strikes   
the impacted mixture--   
hailstorm and hymn   

of memories. and the outstretched womb   
involutes and the abdominal wall tightens   
and inside all abandoned encasements   
the night over the day darkens.


the long road south, the pavement flat   
and black as a dash without end, no signs,   

no houses, the heat like an unseen fog   
and the sun a swollen crimson clot 

above fields where frazzle-haired palm trees rose   
sporadic and unwieldy, the miles   

of pasture where cattle of every conceivable   
color, rust and tobacco and ashen, fed   

and nursed their stumbling young,   
heavy heads bent to the ground.   

and insects that crashed against windshield   
so tiny, no body was left behind.   

then a wooden shack where we stopped to pee    
and the shock of iron-red flecks against   

bowl, the water placid, unmoved.   
there was hardly any pain.   

what could we do but continue on   
as scattered street-lamps gradually revealed   

a landscape inhabited once again the still      
shuttered windows of bungalows pink   

as scrubbed flesh, the small dark yards of abandoned   
bigwheels and plots of petunias or cukes,   

the closed, expectant mailboxes   
and the living already dead inside me.


 in the metro toronto zoo
he pads on grassy banks behind a fence,
          with measured paces slow and tense.

          beyond his cage his thoughts are sharp and white
                  he lives a compelled anchorite.

                  a solid ghost gone blind with all the green,
                              he waits and waits to be unseen.

                                                         -for paul strong


i call and hear your voice   

on the answering machine   

weeks after your death,   

a fledgling ghost still longing   

for human messages.   


shall i leave one, telling   

how the fabric of our lives   

has been ripped before   

but that this sudden tear will not   

be mended soon or easily?   


in your emptying house, others   

roll up rugs, pack books,   

drink coffee at your antique table,   

and listen to messages left   

on a machine haunted   


by the timbre of your voice,   

more palpable than photographs   

or fingerprints. on this first day   

of this first fall without you,   

ashamed and resisting   


but compelled, i dial again   

the number i know by heart,   

thankful in a diminished world   

for the accidental mercy of machines,   

then listen and hang up.


pura vida --costa rican phrase for o.k. or great
such heat it brings the brain back to its basic blank. 
small, recurrent events become the daily news-- 
the white-nosed coati treading the cecropia's 
bending thin branches like sidewalks in the sky, 
the scarlet-rumped tanager flitting like a spark 
in the tinder of dank green, the nodding palm leaves 
perforated like jacquard cards in a code of wormholes, 
the black hawk skimming nothingness over and over. 

what does the world's wide brimming mean, with hunger 
the unstated secret, dying the proximate reality? 
con mucho gusto--the muchness extends to the stars, 
as wet and numerous as larvae underground 
where the ants in their preset patterns scurry and nurture, 
and the queen, immobilized, pours forth her eggs 
in the dark. we are far from oaks and stoplights, 
from england's chill classrooms and tuscany's paved hills. 

for thought is a stridulation, an insect sizzling, 
knit of the moment's headlines and temperate-zone quips, 
viable in the debris of our rotting educations, 
that thatch where peer-groups call each to each in semes 
ecosystematically. great god himself 
wilts with a rise in temperature, a drop in soil acidity, 
a new language in its grimacing opacity. 
the brain's dry buzz revives, a bit, as evening falls.


medical school skeleton 
with domino's pizza man 

         superbowl xxx. and see, strung-out and thin, 
the skeleton has been exposed against 
                           the domino's pizza man, enveloped in 
a black felt background. poor bones, he's been flensed. 
                              that baggy uniform, a backwards cap, 
he's pierced he's heroin chic but he's all grins, 
                        come from the darkness in his rattletrap, 
burlesquer, rake, this rack of candlepins, 
            giving long odds, right here at the front door, 
a real smoothie, with a faint ennui, 
                   and winning the bet he'll be returning for.  
another working stiff,   like you or me. 

profiles anne dancing with skeleton 

                     or was it xxxi? oh well. that's anne. 
and look who's back in this one portrait style, 
               you see, anne's dancing with the pizza man, 
our old friend bonesy, with the killer smile, 
                           doing a sort of earthy, homegrown bop, 
with those dark, bedroom eyes and the cleft chin, 
                                 belting it out like soul with zz top, 
but think about his humble origin, 
             bouyant with life, jouissance, the growing buzz 
about tough prizes won along the way 
                           and toasted. but, then, everybody was. 
becoming much the man you see today.


did they enjoy this, those honorary ancestors 
of ours, whom we may not speak of as indians now, 
but, rather, as native americans? did they, that is, 
have the opportunity to take in such views? 
for there were no roads then, slicing through 
the hills, opening vistas like this. astonishing 
unless, perhaps, they were upon the delaware, 
a kind of road itself. but, otherwise, would not 
the land itself have been an inconvenience, 
the changing leaves an oracle of cruelties 
to come and not, as for the tourists on a bus, 
a postcard to sweep up at a glance and then 
go home to the similar view they own-- 
one stately maple, or two, intensely orange? 
only the birds, may be, might have known 
these colors, the sudden shift of gears from green 
to ocher, umber, brightest yellow, deepest red, 
the colors of the gleeful dead. for birds can fly 
above the trees and see what we see from a bus. 
but is there gladness in their flight? might it 
not as well be night? and indians forgive the word, 
did they delight more than a bird? were there 
esthetes then as now, before the ax, 
the ox, the plow? i must believe there were-- 
and why? because they traded all manhattan 
for a handful of ceramic beads. they knew, 
as we, that a glint of pure bright blue 
is worth a whole october day, or two.


some days i catch a rhythm, almost a song   
in my own breath. i'm alone here   
in brooklyn heights, late morning, the sky   
above the st. george hotel clear, clear   
for new york, that is. the radio playing   
bird flight, parker in his california   
tragic voice fifty years ago, his faltering   
lover man just before he crashed into chaos.   
i would guess that outside the recording studio   
in burbank the sun was high above the jacarandas,   
it was late march, the worst of yesterday's rain   
had come and gone, the sky washed blue. bird   
could have seen for miles if he'd looked, but what   
he saw was so foreign he clenched his eyes,   
shook his head, and barked like a dog--just once--   
and then howard mcghee took his arm and assured him   
he'd be ok. i know this because howard told me   
years later that he thought bird could   
lie down in the hotel room they shared, sleep   
for an hour or more, and waken as himself.   
the perfect sunlight angles into my little room   
above willow street. i listen to my breath   
come and go and try to catch its curious taste,   
part milk, part iron, part blood, as it passes   
from me into the world. this is not me,   
this is automatic, this entering and exiting,   
my body's essential occupation without which   
i am a thing. the whole process has a name,   
a word i don't know, an elegant word not   
in english or yiddish or spanish, a word   
that means nothing to me. howard truly believed   
what he said that day when he steered   
parker into a cab and drove the silent miles   
beside him while the bright world   
unfurled around them filling stations, stands   
of fruits and vegetables, a kiosk selling trinkets   
from mexico and the philippines. it was all   
so actual and western, it was a new creation   
coming into being, like the music of charlie parker   
someone later called glad, though that day   
i would have said silent, the silent music   
of charlie parker. howard said nothing.   
he paid the driver and helped bird up two flights   
to their room, got his boots off, and went out   
to let him sleep as the afternoon entered   
the history of darkness. i'm not judging   
howard, he did better than i could have   
now or then. then i was , working   
on the loading docks at railway express,   
coming day by day into the damaged body   
of a man while i sang into the filthy air   
the yiddish drinking songs my zadie taught me   
before his breath failed. now howard is gone,   
eleven long years gone, the sweet voice silenced.   
the subtle bridge between eldridge and navarro,   
they later wrote, all that rising passion   
a footnote to others. i remember in '   
walking the halls of cass tech, the high school   
where he taught after his performing days,   
when suddenly he took my left hand in his   
two hands to tell me it all worked out   
for the best. maybe he'd gotten religion,   
maybe he knew how little time was left,   
maybe that day he was just worn down   
by my questions about parker. to him bird   
was truly charlie parker, a man, a silent note   
going out forever on the breath of genius   
which now i hear soaring above my own breath   
as this bright morning fades into afternoon.   
music, i'll call it music. it's what we need   
as the sun staggers behind the low gray clouds   
blowing relentlessly in from that nameless ocean,   
the calm and endless one i've still to cross.


it's been two thousand years now that, with a wounded leg,   
the god's amazing loves have dragged along.   

he has aged. soon   
he won't be noticed except from way up in a plane   
in the markings of wheat   
that yield the trace   
of an ancient sanctuary.   

he solicits a language of caresses,   
open pasture, available bodies,   

and the words refuse, and this elsewhere is already in his death   
except for a slender purple flower under the sun.   

he can still act the god all around,   
evening's worn heart.   

he guesses the flower will slip   
fragile   
from one century to the next with its prayer.



       always the evening noises, the footsteps on the stairs, the day that rises in the throat. 
       a turn of the key will expel the world. 
       against the extinct forest of furniture, the channeled bloodstream translates the dream into this small life. 

       in the end we shrink until finally we can no longer inhabit the gestures of our childhood. 

       a nail in a board the remains of a fence blurred memory of the mountain that raised the tree, that brooded over its ore. 

       modest against a hedge, a spade dreams its beautiful death. 
       simple and calm, nourished on weeds and wind, the image moves, distilling its own memory. far off, we disappear into the ochre and the gold, the mud-brown and the primordial green.

       the slightest evidence of life. in the courtyard's silence, the barking of that dog. a shutter, merely, that's banging. those books stacked in one corner of the room. everything that, ordinarily, follows its automated course. and there, all at once the happiness that spreads its billion pinpricks through the body.

        evening's voice unreels its argument. five floors below, the courtyard and its echoes. the barking still, and overhead the footsteps of regret in the maids' rooms. i'll try to have given each thing my word before giving in to sleep. 

       the room breathes deeply the music of a quartet. it's that grave well-being, unexpectedly, you know? 
       nobody. you may speak. i'm not there. 

       a gesture the garden diffuses the pale green taste of currants. one remains quiet as long as possible.
       another gesture the sun rips open the scent of the lindens. childhood leaps over the wall. 
       the miracle would be having something to say. 

       maybe we could have inhabited that smile, over there, at the other end of the room or else we could have met at the improbable dawn of memory. maybe we could have fallen asleep in the twilight of this autumn when the brain is nothing more than oak and leather.
       but we have only this thin life to place beneath the axe. 

       the crows in the plowed field, black against the field's ochre, gleaming and black amid the smell of moist earth, a smell mixed with the brush and bark and roots that the wind returns as someone somewhere burns them. 
       and then that pile of words that rots with helplessness.

       in the forest, the sound, dry and brief, of a pebble in a streambed, fallen after patient millennia into the earth's darkness. just a dry sound and its echo, quickly engulfed by birdcalls. and later, on the path, drops of blood from the trees. 

       a farmer carriers his tools slowly toward the shed. in the atmospheric silence, a woodpecker registers the sound of its life's work. that's all. some animals, a pile of wood, and the smell of rain, which always calls to mind something that can't quite be reconstructed. 

       acrid smoke and then that crackling of the woods in the clearing. a few centimeters above the cut weeds, the tenuous vapor of memory. 
       between eyelashes, amid the colors of the woods, the colors of weeds, and earth, that sky, that patch of sky, that sky. 

       the courtyard, the wood bench, the sputtering of the fishpond, the smell of humus, the smell of mushroom. 
       five notes in the rain sketch the presence of a bird. 

       the village, the morning, belong to the birds. images flow freely through the alleys. silence full of events the eyes prey on a shadow. a gull's passing reshapes all the shores of the world. 

       birdcalls cut through the fog, wet grass morning. the rectangle of a wall says blank, nothing else. on the horizon, very nearby, a woman dressed in black glides silently across her wide open destiny. 

       between branches, near the sun, the moon, which opens the night to the night. i sink, gently, and disappear. on the surface, alone, the cry of an owl keeps watch. 

       the stairs, the brass doorknob, the smell of dark corners. the iron bed, the red bedspread. slow breathing. that song that waits for nothing but our melody. 

       we are of the morning, of the gently sloping hour that comes slowly down from the sun. the old clothes in the corner are tinged with the morning's color, which will have to be worn. the lark's song widens the silence. 

       deep in the forest, the cuckoo, the woodpecker, the chiaroscuro of ancient musics. heavy wagons clench their signal-lights toward the heights of the opaque sky. i moved with closed words across the homeland that sleeps me. 

       from this far country, where you respond to me without my hearing a word of yours, without perhaps my words ever reaching you, from this country where perhaps we understand each other, i overhear the most contradictory noises, which veil and deny your voice, and which would like to make me believe that i'm speaking alone.


often 
when he was advancing 
feeling his way in the night 
he was doubtful      rebelled 
wanted to climb back up 
to the old light 

but a force held him 
enjoined him 
to pursue 
to venture 
once more 
once again 
into the thickest darkness 
of his shadow 

one day 
at the height of his distress 
emptied of all force 
driven to see that 
the inaccessible would not yield 
he admitted that he must 
renounce it 

to his great surprise 
without his having 
to take a single step 
he crossed the threshold 
came into the light


whitecaps surge in from some infinite distance 
rocks, grottoes, clay stridencies beneath the storm 
amalgams of sea-wrack and brownish moss 
each tide pushes forth its flesh-antennae 
the persistent squid stretches its arms, wave-crests 
cave in, everything gives way to sand 
which silently drinks up the acid, cold red sweat 
those children launched in assault against the waves 
how could they turn their heads 
back toward those who've brought them this far 
to be taken even farther in their turn 
they passed though the crowd, laughing 
or crying without telling the password 
they've passed, the ferret runs and runs 
memory, the battlefield nurse, can barely 
triage the rarest ones 
whose heat shifts at the crater's edge 
yet they give our trajectory 
its dreamlike depth the whole chain 
coils up in our smallest cells 
and in a lifetime time annuls itself


les plantes et les plantes

du mme soleil les btes

naines ou gantes sont

plants and planets 

plants and planets 
obey the same heaven 
as beasts and men 
are nourished by the same sun 

and the metal in the mine

sulphurous flowers so delicate 
they live in every corpuscule. 

dwarves and giants are   
powder and dust thrown far 
without fall or check whirl 
to the four cornerless, angleless 

worlds, peopled with angels, 
but others say not at all. 
their worlds seem   
fired from a cannon, 

fired by whom by chance, 
this expanding consequence, 
the fruit of some grapeshot 
without any intelligence.


you should have heard the soldiers' feet
wounding the swirls that the accordion waltz
left on the pavement like a mower's swath
once the parade had passed
you should have kissed the soldiers' feet
pulled out of their boots and licked the ankles
and climbed as far as the khaki
seven and a half millimeters thick would allow
you should have shaken their belly like a carpet
it was grand illusion day
when they escape their deep knowledge
and pretend to look for handsome successors
but it would be better to look for the heart
and put an alarm clock in its place
that could play reveille like a puppet
but wouldn't serve coffee in bed
you should have rummaged under their false teeth
to hunt for hidden diamonds with lively fingers
hunt for them everywhere not find them
even in the creases of their nakedness.
joy of being a child of the sovereign people
of lending a hand to institutions
and seeing one's name inscribed on the slate
of urinals in letters of coal tar
for a single flag that one has become
flapping its boredom at the angles of two streets
that the wind stirs unless it's first
the wind of trumpets all love to the winds


you let your shirt hang down
putting on airs of cuffs
at the edge of ending night
like the end of a java with double ritournelles
or the way the canaries in the cage of still-closed mornings
were singing that it mattered little
to them that their windows were open
the stones the paving stones the door-frames the armatures
the window-frames the sheets of the bed clothes in their colors
were beating the dawn along with us
better drums than your belly
better drumsticks than my fingers
and the trees and the roofs the river and its bridges
the clear distances of the city the factories without smoke
bathed as at their birth stammered
a trial hello
that only ended however
in this word round as a doubloon
placed on the edge of that day
by a considerate friend
the sun on your arms naked against my cheeks
hello i said to you
the day of quatorz'juillet


					
					le regard bleu  nous connaissons par ou-dire l'existence de l'amour.  assis sur un rocher ou sous un parasol rouge, allongs dans le pr bourdonnant d'insectes, les deux mains sous la nuque, agenouills dans la fracheur et l'obscurit d'une glise, ou tasss sur une chaise de paille entre les quatre murs de la chambre, tte basse, les yeux fixs sur un rectangle de papier blanc, nous rvons  des estuaires, des tumultes, des ressacs, des embellies et des mares. nous coutons monter en nous le chant inpuisable de la mer qui dans nos ttes afflue puis se retire, comme revient puis s'loigne le curieux dsir que nous avons du ciel, de l'amour, et de tout ce que nous ne pourrons jamais toucher des mains.    la mer en nous essaie des phrases.  depuis des lustres, la mme voix pelle le mme alphabet dans le mme cerveau d'enfant. elle balbutie des mots vite envols, accrochs aux herbes des plages,  la peau brunie des baigneurs,  la proue des barques, aux mtures. des mots quelconques, pour rien et pour quiconque. il n'y est question que de l'amour. c'est pourquoi nous ne savons trop que dire et souffrons que le regard d'autrui s'attarde sur notre visage quand nous voudrions qu'il se pose  mme notre cur. nos lvres sont si maladroites, notre corps invisible dans la nuit opaque, et nos mains mal-habiles, des clairs ou des ailes pourtant au bout des doigts.   
from a story of blue
 the blue look  we know through hearsay that love exists.  seated on a rock or under a red parasol, lying in the field buzzing with insects, our hands clasped behind our necks, kneeling in the cool darkness of a church, or settled on a straw chair within the four walls of the bedroom, head lowered, eyes fixed on a rectangle of white paper, we dream of estuaries, tumultuous surf, clearing weather and tides. we listen to the inexhaustible chant of the sea within us, as it rises and falls in our heads, like the approach and retreat of the strange desire we have for heaven, for love, and all that we cannot touch with our hands.    within us the sea tries out sentences.  from time immemorial, the same voice spells the same alphabet in the same child's brain. it mutters words which quickly fly off, snagged on the sea grasses, on the bathers' browned skin, on the bows of boats, on the masts. ordinary words, for nothing and no one in particular. it is only about love. this is why we hardly know what to say and we suffer when someone's gaze fixes on our face, when we would like it to look into our heart. our lips are so awkward, our body invisible in the opaque night, and our hands inept, yet lightening flashes or wings are at our fingertips.
				

 

the street i walk along i often see   
as if i'd long since left the moving surface   
of the world for the endless other side that disperses   
us all some day without return but free   

of care. i apply myself so well to this fragile proceeding   
that very quickly my gaze ceases to be   
part of the cloudy clump of hope and memory   
i'll have given my name to. but for this to succeed,   

a feeling of absolute happiness has to make   
itself felt, as if from outside me, so much   
that at that moment the very street has a hunch   
that it, the entire city, and its uncertain space   

have become one with the mobile but faithful pattern   
of phrases written by our steps when we move about.   
i no longer know who's walking and marking out   
the ground, bit by bit, to the corner. my gaze then patterns   

itself on tomorrow's unknown eyes, which will shine   
when from the roofs, posthumous and vague, mine glow,   
and my invisible trace on the asphalt below    
might guide the lan of hardier passersby.   

will they know what i sometimes suspect what appears   
to be the distracted gaze with which we see   
the world is the world itself?--it sees and hears   
itself through the thin transparency of our screens.


parmi beaucoup de pomes 
il y en avait un 
dont je ne parvenais pas  me souvenir 
sinon que je l'avais compos
autrefois 
en descendant cette rue 
du ct des numros pairs de cette rue 
baigne d'une matine limpide 
une rue de petites boutiques persistantes 
entre la seine sinistre et l'hpital 
un pome crit avec mes pieds 
comme je compose toujours les pomes
en silence et dans ma tte et en marchant 
mais je ne me souviens de rien 
que de la rue de la lumire et du hasard 
qui avait fait entrer dans ce pome 
le mot respect 
que je n'ai pas l'habitude de faire vibrer 
dans les pages mentales de la posie
au-del   de lui il n'y a rien 
et ce mot ce mot qui ne bouge pas 
atteste la cessation de la rue 
comme un arbre oubli de l'espace 


among many poems 

among many poems 
there was one 
which i couldn't remember 
except having made it up 
long ago 
while going down that street 
on the even-numbered side of that street 
bathed in a limpid morning 
a street of little shops still lasting 
between the hospital and the wounded seine 
a poem written with my feet 
as i always make up my poems 
in silence and in my head while walking 
but i remember nothing 
except the street the light and the chance 
that had caused the entry in the poem 
of the word respect 
that i don't usually set resounding 
in poetry's mental pages 
beyond it there is nothing 
and this word this unmoving word   
awaits the ending of the street 
like a tree space has forgotten


in a rush this weekday morning,

i tap the horn as i speed past the cemetery 

where my parents are buried

side by side beneath a slab of smooth   granite. 


then, all day, i think of him rising up 

to give me that look 

of knowing disapproval 

while my mother calmly tells him to lie back down.


from the point of view of all time, 
these recent changes signal 
more a return to nature 
than a departure, than degradation. 
in the beginning, after all, 
there was boiling rock. 
then waters arranging their bodies 
around an era of softer forms 
lichen, grassland, swaying treetops. 
then creatures, movingly fleshed, 
treading pathways that hardened. 
then pavement hardening 
and cities, monumental. 
soon mostly rock again, 
and radiant. more and more like moon. 
soon, sooner than is being thought, 
there will be even more light. 
the creatures will have stopped 
being able to move 
or be moved. 
and the rock will boil.


when fall brought the graders to atlas road, 
i drove through gray dust thick as a battle 
and saw the ditch freshly scattered with   gravel. 

leveling, shaving on the bevel, the blade 
and fanged scraper had summoned sleepers-- 
limestone loaves and blue slate, skulls of quartz 

not even early freeze had roused. some rocks 
were large as buckets, others just a scone 
tumbled up and into light the first time 

in ages. loose, sharp, they were a hazard 
to anyone passing. so i gathered 
what i could, scooped them into the bed 

and trucked my freight away under birdsong 
in my own life's autumn. i was eager 
to add to the snaggled wall bordering 

my single acre, to be safe, to be still 
and watch the planet's purposeful turning 
behind a cairn of roughly balanced stones. 

uprooted, scarred, weather-gray of bones, 
i love their old smell, the familiar unknown. 
to be sure this time i know where i belong 

i have brought, at last, the vagrant road home.


to remind myself
i   

make a place to sit down.   
sit down. be quiet.   
you must depend upon   
affection, reading, knowledge,   
skill--more of each   
than you have--inspiration,   
work, growing older, patience,   
for patience joins time   
to eternity. any readers   
who like your poems,   
doubt their judgment.   

 ii   

breathe with unconditional breath   
the unconditioned air.   
shun electric wire.   
communicate slowly. live   
a three-dimensioned life   
stay away from screens.   
stay away from anything   
that obscures the place it is in.   
there are no unsacred places   
there are only sacred places   
and desecrated places.   

 iii   

accept what comes from silence.   
make the best you can of it.   
of the little words that come   
out of the silence, like prayers   
prayed back to the one who prays,   
make a poem that does not disturb   
the silence from which it came.


it's the other ones, who soon enough return   
to being happy after the funeral, that are nearest   
to their own deaths--in their gaiety   
and everyday distraction, they're so open   

and unguarded . . . anything could enter them   
could claim them. it's the ones who weep   
incessantly that are saved for now, the ones   
who have taken a little of it   

into their systems this is how   
inoculation works. and sorrow is difficult,   
a job it requires time to complete.   
and the tears?--the salt   

of the folk saying,   
that gets sprinkled over the tail feathers   
and keeps a bird from flying   
keeps it stationed in this world.


national museum of scotland
on the ground floor called beginnings, 
a fertility stone is displayed   
in the diamond-hard blue halogen,   
a line etching of an erection   
with two equal circles, as one sees   
in graffitti in the underground.   
the stone is attributed to the picts,   
of whom history says little,   
besides the latin picti,   
painted people, tattooed.   
when set side by side   
with latin engravings   
and roman military hardware,   
the artifact makes them   
seem pitiful. in the museum   
you rise through time,   
the text written in first   
person plural as if all   
who enter are complicitous   
with the articles of defiance,   
robert the bruce, the long   
unveering heredity of defeat,   
the room of thumbscrews   
and the maiden for severing   
heretical heads of witches,   
upward to the reformation,   
then the rout of the highlanders   
and the exile of the bonnie prince,   
until the museum seems   
like a deep well where   
the fertility stone   
of the painted people   
rests at its bottom,   
universal hieroglyph   
on which someone made a wish.


    where two streams joined, we met 
by accident, sitting upon an outcropping of rock 
with only the intent of watching 
water flow beneath unwinding water. 
    facing up-stream, she held a flower 
to the sun as i leaned back and found 
an arrowhead inside a crevice, which lay there 
as if someone had left it by intent 
as an excuse for me to speak above the whirl of water 
swirling upon stone and thus 
transform the accident of meeting her--
ablaze in sunlight with a flower in her hand--
into stark fact as obdurate as rock. 
    could i have called, look at this arrowhead 
i just found here would she have thought 
an accident, that's credible,
or feared that my intent was sinister, 
and that the implication of the arrowhead, 
unlike the radiant white flower or 
the two streams merging into faster water, 
casting up colored spume, 
had been contrived by me, certain as rock 
that forms by geologic laws? 
    she had to know an arrowhead 
is humanly designed with the intent to kill, 
though now it's harmless as a flower 
decorating someone's hair, 
or water organized into a garden fountain. 
an arrowhead can now be used 
as an adornment for a necklace 
like a flower in a painting where a stream 
leaps past a light-reflecting rock 
with nothing in a brush-stroke left to accident. 
    and so our accidental meeting on the rock 
flowed by, a flower cast upon the water 
with intent unknown, and all 
that's left now is the arrowhead.


i, as sinned against as sinning, 
take small pleasure from the winning 
of our decades-long guerrilla war. 
for from my job i've wanted more 
than victory over one who'd tried 
to punish me before he died, 
and now, neither of us dead, 
we haunt these halls in constant dread 
of drifting past the other's life 
while long-term memory is rife 
with slights that sting like paper cuts. 
we've occupied our separate ruts 
yet simmered in a single rage. 
we've grown absurd in middle age 
together, and should seek wisdom now 
together, by ending this row. 
i therefore decommission you 
as constant flagship of my rue. 
below the threshold of my hate 
you now my good regard may rate. 
for i have let my anger pass. 
but, while you're down there, kiss my ass.


thank you but 

not just at the moment 


i know you will say 

i have said that before 

i know you have been 

there all along somewhere 

in another time zone 


i studied once 

those beautiful instructions 

when i was young and 

far from here 

they seemed distant then 

they seem distant now 

from everything i remember 


i hope they stayed with you 

when the noose started to tighten 

and you could say no more 

and after wisdom 

and the days of iron 

the eyes started from your head 


i know the words 

must have been set down 

partly for yourself 

unjustly condemned after 

a good life 


i know the design 

of the world is beyond 

our comprehension 

thank you 

but grief is selfish and in 

the present when 

the stars do not seem to move 

i was not listening 


i know it is not 

sensible to expect 

fortune to grant her 

gifts forever 

i know


go home. it's never what you think it is, 
the kiss, the diamond, the slamdance pulse in the wrist. 
nothing is true, my dear, not even this 

rumor of passion you'll doubtless insist 
on perceiving in my glance. please just 
go. home is never what you think it is. 

meaning lies in meaning's absence. the mist 
is always almost just about to lift. 
nothing is truer. dear, not even this 

candle can explain its searing twist 
of flame mounted on cool amethyst. 
go on home--not where you think it is, 

but where you would expect its comfort least, 
in still-black stars our century will miss 
seeing. nothingness is not as true as this 

faith we grind up with denial grist 
to the midnight mill morning's catalyst. 
come, let's go home, wherever you think it is. 
nothing is true, my dear. not even this.


piraeus archeological museum
on the journey to the mundane afterlife, 
you travel equipped to carry on your trade 
a bronze, small-toothed saw to make repairs, 
the stylus and the ink pot and the scraper, 
wax tablets bound into a little book. 

here is the tortoise shell for the cithara, 
bored through with holes for strings, natural sound box. 
here is the harp's wood triangle, all empty--
the sheep-gut having long since decomposed 
into a pure pythagorean music. 

the beeswax, frangible with centuries, 
has puzzled all your lyrics into silence. 
i think you were a poet of perfection 
who fled still weighing one word with another, 
since wax forgives and warms beneath revision.


in a hut far from the village   
li hua bends over his canvas   
like an insect.   

he is so deliberate,   
each stroke is a spider's legs   
fighting the current.   

there is a war in his veins,   
a battle of desires.   
he is jealous of li po   
whose pictures glide   
like the moon over dark water.   

i do not wish   
to disturb him   
as he tries to make art   
in this time of death,   

so i will wait,   
like a fly on the tip of a stick,   
until he is finished.


you could grow into it,   
that sense of living like a dog,   
loyal to being on your own in the fur of your skin,   
able to exist only for the sake of existing.   

nothing inside your head lasting long enough for you to hold onto,   
you watch your own thoughts leap across your own synapses and disappear-- 
small boats in a wind,   
       fliers in all that blue,   
               the swish of an arm backed with feathers,   
a dress talking in a corner,   
               and then poof,   
       your mind clean as a dog's,   
your body big as the world,   
       important with accident-- 
               blood or a limp, fur and paws.   

you swell into survival,   
       you take up the whole day,   
you're all there is,   
       everything else is   
not you, is every passing glint, is   
       shadows brought to you by wind,   
               passing into a bird's cheep, replaced by a   
                              rabbit skittering across a yard,   
a void you yourself fall into.   

you could make this beautiful,   
       but you don't need to,   
living is this fleshy side of the bone,   
       going on is this medicinal smell of the sun-- 
               no dog ever tires of seeing his life   


keep showing up at the back door   
even as a rotting bone with a bad smell   
feet tottering, he dreams of it,   
wakes and licks no matter what.


a man steps out of sunlight, 
sunlight that streams like grace, 

still gaping at blue sky 
staked across the emptiness of space, 

into a history where shadows 
assume a human face. 

a man slips into silence 
that began as a cry,

still trailing music 
although reduced to the sigh 

of an accordion 
as it folds into its case.


i wanted to go to military school   
and march, i wanted to grow up   
and be composed and expert   
with a rifle, with tactics and fighting,   
to be safe and courageous among men   
in barracks and on the battlefield.   
i wanted to see my arms hairy and   
corded with muscle at the end of rolled up khaki sleeves.   
i wanted to flex my feet in boots and   
look down at the the dust of battles   
dimming the leather surfaces, the blood slick   
on the rim of the soles. i wanted   
the smell of gunpowder in my nostrils, the grime   
on my face, the washed-out hollow   
love for my comrades found in the foxholes,   
the sad understanding, the requiems   
of late afternoons walking away from the burial site   
with the widow as she cradled the triangulated flag   
like a plowblade in her arms.


han-shan sits on a flat stone 
in his garden and plays the flute, 
mimicking the birds singing among 
the gourd vines or from the top 
of the blue pine tree. 

or he constructs a new trellis 
for the rambling rose over his front 
gate or works at the great loom in his porch, 
weaving his own coverlets. 

sometimes, he paints drinking gourds 
to hang at his cold spring. 

his poems, delicate but strong, 
paper the ceiling above his bed, 
so he can lie and read 
his own masterpieces. 

no man, he avers, can catch 
such fish in one basket.


i.  

much too long you say, velox, censorious, 
of my epigrams--that's quite uproarious. 
you write none. your brevity is glorious. 

 

scribere me quereris, velox, epigrammata longa. 
       ipse nihil scribis tu breviora facis? 

vi.  

for my small books rome's gone utterly mad 
i'm quite ubiquitous--call it a fad. 
look, there--see that fellow, leafing, curious. 
first he blushes deeply, then he's furious 
a moment later his eyes glaze over 
he yawns, flips a page, then reels in horror. 
this mercurial response i thrill to see 
why, then my epigrams even please me 

 

laudat, amat, cantat nostros mea roma libellos, 
       meque sinus omnes, me manus omnis habet. 
ecce rubet quidam, pallet, stupet, oscitat, odit. 
       hoc volo nunc nobis carmina nostra placent. 

vii.  

matho's one-word review of my small book 
uneven. i'm supposed to get all shook 
the scribblings of calvinus and umber 
are very even. . . yet how they lumber. 
i swear to you, creticus, i thank god 
my gift is for being quite frankly odd.

 

iactat inaequalem matho me fecisse libellum

       si verum est, laudat carmina nostra matho. 
aequales scribit libros calvinus et umber 
       aequalis liber est, cretice, qui malus est. 

ix.  

you pontificate my talent is small, 
gaurus, because my epigrams are all 
just puny trifles. yet they seem to please, 
i'll confess. they're a veritable breeze 
compared to your epic tome, which rattles, 
in twelve mortal books, o'er priam's battles. 
that makes you big man on campus? oh no 
as statuettes of master carvers glow 
with life, so do my tiny dramas boast 
vital creatures. your giants? clay, at most. 

 

ingenium mihi, gaure, probas sic esse pusillum, 
       carmina quod faciam quae brevitate placent. 
confiteor. sed tu bis senis grandia libris 
       qui scribis priami proelia, magnus homo es? 
nos facimus bruti puerum, nos langona vivum

       tu magnus luteum, gaure, giganta facis. 

iv.  

quite clueless, flaccus, all these sorry folks 
who brand short poems mere badinage and jokes. 
want to know who's more idle? the big boys, 
our epic poets, who rehearse the joys 
of serving human flesh up  la carte--

tereus' bloody banquet or the huge tart 
chez thyestes it's a little gristly. 
or they serve us crap, like how remissly 
daedalus made--with wax, imagine--wings 
for his poor doomed son. then big epic sings 
of arms and the--not man--one-eyed giant? 
polyphemus his brain was far from pliant, 
so homer made him watch sheep in sicily. 
pardon me for carping so pissily, 
flaccus, at insults to my epigrams, 
so far from the bloated whimsy that crams 
our big-assed epics. all men blare in praise 
of these classics, you say, and bask in their rays. 
i will not disagree, but mark my word 
some day, far off, a wise man will be heard 
to say, classics we all want to have read, 
never to read. my books get read instead 

 

nescit, crede mihi, quid sint epigrammata, flacce, 
       qui tantum lusus illa iocosque vocat. 
ille magis ludit qui scribit prandia saevi 
       tereos aut cenam, crude thyesta, tuam, 
aut puero liquidas aptantem daedalon alas, 
       pascentem siculas aut polyphemon ovis. 
a nostris procul est omnis vesica libellis, 
       musa nec insano syrmate nostra tumet. 
illa tamen laudant omnes, mirantur, adorant.

       confiteor laudant illa, sed ista legunt. 

ix. 

read or recited, my verse is much praised, 
aulus, yet one poet opines ill-phrased.

i couldn't care less when i set a table, 
my guests, not the cooks, should say i'm able. 

 

lector et auditor nostros probat, aule, libellos, 
       sed quidam exactos esse poeta negat. 
non nimium curo nam cenae fercula nostrae 
       malim convivis quam placuisse cocis. 

x.  

a whole damned page crammed with verse--so you yawn 
if a poem's too long you move swiftly on 
shorter the better is your golden rule. 
but markets are scoured to make the tongue drool 
a groaning board's set--rich sauces for days--

and yet, dear reader, you want canaps? 
but i don't hunger for diners so prude 
hail meat and potatoes--screw finger food 

 

consumpta est uno si lemmate pagina, transis, 
       et breviora tibi, non meliora placent. 
dives et ex omni posita est instructa macello 
       cena tibi, sed te mattea sola iuvat. 
non opus est nobis nimium lectore guloso 
       hunc volo, non fiat qui sine pane satur. 

xi.  

you there, reader, the over-solemn one, 
take a hike wherever--my verse is spun 
only for blithe, witty cognoscenti 
up for priapic jeux de spree aplenty 
or aroused by bells on harlot's fingers. 
he who in these randy pages lingers--

though more stern than curius or fabricius 
soon gets tingly, and anon lubricious 
then, lo, beneath a toga something pokes. 
my little book's salacious whims and jokes 
will lead even the chastest dames astray 
taken with wine, my lines can make 'em bray 
lucretia, more proper than whom none such, 
peeked between my covers, blushed very much, 
and threw me down but brutus stood glowering. 
brutus, ciao--and back she'll be devouring. 

 

qui gravis es nimium, potes hinc iam, lector, abire 
       quo libet urbanae scripsimus ista togae 
iam mea lampsacio lascivit pagina versu 
       et tartesiaca concrepat aera manu. 
o quotiens rigida pulsabis pallia vena, 
       sis gravior curio fabricioque licet 
tu quoque nequitias nostri lususque libelli 
       uda, puella, leges, sis patavina licet. 
erubuit posuitque meum lucretia librum, 
       sed coram bruto brute, recede leget. 

iv. 

hey, you're stuffed, little book, give it a rest. 
you've reached the end-papers and still have zest 
what on earth makes you yet want to let go, 
when misfire our verse reeked from the get-go? 
zip it, my pages, let's call a time out 
we've hit the back cover--and still you'd spout? 
look, the reader's pissed and quite unimpressed 
even our publisher calls you a pest 
hey, you're stuffed, little book, give it a rest

 

ohe, iam satis, ohe, libelle, 
iam pervenimus usque ad umbilicos. 
tu procedere adhuc et ire quaeris, 
nec summa potes in schida teneri, 
sic tamquam tibi res peracta non sit, 
quae prima quoque pagina peracta est. 
iam lector queriturque deficitque, 
iam librarius hoc et ipse dicit 
ohe, iam satis est, ohe, libelle.


they're tipping their battered derbies and striding forward 
    in step for a change, chipper, self-assured, 
         their cardboard suitcases labeled 
guest of steerage. they've just arrived at the boot camp 
    of the good old french foreign legion 
         which they've chosen as their slice of life 
instead of drowning themselves. once again 
    they're about to become their own mothers and fathers 
         and their own unknowable children 
who will rehearse sad laughter and mock tears, 
    will frown with completely unsuccessful 
         concentration, and will practice the amazement 
of suddenly understanding everything 
    that baffles them and will go on baffling them 
         while they pretend they're only one reel away 
from belonging in the world. their arrival 
    will mark a new beginning of meaningless 
         hostilities with a slaphappy ending. in a moment, 
they'll hear music, and as if they'd known all along 
    this was what they'd come for, they'll put down 
         the mops and buckets given them as charms 
with which to cleanse the sahara and move their feet 
    with a calm, sure, delicate disregard 
         for all close-order drill and begin dancing.




this is what poetry is says the road, 
a laying down of uniform pattern 
across a land you can't control 
but which you think it best to flatten. 
it's far from vivid. look at the whole 
flamboyant forest look at the paths 
that can't be uttered by a mouth 
and at the scattered arcs of light 
more integral to this wide planet 
than words will ever be. your lines? 
like railroad tracks that cut the bracken, 
bring something through, then disappear. 
no one knows what speck was taken 
or where it moved, and no one cares.


we here at progressive health would like to thank you   
for being one of the generous few who've promised   
to bequeath your vital organs to whoever needs them.   

now we'd like to give you the opportunity   
to step out far in front of the other donors   
by acting a little sooner than you expected,   

tomorrow, to be precise, the day you're scheduled   
to come in for your yearly physical. six patients   
are waiting this very minute in intensive care   

who will likely die before another liver   
and spleen and pairs of lungs and kidneys   
match theirs as closely as yours do. twenty years,   

maybe more, are left you, granted, but the gain   
of these patients might total more than a century.   
to you, of course, one year of your life means more   

than six of theirs, but to no one else,   
no one as concerned with the general welfare   
as you've claimed to be. as for your poems-- 

the few you may have it in you to finish-- 
even if we don't judge them by those you've written,   
even if we assume you finally stage a breakthrough,   

it's doubtful they'll raise one lazarus from a grave   
metaphoric or literal. but your body is guaranteed   
to work six wonders. as for the gaps you'll leave   

as an aging bachelor in the life of friends,   
they'll close far sooner than the open wounds   
soon to be left in the hearts of husbands and wives,   

parents and children, by the death of the six   
who now are failing. just imagine how grateful   
they'll all be when they hear of your grand gesture.   

summer and winter they'll visit your grave, in shifts,   
for as long as they live, and stoop to tend it,   
and leave it adorned with flowers or holly wreaths,   

while your friends, who are just as forgetful   
as you are, just as liable to be distracted,   
will do no more than a makeshift job of upkeep.   

if the people you'll see tomorrow pacing the halls   
of our crowded facility don't move you enough,   
they'll make you at least uneasy. no happy future   

is likely in store for a man like you whose conscience   
will ask him to certify every hour from now on   
six times as full as it was before, your work   

six times as strenuous, your walks in the woods   
six times as restorative as anyone else's.   
why be a drudge, staggering to the end of your life   

under this crushing burden when, with a single word,   
you could be a god, one of the few gods   
who, when called on, really listens?


i leave the formal garden of schedules 
where hours hedge me, clip the errant sprigs 
of thought, and day after day, a boxwood 
topiary hunt chases a green fox 
never caught. no voice calls me to order 
as i enter a dream of meadow, kneel 
to earth and, moving east to west, second 
the motion only of the sun. i plant 
frail seedlings in the unplowed field, trusting 
the wildness hidden in their hearts. spring light 
sprawls across false indigo and hyssop, 
daisies, flax. clouds form, dissolve, withhold 
or promise rain. in time, outside of time, 
the unkempt afternoons fill up with flowers.


because someone thirsty enough 
to trust old testament wisdom 
followed the deepening greens 

and found a spring, silver 
in the shadow of blue ridges, 
i can kneel beneath 

this spill of willow 
limbs a century later 
and drink water 

risen from roots 
to enter the evening 
through a spout, the way 

cherokee stories say the first 
people were born, 
washing into the world 

of such trees whose bark, 
like the water i cup 
to my parched mouth, 

tastes leafy and sweet 
and has the power, 
the old ones say, to heal.


do nothing and everything will be done,   
that's what mr. lao tzu said, who walked   
around talking , years ago and   

now his books practically grow on trees   
they're so popular and if he were   
alive today beautiful women would 

rush up to him like waves lapping   
at the shores of his wisdom.   
that's the way it is, i guess humbling. 

but if i could just unclench my fists,   
empty out my eyes, turn my mind into   
a prayer flag for the wind to play with, 

we could be brothers, him the older one   
who's seen and not done it all and me   
still unlearning, both of us slung low 

in our hammocks, our hats tipped   
forwards, hands folded neatly,   
like bamboo huts, above our hearts.


midmorning like a deserted room, apparition 
of armoire and table weights, 
oblongs of flat light, 
                                      the rosy eyelids of lovers 
raised in their ghostly insurrection, 
decay in the compassed corners beating its black wings, 
late june and the lilac just ajar. 

where the deer trail sinks down through the shadows of blue spruce, 
reeds rustle and bow their heads, 
creek waters murmur on like the lamentation of women 
for faded, forgotten things. 
and always the black birds in the trees, 
always the ancient chambers thudding inside the heart. 

                                            

swallow pure as a penknife 
                                                   slick through the insected air. 
swallow poised on the housepost, beakful of mud and a short straw. 
swallow dun-orange, swallow blue, 
                                                                 mud purse and middle arch, 
home sweet home. 
swallow unceasing, swallow unstill 
at sundown, the mother's shade over silver water. 

at the edge of the forest, no sound in the grey stone, 
no moan from the blue lupin. 
the shadows of afternoon 
                                               begin to gather their dark robes 
and unlid their crystal eyes. 
minute by minute, step by slow step, 
like the small hand on a clock, we climb north, toward midnight. 

                                            

i've made a small hole in the silence, a tiny one, 
just big enough for a word. 
and when i rise from the dead, whenever that is, i'll say it. 
i can't remember the word right now, 
but it will come back to me when the northwest wind 
                                                                            blows down off mt. caribou 
the day that i rise from the dead, whenever that is. 

sunlight, on one leg, limps out to the meadow and settles in. 
insects fall back inside their voices, 
little fanfares and muted repeats, 
inadequate language of sorrow, 
                                                            inadequate language of silted joy, 
as ours is. 
the birds join in. the sunlight opens her other leg. 

                                            

at times the world falls away from us 
                                                                     with all its disguises, 
and we are left with ourselves 
as though we were dead, or otherwised, our lips still moving, 
the empty distance, the heart 
like a votive little-red-wagon on top of a child's grave, 
nothing touching, nothing close. 

a long afternoon, and a long rain begins to fall. 
in some other poem, angels emerge from their cold rooms, 
their wings blackened by somebody's dream. 
the rain stops, the robin resumes his post. 
                                                                               a whisper 
out of the clouds and here comes the sun. 
a long afternoon, the robin flying from post back to post. 

                                            

the length of vowel sounds, by nature and by position, 
count out the morning's meters-- 
                                                              bird song and squirrel bark, creek run, 
the housefly's languor and murmurous incantation. 
i put on my lavish robes 
and walk at random among the day's 
                                                                     dactyls and anapests, 
a widening caesura with each step. 

i walk through my life as though i were a bookmark, a holder of place, 
an overnight interruption 
                                                 in somebody else's narrative. 
what is it that causes this? 
what is it that pulls my feet down, and keeps on keeping my eyes 
       fixed to the ground? 
whatever the answer, it will start 
                                                              the wolf pack down from the mountain, 
the raven down from the tree. 

                                            

time gnaws on our necks like a dog 
                                                                  gnaws on a stew bone. 
it whittles us down with its white teeth, 
it sends us packing, leaving no footprints on the dust-dour road. 
that's one way of putting it. 
time, like a golden coin, lies on our tongue's another. 
we slide it between our teeth on the black water, 
                                                                                        ready for what's next. 

the white eyelids of dead boys, like flushed birds, flutter up 
at the edge of the timber. 
domestic lupin crayolas the yard. 
                                                              slow lopes of tall grasses 
southbound in the meadow, hurled along by the wind. 
in wingbeats and increments, 
the disappeared come back to us, the soul returns to the tree. 

                                            

the intermittent fugues of the creek, 
                                                                   saying yes, saying no, 
master music of sunlight 
and black-green darkness under the spruce and tamaracks, 
lull us and take our breath away. 
                                                              our lips form fine words, 
but nothing comes out. 
our lips are the messengers, but nothing can come out. 

after a day of high winds, how beautiful is the stillness of dusk. 
enormous silence of stones. 
illusion, like an empty coffin, that something is missing. 
monotonous psalm of underbrush 
                                                               and smudged flowers. 
after the twilight, darkness. 
after the darkness, darkness, and then what follows that. 

                                            

the unborn own all of this, what little we leave them, 
st. thomas's hand 
                                   returning repeatedly to the wound, 
their half-formed mouths irrepressible in their half-sleep, 
asking for everything, and then some. 
already the melancholy of their arrival 
swells like a sunrise and daydream 
                                                                 over the eastern ridge line. 

inside the pyrite corridors of late afternoon, 
image follows image, clouds 
reveal themselves, 
                                    and shadows, like angels, lie at the feet of all things. 
chambers of the afterlife open deep in the woods, 
their secret hieroglyphics suddenly readable 
with one eye closed, then with the other. 

                                            

one star and a black voyage, 
                                                     drifting mists to wish on, 
bullbats and their lullabye-- 
evening tightens like an elastic around the hills. 
small sounds and the close of day, 
as if a corpse had risen from somewhere deep in the meadow 
and walked in its shadows quietly. 

the mouth inside me with its gold teeth 
begins to open. 
no words appear on its lips, 
                                                     no syllables bubble along its tongue. 
night mouth, silent mouth. 
like drugged birds in the trees, 
                                                          angels with damp foreheads settle down. 
wind rises, clouds arrive, another night without stars.


for christopher merrill
swear by the olive in the god-kissed land-- 
there is no sugar in the promised land. 

why must the bars turn neon now when, love,   
i'm already drunk in your capitalist land? 

if home is found on both sides of the globe, 
home is of course here--and always a missed land. 

the hour's come to redeem the pledge not wholly?   
in fate's long years ago we made a tryst land. 

clearly, these men were here only to destroy,   
a mosque now the dust of a prejudiced land. 

will the doomsayers die, bitten with envy,   
when springtime returns to our dismissed land? 

the prisons fill with the cries of children. 
then how do you subsist, how do you persist, land? 

is my love nothing for i've borne no children? 
i'm with you, sappho, in that anarchist land. 

a hurricane is born when the wings flutter ...   
where will the butterfly, on my wrist, land? 

you made me wait for one who wasn't even there   
though summer had finished in that tourist land. 

do the blind hold temples close to their eyes   
when we steal their gods for our atheist land? 

abandoned bride, night throws down her jewels   
so rome--on our descent--is an amethyst land. 

at the moment the heart turns terrorist, 
are shahid's arms broken, o promised land?


birdsongs that sound like the steady determined tapping 
of a shoemaker's hammer, 
or of a sculptor making tiny ball-peen dents in a silver plate, 
wake me this morning. is it possible the world itself can be happy? the calico cat 
stretches her long body out across the top of my computer monitor, 
yawning, its little primitive head a cave of possibility. 
and i'm ready again 
to try and see accidents, the over and over patterns 
of double-slit experiments a billionfold 
repeated before me. if i had great patience, 
i could try to count the poplar, birch and oak 
leaves in their shifting welter outside my bedroom window 
or the almost infinitesimal trails of thought that flash and flash 
everywhere, as if decaying particles inside a bubble chamber,
windshield raindrops, lake ripples. however, 
instead i go to fry some bacon, crack two eggs 
into the cast-iron skillet that's even older than this house, 
and on the calendar each month another oriental fan 
where the climbing solitary is dwarfed . . . or on dark blue oceans 
minuscular fishing boats bob beneath gigantic waves 
x out the days, including those i've forgotten.


did you sneeze? 
yes, i rid myself of the imposter inside me. 

did you iron your shirt? 
yes, i used the steam of mother's hate. 

did you wash your hands? 
yes, i learned my hygiene from a raccoon. 

i prayed on my knees, and my knees answered with pain. 
i gargled. i polished my shoes until i saw who i was. 
i inflated my rsum by employing my middle name. 

i walked to my interview, early, 
the sun like a ring on an electric stove. 
i patted my hair when i entered the wind of a revolving door. 
the guard said, for a guy like you, it's the th floor. 

the economy was up. flags whipped in every city plaza 
in america. this i saw for myself as i rode the elevator, 
empty because everyone had a job but me. 

did you clean your ears? 
yes, i heard my fate in the drinking fountain's idiotic drivel.

did you slice a banana into your daily mush? 
i added a pinch of salt, two raisins to sweeten my breath. 

did you remember your pen? 
i remembered my fingers when the elevator opened. 

i shook hands that dripped like a dirty sea. 
i found a chair and desk. my name tag said my name. 
through the glass ceiling, i saw the heavy rumps of ceos. 
outside my window, the sun was a burning stove, 
all of us pushing papers 
to keep it going.


how exhilarating it was to march 

along the great boulevards 

in the sunflash of trumpets 

and under all the waving flags--

the flag of ambition, the flag of love. 


so many of us streaming along--

all of humanity, really--

moving in perfect step, 

yet each lost in the room of a private dream. 


how stimulating the scenery of the world, 

the rows of roadside trees, 

the huge curtain of the sky. 


how endless it seemed until we veered 

off the broad turnpike 

into a pasture of high grass, 

headed toward the dizzying cliffs of mortality. 


generation after generation, 

we keep shouldering forward 

until we step off the lip into space. 


and i should not have to remind you 

that little time is given here 

to rest on a wayside bench, 

to stop and bend to the wildflowers, 

or to study a bird on a branch--


not when the young 

are always shoving from behind, 

not when the old keep tugging us forward, 

pulling on our arms with all their feeble strength.


as we sat at the feet of the string quartet,   
in their living room, on a winter night,   
through the hardwood floor spurts and gulps   
and tips and shudders came up, and the candle-scent   
air was thick-alive with pearwood,   
ebony, spruce, poplar, and horse   
howled, and cat skreeled, and then,   
when the grsse fugue was around us, under us,   
over us, in us, i felt i was hearing   
the genes of my birth-family, pulled, keening   
and grieving and scathing, along each other,   
scraping and craving, i felt myself held in that   
woods of hating longing, and i knew   
and knew myself, and my parents, and their parents,   
there--and then, at a distance, i sensed,   
as if it were thirty years ago,   
a being, far off yet, oblique-approaching,   
straying toward, and then not toward,   
and then toward this place, like a wandering dreaming   
herdsman, my husband. and i almost wanted   
to warn him away, to call out to him   
to go back whence he came, into some calmer life,   
but his beauty was too moving to me,   
and i wanted too much to not be alone, in the   
covert, any more, and so i prayed him   
come to me, i bid him hasten, and good welcome.


and place is always and only place
and what is actual is actual only for one time
and only for one place . . .
                              t. s. eliot
the wind cooled as it crossed the open pond 
and drove little waves toward us, 
brisk, purposeful waves 
that vanished at our feet, such energy 
thwarted by so little elevation. 
the wind was endless, seamless, 
old as the earth. 
                           insects came 
to regard us with favor. i felt them alight, 
felt their minute footfalls. 
i was a challenge, an everest . . . 

and you, whom i have heard breathe all night, 
sigh through the water of sleep 
with vestigial gills . . .

a pair of dragonflies drifted past us, silent, 
while higher up two bullet-shaped jets 
dragged their roars behind them 
on unbreakable chains. it seemed a pity 
we'd given up the sky to them, but i understand so little. 
perhaps it was necessary.

all our years together--
and not just together. surely by now 
we have the same blood type, the same myopia. 
sometimes i think we're the same sex, 
the one in the middle of man and woman, 
born of both as every child is.

the waves came to us, one each heartbeat, 
and lay themselves at our feet. 
the swelling goes down. 
the fever cools. 
there, where the hartleys grew lettuce eighty years ago 
bear and beaver, fox and partridge 
den and nest and hunt 
and are hunted. i wish i had the means 
to give all the north back to itself, to let the pines 
rise in the hayfield and the lilacs go wild. 
but then where would we live?

i wanted that hour with you all winter--
i thought of it while i worked, 
before i slept and when i woke, 
a time when the tangled would straighten, 
when contrition would become benediction 
the positive hour, shining like mica. 
at last the wind brought it to us across the pond, 
then took it up again, every last minute.


because the ostracized experience the world 
in ways peculiar to themselves, often seeing it 
clearly yet with such anger and longing 
that they sometimes enlarge what they see, 
she at first saw brigantine as a paradise for gulls. 
she must be a horseshoe crab washed ashore. 

how startling, though, no one knew about her past, 
the scandal with percy, the tragic early deaths, 
yet sad that her frankenstein had become 
just a name, like dracula or satan, something 
that stood for a kind of scariness, good for a laugh. 
she found herself welcome everywhere. 

people would tell her about brigantine castle, 
turned into a house of horror. they thought 
she'd be pleased that her monster roamed 
its dark corridors, making children scream. 
they lamented the day it was razed. 
thus mary shelley found herself accepted 

by those who had no monster in them --
the most frightening people alive, she thought. 
didn't they know frankenstein had abandoned 
his creation, set him loose without guidance 
or a name? didn't they know what it feels like 
to be lost, freaky, forever seeking who you are? 

she was amazed now that people believed 
you could shop for everything you might need. 
she loved that in the dunes you could almost hide. 
at the computer store she asked an expert 
if there was such a thing as too much knowledge, 
or going too far? he directed her to a website 

where he thought the answers were. 
yet mary shelley realized that the pain she felt 
all her life was gone. could her children, dead so young, 
be alive somewhere, too? she couldn't know 
that only her famous mother had such a chance. 
she was almost ready to praise this awful world.


what became of the dear   
strands of hair pressed   
against the perspiration   
of your lover's brow   
after lovemaking as you gazed   
into the world of those eyes,   
now only yours?   

what became of any afternoon   
that was so vivid you forgot   
the present was up to its old   
trick of pretending   
it would be there   
always?   

what became of the one   
who believed so deeply   
in this moment he memorized   
everything in it and left   
it for you?


there are, of course, theories 
about the wide-eyed, drop-jawed 
fascination children have for them, 
about how, before he's learned 
his own phone number or address, 
a five-year-old can carry 
like a few small stones 
the latin tonnage of those names, 
the prefixes and preferences 
for leaf or meat. 

my son recites the syllables 
i stumble over now, 
sets up figures as i did 
years ago in his prehistory. 
here is the green ski slope 
of a brontosaur's back, 
there a triceratops in full 
gladiator gear. from the arm 
of a chair a pterodactyl 
surveys the dark primeval carpet. 

each has disappeared from time 
to time, excavated finally 
from beneath a cabinet 
or the sofa cushions, only 
to be buried again among its kind 
in the deep toy chest, 
the closed lid snug as earth. 
the next time they're brought out 
to roam the living room 
another bone's been found 

somewhere, a tooth or fragment 
of an eggshell dusted off, 
brushing away some long-held notion 
about their life-span 
or intelligence, warm blood 
or cold. on the floor 
they face off as if debating 
the latest find, what part 
of which one of them 
has been discovered this time. 

or else they stand abreast 
in one long row, side 
by scaly side, waiting to fall 
like dominoes, my son's 
tossed tennis ball a neon yellow 
asteroid, his shadow a dark cloud 
when he stands, his fervor for them 
cooling so slowly he can't feel it-- 
the speed of glaciers, maybe, 
how one age slides into the next.


        carpaccio, san giorgio degli schiavoni, venice
you are amazed to find trees in venice --
to turn a corner into a campo
where two or three rustling acacias
spread their halo of leaves
over two or three red-slatted benches.
it's as if you had slipped through a curtained doorway
into a hall full of dull gold scenes
by carpaccio -- a miraculous light --
though the rio's still shrouded in a mist
compounded of water vapour and smog
so it's not that the sun has come out, it's
something to do with the leaves and painting

in the realm of echoes where footsteps
reverberate endlessly between two walls
and dawn is the chink of a stonemason
at his reparations, disembodied
voices irresistible as bird calls.
yes, you're amazed to find trees in venice
shedding their gold leaf onto the pavement
outside a secondhand bookstore.
it's like carpaccio's little white dog
wagging his tail at the feet of saint augustine
who is staring out of the window
looking for the voice of saint jerome.


santa maria assunta, torcello
mater dolorosa, here i am hungry
and ill-disposed on worn flags at your feet.
through high windows wintry sun seeps in
and floods the six-tiered polychrome apocalypse,
this sunday's text in comic strip.

that's my son over by the door, impatient
to be off somewhere. other boys pose
on attila's throne while their fathers snap pictures
and mothers price lace - clotheslines of lace
strung from trucks selling pizzas.

around the lagoon, your fields have grown wild
vines redden on half-fallen fences
that no longer keep the allotments apart.
on some islands the women make lace, punti in aria - stitches in air -  
materializing the spaces between things.


how strange my lack of faith must seem to you. 
i see the way your god provides a cradle for your grief 
how lovely to be certain that the ancient story's true. 

you sang the hymns as if each word were new--
at last, you sang, at last in your  eternal arms i'll find relief 
how strange my lack of faith must seem to you--

while i kept drifting, lost in the refrains and in the blue 
fragility the tinted glass provided us to bow beneath 
how lovely to be certain that the ancient story's true. 

beneath that moderated sky we rose and sang and cried on cue 
familiar words were read to keep our sorrow brief 
how sad my lack of faith must seem to you 

the book upon the altar and the hymnals in each pew 
held pages edged in fine gold leaf--
how lovely seeing that the ancient story's true--

and i was wondering just what it cost to see this vaulting through 
the ceilings, windows, ornament the engineering of belief . . . 

but let my lack of faith seem strange to you 
you're lovely certain that the ancient story's true.


it's not exile, homes and families behind 
us, where we meet. it happens anywhere, 
               now a stateless 
state of no name, quietly seceding 
from the crumbling empires round us, 

without stamps or eurovision entries. 
no-one does it with a rough guide in a week. 
               you inhabit it 
or nothing. like this in a pavement cafe 
you blink and you seem to surprise them, 

the crowd, all its separate faces at once, 
coming out of solution like crystals, 
               like a rush of starlings 
or the breeze that lifts the canvas awning 
now and dents your cappuccino froth 

with a crisp little sound. and that's it 
between breaths, just between you and me 
               as if yes, 
qed. you are received. this is 
the freedom of the city, and the key 

to the kingdom, and its borders ripple 
outwards like a frill of breaking wave 
               onto flat sand, 
a wavering line already fading leaving 
spume-flecks high and dry, 

a prickling on your palm you're five 
years old, looking up at the whole sea, 
               unsure 
                            will you laugh or cry?


offshore, the apocalypse   
stays contained   
to one island and its church.   

venice's ruler's out wedding   
himself to the ocean   

while i'm ankle deep   
in the adriatic,   
eyes raised to a book   

unencumbered by words a bible   
that reads from east to west. guidebooks   
want only   

to see it as ceiling--the basilica   
san marco,   

where christ's hands open on wounds   
embedded with rubies, and priests   

hold back the sea with brooms.   
i'm taking on incense,   

bowing at altars dragged out   
of constantinople,   
sloshing across marble   
sacked from jerusalem.   

offshore, the sea's a bride bought   
with a fist full of diamonds   
the doge throws into the deep-- 

a sign of his true and perpetual dominion.   

then why does walking into this church   
mean stepping into the ocean?   
the sea is a dog-- 
priests throw in bones just to placate it.   

the year's nearly ,   
but the millennium already hit once   

on the island torcello,   
a kind of plague the venetians contained.   
 years,   

and the dead still crawl from dirt   
towards their radiant bodies,   
they still gather up   

missing limbs arms, legs, hands   
sharks and beasts keep regurgitating.   

we do what we know-- 
but christ never wanted to manage   
resurrections in venice.   

underdressed in the flesh   
from dead civilizations,   
he moves among us in byzantine skin.   

i'm getting close to this god   
worshiped only by tourists.   

he picks at the wounds   
on his crucified body, the injury   
scabbed over with jewels.


as far as clocks--and it is time to think of them--
i have one on my kitchen shelf and it is 
flat, with a machine-made flair, a perfect 
machine from , at the latest, 
and made of shining plastic with the numbers 
sharp and clear and slightly magnified in 
that heartbreaking post-war style, the cord 
too short, though what does it matter, since the mechanism 
is broken and it sits unplugged alongside a 
cheap ceramic rooster, his head insanely 
small and yet his tiny brain alert for 
he is the one who will crow and not that broken 
buzzing relic, though time is different now 
and dawn is different too, you were up all night 
and it is dark when he crows and you are waiting 
to see what direction you should face and if 
you were born in time or was it wasted and what 
the day looks like and is the rooster loyal.


i tried one or two but they were stale 
and broke like sticks or crumbled when i rolled them 
and lighting a match was useless nor could i 
put them back in the refrigerator-- 
it was too late for that--even licking them 
filled my mouth with ground-up outer leaf, 
product of lancaster or eastern virginia, 
so schooled i am with cigars, it comes in the blood, 
and i threw handfuls of them into the street 
from three floors up and, to my horror, sitting 
on my stoop were four or five street people 
who ran to catch them as if they were suddenly rich, 
and i apologize for that, no one should 
be degraded that way, my hands were crazy, 
and i ran down to explain but they were smoking 
already nor did i have anything to give them 
since we were living on beans ourselves, i sat 
and smoked too, and once in a while we looked 
up at the open window, and one of us spit 
into his empty can. we were visionaries.


a famous battle happened in this valley.   
                     you never understood the nature poem.   
till now. till this moment--if these statements   
                     seem separate, unrelated, follow this   

silence to its edge and you will hear   
                     the history of air the crispness of a fern   
or the upward cut and turn around of   
                     a fieldfare or thrush written on it.   

the other history is silent the estuary   
                     is over there. the issue was decided here   
two kings prepared to give no quarter.   
                     then one king and one dead tradition.   

now the humid dusk, the old wounds   
                     wait for language, for a different truth   
when you see the silk of the willow   
                     and the wider edge of the river turn   

and grow dark and then darker, then   
                     you will know that the nature poem   
is not the action nor its end it is   
                     this rust on the gate beside the trees, on 

the cattle grid underneath our feet,   
                     on the steering wheel shaft it is   
an aftermath, an overlay and even in   
                     its own modest way, an art of peace 

i try the word distance and it fills with   
                     sycamores, a summer's worth of pollen   
and as i write valley straw, metal   
                     blood, oaths, armour are unwritten.   

silence spreads slowly from these words   
                     to those ilex trees half in, half out   
of shadows falling on the shallow ford   
                     of the south bank beside yellow island   

as twilight shows how this sweet corrosion   
                     begins to be complete what we see   
is what the poem says   
                     evening coming--cattle, cattle-shadows-- 

and whin bushes and a change of weather   
                     about to change them all what we see is how 
the place and the torment of the place are   
                     for this moment free of one another.


the year i was born the atomic bomb went off. 
here i'd just begun, and someone 
found the switch to turn off the world. 

in the furnace-light, in the central solar fire 
of that heat lamp, the future got very finite, 
and it was possible to imagine time-travelers 

failing to arrive, because there was no future. 
inside the great dark clock in the hall, 
heavy brass cylinders descended. 

tick-tock, the chimes changed their tune 
one phrase at a time. the bomb became 
a film star, its glamorous globe of smoke 

searing the faces of men in beach chairs. 
someone threw up every day at school. 
no time to worry about collective death, 

when life itself was permeated by ordeals. 
and so we grew up, beneath an umbrella of acceptance. 
in bio we learned there were particles 

cruising through us like whales through archipelagoes, 
and in civics that if hitler had gotten the bomb 
he'd have used it on the inferior races, 

and all this time love was etching its scars 
on our skins like maps. the heavens 
remained pure, except for little white slits 

on the perfect blue skin that planes cut 
in the icy upper air, like needles sewing. 
from one, a tiny seed might fall 

that would make a sun on earth. 
and so the century passed, with me still in it, 
books waiting on the shelves to become cinders, 

what we felt locked up inside, waiting to be read, 
down the long corridor of time. i was born 
the year the bomb exploded. twice 

whole cities were charred like cities in the bible, 
but we didn't look back. we went on thinking 
we could go on, our shapes the same, 

darkened now against a background lit by fire. 
forgive me for doubting you're there, 
citizens, on your holodecks with earth wallpaper--

a shadow-toned ancestor with poorly pressed pants, 
protected like a child from knowing the future.


i wait for my shadow to forget me, 
to take that one phantom step that i keep 
from taking. i wait for the simple flash 
of a dancer's spat upon this one moon 
of stage-light, the mind's lonely oval 
illuminated on the surface of some 
windless pond or slew. and the old soft-shoe 
practices to get it right, husha-husha-hush 
in its constant audition of sawdust. 
even this choreography of useless 
wishing is not enough to keep tonight 
from becoming nothing more than some floor's 
forgotten routine where faded, numbered 
dance-steps silently waltz themselves away. 
the orchestra's now ready to faur
into the evening's last song while i try 
to convince myself to cross this room 
for the first time all night and rinse 
what's left in some dbutante's silver 
sequined waterfall, hope keeling hopelessly 
ever closer to the edge. across the floor 
other couples sashay on. a tin flask empties 
itself from asking, the shadow's last chance 
now wasted in some chandelier's dim lust.


adjectives continue 
their downward spiral, 
with adverbs likely to follow. 

wisdom, grace, and beauty 
can be had three for a dollar, 
as they head for a recession. 

diaphanous, filigree, 
pearlescent, and love 
are now available 
at wholesale prices. 

verbs are still blue-chip investments, 
but not many are willing to sell. 

the image market is still strong, 
but only for those rated aa or higher. 
beware of cheap imitations 
sold by the side of the road. 

only the most conservative 
consider rhyme a good option, 
but its success in certain circles 
warrants a brief mention. 

the ongoing search for fresh 
metaphor has caused concern 
among environmental activists, 

who warn that both the moon and the sea 
have measurably diminished 
since the dawn of the romantic era. 

latter-day prosodists are having to settle 
for menial positions in poultry plants, 
where an aptitude for repetitive rhythms 
is considered a valuable trait. 

the outlook for the future remains uncertain, 
and troubled times may lie ahead. 
supply will continue to outpace demand, 
and the best of the lot will remain unread.


o wonderful for weight and whiteness 
       ideolog whose absolutes 
               are always proven right 
                      by white and then 
               more white and white again, 
       winning the same argument year 
after year by making the opposition 
                            disappear 

o dear miniature of infinity with no 
       end in sight and no snow- 
             flake exactly like 
                      another, all 
             a little different no 
       matter how many may fall, 
just like our own dna or the human face 
                              eternal 

o still keep covering the street 
       and sidewalks, cemeteries, even 
               our twice-shoveled drive, 
                      and all that is alive, 
               with geometries that sleet 
       will freeze into death's 
impromptu vision of a heaven 
                              wholly white 

for we know who your sponsor is, whose will 
       you so immensely serve, 
               whose chill is more severe 
                      than any here. 
               though his name may be unspoken, 
       his commandments are unbroken, 
and every monument that you erect 
                              belongs to him


					
					over a cup of coffee or sitting on a park bench or 
walking the dog, he would recall some incident 
from his youth--nothing significant--climbing a tree 
in his backyard, waiting in left field for a batter's 
swing, sitting in a parked car with a girl whose face 
he no longer remembered, his hand on her breast 
and his body electric memories to look at with 
curiosity, the harmless behavior of a stranger, with 
nothing to regret or elicit particular joy. and 
although he had no sense of being on a journey, 
such memories made him realize how far he had 
traveled, which, in turn, made him ask how he 
would look back on the person he was now, this 
person who seemed so substantial. these images, it 
was like looking at a book of old photographs, 
recognizing a forehead, the narrow chin, and 
perhaps recalling the story of an older second 
cousin, how he had left long ago to try his luck in 
argentina or australia. and he saw that he was 
becoming like such a person, that the day might 
arrive when he would look back on his present self 
as on a distant relative who had drifted off into 
uncharted lands.
				

 

christmas trees lined like war refugees, 
a fallen army made to stand in their greens. 
cut down at the foot, on their last leg, 

they pull themselves up, arms raised. 
we drop them like wood 
tied, they are driven through the streets, 

dragged through the door, cornered 
in a room, given a single blanket, 
only water to drink, surrounded by joy. 

forced to wear a gaudy gold star, 
to surrender their pride, 
they do their best to look alive.


in the cards and at the bend in the road   
we never saw you   
in the womb and in the crossfire   
in the numbers   
whatever you had your hand in   
which was everything   
we were told never to put   
our faith in you   
to bow to you humbly after all   
because in the end there was nothing   
else we could do   
but not to believe in you   

still we might coax you with pebbles   
kept warm in the hand   
or coins or the relics   
of vanished animals   
observances rituals   
not binding upon you   
who make no promises   
we might do such things only   
not to neglect you   
and risk your disfavor   
oh you who are never the same   
who are secret as the day when it comes   
you whom we explain   
as often as we can   
without understanding


i do not understand the poets who tell me 
that i should not personify. every morning 
the willow auditions for a new role 

outside my bedroom window--today she is 
clytemnestra yesterday a southern belle, 
lost in her own melodrama, sinking on her skirts. 

nor do i like the mathematicians who tell me 
i cannot say, the zinnias are counting on their 
fingers, or the dog is practicing her geometry, 

even though every day i watch her using 
the yard's big maple as the apex of a triangle 
from which she bisects the circumference 

of the lawn until she finds the place where 
the rabbit has escaped, or the squirrel upped 
the ante by climbing into a new euclidian plane. 

she stumbles across the lawn, eyes pulling 
her feet along, gaze fixed on a rodent working 
the maze of the oak as if it were his own invention, 

her feet tangling in the roots of trees, and tripping, 
yes, even over themselves, until i go out to assist, 
by pointing at the squirrel, and repeating, there 

there but instead of following my outstretched 
arm to the crown of the tree, where the animal is 
now lounging under a canopy of leaves, 

catching its breath, charting its next escape, 
she looks to my mouth, eager to read my lips, 
confident that i--who can bring her home 

from across the field with a word, who 
can speak for the willow and the zinnia-- 
can surely charm a squirrel down from a tree.


their authority did not unfold 
from ironed white shirts and thin ties 
or from the funereal seriousness that struck 
their acne-splashed faces but because 
they stood heir to our native faith in light. 

so we followed the thin white waver 
of beams they pointed down aisles 
to seats we never thought of refusing. 
it was the first job i wanted, 
especially after birthday outings 

far from home showed me the glowing 
outfits worn by big-city ushers, their get-ups 
a blend of doorman and military dictator, 
as gaudy and fine as the plots 
of movies my saturdays were swallowed by. 

none of us knew, as they took us 
into the artificial light of the cinema, 
that they walked the path of the pin setter, 
the blacksmith or elevator operator, 
professions reduced to curiosity 

by wandering time. only in the quick steps 
of floor salesmen, the slim backs of hostesses 
bringing us to our tables, do they remain, 
the artful flutters of their flashlights lost 
in dark we are left to find our own way through.


tenderness and rot   
share a border.   
and rot is an   
aggressive neighbor   
whose iridescence   
keeps creeping over.   

no lessons   
can be drawn   
from this however.   

one is not   
two countries.   
one is not meat   
corrupting.   

it is important   
to stay sweet   
and loving.


it is always the same 
she is standing over me 

in the forest clearing, 
a dab of blood on her cheek 

from a rabbit or a deer. 
i am aware of nothing 

but my mutinous flesh, 
and the traps of desire 

sent to test it-- 
her bare arms, bare 

shoulders, her loosened hair, 
the hard, high breasts, 

and under a belt 
of knives and fish-lures, 

her undressed wound. 
every night the same 

the slashed fetlock, 
the buckling under 

i wake in her body 
broken, like a gun.


i gave birth to a princess, her mother 
once told me, and i thought of my son pouring 
his grape-nuts in the garage so as not to wake her, 

of the moment her baby, seeing her 
now a separate entity, seemed not to breathe, 
refused to blink her sapphire eyes. 

i remembered again last night as she 
and i crossed a florida street, the caution 
light running gold streamers 

over the dark sweep of her hair, 
when a young man coming toward us halted 
midway a moment, stunned, before moving on. 

so what is this divine right--less 
than bloodlines, or more? more than symmetry 
of face or a silver necklace nestled 

at a flawless throat, the nerve to send back 
bad food in restaurants, more than the big, 
loopy handwriting of the generous spirit? 

call it bravery, that eager readiness 
in the eyes, the quality of the light shining 
there. call it blessed assurance. 

today, pony-tailed, she luxuriates in sun, 
opulent in a hot pink bikini. in deference 
the ocean leans away, a backdrop. 

i find myself bent, studying the shore for perfect 
shells to lay at her feet--cat's paw, prickly 
cockle, angel wing. call it homage, more or less.


the sun is high, the seaside air is sharp, 
and salty light reveals the mayan school. 
the irish hope their names are on the harp, 
we see the sheep's advertisement for wool, 
boulders are here, to throw against a tarp, 
from which comes bursting forth a puzzled mule. 
perceval seizes it and mounts it, then 
the blood-dimmed tide recedes and then comes in again. 

fateful connections that we make to things 
whose functioning's oblivious to our lives 
how sidewise news of light from darkness springs, 
how blue bees buzz from big blooms back to hives 
and make the honey while the queen bee sings 
leadbelly in arrangements by burl ives-- 
how long ago i saw the misted pine trees 
and hoped, no matter how, to get them into poetry 

stendhal, at fifty, gazing as it happened 
on rome from the janiculum, decided 
that one way he could give his life a stipend 
was to suspend his being amour's fighter 
and get to know himself. here he had ripened 
accomplished, loved, and lived, was a great writer 
but never had explored in true detail 
his childhood and his growing up. so he set sail 

composing la vie de henry brulard 
but in five hundred pages scarcely got 
beyond his seventeenth year, for it is hard 
to take into account what happens here 
and fit it all onto an index card. 
even one moment of it is too hot, 
complex and cannibalistically connected 
to every other, which is what might be expected. 

sterne's hero has a greater problem, never 
getting much past his birth. i've had a third one. 
my autobiography, if i should ever 
start out to write it, quickly seems a burden 
an i-will-do-that-the-next-time endeavor. 
whatever life i do write's an absurd one 
as if some crazy person with a knife 
cut up and made a jigsaw puzzle of a life. 

in any case a life that's hardly possible 
in the conditions that we really live in, 
where easy flying leaps to inaccessible 
mountainy places where love is a given 
and misery, if there, infinitesimal, 
are quite the norm. here none by pain is driven 
that is not curable by the romanza 
that's kept in readiness to finish any stanza. 

whatever, then, i see at this late stage of 
my life i may or may not have stayed ignorant 
of that great book i've strained to write one page of 
yet always hoping my page was significant. 
be it or not, for me and for the ages 
i leave it as it is. yet as a figurant 
who has not stopped, i'm writing in addition 
more lines to clarify my present disposition. 

one person in a million finds out something 
perhaps each fifty years and that is knowledge. 
newton, copernicus, einstein are cunning. 
the rest of us just rise and go to college 
with no more hope to come home with the bunting 
than a stray dachshund going through the village. 
however, what a treat our small successes 
of present and of past, at various addresses 

to be in all those places where i tarried 
too little or too late or bright and early 
to love again the first woman i married 
to marvel at such things as melancholy, 
sophistication, drums, a baby carriage, 
a john cage concert heard at alice tully-- 
how my desire when young to be a poet 
made me attentive and oblivious every moment 

do you remember oceanview the fair? 
the heights above the river? the canoes? 
the place we beached them and the grass was bare? 
those days the sandbars gave our knees a truce? 
the crooked line of pantry shelves, with pear 
and cherry jam? and pancho, with his noose? 
do you remember full and half and empty? 
do you remember sorrow standing in the entry? 

do you remember thought, and talking plainly? 
michel and i went walking after chartres 
cathedral had engaged our spirits mainly 
by giving us an insight into barthes. 
michel said he was capable of feigning 
renewed intentions of the soul's deep part, 
like this cathedral's artificial forces 
that press a kind of artless thought into our faces. 

and yet--    the moor is dark beneath the moon. 
the porcupine turns over on its belly 
and new conceptions rap at the cocoon. 
civilization, dealing with us fairly, 
for once, releases its erectheion 
of understanding, which consoles us, nearly. 
later we study certain characteristics 
that may give us a better chance with the statistics. 

how much i'd like to live the whole thing over, 
but making some corrections as i go 
to be a better husband and a father, 
be with my babies on a sled in snow. 
by twenty i'd have understood my mother 
and by compassion found a way to know 
what separates the what-i-started-out-as 
from what-i-sometimes-wished-i-was-when-in-the-mountains. 

to be once more the one who what was worthy 
of courtship courted--it was quite as stressful 
as trying to, er, as they say, give birth to 
a poem and as often unsuccessful, 
but it was nice to be sublime and flirty 
with radiant girls, and, in some strange way, restful. 
i could be everything i wasn't usually-- 
and then to get somebody else to feel it mutually 

in poems the same problem or a similar. 
desire of course not only to do old things 
but things unheard of yet by nuns or visitors 
and of the melancholy finch be co-finch 
in singing songs with such a broad parameter 
that seamstresses would stare, forget to sew things, 
astronauts quit the sky, athletes the stadium 
to hear them, and the rest of what they hear be tedium. 

such wild desires, i think it's recognizable 
are part and parcel of the human image 
and in a way, i'd say, no less predictable 
than popeye's feelings for a can of spinach. 
yet if we're set on course by the invisible, 
all pre-determined, what about the language 
that teases me each morning with its leanings 
toward the unprogrammed altitudes beyond its meanings? 

are you, o particles, o atoms, nominatives 
like percevals and stendhals, set in motion 
by some ordaining will that is definitive? 
is this invading chill and high emotion, 
this tendency to know one is regenerative, 
is this, all, tidal take-home like the ocean? 
be what you may, my thanks for your society 
through the long life i've had, your jokes and your variety, 

the warmth you've shown in giving me a temperature 
that i can live with, and the strength you've shared with me 
in arms and legs--and for your part in literature, 
what can i say? it is as if life stared at me 
and kissed my lips and left it as a signature. 
thank you for that, and thank you for preparing me 
for love itself, and friendship, its co-agent. 
thank you for being this, and for its inspiration.


don't look at me   
for answers. who am i but   
a sobriquet,   
a teeth-grinder,   
grinder of color,   
and vanishing point?   

there was a time   
of middle distance, unforgettable,   
a sort of lace-cut   
flame-green filament   
to ravish my   
skin-tight eyes.   

i take that back--   
it was forgettable but not   
entirely if you   
consider my   
heavenly bodies . . .   
i loved them so.   

heaven's motes sift   
to salt-white--paint is ground   
to silence and i,   
i am bound, unquiet,   
a shade of blue   
in the studio.   

if it isn't too late   
let me waste one day away   
from my history.   
let me see without   
looking inside   
at broken glass.


  
 meanwhile the faithful, prostrate and intoning,
 stare into the light as blind as death,
 knowing for sure their end is instant heaven.
 we infidels concede them paradise,
 having seen heaven-as-harem, a eunuch god
 in charge the virgin slowly fattening to blubber.
 love, become feminized, tickles like a feather.
  
 the saints of art? sophia, that vast barn
 holds no small savior waiting to get born.
 the formal scribble on the assaulted walls--
 five hundred years of crossing out his name
 some famous, glittering pebbles mark the place
 as god's most grandiose sarcophagus.
 decay, decay. and the mind, a fetus, dies.
  
  
           iii.
  
 return me to the airfield near shanghai
 where i am very young shy, apprehensive,
 seated like sheba on a baggage mountain
 waiting for the first adventure to begin.
 the train will glide through fields of rice and men,
 bodies like thongs, and glorious genitals,
 not alien as chinese, but adam-strange.
  
 rejoiced by her first look at naked men,
 her soul swims out the window of the train
 she goes where newborn daughters clog the creeks
 bank-porticoes are strewn with starving rags.
 here the old dragon, china, thrashes, dying.
 but the ancient, virile music of the race
 is rising, drenched in gongs and howls of dogs
  
 islanded, the sighs of walled-up women
 dreaming of peasants in their prisoning fields
 but we break out of the harem of history
 no longer that young foreigner on the train,
 i listen like a bird, although i ruminate
 like a cow, in my pale holland body, riven
 by love and children. these eyes are what they see.
  
 come die with me in the mosques of rotterdam.




last night i dreamed i ran through the streets of new york
 looking for help for you, nicanor.
 but my few friends who are rich or influential
 were temporarily absent from their penthouses or hotel suites.
 they had gone to the opera, or flown for the weekend to bermuda.
 at last i found one or two of them at home,
 preparing for social engagements,
 absently smiling, as they tried on gown after gown
 until heaps of rich, beautiful fabric were strewn
 over the chairs and sofas. they posed before mirrors,
 with their diamonds and trinkets and floor-length furs.
 smiling at me from the mirror, they vaguely promised help.
 they became distracted--by constantly ringing phones,
 by obsequious secretaries, bustling in with packages,
 flowers, messages, all the paraphernalia,
 all part of the uninterruptible rounds of the rich,
 the nice rich, smiling soothingly, as they touched their hair
 or picked up their phone extensions.
 absently patting my arm, they smiled, it will be all right.
  
 dusk fell on the city as i ran, naked, weeping, into the streets.
 i ran to the home of barbara, my friend,
 who, as a young girl, rescued four loyalist soldiers
 from a spanish prison
 in her teenage sweater set and saddle shoes and knee socks,
 she drove an old car sagging with loyalist pamphlets
 across the pyrenees all the way to paris without being caught.
 and not long ago, she helped save a group of men
 from franco's sentence of death.
  
 in my dream, barbara telephones barcelona.
 i realize this isn't quite right, 
 but i just stand there paralyzed, as one does in dreams.
 then, dimly, from the other end of the line,
 through the chatter of international operators,
 we hear artillery fire, the faint tones of lost men,
 cracked voices singing, los quartros generales through the pulsations
 of the great, twisted cable under the ocean.
 agona, agona, sueo, fermente & sueo.
 este es el mundo, amigo, agona, agona.
  
 no, barbara i scream. we are not back there.
 that's the old revolution. call up the new one.
 though i know that, every day,
 your friends, nicanor, telephone santiago,
 where the number rings and rings and rings
 with never an answer. and now the rings
 are turning into knells
  
 the church bells of santiago
 tolling the funeral of neruda, his poems looted,
 his autobiography stolen, his books desecrated
 in his house on isla negra.
 and among the smashed glass, the broken furniture,
 his desk overturned, the ruined books strewn over the floor,
 lie the great floral wreaths from the swedish academy,
 the wreaths from paris, south asia, the whole world over.
 and the bells toll on
 then i tell barbara to hang up the phone.
  
 she dials the number again, then turns to me, smiling,
 smiling like an angel
 he is there. trembling, i take the phone from her,
 and hear your voice, nicanor,
 sad, humorous, infinitely disillusioned,
 infinitely consoling
 dear carolyn it is nicanor
 and the connection is broken, because i wake up,
 in this white room, in this white silence,
                    in this backwater of silence
 on this isla blanca
                    nicanor, nicanor,
 are you, too, silent under the earth,
                    brother, brother?



the poets are going home now,
 after the years of exile,
 after the northern climates
 where they worked, lectured, remembered,
 where they shivered at night
 in an indifferent world.
 where god was the god of business,
 and men would violate the poets' moon,
 and even the heavens become zones of war.
  
 the poets are going home
 to the blood-haunted villages,
 to the crumbling walls, still pocked
 with a spray of bullets
 to the ravine, marked with a new cross,
 where their brother died.
 no one knows the precise spot where they shot him,
 but there is a place now to gather, to lay wreaths.
 the poets will bring flowers.
  
 the poets are coming home
 to the cafs, to the life of the streets at twilight,
 to slip among the crowds and greet their friends
 thee young poets, old now, limping, who lean on a cane
 or the arm of a grandchild, peer with opaque eyes
 at the frightening city, the steel and concrete towers
 sprung up in their absence.
 yet from open doorways comes the odor of grapes
 fermented, of fish, of oil, of pimiento
  
 the poets have come home
 to the melodious language
 that settles in their heads like moths alighting,
 this language for which they starved
 in a world of gutturals,
 crude monosyllables barked by strangers.
 now their own language enfolds them
 with its warm vocables.
 the poets are home.
  
 yes, they have come back
 to look up at the yellow moon,
 cousin of that cold orb that only reflected
 their isolation.
 they have returned to the olives, the light,
 the sage-scented meadows,
 the whitewashed steps, the tubs of geraniums,
 the sere plains, the riverbanks spread with laundry,
 the poppies, the vineyards, the bones of mountains.
  
 yes, poets, welcome home
 to your small country
 riven by its little war
 as the world measures these events,
 a country that remembers heroes and tears
 where, in your absence, souls kept themselves alive
 by whispering your words.
 now you smile at everything, even the priests, the militia,
 the patient earth that is waiting to receive you.




thousands lavishing, thousands starving        intrigues, war, flatteries, envyings,      hypocrisies, lying vanities, hollow amusements,         exhaustion, dissipation, death--and giddiness         and laughter, from the first scene to the last.        --samuel palmer,  
i. pan awakes summer marches in
  
  
                pan's 
                spring rain
                drives his victims
                out to the animals
                with whom they become
                as one--
  
                pain and paeans,
                hung in the mouth,
  
                to be sung
                
  
                ii. what the flowers in the meadow tell me
  
  
                june , , thoreau in his journal
  
                a year is made up of a certain series
                and number of sensations and thoughts
                which have their language in nature
  
                now i am ice, now
                i am sorrel.
  
                
                or, clare, , epping forest
  
                i found the poems in the fields
                and only wrote them down
  
                and
  
                the book i love is everywhere
                and not in idle words
  
                john, claritas tell us the words are not idle,
                the syllables are able 
                to turn plantains into quatrains,
               tune raceme to cyme, panicle and umbel to
               form corollas in light clusters of tones
  
                sam palmer hit it
                milton, by one epithet
                draws an oak of the largest girth i ever saw,
                pine and monumental oak'
                i have just been trying to draw a large one in 
                lullingstone but the poet's tree is huger than
                any in the park.
  
                muse in a meadow, compose in
                a mind
  
  
                iii. what the animals in the forest tell me
  
  
                harris's sparrow--
  
                 species seen
                by the georgia ornithological society
                in rabun gap,
  
                including harris's sparrow, with its
                black crown, face, and bib encircling
                a pink bill
  
  
                it was, i think, the third sighting
                in georgia, and i should have been there
                instead of reading clare, listening to
                catbirds and worrying about
                turdus migratorious that flew
                directly into the volkswagen and
                bounced into a ditch
  
  
                friend robin, i cannot figure it, if i'd
                been going  you might be
                whistling in some grass.
  
                 tepid people got  stale letters
                one day earlier, 
                i cannot be happy
                about that. 
  
  
                iv. what the night tells me
  
  
                the dark drones on
                in the southern wheat fields
                and the hop flowers
                open before the sun's
                beckoning
  
  
                the end
                is ripeness, the wind
                rises,
                and the dawn says
                yes
  
  
                yes it says
                yes
  
  
  
                v. what the morning bells tell me
  
  
                sounds, and sweet aires
                that give delight
                and hurt not--
  
                that, let
                shakespeare's
                delectation 
                bear us
  
  
  
                vi. what love tells me
  
  
  
                anton bruckner counts the th leaf
                on a linden tree in the countryside near wien
                and prays
  
                dear god, sweet jesus,
                save us, save us
  
                the light in the grass,
                the wind on the hill,
  
                are in my head,
                the world cannot be heard
  
  
                leaves obliterate
                my  heart,
  
                we touch each other
                far apart
  
  
                let us count 
                into 
                the darkness
  
  
  



red-wigglers, night-crawlers
 & other worms
 look out
 into the crapulous moonlight
  
 figures of women cascading through the sunday night
  
 no beer in sight.
  
 i remember the night-blooming
 cereus by dr. thornton, engraver, blake's
 patron, it
 hangs in the hall outside the bedroom
 swaying hungrily like these
 giant white goddesses of the dark grotto
  
 there are touring cars
 and men with large guns
 singing through the woods
  
 behind us.
  




i. if the night could get up & walk
  
         i cannot put my hand into
         a cabbage to turn 
         on the light, but
  
         the moon moves over
         the field of dark cabbage and an
         exchange fills 
         all veins.
  
         the cabbage is also a globe
         of light, the two globes
  
         now two eyes in 
         my saturated 
  
         head
  
  
         ii. one must try behind the hills
  
  
         eight great dahlias stood
         beyond the mountains.
  
         they set fire to the sun
         in a black wood
         beyond the mountains,
  
         in the valley of vision

        in the valley of vision
  
         the fission of
         flowers
  
         yields all power
         in the valley of vision.
  
         eight suns
         on eight stems,
  
         aflame

       


for robert duncan 
one comes to language from afar, the ear
 fears for its sound-barriers--
  
 but one comes the language comes for
 the beckoning fair one
  
 plant you now, dig you
 later, the plaint stirs winter
 earth
  
 air in a hornet's nest
 over the water makes a
 solid, six-sided music
  
 a few utterly quiet scenes, things
 are very far away--form
 is emptiness
  
 comely, comely, love trembles
  
 and the sweet-shrub
 



 december ,  
john gordon boyd
 died on the birthday
 of three remarkable, and remarkably different, writers
 heinrich heine, kenneth patchen, ross mcdonald
  
 john, too, was just as remarkable, blessed with an inherent graciousness
 and with extraordinary eyes & ears
  
  
 i think of two texts
 on the grievous occasion of his death
  
 religion does not help me.
 the faith that others give to what is unseen,
 i give to what i can touch, and look at.
 my gods dwell in temples
 made with hands.
  -- oscar wilde, in de profundis
  
  
 and two lines in rainier maria rilke,
 john's favorite poet,
 that say it all
  
 was tun sie, gott,
 wenn ich bin strbe?
  
 what will you do, 
 god, when i am dead?
 



there are more things to love                               than we would dare to hope for.                              --richard of st. victor

if there is a river
 more beautiful than this

 red edge of the moon          if
  
 there is a river
 more faithful than this
 returning each month
 to the same delta          if there
  
 is a river

 coming and coming in a surge

 beautiful and faithful and ancient

a woman unlike myself is running
 down the long hall of a lifeless house
 with too many windows which open on
 a world she has no language for,
 running and running until she reaches
 at last the one and only door
 which she pulls open to find each wall
 is faced with clocks and as she watches
 all of the clocks strike
                                              no
 
 



i am learning to abandon the world 
before it can abandon me. 
already i have given up the moon 
and snow, closing my shades 
against the claims of white. 
and the world has taken 
my father, my friends. 
i have given up melodic lines of hills, 
moving to a flat, tuneless landscape. 
and every night i give my body up 
limb by limb, working upwards 
across bone, towards the heart. 
but morning comes with small 
reprieves of coffee and birdsong. 
a tree outside the window 
which was simply shadow moments ago 
takes back its branches twig 
by leafy twig. 
and as i take my body back 
the sun lays its warm muzzle on my lap 
as if to make amends.


somebody coming in blackness
 like a star
 and the world be a great bush
 on his head
 and his eyes be fire
 in the city
 and his mouth be true as time
  
 he be calling the people brother
 even in the prison
 even in the jail
  
 i'm just only a baptist preacher
 somebody bigger than me coming
 in blackness like a star
  



the green of jesus
 is breaking the ground
 and the sweet
 smell of delicious jesus
 is opening the house and
 the dance of jesus music
 has hold of the air and
 the world is turning
 in the body of jesus and
 the future is possible
 



for elaine philip on her birthday
me and you be sisters.

 me and you
 be greasing our legs
 touching up our edges.
 me and you

 be stepping on roaches.
 me and you
 come running high down purdy street one time
 and mama laugh and shake her head at
 me and you.
 me and you
 got babies
 got thirty-five
 got black
 let our hair go back
 be loving ourselves
 be loving ourselves
 be sisters.
 only where you sing
 i poet.



a love person
 from love people
 out of the afrikan sun
 under the sign of cancer.
 whoever see my 
 midnight smile
 seeing star apple and
 mango from home.
 whoever take me for
 a negative thing,
 his death be on him
 like a skin
 and his skin
 be his heart's revenge.

 she got her mama's ways.
 big round roller
 can't cook 
 can't clean
 if that's what you want
 you got it world.
  
 lucy one-eye
 she see the world sideways.
 word foolish
 she say what she don't want
 to say, she don't say
 what she want to.
  
 lucy one-eye
 she won't walk away
 from it.
 she'll keep on trying
 with her crooked look
 and her wrinkled ways,
 the darling girl.
  
  
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
 if mama 
 could see
 she would see
 lucy sprawling
 limbs of lucy
 decorating the
 backs of chairs
 lucy hair
 holding the mirrors up
 that reflect odd
 aspects of lucy.
  
 if mama
 could hear
 she would hear
 lucysong rolled in the
 corners like lint
 exotic webs of lucysighs
 long lucy spiders explaining
 to obscure gods.
  
 if mama

 she would talk

i was born in a hotel,
 a maskmaker.
 my bones were knit by
 a perilous knife.
 my skin turned around
 at midnight and
i entered the earth in
 a woman jar.
 i learned the world all
 wormside up
 and this is my yes
 my strong fingers
 i was born in a bed of
 good lessons
 and it has made me 
wise.
  
  
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
 light
 on my mother's tongue
 breaks through her soft
 extravagant hip
 into life.
 lucille
 she calls the light,
 which was the name
 of the grandmother
 who waited by the crossroads
 in virginia
 and shot the whiteman off his horse,
 killing the killer of sons.
 light breaks from her life
 to her lives
  
 mine already is 
 an afrikan name.
  
  
 



curling them around
i hold their bodies in obscene embrace
 thinking of everything but kinship.
 collards and kale
 strain against each strange other
 away from my kissmaking hand and
 the iron bedpot.
 the pot is black,
the cutting board is black,
 my hand,
 and just for a minute
 the greens roll black under the knife,
 and the kitchen twists dark on its spine
 and i taste in my natural appetite
 the bond of live things everywhere. 



there should be a writing of non-writing. someday it will come.                                              a brief writing, without grammar, a writing of words alone.                                                      words without supporting grammar. lost. written, there.                                                                                                                                           and immediately left behind.                                                                                                                                                                        --marguerite duras                                                                                                                                                    translated by mark pollizzotti

					here the readers gather to watch the books die. they die suddenly, as if thrown from an airplane, or from spontaneous cardiac arrest. they live, and then suddenly they die, and the reader who watches this is at the moment of the books' death bombarded with images documented through the smiling lipstick face of a journalist who has shown up to report on the death of the books. the milk was poisoned and forty-two babies died, she laughs, as she fondles the ashes of the dead books. and the death of forty-two babies is equal in value to the death of this book which is equal in value to the ninety-year old woman who shot herself while the sheriff waited at her door with an eviction notice which is equal in value to the collapsing of the global economy which is equal to the military in country xyz seizing the land of the semi-nomadic hunters and cultivators of crops who have lived in the local rain forest for thousands of years. the reader opens a dead book and finds an infinite amount of burnt ash between the bindings, and when the ash blows in the wind the lipstick says that every death in the world is equal to every other death in the world which is equal to every birth in the world which is equal to every act of dismemberment which is equal to the death of a jungle which is equal to the collapse of the global economy and hey look there's another lady falling out of a window she looks about equal to the poet hurled out of his country for words he wrote but which did not belong to him and whose death is about equal to the girl who was shot on the bus on her way to school this morning which is just about the same as the bearded man whose head was shoved into a sac while water was dumped over it and he died for an instant and came back to life and talked and talked and that's about equal to the steroid illegally injected into the arm of a beautiful man who makes forty million dollars a year for injecting his arms with steroids so he can more skillfully wave a wooden stick at a ball, and in the ash we see the truest democracy there ever was hey look it's a little baby found in a dumpster how equal you are says the smiling lipstick to the civilized nation whose citizens walk the flooded streets looking for their homes, and in the ashes of the dead book the dead streets are equal to the eating disorders of movie stars which are equal to the dead soldiers who are equal to the homeruns which are equal to the bomb dropped by country abc over weddings in the village of country xyz which is equal to the earth swallowing up and devouring all of its foreigners which is just about equal to the decline in literacy in the most educated nation in the planet. there is no end to this book. there are no paragraph breaks to interrupt the smiling lipstick that goes on and on in one string of ashy words about how the declaration of peace is equal to the resumption of war and how the bodies that fall are equal to the birds that ascend and how the bomb in the eiffel tower is equal to the rising cost of natural gas, and the murmurs of the voices in the mud are equal to the murmurs of the expensive suits falling out of buildings and these are equal to the silence that kills with one breath and coddles life with another.


for richard griffith 
  the burning
  
 girl grown woman     fire     mother of fire
 i go to the stone street turning to fire.     voices
 go screaming     fire     to the green glass wall.
 and there where my youth flies blazing into fire
 the     dance     of sane and insane images, noon
 of seasons and days.     noontime of my one hour.
  
 saw down the bright noon street the crooked faces
 among the tall daylight in the city of change.
 the scene has walls     stone     glass     all my gone life
 one wall a web through which the moment walks
 and i am open, and the opened hour
 the world as water-garden     lying behind it.
 in a city of stone, necessity of fountains,
 forces water fallen on glass, men with their axes.
  
 an arm of flame reaches from water-green glass,
 behind the wall i know waterlilies
 drinking their light, transforming light and our eyes
 skythrown under water, clouds under those flowers,
 walls standing on all things stand in a city noon
 who will not believe a waterlily fire.
 whatever can happen in a city of stone,
 whatever can come to a wall can come to this wall.
  
 i walk in the river of crisis toward the real,
 i pass guards, finding the center of my fear
 and you, dick, endlessly my friend during storm.
  
 the arm of flame striking through the wall of form.
  
  
   the island
  
 born of this river and this rock island, i relate
 the changes  i born when the whirling snow
 rained past the general's grave and the amiable child
 white past the windows of the house of gyp the blood.
 general, gangster, child.     i know in myself the island.
  
 i was the island without bridges, the child down whose blazing
 eye the men of plumes and bone raced their canoes and fire
 among the building of my young childhood, houses
 i was those changes, the live darknesses
 of wood, the pale grain of a grove in the fields 
 over the river fronting red cliffs across--
 and always surrounding her the river, birdcries, the wild
 father building his sand, the mother in panic her parks--
 bridges were thrown across, the girl arose
 from sleeping streams of change in the change city.
 the violent forgetting, the naked sides of darkness.
 fountain of a city in growth, and island of light and water.
 snow striking up past the graves, the yellow cry of spring.
  
 whatever can come to a city can come to this city.
 under the tall compulsion
                                                    of the past
 i see the city
                           change like a man changing
 i love this man 
                                with my lifelong body of love
 i know you
                         among your changes
                                                                   wherever i go
 hearing the sounds of building
                                                           the syllables of wrecking
 a young girl watching
                                               the man throwing red hot rivets
 coals in a bucket of change
 how can you love a city that will not stay?
 i love you
                        like a man of life in change.
  
 leaves like yesterday shed, the yellow of green spring
 like today accepted and become one's self
 i go, i am a city with bridges and tunnels,
 rock, cloud, ships, voices.     to the man where the river met
 the tracks, now buried deep along the drive
 where blossoms like sex pink, dense pink, rose, pink, red.
  
 towers falling.     a dream of towers.
 necessity of fountains.     and my poor,
 stirring among our dreams, 
 poor of my own spirit, and tribes, hope of towers
 and lives, looking out through my eyes.
 the city the growing body of our hate and love.
 the root of the soul, and war in its black doorways.
 a male sustained cry interrupting nightmare.
 male flower heading upstream.
  
 among a city of light, the stone that grows.
 stigma of dead stone, inert water, the tattered
 monuments rivetted against flesh.
 blue noon where the wall made big agonized men
 stand like sailors pinned howling on their lines, and i
 see stopped in time a crime behind green glass,
 lilies of all my life on fire.
 flash faith in a city building its fantasies.
  
 i walk past the guards into my city of change.
  
  
   journey changes
  
 many of us     each in his own life waiting
 waiting to move     beginning to move     walking
 and early on the road of the hill of the world
 come to my landscapes emerging on the grass
  
 the stages of the theatre of the journey
  
 i see the time of willingness between plays
 waiting and walking and the play of the body
 silver body with its bosses and places
 one by one touched awakened into into
  
 touched and turned one by one into     flame
  
 the theatre of the advancing goddess     blossoming
 smiles as she stands intensely being in stillness
 slowness in her blue dress advancing standing i go 
 and far across a field over the jewel grass
  
 the play of the family stroke by stroke acted out
  
 gestures of deep acknowledging on the journey stages
 of the playings the play of the goddess and the god
 a supple god of searching and reaching
 who weaves his strength     who dances her more alive
  
 the theatre of all animals, my snakes, my great horses
  
 always the journey     long     patient     many haltings
 many waitings for choice and again easy breathing
 when the decision to go on is made
 along the long slopes of choice and again the world
  
 the play of poetry approaching in its solving
  
 solvings of relations in poems and silences
 for we were born to express     born for a journey
 caves, theatres, the companioned solitary way
 and then i came to the place of mournful labor
  
 a turn in the road and the long sight from the cliff
  
 over the scene of the land dug away to nothing and many
 seen to a stripped horizon carrying barrows of earth
 a hod of earth taken and emptied and thrown away
 repeated farther than sight.     the voice saying slowly
  
 but it is hell.     i heard my own voice in the words
 or it could be a foundation     and after the words
 my chance came.     to enter.     the theatres of the world.
  
  
   fragile
  
 i think of the image brought into my room
 of the sage and the thin young man who flickers and asks.
 he is asking about the moment when the buddha
 offers the lotus, a flower held out as declaration.
 isn't that fragile? he asks.     the sage answers
 i speak to you.     you speak to me.     is that fragile?
  
  
   the long body
  
 this journey is exploring us. where the child stood
 an island in a river of crisis, now
 the bridges bind us in symbol, the sea
 is a bond, the sky reaches into our bodies.
 we pray  we dive into each other's eyes.
  
 whatever can come to a woman can come to me.
  
 this is the long body  into life from the beginning,
 big-headed infant unfolding into child, who stretches and finds
 and then flowing the young one going tall, sunward,
 and now full-grown, held, tense, setting feet to the ground,
 going as we go in the changes of the body,
 as it is changes, in the long strip of our many
 shapes, as we range shifting through time.
 the long body  a procession of images.
  
 this moment in a city, in its dream of war.
                                               we chose to be, 
 becoming the only ones under the trees
                                                                             when the harsh sound
 of the machine sirens spoke. there were these two men,
 and the bearded one, the boys, the negro mother feeding
 her baby. and threats, the ambulance with open doors.
 now silence. everyone else within the walls. we sang.
                                we are the living island,
 we the flesh of this island, being lived,
 whoever knows us is part of us today.
  
 whatever can happen to anyone can happen to me.
  
 fire striking its word among us, waterlilies
 reaching from darkness upward to a sun
 of rebirth, the implacable.     and in our myth
 the changing woman who is still and who offers.
  
 eyes drinking light, transforming light, this day
 that struggles with itself, brings itself to birth.
 in ways of being, through silence, sources of light
 arriving behind my eye, a dialogue of light.
  
 and everything a witness of the buried life.
 this moment flowing across the sun, this force
 of flowers and voices body in body through space.
 the city of endless cycles of the sun.
  
 i speak to you     you speak to me
  
  



     for robert payne 
great alexander sailing was from his true course turned
 by a young wind from a cloud in asia moving
 like a most recognizable most silvery woman
 tall alexander to the island came.
 the small breeze blew behind his turning head.
 he walked the foam of ripples into this scene.
  
 the trunk of the speaking tree looks like a tree-trunk
 until you look again.     then people and animals
 are ripening on the branches     the broad leaves
 are leaves     pale horses, sharp fine foxes
 blossom     the red rabbit falls
 ready and running.     the trunk coils, turns,
 snakes, fishes.     now the ripe people fall and run,
 three of them in their shore-dance, flames that stand
 where reeds are creatures and the foam is flame.
  
 stiff alexander stands.     he cannot turn.
 but he is free to turn  this is the speaking tree,
 it calls your name.     it tells us what we mean.
 


the way out
  
 the night is covered with signs. the body and face of man,
 with signs, and his journeys.     where the rock is split
 and speaks to the water     the flame speaks to the cloud
 the red splatter, abstraction, on the door
 speaks to the angel and the constellations.
 the grains of sand on the sea-floor speak at last to the noon.
 and the loud hammering of the land behind
 speaks ringing up the bones of our thighs, the hoofs,
 we hear the hoofs over the seethe of the sea.
  
 all night down the centuries, have heard, music of passage.
  
 music of one child carried into the desert
 firstborn forbidden by law of the pyramid.
 drawn through the water with the water-drawn people
 led by the water-drawn man to the smoke mountain.
 the voice of the world speaking, the world covered by signs,
 the burning, the loving, the speaking, the opening.
 strong throat of sound from the smoking mountain.
 still flame, the spoken singing of a young child.
 the meaning beginning to move, which is the song.
  
 music of those who have walked out of slavery.
  
 into that journey where all things speak to all things
 refusing to accept the curse, and taking
 for signs the signs of all things, the world, the body
 which is part of the soul, and speaks to the world,
 all creation being created in one image, creation.
 this is not the past walking into the future,
 the walk is painful, into the present, the dance
 not visible as dance until much later.
 these dancers are discoverers of god.
  
 we knew we had all crossed over when we heard the song.
  
 out of a life of building lack on lack
 the slaves refusing slavery, escaping into faith
 an army who came to the ocean the walkers
 who walked through the opposites, from i to opened thou,
 city and cleave of the sea. those at flaming nauvoo,
 the ice on the great river the escaping negroes,
 swamp and wild city the shivering children of paris
 and the glass black hearses those on the long march
 all those who together are the frontier, forehead of man.
  
 where the wilderness enters, the world, the song of the world.
  
 akiba rescued, secretly, in the clothes of death
 by his disciples carried from jerusalem
 in blackness journeying to find his journey
 to whatever he was loving with his life.
 the wilderness journey through which we move
 under the whirlwind truth into the new,
 the only accurate. a cluster of lights at night
 faces before the pillar of fire. a child watching
 while the sea breaks open. this night. the way in.
  
 barbarian music, a new song.
  
 acknowledging opened water, possibility
 open like a woman to this meaning.
 in a time of building statues of the stars,
 valuing certain partial ferocious skills
 while past us the chill and immense wilderness
 spreads its one-color wings until we know
 rock, water, flame, cloud, or the floor of the sea,
 the world is a sign, a way of speaking. to find.
 what shall we find? energies, rhythms, journey.
  
 ways to discover. the song of the way in.
 



murmurs from the earth of this land, from the caves and craters,
        from the bowl of darkness. down watercourses of our 
        dragon childhood, where we ran barefoot.
 we stand as growing women and men. murmurs come down
         where water has not run for sixty years.
 murmurs from the tulip tree and the catalpa, from the ax of
         the stars, from the house on fire, ringing of glass from
         the abandoned iron-black mill.
 stars with voices crying like mountain lions over forgotten
         colors.
 blue directions and a horizon, milky around the cities where the 
         murmurs are deep enough to penetrate deep rock.
 trapping the lightning-bird, trapping the red central roots.
 you know the murmurs. they come from your own throat.
 you are the bridges to the city and the blazing food-plant green
 the sun of plants speaks in your voice, and the infinite shells of 
         accretions
 a beach of dream before the smoking mirror.
 you are close to that surf, and the leaves heated by noon, and
         the star-ax, the miner's glitter walls. the crests of the sea
 are the same strength you wake with, the darkness is the eyes
         of children forming for a blaze of sight and soon, soon,
 everywhere, you own silence, who drink from the crater, the 
         nebula, one another, the changes of the soul.
 


deeper than sleep but not so deep as death
 i lay there dreaming and my magic head
 remembered and forgot. on first cry i
 remembered and forgot and did believe.
 i knew love and i knew evil
 woke to the burning song and the tree burning blind,
 despair of our days and the calm milk-giver who
 knows sleep, knows growth, the sex of fire and grass,
 renewal of all waters and the time of the stars
 and the black snake with gold bones.
  
 black sleeps, gold burns on second cry i woke
 fully and gave to feed and fed on feeding.
 gold seed, green pain, my wizards in the earth
 walked through the house, black in the morning dark.
 shadows grew in my veins, my bright belief,
my head of dreams deeper than night and sleep.
 voices of all black animals crying to drink,
 cries of all birth arise, simple as we,
 found in the leaves, in clouds and dark, in dream,
 deep as this hour, ready again to sleep.
  



my liveliest self, i give you fair leave
 in these windblown weathers,
 heather-hearted and human and strange,
 to turn every blackberry corner
 of yesterday's summer.
  
 the robin, singing her love-me-forever,
 kiss-catch-clutch-in the heather
 blues, sings tide flow
 and autumn's turning and white
 winds folding.
  
 cattle along all hedges wind winter
 into their frosty
 breathing, their slow eyes dreaming
 barn, bullock, and fodder
 under all hedges.
  
 but sea cave and sycamore tell us the world
 is wider than weather.
 blackberries darken the corners
 i turn, and gold seas turning
 darken, darken.
  
 my liveliest self, my other, godspeed
 on our farings.
 the bronze path at evening.            toward summer,
 then.                        my hand, your hand--
 as if first meeting.



at dusk, a great flare of winter lightning photographed the bay
 waves were broken scrolls.          beyond donegal, white mountains
 hung in a narrow bas-relief frozen on sky.
  
                                                                             later, there was sleet trees down
 on the drumholm road near timoney's farm, a frantic goose
 pinned under branches.
  
                                         all night long, we spoke of loneliness,
 long winter, while winter sang in the chimneys.
  
 then the sky cleared and a marvel began the hills turned blue
 in the valley a blue cottage sent up the day's first plume of smoke.
 it gathered like a dream drenched in frost.
  
 that should have been all.                           we had worn out night.
  
 but single-file,  deliberate,  five heifers,  a black bull,  three calves stepped  through the
                                                                                                                                     broken fence.
 they arranged themselves between the house and hedge a kind of diagram
 a shifting pattern grazing frozen weeds.
  
 their image is with me still.               the backs of the cattle are patchy with frost blue as
                                                                                                                                      morning.



the giant takes us
 down. a man with no arms.
 unbreakable.
  
 what made today
 is concordant,
 transforms
 the brief decisive phase we call fear.
  
 i look to that whited-over part and see a face.
 then i look to the black and
 see the same face.
  
 there were tunnelschambers
 beneath some of the sidewalkspage after page of places
  
 the last thing you think of.
 won't be my fluffy blonde hair.
  
 we have his ear.
 he was the first boy i knew. the liberation.
 which i remember
 from sand. the pail shape. the whole world's washed out.
  
 these words take refuge.
 what i mean by dream in this case is
 his last dream.
 and you see no land, you're that far away.
  
 someone coughs
 in my first life.
 someone must have noticed
 how like you he is
  
 first you can't be heard
 then you can't hear
 then you can't dial
 then you can't turn it off
  
 you pose a question, i repeat it.
 and as always with speech, one is blind. 
  
 as a reflector, as of cloth or
 thick flecked glass, as slats--
 you asked though
  
 about the self.
 there were fireflies,
 and the corn cut to the nubs. the windows
 shook, we saw a flash of light
  
 then the tiniest 
 feckles
 of rain
  
 after we waited
 all day.



					
					men are trading their bullets for worms. i spent a lifetime building.   we come down from the mountains. we brought eggs, a table, a windowshade. there were times when we couldn't bring anything. so many people.   as you were walking up the hill and i was walking down, we almost passed each other. but i grasped your arm and backed up. you said this is what i look like now.


					
					she considers a field. she considers a field and buys it. let her have the fruit of her hands.   we come down from the mountains. yellow trees, green trees. i was leaving earth but, before i did, i had to get rid of all my animals. my main one, my main model for behavior, was my snake. he was attached to the bottom of my foot but had become dangerous seeming and i was afraid he would bite me if he got the chance. my sister was there and i said, before i leave, i have to get rid of all my animals, thinking maybe she'd help me. i said, my horse, my frog, my snake but didn't mention i was worried about how to dislodge my snake safely. as i was waking up, i thought of going to a place where they could give the snake a shot to knock it out or even kill it before they tried to get it off my foot. which seemed like a pretty good idea, though inconvenient.


i would be eight people and then the difficulties vanish
 only as one i contain the complications 
 in a warm house roofed with the rib-cage of an elephant
 i pass my grey mornings re-running the reels
 and the images are the same but the emphasis shifts
 the actors bow gently to me and i envy them
 their repeated parts, their constant presence in that world

i would be eight people each inhabiting the others' dreams
 walking through corridors of glass framed pages
 telling each other the final lines of letters
 picking fruit in one dream and storing it in another
 only as one i contain the complications
 and the images are the same, their constant presence in that world
 the actors bow gently to me and envy my grey mornings
  
 i would be eight people with the rib-cage of an elephant
 picking fruit in a warm house above actors bowing
 re-running the reels of my presence in this world
 the difficulties vanish and the images are the same
 eight people, glass corridors, page lines repeated
 inhabiting grey mornings roofed with my complications
 only as one walking gently storing my dream



for john barrell 
. gone to lunch back in five minutes
  
 night closed in on my letter of resignation
 out in the square one of my threads had broken loose
 the language i used was no and no
 while the yellow still came through, the hammer and the drills
  
 occasionally the metabolism alters
 and lines no longer come express
 waiting for you what muscles work me
 which hold me down below my head?
  
 it is a long coat and a van on the horizon
 a bird that vanishes    the arabic
 i learn from observation is how to break the line
  
 genius creates surprises  the metropolitan
 police band singing bless this house'
  
 as the filmed extractor fans inflate the house with steam
  
  
 . walking my back home
  
 the wind
 is the wind
 is a no-vo-cain band
  
 and the footstep
                           echoes
  
 i 
 have conjured people 
  
  
 . ah, it all falls into place
  
 when it was time what he had left became a tile
 bodies held shaped by the pressure of air
 were clipped to his attention by their gestures
  
 my but we do have powerful muscles
 each of us equal to gravity

or sunlight that forces our shadows
 into the pieces of a fully interlocking puzzle
  
  
 . good morning he whispered
  
 the horrors of the horses are the crows
 the bird flies past the outside the library
 many heels have trapped the same way
 he tolls, he lapsed with the light from so many trees
  
 check the pattern swerves with the back
 the tree that holds the metal spiral staircase swings
 aloft the hand removes a book and checked it
 for death by glasses or the angle food descends
  
  
 . the broadcast
  
 she turns me on she turns on me
 that the view from the window is a lake
 and silent cars are given the noise of flies dying in the heat
 of the library    the grass outside goes brown
 in my head behind my glasses behind the glass in the precinct
 thus, too, they whisper in museums and banks



a line of faces borders the strangler's work
 heavy european women
 mist blows over dusty tropical plants
 lit from beneath the leaves by a spotlight
 mist in my mind a riffled deck
  
 of cards or eccentrics
 was i
 a waterton animal my head
 is not my own
  
 poetry is neither swan nor owl
 but worker, miner
 digging each generation deeper
 through the shit of its eaters
 to the root  then up to the giant tomato
  
 someone else's song is always behind us
 as we wake from a dream trying to remember
 step onto a thumbtack
  
 two worlds  we write the skin
 the surface tension that holds
                                        you
                                        in
 what we write is ever the past
  
 curtain pulled back
 a portrait behind it
 is a room suddenly lit
  
 looking out through the eyes
 at a t.v. programme
 of a monk sealed into a coffin
  
 we close their eyes and ours
 and still here the tune
  
 moves on

 she was dealing with
  
 an unworthy family
  
 gathered for death
  
 inconvenient location
  
 gruesome tired mannerisms
  
 a bit thick coming from her
  
 losing the thread of argument
  
 in a sinuous cartwheel
  
 drained of what life
  
 hurried out with a pushchair
  
 unsparing he takes us
  
 to the cabaret
  
 into patterns and groups
  
 contrived for distraction
  
 more likely
  
 to deepen withdrawal

 distorts to represent
  
 thinking and feeling life
  
 he considers in particular
  
 superimposed spatial images
  
 accelerating production
  
 of different times
  
 to control the future
  
 this book has been edited 

to detect the note
  
 of such preoccupations
  
 blue evening light
  
 desire out of stasis
  
 for jobs
  
 investment itself
  
 ruthless traders
  
 organising forces
  
 unable to stop the drift
  
 of imagination over materiality

 in fires of competition
  
 only to emerge stronger
  
 within this system of production

 by herself he touches her
  
 surrounded by models
  
 able to pass unrecognised
  
 in the stream of money
  
 implied by a photograph
  
 where the sun never seen
  
 can be constructed
  
 crashing through layer after layer
  
 on a depthless screen
  
 with the requisite speed
  
 somewhere behind us
  
 thrown into the street
  
 patiently to see 
  
 rotting pieces of car
  
 buttons working backwards
  
 against nerve junctions
  
 tilt her head
  
 towards her ankles
  
 in the underground light
  
 black fur gleamed
  
 off the oil drum
  
 searchers found
  
 a delicate bubble of oil
  
 sweeping through it
  
 pure oxygen
  
 dawn touched
  
 at the corners
  
 rose in flame
  
 lengths of thin steel
  
 drawn across dust
  
 shifting in thick
  
 time on
  
 motions playing out
  
 across from me
  
 not in sequence
  
 cut into the sides 
  
 of an extension run
  
 below his eyes
  
 were tombstones
  
 ringed with razor-wire
  
 he threaded 
  
 bright slashes of colour
  
 through open
  
 jolts of fear
  
 measuring, calculating
  
 shaking so hard
  
 a lump of shadow
  
 watching
  
 turned from side to side
  
 shielding us from the sun
  
 pale green glass
  
 frames disintegrating tarmac
  
 down to the tunnel
  
 of the corner of his eye
  
 moving on
  
 to some other
  
 man for the moment
  
 horizon of empty water
  
 locking him away
  
 inside and he wore
  
 two pictograms
  
 set in strange lines
  
 invisible in air
  
 energetically above them
  
 heels and silk
  
 scatter snow
  
 in the middle of a room
  
 swirling out of the mist
  
 bright with arrangements
  
 tainted too historically
  
 he had forgotten
  
 quite violent fights
  
 listening
  
 to the continuous pounding
  
 of some other thought
  
 looking at the surface
  
 far away down
  
 in a cloud of dust
  
 tattered lace about her
  
 she watched him calmly
  
 bits of it he tore off
  
 at the end of each meeting
  
 seemed colour-coded
  
 sparkling violently
  
 tingling on his skin
  
 holes turned round slowly
  
 in brown earth
  
 lined with age
  
 he smelled burning
  
 trees in darkness
  
 a voice came
  
 from an imaginary telephone
  
 on the dashboard
  
 shrink-wrapped packages
  
 soft underfoot
  
 glowed in the dark
  
 blinds slanted to make
  
 the match flame
  
 blast across his face
  
 snap shut
  
 in the jungle
  
 after the ones still alive
  
 start confessing
  
 flashbulbs go off
  
 her hand flicked back and forth
  
 over a section of floor
  
 he had heard more
  
 than every single word
  
 from the once proud
  
 ruins of arches
  
 in one outstretched hand
  
 an odd sensation
  
 included balance
  
 working to repair the damage
  
 of triumph on his face
  
 folded against the edge
  
 of exhaust fumes
  
 closing his lids
  
 properly needed great care
  
 she heard a rustle
  
 little numbers
  
 flew around trees
  
 tumbled across a moonlit field
  
 trying to reassemble
  
 his head again
  
 she blinked
  
 some sort of code
  
 subtle variations
  
 in the colour of her eyes
  
 a reliable testing ground
  
 gardens inside shelters
  
 shades patterning
  
 an idealised culture
  
 in one landscaped clump
  
 stuffed full of shells
  
 a version or remnant of something
  
 under a different name
  
 some crisis of identity
  
 spanned the world
  
 thought was the only thing
  
 to come back to acting
  
 beyond acoustics
  
 even when dramatic
  
 she always wore fancy dress
  
 simply cut and held low
  
 objects grouped together
  
 confidently into fine jewellery
  
 after the storm new scents
  
 touched by salt spray
  
 hardly dimmed the harsh light
  
 he sometimes pulled at his hair
  
 obsessed with finding the beautiful
  
 curtain allowing him entry
  
 never able to follow
  
 the middle of night
  
 downwards to find a runway
  
 with deep sides
  
 writhing under his fingers
  
 personalities full of energy
  
 order a series
  
 of the same programme
  
 cool for film
  
 using this knowledge
  
 machines talk to themselves
  
 maintain a very persistent
  
 buzzing as the signal
  
 ends in a dramatic freeze
  
 close to the border
  
 on a street with a few orange trees


it's the mystery of the hunt that intrigues me,
                    that drives us like lemmings, but cautiously--
 the search for a bright square cloud--the scent of lemon verbena--
                     or to learn rules for the game the sea otters
                                       play in the surf.
  
                   it is these small things--and the secret behind them
                                     that fill the heart.
                         the pattern, the spirit, the fiery demon
                                 that link them together
                       and pull their freedom into our senses, 
  
              the smell of a shrub, a cloud, the action of animals
  
          --the rising, the exuberance, when the mystery is unveiled.
                                  it is these small things
  
                    that when brought into vision become an inferno.
 


for jack kerouac 
in light room in dark hell in umber in chrome,
      i sit feeling the swell of the cloud made about by movement
  
                  of arm leg and tongue. in reflections of gold
            light. tints and flashes of gold and amber spearing
                      and glinting. blur glassblue glass,
  
              black telephone. matchflame of violet and flesh
                  seen in the clear bright light. it is not night
  
                 and night too. in hell, there are stars outside.
             and long sounds of cars. brown shadows on walls
                                        in the light
                            of the room. i sit or stand
  
                  wanting the huge reality of touch and love.
             in the turned room. remember the long-ago dream
  
           of stuffed animals owl, fox in a dark shop. wanting
              only the purity of clean colors and new shapes
                                      and feelings.
                  i would cry for them uselessly
  
                    i have ten years left to worship my youth
                       billy the kid, rimbaud, jean harlow
   in dark hell in light room in umber and chrome i
                                                                                             feel the swell of
 smoke the drain and flow of motion of exhaustion, the long sounds of cars
                                                                                                      the brown shadows
 on the wall. i sit or stand. caught in the net of glints from corner table to 
                                                                                                                        dull plane
 from knob to floor, angles of flat light, daggers of beams. staring at love's face.
       the telephone in cataleptic light. marchflames of blue and red seen in the 
                                                                                                                             clear grain.
 i see myself--ourselves--in hell without radiance. reflections that we are.
  
               the long cars make sounds and brown shadows over the wall.
  
                                i am real as you are real whom i speak to.
                    i raise my head, see over the edge of my nose. look up
  
                     and see that nothing is changed. there is no flash
                             to my eyes. no change to the room.
  
                        vita nuova--no the dead, dead world.
                      the strain of desire is only a heroic gesture.
                        an agony to be so in pain without release
  
                              when love is a word or kiss.



for jane 
--all  huge like giant flightless kiwis twice the
                                                                          size of ostriches,
                           they turned and walked away from us
                  and you were there jane and you were twenty-two
                         but this was the nineteen-forties,
                    in wichita, near the edge of town, in a field
                   surrounded by a copse of cottonwoods. it was 
                     getting dark and the trees around the bridge
                        almost glowed like a scene by palmer.
            the two giant birds--aepyorni--from madagascar,
                extincted a.d. one thousand, turned and walked
            from us across the bridge. even in the semi-darkness
                    the softness of their brown feathers made
                  curls pliant as a young mother's hair. there
          was a sweet submission in the power of their enormous
                   legs giant drumsticks. their tiny heads
                   in proportion to their bodies were bent
           utterly submerged in their business and sweeping
          side to side as a salmon does--or as a wolf does--
              but with a pleistocene, self-involved gentleness
                 beyond our ken. my heart rose in my chest
                     as the metaphysical poets say with
                    purple wings of joy. to see them back
               in life again. we both looked, holding hands,
                      and i felt your wide-eyed drinking-in 
  
 of things.
                 then i turned and viewed across the darkening
              field and there was a huge flightless hunting fowl
                   the kind that ate mammals in the pliocene.
           he stood on one leg in the setting sun by the sparkling
                stream that cut across the meadow to the bridge.
  
             he had a hammer head and curled beak, and after my
                  initial surge of fear to see the field was dotted,
             populated, by his brethren, each standing in the setting
  
                         sun, i saw their stately nobility
  
                                                                               and again
  
 the self-involvement.
  
                                    we followed the aepyorni
  
                       across the old wooden bridge made of huge
                timbers. the bridge was dark from the shadows
                      of the poplars and the evergreens there.
               the stream was dimpled with flashing moonlight
  
                         --and i think it had a little song.
  
                                                                                   then
  
               i found that on the bridge we were among
               a herd of black wildebeests--black gnus.
            one was two feet away--turned toward me--
                 looking me eye-into-eye. there was primal
                     wildness in the upstanding coarse not
                         sleek as it really is in africa fur on
                 the knobby, powerful-like-buffalo shoulders.
                  remember this is a dream. i passed by him
            both afraid and unafraid of wildness as i had passed
     through the herd of zebras at the top of ngorongoro crater
         in front of the lodge, where from the cliff we could see
             a herd of elephants like ants, and the soda lake
                     looked pink because of flamingos there.
                         there is an essence in fear overcome
                 and i overcame fright in passing those zebras
  
                      and this black wildebeest.
  
                                                             then we passed
  
                   over the heavy bridge and down a little trail
                   on the far side of the meadow, walking back
  
                   in the direction we had been.
  
                                                                    soon we came
  
                        to a cottage of white clapboards
           behind a big white clapboard house and knocked
              on the door it was answered by a young man
   with long hair who was from the incredible string band.
           he took us inside and he played an instrument
               like a guitar and he danced as he played it.
           the lyre-guitar was covered with square plastic
                 buttons in rows of given sizes and shapes.
               the instrument would make any sound, play
                  any blues, make any creature sound, play
                              any melodyi wanted it
                      badly--it was a joy. my chest rose.
                i figured i'd have to, and would be glad to,
                   give twenty or thirty thousand for it
                               then the dream broke
               and i was standing somewhere with joanna
                 to the side of a crowd of people by a wall
                 of masonry and i reached into my mouth
                   and took from my jaw all the other
         persons vanished and i was the center of everything
                         a piece which was eight teeth
                       fused together. i stared at them
                wondering how they could all be one piece.
                 they were whiteit was some new fossil.
         down on the bone there were indentations like rivulets
                     like the flowing patterns of little rivers.




 there are hills like sharkfins
                                   and clods of mud.
 the mind drifts through
 in the shape of a museum,
 in the guise of a museum
 dreaming dead friends
 jim, tom, emmet, bill.
 --like billboards their huge faces droop
 and stretch on the walls,
 on the walls of the cliffs out there,
 where trees with white trunks
           makes plumes on rock ridges.
  
 my mind is fingers holding a pen.
  
 trees with white trunks
              make plumes on rock ridges.
 rivers of sand are memories.
 memories make movies
              on the dust of the desert.
 hawks with pale bellies
              perch on the cactus,
 their bodies are portholes
              to other dimensions.
  
 this might go on forever.
  
 i am a snake and a tiptoe feather
 at opposite ends of the scales
 as they balance themselves
 against each other.
 this might go on forever.
  
  



were lifted over the valley, its steepling dustdevils
 the redwinged blackbirds convened
 vibrant arc their swift, their dive against the filmy, the finite air
  
 the profession of absence, of being absented, a lifting skyward
 then gone
 the moment of flight another resignation from the sweep of earth
  
 jackrabbit, swallowtail, harlequin duck believe in this refuge
 vivid tips of oleander
 white and red perimeters where no perimeter should be
  
  
  
                here is another in my long list of asides
 why have i never had a clock that actually gained time?
 that apparatus, which measures out the minutes, is our own image
                          forever losing
  
 and so the delicate, unfixed condition of love, the treacherous body
 the unsettling state of creation and how we have damaged--
 isn't one a suitable lens through which to see another
                filter the body, filter the mind, filter the resilient land
  
  
  
 and by resilient i mean which holds
               which tolerates the inconstant lover, the pitiful treatment
 the experiment, the untried & untrue, the last stab at wellness
  
 choose your own adventure drug failure or organ failure
 cataclysmic climate change
 or something akin to what's killing bees--colony collapse
  
 more like us than we'd allow, this wondrous swatch of rough
  
  
  
 why do i need to say the toads and moor and clouds--
 in a spring of misunderstanding, i took the cricket's sound
  
 and delight i took in the sex of every season, the tumble on moss
 the loud company of musicians, the shy young bookseller
 anonymous voices that beckoned to ramble
              to be picked from the crepuscule at the forest's edge
  
 until the nocturnal animals crept forth
              their eyes like the lamps in store windows
                           forgotten, vaguely firing a desire for home
  
 hence, the body's burden, its resolute campaign  trudge on
  
 and if the war does not shake us from our quietude, nothing will
  
 i carry the same baffled heart i have always carried
              a bit more battered than before, a bit less joy
 for i see the difficult charge of living in this declining sphere
  
  
  
 by the open air, i swore out my list of pleasures
 sprig of lilac, scent of pine
 the sparrows bathing in the drainage ditch, their song
  
 the lusty thoughts in spring as the yellow violets bloom
               and the cherry forms its first full buds
 the tonic cords along the legs and arms of youth
               and youth passing into maturity, ripening its flesh
 growing softer, less unattainable, ruddy and spotted plum
  
  
  
 daily, i mistake--there was a medication i forgot to take
 there was a man who gave himself, decently, to me & i refused him
  
 in a protracted stillness, i saw that heron i didn't wish to disturb
 was clearly a white sack caught in the redbud's limbs
  
 i did not comprehend desire as a deadly force until--
               daylight, don't leave me now, i haven't done with you--
                             nor that, in this late hour, we still cannot make peace
  
  
  
 if i, inconsequential being that i am, forsake all others
 how many others correspondingly forsake this world
  
  
  
                light, light do not go
 i sing you this song and i will sing another as well
  
 

 



a tree that grew in the garden of eden
 a tree of innocence called
 the tree of good and evil. it was harmless
  
 as opposites are in balance. it was also
 tasteless,
 the taste of innocence before it is betrayed.
 when god removed the wall
  
 he gave the lemon thorns and bitterness because it had
 no hostility.
 it is a taste we want most to subdue. it asks
 to be left alone.
 we use it with fish and tea. we sugar it.
  
 look out the window. it stands with a donkey's
 stance, hoping the day will pass.
 its scent through the curtains
 cuts through
 mustiness, sharp
 with sweet blossoms. it hides the smell
 of new babies.
 


a hole torn in the fabric of the world,
the web, the whole infernal weave
through which live-giving rain is falling
but mixing with the tears and with the blood.
dead body-snatchers enter, the mega-corpses, 
much in the news these days, enter and grind
bones, flesh and sinews down to dry tree bark,
mixing with tree bark, crawling with the demonic 
beetles. they'll tell it later no one expected this
not one--patient, doctors, practitioners
of every stripe, no one except the one whose daily
work is close to prophecy, who feels it in his nerves
or in her muscles--where news travels up fast
and lodges in the eyes, all-seeing, all-pervading vision
of disaster. and comes in like a mouse, wee small,
wee modest, so wee, wee practical, mouse with big ears
and popping eyes, looking this way and that and not
one tittle-tattle fazed by your huge presence. later
drowns in a bucket with a lizard everything drowns 
round here getting to water. not able to get out again. 
thus coming quietly, thus probing, thus stealing in,
squatting thus quietly back of the house
how do the tears well up, well down again,
what makes them well, the seeing eyes know not,
what routes the change parent-to-orphan? stop.
orphan-to-parent? stop. then back again to tears?
look out beyond the healthy trees preserved
in a close circle round the house for privacy,
look out the window over hills and dales
of this milagro country, see living green, see dying
brown--on each and every morning mourn the trees.
criminal imbeciles who run the shows we live in 
from top to bottom of their slimy theater, have now
decreed they will not solve the water. matter of fact,
they will not solve what we are made of--the high
percentage water in all of us compounded. they will not
solve a single problem by the name of life we give
to human business. they will prefer
to dip their steel in blood, to let the semen drip
from off of their steel into the blood and thus contaminate,
infuse with every cancer both body politic and body
not so politic, just private, single, individual--but
gives to other individuals their mien and color. ghosts
walk the hills and dales between the dying trees.
remember now, they say, with stab at tragic countenance,
for when can privacy enter into collective? those days,
those days you took no notice of, counting them poor, 
dispersing them among the memories you could not value
at their true worth, you could not recognize enough to feel
who knows if these few days, these very days, were not
those ones we lived together here, the only paradise?


billie holiday was on the radio
i was standing in the kitchen
smoking my cigarette of this
pack i plan to finish tonight
last night of smoking youth.
i made a cup of this funny
kind of tea i've had hanging
around. a little too sweet
an odd mix. my only impulse
was to make it sweeter.
ivy anderson was singing
pretty late tonight
in my very bright kitchen.
i'm standing by the tub
feeling a little older
nearly thirty in my very
bright kitchen tonight.
i'm not a bad looking woman
i suppose     o it's very quiet
in my kitchen tonight        i'm squeezing
this plastic honey bear      a noodle
of honey dripping into the odd sweet
tea. it's pretty late
honey bear's cover was loose
and somehow honey      dripping down
the bear's face   catching
in the crevices beneath
the bear's eyes    o very sad and sweet
i'm standing in my kitchen     o honey
i'm staring at the honey bear's face.


i am always hungry
& wanting to have
sex. this is a fact.
if you get right
down to it the new
unprocessed peanut
butter is no damn
good & you should
buy it in a jar as
always in the
largest supermarket
you know. and
i am an enemy
of change, as
you know. all
the things i
embrace as new
are in
fact old things,
re-released swimming,
the sensation of
being dirty in
body and mind
summer as a
time to do
nothing and make
no money. prayer
as a last re-
sort. pleasure
as a means,
and then a
means again
with no ends
in sight. i am
absolutely in opposition
to all kinds of
goals. i have
no desire to know           
where this, anything
is getting me.
when the water
boils i get
a cup of tea.
accidentally i
read all the
works of proust.
it was summer
i was there
so was he. i
write because
i would like
to be used for
years after
my death. not
only my body
will be compost
but the thoughts
i left during
my life. during
my life i was
a woman with
hazel eyes. out
the window
is a crooked
silo. parts
of your
body i think
of as stripes
which i have
learned to
love along. we
swim naked
in ponds &
i write be-
hind your
back. my thoughts
about you are
not exactly
forbidden, but
exalted because
they are useless,
not intended
to get you
because i have
you & you love
me. it's more
like a playground
where i play
with my reflection
of you until
you come back
and into the
real you i
get to sink
my teeth. with
you i know how
to relax. &
so i work
behind your
back. which
is lovely.
nature
is out of control
you tell me &
that's what's so
good about
it. i'm immoderately
in love with you,
knocked out by
all your new
white hair
 
why shouldn't
something
i have always
known be the
very best there
is. i love
you from my
childhood,
starting back
there when
one day was
just like the
rest, random
growth and
breezes, constant
love, a sand-
wich in the
middle of
day,
a tiny step
in the vastly
conventional
path of
the sun. i
squint. i
wink. i
take the
ride.

an open door says, come in.
a shut door says, who are you?
shadows and ghosts go through shut doors.
if a door is shut and you want it shut,
     why open it?
if a door is open and you want it open,
     why shut it?
doors forget but only doors know what it is
     doors forget.


i hate to admit this, brother, but there are times
when i'm eating fried chicken
when i think about nothing else but eating fried chicken,
when i utterly forget about my family, honor and country,
the various blood debts you owe me,
my past humiliations and my future crimes--
everything, in short, but the crispy skin on my fried chicken.
 
but i'm not altogether evil, there are also times
when i will refuse to lick or swallow anything
that's not generally available to mankind.
 
which is, when you think about it, absolutely nothing at all.
 
and no doubt that's why apples can cause riots,
and meat brings humiliation,
and each gasp of air
will fill one's lungs with gun powder and smoke.

she says my hair smells
like corn tortillas.
i raise an eyebrow.
after all those honeysuckle
and papaya shampoos,
i can't believe my scalp
hasn't soaked up
the scent of blossom
or the perfume of rainfall.
no, she's my mother,
and she insists
that even as a little girl,
my whole bedroom breathed
corn tortillas.
 
pressing nose to pillowcase,
i search for masa,
reach back before
molcajete and plow
to a dusky meadow,
its bed of soil flecked
with teosinte,
ancestor grasses.
 
up through the dark
follicles of my skull
covered in sun-cracked husks,
push the black-brown silk strands,
cocooning thirsty kernels.
maz sprouts into fields of thought
bearing hybrid rows of words
that fall like teeth
from the mouths of the dead.


after the painting rbol de blues by roberto valadez
the hands of this telling tree pull
            him from the cobalt bowl sky,
bring jimmy back to the ruins
            of maxwell street hunched in dusk.
he stood where strings intersected
            frets like tracks meeting ties
on the illinois central's passage
            from the mississippi delta,
then followed the bread crumbs
            of troubadours to this steel city.
twelve-hour shifts beckoned
            mexicanos north on the union pacific
from piedras negras
            to pilsen, back of the yards.
 
how many grandparents, mothers and fathers,
            pounded stake into soil,
snuck or were shoved into boxcars,
            leapt onto the train's iron rungs
as it shuddered along the rails
            to foundries where they poured
molten metal, faced hot licks
            of the blast furnace's growl and hiss?
how many lugged themselves north
            to slaughterhouses that drooled
rank puddles at their feet? this,
            so sons and daughters might step off
into another era, choose instruments of wood and metal,
            axes of their own timbre.
 
this so jimmy might mix his own palette--
            tune each turquoise pitch and purple tone
into an electric blues old as corridos,
            but new to the mexicanos who came each
sunday to the market at maxwell.
 
new to the ears of roberto, a boy, who would keep
            his ranchera rhythms close
as a pair of old jeans but grow
            into the blues as he listened
to the heirs of papa jackson--
            johnny young, howlin' wolf, nighthawk
and maxwell jimmy. now roberto sits in overalls
            at an easel, splits
the hairs of his brush over how to compose
            this ofrenda, this homage. how
to take jimmy back in time to the market
            whose merchants once hustled
with tricks for trade ancient as africa, as toltec mexico,
            maxwell, whose live blues bands
and car radios belting norteo mixes made
            every sunday a session.
 
how to take jimmy back
            to maxwell's gathering spot where he guzzles
from an aluminum garden blooming atop his amp,
            swings his ax--
fingers climbing its trunk, plucking twigs--
            while our feet tap the roots
of this wailing tree. notes skip through alleys
            of his voice like gravel
pinging off windshields, lift a pitch
            high enough to singe the autumn sky--
cousin to the red and green gritos of the barrio
            only blocks away. twelve bars spin
like metal rims, stack like hubcaps,
            chords crackling in the tin barrels of his laughter.
when the people gather, he sputters,
            what did the one-eyed woman say?
and waits for them to peer into the devil's draw
of his eyes before he roars,
            where is my one-eyed man?
 
but we barely get to the punch line, to the end
            of a set, before the mayor swings his ax,
a claw that rips this rbol de blues up by its roots
            before chicago swings its wrecking ball
to level homes, stores, restaurants, bars
            before troops graffiti-blast, scrub and cinch-sack it
all, but one empty wall
            where someone has scrawled jimmy's name
among the others in this hall of fame
            willie, hound dog, honey boy, sal,
the many legends who've shared the marrow
            of their music, of santana's hearty
soup with the bones still in it steaming with sabor
            and sometimes weeping.


she is proud of her pap
because he comes
to their little grey school,
converted from army barracks,
to teach espaol
to mrs. brenda's fifth grade.
and that means they don't
have to listen to that awful
seora beister on tv
with her screech owl version
of las maanitas and her annoying
forefinger to the ear,
               escuchen
and then to the lips,
               y repitan.
 
he teaches them to order
coca-cola en el restaurn
               seor, quisiera una coca, por favor
and the names of all the utensils
               cuchara, cuchillo, tenedor.
the children look at him funny
when he picks up the knife.
next week he will demonstrate
the bullfights he watched
in mexico when he was muy chiquitito.
he will choose a boy to snort, stomp,
charge the red cloth
that pap will snap
at his side as he dodges
the sharp-horned strike,
stabs invisible swords
into the boy's hide
 
               and makes the children laugh.


in memory of jos antonio burciaga, -                                                we are chameleons. we become chameleon.                              --jos antonio burciaga  
we are space between--
the black-orange blur
of a million monarchs
on their two-generation migration
south to fir-crowned michoacn
where tree trunks will sprout feathers,
a forest of paper-thin wings.
 
our mexica cocooned
in the membranes de la madre tierra
say we are reborn zacuanpapalotls,
mariposas negras y anaranjadas
in whose sweep the dead whisper.
 
we are between--
the flicker of a chameleon's tail
that turns his desert-blue backbone
to jade or pink sand,
the snake-skinned fraternal twins
of solstice and equinox.
 
the ashen dawn, silvering dusk,
la oracin as it leaves the lips,
the tug from sleep,
the glide into dreams
that husk out mestizo memory.
 
we are--
one life passing through the prism
of all others, gathering color and song,
cempazuchil and drum
to leave a rhythm scattered on the wind,
dust tinting the tips of fingers
as we slip into our new light.


perfect disc of moon, huge
and simmering
low on the capital's filthy horizon-- ay,
qu luna ms hermosa she says
pushing the stroller slowly down atocha.
and gorgeous too the firm-thighed
 
boys from lisbon
a block away, who work
kilometer zero's sidewalk, the neon
shoestore they lean against
cupping the flames
of passing strangers.
 
the sky above puerta del sol turns
a darker shade of blue. who says
it doesn't become night's
one eye
as it scales the heavens, paling
and shrinking before it moves
 
across a late june sky? and below,
men persist and circle
the plaza, twin fountains brimming
over their brilliant waters. hours
from now with the heat
waning, the same moon will spot
 
the figure of him
making past neptune, the ritz
the orange jumpsuits
hopping off trucks to sweep
and spray, hosing
down those electric streets.
 


                not straight, but in waves 
it seems every advance in the process
deepens the subject's relations to
inner objects, happiness in regaining them
 
after feeling adrift and lost, an increased
trust because they appear good
and helpful after all, as in the child
 
step by step, building his relations to
external objects, gaining not only from things
pleasant, but from ways in which the child
 
overcomes frustrations . . . mrs. a, for instance
finally walking down familiar streets with a friend
an attempt at old bonds. yet moments into the stroll
 
the number of bustling people is too much,
the buildings strange, the sunlight artificial, bleak . . .
so that she has to retreat indoors into
 
a restaurant for a chair, but even there the walls
are buckling, the diners and waiters blurred--
indifferent to what she carries inside, her home
 
suddenly the only tolerable place--
pictures of her boy, his drawings,
in each and every room. 
 


                                   listen to the creepy proclamation,                                                           blown through the lairs of the forest-nation                                                          --vachel lindsay 

 
who knows why my baby left me?
who knows where she could have gone?
is she hiding in the center
of some little-known downtown?
has she been seduced by villains?
have they got her gagged and bound?
vanished from the lost and found
with no trace and no reminder . . . ?
yeah, she's lost, but i will find her
down in the faraway suburbs.
 
                        puerto rico
 
in guaynabo and tao baja
the theorists and professors
are playing rhetorical poker
with their identity cards,
they are shooting wads of wisdom
to impress the senile deans
meanwhile, the good citizens
are all working for the government,
cheating on taxes and spouses
down in the faraway suburbs.
 
                        new york
 
the greyhound wheezes its way
from new york up to poughkeepsie
i pass the time singing gypsy
by fleetwood mac, a cappella
and the watercolor landscape
falls apart on the gray planes
the diners and the dead-ends,
the deserted factories,
and the doors creak noisily
down in the faraway suburbs.
 

 
the are prehistoric skeletons
at the beach on staten island
and the jellyfish are dancing
slow, hydrochloric waltzes
there are doric-style chalets
with south american servants
where the little brothers play
sniffing underarms and solvents
while the dog shows off its teeth
down in the faraway suburbs.
 
 
 
here the end of the expressway
gives way to medieval forests
and correctional facilities
and mcdonald's without tourists
i'm overwhelmed by the view
of the mansions on the plains,
the housing projects, the flames
creeping through the dead of winter
as the landfill burns tonight
down in the faraway suburbs.
 
                        california
 
in the righteous neighborhoods,
atherton, west palo alto,
they're paving over the asphalt
with the gravel of privilege--
all ones hears are the arpeggios
of the pre-recorded pianos,
and the trembling of the hands
that are serving themselves gin
and the shot glass shattering
down in the faraway suburbs.
 

 
far from all the shantytowns,
in millbrae and redwood city,
one more neighborhood committee
is creating civic centers
and more monumental malls
catering to healthy pleasures
peewee softball in the summers,
window-shopping, cineplex,
and those fruity tex-mex shakes
down in the faraway suburbs.
 

 
a distant, majestic sun
licks the cliffs and the embankments,
i search for your embalmed eye
on the coast of the pacific.
marin county  in particular
has its share of urban ghosts,
like those midget saxophonists
who long for their days of glory
and are now telling their story
down in the faraway suburbs.
 

 
i've searched for you in each corner of
this innocuous continent--
could it be you're facing me?
could it be that you're my neighbor?
that the downtown and the eye balm
and the grime that coats your hands
are all arcane holograms?
that your epileptic smile
died that antiseptic night
down in the faraway suburbs.


i swallow a pill but there is no cure
a city map won't get me where i want to go
 
scaling the scaffold,
mindless of the mall,
unaware of driveways
where housewives dodge the wrecking ball,
i crawl outside these vacant blues
 
and into the contours of your eyes


the housewives laugh at what they can't avoid
in single file, buckling one by one
under the weight of the late summer sun,
they drop their bags, they twitch, and are destroyed.
he hears a voice there is a bust of freud
carved on the mountainside. he tucks the gun
under his rented beard and starts to run.
the housewives laugh at what they can't avoid.
like she-bears fettered to a rusted moon
they crawl across the parking lot and shed
tearblood. the office park is closing soon.
night falls. the neighborhood buries its dead
and changes channels--zap ah, the purity
of death and taxes and social security.


lagos you are dirty
your sand is soiled
your fruits pithy.
 
i am tied to you
in a strange land
by lines that queue up
for foodstuffs you
should be eating but
ship off to me here
where i stand on check
out lines and marvel
at the cost of one
paw paw, just one mango
singular, along and apart
from you my dirty city.
 
o lagos, your streets
are packed and pollute
the air while here in
a smug smogged city
i choke.
 
your cord cuts my throat.
i am hurt and i cry like
my mami market mothers
who go home night after
night with the same tin pots.
their food is rotting and
ought to be thrown out to
the birds and beasts of
the forest but the lines
o god, these lines are so long
and between the houses and
the foodstuffs so many palms
must be oiled.
 
nairas are dripping with black gold
and yet a beggar man's lot is the
same he covers his shame as best
he can and little boys skip school.
a policeman holds his right hand out
a green car passes him dash. and we go
dash you dis and we go dash you dat
and mek we do business.
 
o lagos, lagos, ah say, you don tyah
fo dis? yousef wey you de com fom?
me, i long for the cleanliness of
sand roads that breathe long in carefully
spaced intervals between cars running
wild like mustangs roaming the plains.
there are no drivers to speak of.
they have vanished over the hills and
into gulleys.
 
the seeds have been planted. it is a
bitter harvest we reap. the deeds have
been done. what has been sown is the
flower of our calabashes on the eve of
harvest. if only the waters in the marina
               if only the waves would whisper
louder the secrets of her beaches i would
know all
 
my harbour is named after a queen whose
son's footprints are planted like a bad
seed on the headdress of my children.
 
lagos, lay your plans carefully. there
is no way to stop the rise of bicycles
and lorries, hopeful bodies and empty
pots. you divert dash for food, care
for business. we are not an oasis in a
dying desert have we not learnt, o
lagos, the sound of seductive songs
and sights that blind us
between need and life there must be hope


for daniel chappie james, general usaf             and for the d fighter group
being black in america
was the original catch,
so no one was surprised
by 
the segregated airstrips,
separate camps.
they did the jobs
they'd been trained to do.
 
black ground crews kept them in the air
black flight surgeons kept them alive
the whole group removed their headgear
when another pilot died.
 
they were known by their names
ace and lucky,
sky-hawk johnny, mr. death.
and by their positions and planes.
red leader to yellow wing-man,
do you copy?
 
if you could find a fresh egg
you bought it and hid it
in your dopp-kit or your boot
until you could eat it alone.
on the night before a mission
you gave a buddy
your hiding-places
as solemnly
as a man dictating
his will.
there's a chocolate bar
in my bible
my whiskey bottle
is inside my bedroll.
 
in beat-up flying tigers
that had seen action in burma,
they shot down three german jets.
they were the only outfit
in the american air corps
to sink a destroyer
with fighter planes.
fighter planes with names
like by request.
sometimes the radios
didn't even work.
 
they called themselves
hell from heaven.

my father's old friends.
 
it was always
maximum effort
a whole squadron
of brother-men

            my tent-mate was a guy named starks.
            the funny thing about me and starks
            was that my air mattress leaked,
            and starks' didn't.
            every time we went up,
            i gave my mattress to starks
            and put his on my cot.
 
            one day we were strafing a train.
            strafing's bad news
            you have to fly so low and slow
            you're a pretty clear target.
            my other wing-man and i
            exhausted our ammunition and got out.
            i recognized starks
            by his red tail
            and his rudder's trim-tabs.
            he couldn't pull up his nose.
            he dived into the train
            and bought the farm.
 
            i found his chocolate,
            three eggs, and a full fifth
            of his hoarded-up whiskey.
            i used his mattress
            for the rest of my tour.
 
            it still bothers me, sometimes
            i was sleeping
            on his breath.


history is your own heartbeat.                                    --michael harper 
last night a man on the radio,
a still young man, said the business district
of his hometown had been plowed under.
the town was in north dakota.
grass, where the red-and-gold           
woolworth sign used to be,
where the revolving doors
took him inside sears
gone the sweaty seats
of the roxy--or was it the princess--
of countless friday nights
that whipped his heart to a gallop
when a girl touched him, as the gun
on the screen flashed in the moonlight.
grass, that egalitarian green,
pulling its sheet over rubble,
over his barely cold childhood,
on which he walks as others walk
over a buried mayan temple
or a roman aqueduct beneath
 a remote sheep pasture
in the british isles. yet his voice,
the modest voice on the radio,
was almost apologetic,
as if to say, what's one small town,
even if it is one's own,
in an age of mass destruction,
and never mind the streets and stones
of a grown man's childhood--
as if to say, the lives we live
before the present moment
are graves we walk away from.
 
except we don't. we're all
pillars of salt. my life began
with beethoven and schubert
on my mother's grand piano,
the shiny bechstein on which she played
the famous symphonies
in piano reductions. but they were no
reductions for me, the child
who now remembers nothing
earlier than that music,
a weather i was born into,
a jubilant light or dusky sadness
struck up by my mother's hands.
where does music come from
and where does it go when it's over--
the child's unanswered question
about more than music.
 
my mother is dead, and the piano
she could not take with her into exile
burned with our city in world war ii.
that is the half-truth. the other half
is that it's still her black bechstein
each concert pianist plays for me
and that her self-taught fingers
are behind each virtuoso performance
on the stereo, giving me back
my prewar childhood city
intact and real. i don't know
if the man from north dakota has
some music that brings back
his town to him, but something does,
and whatever he remembers
is durable and instantly
retrievable and lit
by a sky or streetlight
which does not change. that must be why
he sounded casual about
the mindless wreckage, clumsy
as an empty threat.


in the america of the dream
the first rise of the moon
swings free of the ocean,
and she reigns in her shining flesh
over a good, great valley
of plumped, untrampled grasses
and beasts with solemn eyes,
of lovers infallibly pitched
in their ascendant phase.
 
in this america, death
is virginal also, roaming
the good, great valley
in his huge boots, his shadow
steady and lean, his pistol
silver, his greeting clear
and courteous as a stranger's
who looks for another, a mind
to share his peaceable evenings.
 
dreaming, we are another
race than the one which wakes
in the cold sweat of fear,
fires wild shots at death.,
builds slippery towers of glass
to head him off, waylays him
with alcohol traps, rides him down
in canyons of sex, and hides
in teetering ghost towns.
 
dreaming, we are the mad
who swear by the blood of trees
and speak with the tongues of streams
through props of steel and sawdust,
a colony of souls
ravaged by visions, bound
to some wild, secret cove
not yet possessed, a place
still innocent of us.


there is less difficulty--indeed, no logical difficulty at all--inimagining two portions of the universe, say two galaxies, in which time goes one way in one galaxy and the opposite way in the other. . . . intelligent beings in each galaxy would regard their own time as forward and time in the other galaxy as backward.                                                                         --martin gardner, in scientific american 
somewhere now she takes off the dress i am
putting on. it is evening in the antiworld
where she lives. she is forty-five years away
from her death, the hole which spit her out
into pain, impossible at first, later easing,
going, gone. she has unlearned much by now.
her skin is firming, her memory sharpens,
her hair has grown glossy. she sees without glasses,
she falls in love easily. her husband has lost his
shuffle, they laugh together. their money shrinks,
but their ardor increases. soon her second child
will be young enough to fight its way into her
body and change its life to monkey to frog to
tadpole to cluster of cells to tiny island to
nothing. she is making a list
            things i will need in the past
                        lipstick
                        shampoo
                        transistor radio
                        sergeant pepper
                        acne cream
                        five-year diary with a lock
she is eager, having heard about adolescent love
and the freedom of children. she wants to read
crime and punishment and ride on a roller coaster
without getting sick. i think of her as she will
be at fifteen, awkward, too serious. in the
mirror i see she uses her left hand to write,
her other to open a jar. by now our lives should
have crossed. somewhere sometime we must have
passed one another like going and coming trains,
with both of us looking the other way.


since it always begins
in the unlikeliest place
we start in an obsolete country
on no current map. the camera
glides over flower beds,
for this is a southern climate.
we focus on medals, a horse,
on a white uniform,
for this is june. the young man
waves to the people lining the road,
he lifts a child, he catches
a rose from a wrinkled woman
in a blue kerchief. then we hear shots
and close in on a casket
draped in the austrian flag.
thirty-one days torn off a calendar.
bombs on belgrade then europe explodes.
we watch the trenches fill with men,
the air with live ammunition.
a close-up of a five-year-old
living on turnips. her older sister,
my not-yet-mother, already
wearing my daughter's eyes,
is reading a letter as we cut
to a young man with thick glasses
who lies in a trench and writes
a study of ibsen. i recognize him,
he is going to be my father,
and this is his way of keeping alive.
snow. blood. lice. frostbite.
grenades. stretchers. coffins. snow.
telegrams with black borders.
on the wide screen my father returns
bringing his brother's body
my mother's father brings back his son's
from the opposite edge. they come together
under the oaks of the cemetery.
all who will be my family
are here, except my sister,
who is not yet imagined.
neither am i, who imagine
this picture, who now jump
to my snowy birthday in the year
of the million-mark loaf of bread.
my early years are played
by a blue-eyed child who grows up
quickly, for this is a film
of highlights, like all documentaries
false to the life--the work
 of selective memory, all i can bear
of a painful childhood. the swastika
appears and remains as the huge
backdrop against which we're seen.
the sound track of a hysterical voice
is threatening us. we're heard as whispers.
shortly before my city
bursts into flames, my stand-in
disappears from the film, which continues
with scenes of terror and death
i can't bear to watch. i pick up
a new reel, a strange sequel
set in a different location
and made in another language,
in which i am back. the colors are bright,
the sound track is filled with music,
the focus gentle. a man is beside me.
time-lapse photography picks up
the inchmeal growth of daughters
toward the sky, the slow subversion
of dark by gray hair. little happens.
the camera sums up the even flow
of many years in a shot of a river.
the principals from part one
are missing, except for me
who am the connection. the time is now,
and i am playing myself.


this is not fantasy, this is our life.
we are the characters
who have invaded the moon,
who cannot stop their computers.
we are the gods who can unmake
the world in seven days.
 
both hands are stopped at noon.
we are beginning to live forever,
in lightweight, aluminum bodies
with numbers stamped on our backs.
we dial our words like muzak.
we hear each other through water.
 
the genre is dead. invent something new.
invent a man and a woman
naked in a garden,
invent a child that will save the world,
a man who carries his father
out of a burning city.
invent a spool of thread
that leads a hero to safety,
invent an island on which he abandons
the woman who saved his life
with no loss of sleep over his betrayal.
 
invent us as we were
before our bodies glittered
and we stopped bleeding
invent a shepherd who kills a giant,
a girl who grows into a tree,
a woman who refuses to turn
her back on the past and is changed to salt,
a boy who steals his brother's birthright
and becomes the head of a nation.
invent real tears, hard love,
slow-spoken, ancient words,
difficult as a child's
first steps across a room.
 


     in memory of my parents 
people whose lives have been shaped
by history--and it is always tragic--
do not want to talk about it,
would rather dance, give parties
on thrift-shop china. you feel
wonderful in their homes,
two leaky rooms, nests
they stowed inside their hearts
on the road into exile.
they know how to fix potato peelings
and apple cores so you smack your lips.
 
the words start over again
hold no terror for them.
obediently they rise
and go with only a rucksack
or tote bag. if they weep,
it's when you're not looking.
 
to tame their nightmares, they choose
the most dazzling occupations,
swallow the flames in the sunset sky,
jump through burning hoops
in their elegant tiger suits.
cover your eyes there's one
walking on a thread
thirty feet above us--
shivering points of light
leap across her body,
and she works without a net.

the modern biographers worry
how far it went, their tender friendship.
they wonder just what it means
when he writes he thinks of her constantly,
his guardian angel, beloved friend.
the modern biographers ask
the rude, irrelevant question
of our age, as if the event
of two bodies meshing together
establishes the degree of love,
forgetting how softly eros walked
in the nineteenth-century, how a hand
held overlong or a gaze anchored
in someone's eyes could unseat a heart,
and nuances of address not known
in our egalitarian language
could make the redolent air
tremble and shimmer with the heat
of possibility. each time i hear
the intermezzi, sad
and lavish in their tenderness,
i imagine the two of them
sitting in a garden
among late-blooming roses
and dark cascades of leaves,
letting the landscape speak for them,
leaving us nothing to overhear.


there doesn't seem
to be a crack. a
higher pin cannot
be set. nor can 
you go back. you
hadn't even known
the face was vertical.
all you did was 
walk into a room.
the tipping up
from flat was
gradual, you
must assume.



there are charms
that forestall harm.
the house bristles
with opportunities
for stasis refolding
the linens along 
their creases, keeping
the spoons and chairs
in their right places.
nobody needs to
witness one's exquisite
care with the napkins
for the napkins 
to have been the act
that made the fact
unhappen.



we knew it 
would happen, 
one of the laws.
and that it
would be this
sudden. words
become a chewing
action of the jaws 
and mouth, unheard
by the only other
citizen there was
on earth.



pity the beautiful,
the dolls, and the dishes, 
the babes with big daddies 
granting their wishes.

pity the pretty boys, 
the hunks, and apollos, 
the golden lads whom 
success always follows.

the hotties, the knock-outs,
the tens out of ten, 
the drop-dead gorgeous, 
the great leading men.

pity the faded, 
the bloated, the blowsy, 
the paunchy adonis 
whose luck's gone lousy.

pity the gods, 
no longer divine.
pity the night 
the stars lose their shine.

so this is where the children come to die,
hidden on the hospital's highest floor.
they wear their bandages like uniforms
and pull their iv rigs along the hall 
with slow and careful steps. or bald and pale,
they lie in bright pajamas on their beds,
watching another world on a screen.

the mothers spend their nights inside the ward,
sleeping on chairs that fold out into beds,
too small to lie in comfort. soon they slip
beside their children, as if they might mesh
those small bruised bodies back into their flesh.
instinctively they feel that love so strong
protects a child. each morning proves them wrong.

no one chooses to be here. we play the parts
that we are given--horrible as they are.
we try to play them well, whatever that means.
we need to talk, though talking breaks our hearts.
the doctors come and go like oracles,
their manner cool, omniscient, and oblique.
there is a word that no one ever speaks.


                                        ii

 
i put this poem aside twelve years ago
because i could not bear remembering 
the faces it evoked, and every line
seemed--still seems--so inadequate and grim.

what right had i, whose son had walked away, 
to speak for those who died? and i'll admit
i wanted to forget. i'd lost one child
and couldn't bear to watch another die.

not just the silent boy who shared our room,
but even the bird-thin figures dimly glimpsed
shuffling deliberately, disjointedly
like ancient soldiers after a parade.

whatever strength the task required i lacked. 
no well-stitched words could suture shut these wounds. 
and so i stopped...
but there are poems we do not choose to write.


                                        iii

 
the children visit me, not just in dream,
appearing suddenly, silently--
insistent, unprovoked, unwelcome.

they've taken off their milky bandages
to show the raw, red lesions they still bear.
risen they are healed but not made whole.

a few i recognize, untouched by years.
i cannot name them--their faces pale and gray
like ashes fallen from a distant fire.

what use am i to them, almost a stranger?
i cannot wake them from their satin beds.
why do they seek me? they never speak.

and vagrant sorrow cannot bless the dead.



for marina
you say the old masters never got it wrong,
but when goya painted the death of the imagination
it was a lost dog against a usurious yellow sky
and the dog, a hapless creature who had drawn itself
ten miles on two legs, stared in amazement
to see the man who once fed him from his plate
reduced to this. 

so i felt this week, the vile soil and everything upon it--
the beggar guest kicked from the table
before his own dog, and even the honest unpicking
of art performed nightly and in seclusion.
like any penelope my armor is resignation
although i thought i would lift the bow myself
and draw.

by the morning he is gone
and what to make of this?
the prostitutes hang from a beam like mice
the suitors are piled unburied in the yard.
and some say that it is now much better
and others, that it is worse.
so order was restored
i stared in amazement

                                               

perhaps akhmatova was right
when she wrote who knows what shit
what tip, what pile of waste
brings forth the tender verse
like hogweed, like the fat hen under the fence
like the unbearable present tense
who knows what ill, what strife
what crude shack of a life
and how it twists sweetly about the broken sill
pressingness, another word for honeysuckle
but housewives? has poetry
ever deepened in the pail
was it ever found in the sink, under the table
did it rise in the oven, quietly able
to outhowl the hoover?
does it press more than the children's supper
the sudden sleepless wail?
did it ever?
it lives. it takes seed
like the most unforgiving weed
grows wilder as the child grows older
and spits on dreams, did i say
how it thrives in the ashen family nest 
or how iambs are measured best
where it hurts
with the heel of an iron 
on the reluctant breast 
of a shirt?

                                               

                              michael blann

there was a hush, then michael blann
stepped out onto the stage. michael
blann, with his pipe and his jukebox head
oh, he's your man.

he has a song for all weathers, a pipe
and a voice, and he sings and he roams
he sings to the wind and a dog of how
the trees are all bare and jack's come home.

he's a thin voice, like a spider thread 
on days when the sun is late and fine
live and let live, sings michael blann
the wind yields not, but the hills is mine.

he's no call for fate passing over
his sheep are all angels, the stars are his lords
he'll play any part the clouds should fancy
to humble tunes and hand-me-down words

the acts are written in briar strands
and the pharisees are leaves in the air
i likes a drop pipes michael blann
sing follow hark forward the innocent hare. 

he wore to his end a clutch of sheep's wool 
to show the gods that michael blann
went alone, alone for most of his years
but crossed the hills a singing man.



march , 
every morning since the time changed
i have woken to the dawn chorus
and even before it sounded, i dreamed of it
loud, unbelievably loud, shameless, raucous

and once i rose and twitched the curtains apart
expecting the birds to be pressing in fright
against the pane like passengers
but the garden was empty and it was night

not a slither of light at the horizon
still the birds were bawling through the mists
terrible, invisible
a million small evangelists

how they sing as if each had pecked up a smoldering coal
their throats singed and swollen with song 
in dissonance as befits the dark world
where only travelers and the sleepless belong


pure gaze, you are lightning beyond the last trees
and you are the last trees'
past, branching 
green lightning 
of terminal brain branches 
numened densely with summer's
hunter color, as night comes on, 
the ocean they conceal
gone berserk, wind still rising.
pure seeing, dual vortex doors 
to the blue fire where
sex is burned away, and all 
is as it was and i am being offered
in your eyes, as in cupped hands,
the water of to never thirst again.
again i turn away, 
and the future comes, all at once 
towering around me 
on every side, and i am lost.
pure looking, past pain 
this is promised
we must have wed on poverty's most hair-raising day 
delighting, flashing risk, risk
unfailingly lighting the way, 
anything possible 
in that dissolving of seam 
between minds, 
no more golden time--
each step i took
the right step, words 
came to me finally and finding the place 
you had set for them,
once again 
wrote themselves down.
till true word's anvil ring, and 
solid tap of winged blind cane come,
i wish you 
all the aloneness you hunger for.
that big kitchen table where you sit laughing 
with friends, i see it happening.
and i wish that i could not be 
so much with you
when i'm suddenly not that
inwardly you might switch 
time, to sleep
and winter while you went about 
your life, until you woke up 
well,
our conversation resumed.
ceaseless blue lightning, this 
love passing through me 
i know somehow it will go on
reaching you, reaching you
instantly
when i'm not in the way 
when it is no longer deflected 
by all the dark bents, all
i tried to overcome but i could not--
so much light pulled off course 
as it passed within reach, so much
lost, lost in me, 
but no more.


                                                 october , october , 



for peter s.
i saw the shrouds of prisoners
like baptismal gowns
buried outside the cemetery.

on the canvas frills exhaled
singed wool and cardboard.

the angels arrived as lace.

took notes, then stuck. awful residue
from a small cut.

                                 

the veil has been ripped from the skin
where it was burned in.

the skin is the veil, the baby-material,
imprinted on, as if
one dropped the handkerchief
and it was one's wrist.

the cuff is frightening.  
stuffed onto oil.
water-stains might fence its ghost in.

                                 

the barbed wire complex
i understand.  
winged and flattened
at the same time, poor things

some leftover specters of blood.

remember blake's figures like columns
with heads

looking around for god?
when events are not as random
as they seem.

                                 

the article of clothing
is only half there, it's not full,
but when it falls forward, it is.

terrible emptiness of the spread
neckline and little sleeve.
half-cooked squares.

was this religious fire
and is this where it passed?

maybe they are floating on water
of paint, pool-sized, 
blue and ridged like foam.

you would have to fly
to see them flat as a map.

the rib and hem. rained on
for eons. noah's children's
floating forms.

                                 

angels die?
it's a frightening-miracle 
because here they are.
the upper god

has let them drop
like centuries into space.

and i recognize them



growing up, i barely knew the bible, but read
and reread the part when cain drifted east
or was drawn that way, into a place of desolation, 
the land of nod, there to begin, with a wife 

of unknown origin, another race of men,
under the mark of god. as a boy, i thought nod 
would be a place where the blue scillas 
would bloom gray, a country of the rack and screw, 

the serrated sword, where the very serving cups 
were bone. as a grown man, i've heard that nod 
never was a nation--of cain's offspring, or anyone--
but a mistranslation of wander, so cain 

could go wherever, and be in nod. far more 
than in god, i believe in cain, who destroyed 
his own brother, and therefore in any city
could have his wish, and be alone.


nervy, sparrow-like,
eyes cherokee, 
blackberry black,
arrow-quick,
picky eater,
lean in spirit,
converted quaker,
she taught her grandson
arithmetic
and checkers tactics
and let him touch
through her cotton nightie
small, tense nipples.
her hands, arthritic,
knitted doilies, 
breaded tomatoes,
and put up apples,
while the hoarded guilts
made for bright quilts,
the torrid migraines'
counterpanes.



one does not want,
o lord, to heap
up by still waters
of words a cairn
but hopes to attend
a small covert
of tamarisk
whose leaves salty
yet feathery
will shed light over
a thickened plot.

one wants at last
to cede the field
to tamarisk
and mastic tree,
to olive and stone,
stones in the fruit,
seed in the stones.



sometimes the rain shines
just when the sun reigns,
and that was the way it is
beyond those french doors
that late afternoon here
in this mind's early evening
where they still fade in
that cool color polaroid,
pastel shades of her prom dress,
a bowl of double peonies,
promising, precocious,
trying, trying to open.

                           

their friend and he were tight
tight-rope walkers, self-taught
taut-trope-talkers, stalking
jamb-up, arm-in-arm
and caroling to lucky stars
their bars and rebars,
the night a carousel
of tryst and troth, 
of casual carousals,
cocky arousals,
pitching the dark to the dark.
streetlight and moth,
reader, she married both.

                           

but then there he was,
in the morning's mourning,
soi-disant
proustian mignon,
aesthetic ascetic
and kansas rube
reducing his thought
to a bouillon cube
that no one hot 
ought ever pore over.   



maybe the light from a small window 
tucked at the utmost eave of the barn
could be misunderstd if only i had pulled  

in by the other way or not looked up
against such darkness. the animal i brought 
into this no longer mine, the task

each day was to confine enough, from harm
or from each other as night loosens
over the assemblage. but in the pasture

one wrong step was taken. and those who remain
are weary, heads low, torment nowhere   
to be seen, not even in the illumination

of men who have come to help,
who behind the double doors keep watch
by the body so it does not become

anything for those who scavenge, to follow back
the acts of blood right up to the locked stall 
and light where each shaft lands precisely again 

through the again. the horse was in the snow,
the rock was underfoot all the unknowables
made whole and apparent by one who stumbled.



how many times i have provided
for your death the apple turned one way
then the other, an arrangement made, 

the softer ground. to hold your head 
as if this mattered, to say what i think
essential into your ear,

to watch the eye look everywhere to find
what it does not know it looks for.
to fasten you down in the one place

where no one can say anything more,
being nothing else but breath leaving,
while the man with the needle stands by

until the signal of how it is time. to believe
i know what will happen next to leave the hill 
as the body stiffens to pass each blossom

of blood in the snow as if i understood 
all i was capable of.


as for her, the circumstances must be ordinary
and so the return. door unlocked. the path mowed 
right to the oiled gate the pasture 

cleared of stone and alder. all untouched
enough to enter. the man or woman 
off down the valley or working above

treeline. no other sound but a few strays 
hurrying through the dusk as if the end
will begin, certain and with nothing

more to say. she does not know she does not know. 
having come back to find her kind
and none being left she took herself up 

into a tree unclear what to do next save only
sing the song she wanted sung back to her.



paul lost his footing, turned out a spectacular corkscrew.
it looked like he was acting out a series of renga 

in the air. the general theme was prevenient grace.
but the white rim broke his form, and he hit 

the bathtub water like a big charred bough of a tree.
a semicircle of his shoes--oxfords, monk straps,

bluchers, a lone boot--crowded in to get a look.
after that, morphy was only surface. you can look

into anything and see what you want. for example,
pierre swore he could read stock returns

in the little channels of morphy's pruned thumbs.
he even called in schiaparelli's niece. she entered

with a shoe on her head, i swear. there are pictures,
look it up. my uncle, my unfortunate uncle,

says the whole event--morphy in the tub--looked
floral, with shoe petals. just to be difficult, i said

saucer of milk a teacup on a dish, alone in the
quiet, waiting for a cougar to come by. i

always bank on something parched and ambling
to make my point. or else something with a

broken heel, covered in wet newspaper and
huddled up next to the highway. all thumbs.



nimble, preserved together, 
milkweed-white rears upturned,

female tule elk 
bowed into rustling foxtails.

males muscled over the slopes,
jostling mantles, marking terrain. 

their antlers clambered wide,
steep as the gorges.  

as they fed, those branches twitched,
sensory, delicate,

yet when one buck reared
squaring to look at us

his antlers and his gaze 
held suddenly motionless.

               further out, the skeleton.

the tar paper it seemed to lie on
was hide. 

               vertebrae like redwood stumps--
an uneven heart-shaped cavern    

               where a coccyx curled to its tip. 
ribs fanned open

hollow, emptied of organs.
in the bushes its skull. 

sockets and sinuses, mandible,
its few small teeth.  

all bare now except  
that fur the red-brown color 

of a young boy's head and also 
of wild iris stalks in winter

still clung to the drying scalp. 
below the eye's rim sagged

               flat as a bicycle tire.

the form was sinking away.

the skin loosened, becoming other,
shedding the mask that hides

but must also reveal a creature.
off amid cliffs and hills

some unfleshed force roamed free. 
in the wind, i felt 

the half-life i watched watch me. 
elk, i said, i see 

               you abandon this life, this earth--

i stood for a time with the bones. 




                          lauds

somehow i am sturdier, more shore
than sea-spray as i thicken through
the bedroom door. i gleam of sickness.
you give me morning, lord, as you
give earthquake to all architecture.
i can forget.
                           you put that sugar
in the melon's breath, and it is wet
with what you are. i, too, ferment.
you rub the hum and simple warmth
of summer from afar into the hips
of insects and of everything.
i can forget.
                           and like the sea,
one more machine without a memory,
i don't believe that you made me.


                          prime

i don't believe that you made me
into this tremolo of hands,
this fever, this flat-footed dance
of tendons and the drapery

of skin along a skeleton.
i am that i am a brittle
rib cage and the hummingbird
of breath that flickers in it.

incrementally, i stand
in me are eons and the cramp
of endless ancestry.

sun is in the leaves again.
i think i see you in the wind
but then i think i see the wind.



has a moth in her palm,
a river on her tongue,
a scalpel in her boat,
a lump in her throat,
a gamble in her shoe,
a fire in her den,
a shadow in her flesh,
a flutter in her breast,
like everybody else.



a sound of far-off thunder from instruments 
ten feet away drums, a log, 
a gong of salvage metal. chimes 
of little issan bells, pipes in a row, sometimes 
a querulous harmonica. 
inside the elephant orchestra's audience, 
bubbles form, of shame and joy, and burst. 
did elephants look so sad and wise, 
a tourist thinks, her camera cold in her pocket, 
before we came to say they look sad and wise? 
did mastodons have merry, unwrinkled faces? 
hollow boom soft chime, stamp of a padded foot, 
tingle of renaat, rattle of angklung. 
this music pauses sometimes, but does not end. 

prathida gently strokes the bells with a mallet. 
poong and his mahout regard the gong. 
paitoon sways before two drums, 
bumping them, keeping time with her switching tail. 
sales of recordings help pay for their thin enclosure 
of trampled grass. they have never lived free. 
beside a dry african river 
their wild brother lies, a punctured balloon, 
torn nerves trailing from the stumps of his tusks. 
hollow boom soft chime, scuff of a broad foot, 
sometimes, rarely, a blatting elephant voice. 
they seldom attend the instruments 
without being led to them, but, once they've begun, 
often refuse to stop playing.


elizabeth bishop leaned on a table, it cracked, 
both fell to the floor. a gesture 
gone sadly awry. this was close to fact 
and quickly became symbolic, bound to occur 
in florida, where she was surrounded 
by rotting abundance and greedy insects. 
one moment a laughing smile, a graceful hand 
alighting on solid furniture, 
a casual shift of weight, 
the next, undignified splayed legs. 
the shell of the table 
proved to be stuffed with termite eggs. 
true, it was a fall from no great height--
merely the height of herself, 
and although the hollowed-out table failed, 
at least the floor held, 
though probably infested by termites as well, 
and possibly built on a latent sinkhole, 
how can you tell? 
and how could she, smiling and easy, 
arm moving without forethought and permission, 
have forgotten fear, apparently 
let go of a hard-learned lesson? 
enter a room as though it is strange. 
what you recognize may have changed, 
or may change without warning. 
trees fall in hurricanes 
and on windless mornings, 
breaching houses where people you knew 
have vanished or died or stopped loving you. 
she regained her feet, already composed, 
brushing dust from an elbow. there would be a bruise, 
but it would remind her that words are full of holes 
flung hard, like paper they fly sideways. 
and a call to joy--a landscape, a face--
may, though scarcely moving, perhaps by not moving, go 
in one breath from heartening to ominous, 
proving to children who need more proof 
that we don't know what we know. 


the most beautiful bodies are like transparent glass.
they are bodies of the selfless or of those newly
dead. what appears transparent is really flame
burning so brightly it appears like glass. what
you're looking through is the act of giving one
thing in life needed desperately, given to another,
or perhaps life itself. the most beautiful bodies
are not transparent, but sometimes the color
of lead, like the elephant whom a child with some
peanuts lifts by the trunk in his hand in the swirling
dust, so that it appears he has lifted a monument
or a city with all its pain. the bodies that seem
transparent are made of an ice so pure it appears
to be glass sweating, where you, desiring another,
glimpse your own face that weighs nothing and is burning.



the tint of the sky between sunset and night.
  
 and wandering with you and your nephew
 in that maze, half-lost--madrid
 of the austrias--looking for plaza of the green
  
 cross where, days before you arrived,
 an opel with false plates was parked, its wheels
 straddling the curb, and so the van
  
 heading for the barracks that morning
 had to slow to squeeze
 past . . . back at the hotel your mom
  
 is holding up her gift--amethyst, she says
 admiring how light
 when passing through a prism
  
 bends. at his window that morning before we began
 my student said, qu bonito, watching it drift
 and descend, settling on roofs and cars.
  
 and i think of you and your wife
 and daughter getting to see madrid
 in white, your visit winding down, and how
  
 i had wanted that lesson to end
 to get to the park--retiro, they say, is the city's
 one lung, and the way the feel and sound of steps
  
 cease
 when grass is completely covered
 as if walking on a cloud. the year before
  
 on a visit from the coast, a friend
 sitting at a window
 watched the flakes flutter
  
 and fall, dissolving before reaching
 the ground--aguanieve, he said
 while from a town near seville
  
 b-s were lifting off . . .
 i was in a trance that week
 though like most things the war
  
 in the gulf was soon another
 backdrop, like the string of car bombs
 the following year. and yet that morning
  
 as soon as i heard, something led me
 not to the park but down
 to city hall, workers in the street
  
 evacuated, sipping coffee, though i never reached
 the site--of course it was cordoned
 off, the spray of glass, the heap
  
 of twisted metal, and so later learned their names
 their lives. of the five
 there was one a postal clerk who
  
 as a boy, would plunge his hands
 into the white, the cold
 a sweet jolt
  
 whenever he got to touch
 the stuff, scooping
 it tightly into a ball
  
 like the ones he would dodge and throw
 years later
 at his wife-to-be those weekends,
  
 those places--away from city air--
 a release . . . miraflores, siete
 picos, rascafra . . . it's in
  
 his blood, she would come to say
 chatting with a neighbor
 about his thing for snow--the way it falls
  
 softly, blanketing roofs
 and groves, villages
 nestled in the sierra's
  
 hills it is february
 and she is picturing him
 and the boy, up there now
  
 playing, horsing around



october is
 when night guzzles up
 the orange sherbet sunset
 and sends the day
 to bed
 before supper
             and
 october is when jack-o'-lanterns
 grin in the darkness
             and
             strange company crunches
 across the rumple of dry leaves
 to ring a doorbell.
 october is
 when you can be ghost,
             a witch,
                         a creature from outer space
 almost anything
 and the neighbors, fearing tricks,
             give you treats.
 


light bulbs on a birthday cake.
 what a difference that would make
      plug it in and make a wish,
      then relax and flip a switch
 no more smoke
       or waxy mess
       to bother any birthday guests.
 but grampa says, it's not the same
       where's the magic?
        where's the flame?
 to get your wish without a doubt,
 you need to blow some candles out
 


just when you think you know the boa,
 there's moa and moa and moa and moa.
 


i am the earth
 and the earth is me.
 each blade of grass,
 each honey tree,
 each bit of mud, 
 and stick and stone
 is blood and muscle, 
 skin and bone.

 and just as i 
 need every bit
 of me to make
 my body fit,
 so earth needs
 grass and stone and tree
 and things that grow here
 naturally.

 that's why we 
 celebrate this day.
 that's why across
 the world we say
 as long as life,
 as dear, as free,
 i am the earth
 and the earth is me. 


petrarch dreams of pebbles
on the tongue, he loves me
at a distance, black polished stone
skipping the lake that swallows

worn-down words, a kind of drown
and drench and quench and very kind
to what i would've said. light marries
water and what else unfit

for drinking purposes, light lavishes
my skin on intermittent sun. i am weather
and unreasonable, out of all
season.  petrarch loves my lies

of laurel leaves, ripped sprigs of
deciduous evergreen. a creek is lying
in my cement-walled bed, slurring
through the center of small

town the current's brown and 
turbid muddy, turbulent
with recent torrents, silt rushing 
toward the reservoir. a sonata

passes by too close i have to jump
and yes i do hear music here. it's blue, or
turquoise, aquamarine, some synonym
on wheels, note down that note. it's petrarch

singing with his back to me delivering
himself to voice, his fingers
filled with jonquil, daffodils, mistaken
narcissus. i surprised him

between the pages of a book,
looked up the flowers i misnamed.
forsythia and magnolia bring me
spring, when he walks into the house

he has wings. song is a temporary thing
attempt, he wants to own his music.


and did those feet in ancient time
 walk upon englands mountains green
 and was the holy lamb of god,
 on englands pleasant pastures seen
  
 and did the countenance divine,
 shine forth upon our clouded hills?
 and was jerusalem builded here,
 among these dark satanic mills?
  
 bring me my bow of burning gold
 bring me my arrows of desire
 bring me my spear o clouds unfold
 bring me my chariot of fire
  
 i will not cease from mental fight,
 nor shall my sword sleep in my hand
 till we have built jerusalem,
 in englands green & pleasant land.


no one knew what the stones like squatting frogs
 signified. there they were, fuming in rows, out
 of the ground every critic had his explanation
 or hers. but--we had to remember--they 
  
 came to nothing, every one those large stones
 out of the earth served the systems
 of those who considered them, as explaining
 something about the past it was important
  
 for the explainer to explain. and yet
 no one had any idea truly there was no
 basis in fact for any view of them, and
 they remained like their origins--or like
  
 smiling olmec babies, sweet but ominous figures
 come from the earth to reproach us, almost
 cheerfully, for our ignorance--a mystery, just
 as the probe of our feelings came up with nothing.



light from the ugliest lamp i ever saw, here
 on the table that triples for reading, eating can't say
 dining, business on the phone ugliest except
 a few around the corner in that guest house at windows
  
 --plaster driftwood cylinders like rockets or sanitary
 napkins propping shades thin torso of a youth
 red globe on orange globe, the works, somebody's
 collection. wouldn't she love this one, lump of lamp base
  
 intending landscape, two donkeys in mustard glaze,
 heads ruefully down, one carrying two rush panniers
 large enough to hold your pens or salts and peppers on
 the other a shifty man with droopy moustache rides,
  
 
  
 grumping under his sombrero right leg broken
 off at the knee, left leg clipped at ankle. they make
 no progress, this mold-made work--the joins, arthritic
 ridges where dabs of grayish green suggest
  
 a wizened bush from which a brass post rises
 to hold a shade that doesn't fit and twice
 has tried to burn, as crusty sores at the rim show.
 still, it lights my work. why hate it? do i care?
  
 these indecorous furnishings stand for failure, are
 a clutter that weighs down, defeats the purpose,
 like dumbbells taken along on vacations the pen jar
 lamp base, sextant, portable folding triptych.
  
 
  
 the writing table fills with clutter. specials
 coax me to nudge buying into play. a checkout
 coupon lets me get some brand of lunch meats
 fifty-five cents off if i spend two dollars
  
 but i just can't find it when i'm shopping, the ticket--
 with its rubric of good news and inscrutable forest
 of bar code, black on red--to lead me on back home
 there it is, on the table, laying waste my power to spend.
  
 what i have wanted with larkin to do must be
 essentially undoable, it belongs to the imagination.
 rather, the demolition has begun, piss and shit
 and blood mix in the snow-white bowl and yet
  
 
  
 i find the beech forest behind the beach
 dunes that allen recommended without
 reservation. the man was right--it more
 than satisfies, these beech ponds and their dune
  
 forest. i sat on a pitch pine that had blown
 over and then turned round and risen again,
 and bowed part making a seat something like
 a saddle the tree was growing while i sat on it
  
 as were the other pitch pines round the pond ruddy
 in afternoon, late light of day, rough trunks
 with tufts of twisted branches green with needles,
 it was idyllic, wind speaking through the pines,
  
 
  
 solitude--o, yes, two high-breasted girls
 came striding by, i heard them coming, i
 heard them going, yammering at full volume
 not looking left or right, they passed me, were
  
 out of sight and soon of earshot, doppler effect 
 caused by exuberant youth in oblivious chitchat.
 and people are smoking in these dry woods too,
 not policing their butts is how i know,
  
 the butts will surface from the heavier, sifting sand,
 sand spilling, surfing down hills, crashing in waves
 over the path here. but call it solitude,
 when a thought--but wait i thought--i should not be
  
 
  
 having a thought here, this moment yet a vision
 of a chinese poet in his study overlooking
 such a pond as this arrives out of the silence
 like the yellow water lilies on the water, pads
  
 spreading out in files like a design on the broadloom
 of a lobby. the sage is working on a poem, brushing it
 on silk, inspired by a blend of tao and 
 confucius. doubtless he would not forget 
  
 allusions to sung poets, if he were not
 a sung poet himself, in which case he would have to
 echo han or t'ang and he would be writing
 of solitude time passing absent friends
  
 
  
 enlightenment would have to be inferred.
 no matter, i didn't bring a pen today.
 however, over there are inkberry bushes, so
 with a reed i just might make a start. . . . farther
  
 on the path i listen to a bird, a warbler perhaps,
 i do not know the song or see the bird.
 there with the pines and sand and birdsong, and no
 prayer- or guide- or selfhelp-book, no
  
 serious commune, the mind must yearn to be 
 led on it wants a deity, an altar to approach
 an altar at least to take steps toward occasion
 to rise to--with nothing planned for the mind,
  
 
  
 it's like a person suddenly blind, not blind
 for a long time and knowing the ropes, but just
 now, rope-stung, blind--and groping, feeling around
 for the way, any way, or, closer to home,
  
 when the power goes at night just getting from
 here to there even though you know the drill, 
 --you never find the batteries when you need them,
 groping down cellar for the circuit breaker then
  
 you flip it nothing, it's a bigger failure you are part of--
 know the layout in general yet without ceremony
 the mind leans forward, over an edge, hoping for,
 needing a little ritual, like a guide rail to keep it
  
 
  
 from falling, going down. even then the mind
 finds need of other news, keeps on desiring
 alterity somewhere at hand. for example,
 walking the streets of provincetown, nothing to see
  
 but lots to look at, all that fluff and buff,
 the michelin-man day-trippers aching along
 suddenly i want a prayer book, maybe not
 bottles and stools or the little red book but still . . .
  
 even a pocket copy of a shropshire lad,
 such as i find soon after all the buff and fluff
 at tim's, the only bookstore on the street,
 handy for quick reads. thin as a shortbread biscuit,
  
 
  
 the richards press london , no doubt
 with its khaki cover, intended for some tommy's
 backpack, a backward solace for off-duty hours
 in the trenches admittedly not very much
  
 on the other hand just the thing i'm talking after
 a talisman perhaps is all, an amulet
 with words that say, buck up, come on, you'll make it,
 there's something on after all this, no matter
  
 what the words say. housman's vision, his drear
 anguish of love for someone, something, lad
 and landscape that never were, that might shoot threads
 of gold among the bloody muslins and the mud
  
  
  
 mind wants other news than what the ruffled senses
 bring data of--smoke or flesh or birdsong.
 it saw there was a space within, reserved
 for turning toward another other that
  
 no bullet, arrowwood or beach plum might 
 fill, though these could occupy that space
 a moment.
                     again i heard the casual chirping
 of that bird, off in that tupelo, the song
  
 i did not know, below the cries of gull
 and jay i did. the unknown i saw was not
 enough to satisfy or--satisfied when it
 was framed, complement of what is known for sure.
  
 
  
 it's--like--when you go someplace strange, new,
 the seashore, any boundary, you want to learn the names
 of plants. start looking at the edges of leaves. it gives 
 a grip on where you are, and who, or seems to,
  
 to know bullbrier, bearberry, blueberry. you get a guide
 or a local to tell. on the dune path i found one, a gnarled
 bush alone, hollylike but succulent leaf nothing
 like it in the book. but why feel helped in nature
  
 by a name? when a horde of flower children wanted
 to know what they should do to be saved back when
 snyder told them, learn the names of plants
 of animals learn to do something with your hands.
  
 
  
 well i went out to that dune again to cop a copy
 of the leaf i took and lost so it's only bayberry
 after all dioecious, two-sexed some leaves different
 from others, that's ok only one got pictured
  
 in my book but the waxiness, bayberry for sure, set
 to be rendered into candles for a gifte shoppe,
 nauseating noose of scents. its nutlets twinkle
 near the oily leaves aglow above the sand,
  
 bone white. doesn't make me feel better to know now
 about that scrawny straggler. sanctimonious 
 pilgrim know-alls, bradford & co. forest
 into desert, just like that. no time flat, considering.



that bag you packed me
 when you sent me
 to the universe--
 camp after camp i've opened it
 debating whether to unpack--
         not yet, not yet--
 why did i feel so much in it
 was dangerous on the playground,
 too good for everyday,
 feel those splendid fireworks
 hazardous to institutions,
 unmannerly to etiquette,
 so that, time after time,
 i found myself saying
        not yet?
  
 at each new place i faced it,
 it suggested,
 here spread out your things,
 put on this coat,
 open this bottle--
        no, not yet . . .
 sometimes throwing something out,
 giving things away,
 lightening my load. . . .
  
 the more i pull out,
 the more it seems, some days,
 is left inside,
 the heavier it is.
  
 sometimes i think this package
 is almost a door
 the opening of which
 careening across heaven
 could be fatal.
  
 some days now i wonder if i'll ever
 dare face my given garments--
 permanently wrinkled,
 surely out of date--
 your travel-thought
 wasting in its tissue, flesh-corrupt--
 till i've absorbed it,
 like those stitches that dissolve
 in an incision
 where something's been removed.



first light of day in mississippi
 son of laborer & of house wife
 it says so on the official photostat
 not son of fisherman & child fugitive
 from cottonfields & potato patches
 from sugarcane chickens & well-water
 from kerosene lamps & watermelons
 mules named jack or jenny & wagonwheels,
  
 years of meaningless farm work
 work work work work work--
 papa pull you outta school bout march
 to stay on the place & work the crop
 --her own earliest knowledge
 of human hopelessness & waste
  
 she carried me around nine months
 inside her fifteen year old self
 before here i sit numbering it all
  
 how i got from then to now
 is the mystery that could fill a whole library
 much less an arbitrary stanza
  
 but of course you already know about that
 from your own random suffering
 & sudden inexplicable bliss



for gordon lapides
green is the color of everything
 that isn't brown, the tones ranging
 like mountains, the colors changing.
  
 you look up toward the hills & fog--
 the familiarity of it after so many years
           a resident tourist.
  
                                                    a young man walks
 toward you in vague streetcrossing denims
 & pronounced boots. from the pallor of
           his gait, the orange splotch twin gobs of sunset
           in his shades, from the way he vibrates
           his surrounding air, you can tell, you can tell
                     he's friendly, circulating,
  
                                     he's a californian comes to visit,
                               stays for years, marries, moves a wife in,
                          kids, wears out tv sets, get stranded on
                                                 loneliness,
                                         afternoon pharmaceutica,
                                so that the sky's got moon in it by
                                      o'clock, is blooo, is blown--
                           
                                                                 the girls theyre all
                                         winners reared by grandmothers & cbs.
  
                                    luckier ones get in a few dances with 
                                 mom, a few hours, before dad goes back
                             in the slam, before g'bye i'm off
                                      to be a singer & another runaway
                                          miss american future drifts
                                               over the mountain &
                                                    into the clouds.
  
                                                    still
             there's a beautifulness about california.
 it's based on the way each eyeblink toward
 the palms & into the orange grove leads backstage
                      into the onionfields.
  
 unreachable, winter happens inside you.
  
 your unshaded eyes dilate at the spectacle.
  
 you take trips to contain the mystery.



she talks too loud, her face
 a blur of wrinkles & sunshine
 where her hard hair shivers
 from laughter like a pine tree
 stiff with oil & hotcombing
  
 o & her anger realer than gasoline
 slung into fire or lighted mohair
 she's a clothes lover from way back
 but her body's too big to be chic
 or on cue so she wear what she want
 people just gotta stand back &
 take it like they do easter sunday when
 the rainbow she travels is dry-cleaned
  
 she laughs more than ever in spring
 stomping the downtowns, saturday past
 work, looking into jc penney's checking
 out sears & bragging about how when she
 feel like it she gon lose weight &
 give up smoking one of these sorry days
  
 her eyes are diamonds of pure dark space
 & the air flying out of them as you look
 close is only the essence of living
 to tell, a full-length woman, an aunt
 brown & red with stalking the years



now i'll tell you about theblues. all negroes like blues. why? because they was born withthe blues. and now everybodyhave the blues. sometimes they don't know what it is.                 --leadbelly
and i was born with you, wasn't i, blues?
 wombed with you, wounded, reared and forwarded
 from address to address, stamped, stomped
 and returned to sender by nobody else but you,
 blue rider, writing me off every chance you
 got, you mean old grudgeful-hearted, table-
 turning demon, you, you sexy soul-sucking gem.
  
 blue diamond in the rough, you are forever.
 you can't be outfoxed don't care how they cut
 and smuggle and shine you on,  you're like a
 shadow, too dumb and stubborn and necessary
 to let them turn you into what you ain't
 with color or theory or powder or paint.
  
 that's how you can stay in style without sticking
 and not getting stuck. you know how to sting
 where i can't scratch, and you move from frying
 pan to skillet the same way you move people
 to go to wiggling their bodies, juggling their
 limbs, loosening that goose, upping their voices,
 opening their pores, rolling their hips and lips.
  
 they can shake their boodies but they can't shake you.



do it, yells the man across the street to his motorcycle.
 we each meet the day in our own way.
 the aquarium with three unspent goldfish buzzes.
 three flies are flying.
 coffee, traceable to dark, wet trees in central america, cools.
 the black cat on my lap hates poetry, even the sound of it being typed.
 my skull and the falling stars sing back and forth the songs of magnets
               in heat.
 a car with a broken muffler hums along, mumbling answers to questions
               i haven't shaped yet.
 what is a life?
 stacks of typing paper wait to be darkened, dented.
 on my white wall a photograph of the poet james galvin
 cut out from the american poetry review.
 sometimes i want to be
  
               .  an american 
               .  a poet
               .  reviewed
  
 james looks like a farmboy iowa, iowa, you have more poets than
               scarecrows these fuse-lit days.
 how carelessly james sits back on his hips, staring into the camera's eye.
 imprisoned inside there is the last surviving cyclops,
 and i think of w. c. w.'s lines
  
                the beauty of  terrible faces.
  
 when my face opens like james's, it is a year later, years later.
 some life is gone.
 only poems remain.
 perhaps a poem that a magazine wanted to publish before it folded
                folded, the flight of such a word.
 and so the poem is stuck on a roll without a player piano.
 imagination insists on saving its works as a poem, a tattoo, a quilt, an
               essay, or an aside, like this one
  
                                        love's chilly night
  
                         an angel's cold hand
                         irons leaves into
                         this flat romance
  
                         colors distract us
                         from stems rotting
                         under our own feet
  
                         an angel burdens
                         our night with
                         its little laughs
  
                         as a derisive white
                         moon freezes
                         far from a fire
  
 even as i type this my coffee is cold the peasants who picked the beans are
                sleeping bottles of erasing fluids await their inevitable moments.
 i lose this moment.
 i'm dancing in the rain with a witch from san carlos botta--is it you?
 her red skirt turns like one solid year of sunsets.
 i almost catch her, but i'm back to this moment.
 just in time to send you, my friends, another telegram.
 here, wordsworth's worthy words.
  
                i know i will have to bear their cost.
  
                cling stop together stop in stop
                             one stop society stop
                                             rane stop
  
 but the words won't stop and what do i owe?
  
 on my desk a dictionary.
 all mine, my mine.
  
 words like lacrimator wait for me,
              lak re mat ar
 which means
  
              .  the lake really matters
              .  the lilac reddens into matters of the air
              .  the lack of the red mats in the attic
  
 yes 
 all of the above and below.
  
 one of the flies has landed on a photograph of me hiding behind
              japanese fans.
 i stare at the fly staring at the me who no longer exists.
 i will not exist soon.
 i'm here, behind the typewriter.
 men don't split into new personae at the command of flashes.
  
 we can become fleshless though, like the skeletons in mexican
              cathedrals, guardians of empty confessionals.
 in my room, i stare into a smaller box
  
              a brooding young man embraces
              a golden girl whose blue dress
  
              has the words forget xanadu'
              stitched into it while dice without
  
              numbers float in the air suspended
              between a far heaven and a near earth
  
              as a black spider crawls toward
              the blind moon. a gray feather's
  
              sleep on a blackening hill is
              a hint of uncompleted journeys
  
 my neighbor comes home on his slow, red motorcycle and enters this
              poem again.
 the miles hum between his legs.
  
 one of the flies has bitten me.
 the black cat darkens all the windows by jumping sill to sill.
 the goldfish haven't lost their glitter.
 at last, this is my land.
 i've learned to speak its language
 america, i give you the power to break my heart.



in one version you must convince every living thing one by one
 to weep until he climbs back into the marriage-house,
 that earth about which it is said that bread is the glue of the earth.
 certainly glue is money, the phrase the tears of things is money,
 the revelation of the woman clothed in the sun is money.
 the lake is a disc of bright money buying a few plain birds down,
 they climb back nervously as you hurry through, plain birds like a
                                                                                                    plain song,
 that moment when four or five are around your knees
 like zeno's arrow, rising by halves, like eurydice's bread,
 & still the possibility they might intersect,
 you would be the one who was struck by a flying bird,
 somewhere between a blessd fool & village idiot,
 the only one to persist outside the local economy,
 drooling at travelers, holding yourself, slinging incomprehensible
                                                                                                    advice,
 you would learn the trick with museum wire
 where you snap the heads off quiet animals in front of the store,
 tempted equally by science & dirty work. . . .
  
 i am trying to invent a way for you to buy me back--



they moved across the screen like a computer simulation.
 they moved across the screen like complex models & we learned
                                       to call this a nature show.
 animals but set in gray shades for video capture with a lighter area for
      the face.
 almost white they moved across the screen like a compressed
      meditation.
 but the song was never familiar.
 because this was the only room this was the only room where we
      undressed--
                                       that was the plot.
 they moved across the screen across the room but it was not happening
      to us.
 the image burning in.
 coated with hair & then a lighter area for the face meaning exposed
      skin.
 we have learned to wear the architecture despite the sky's numerous
      advances.
 all these things--the speed & the music & the room--happened but 
      not enough.
 we undressed in the room we could not take off where i handcuffed
      you to the story.
 this is the work of the brain--itself a bloody spring or electric wire
                                       wrapped in ripe gray gauze--
                                       you like it.
  lobes resembling the holy tablets delivered into the veldt's dry
      speed--the laws
                                       prefigured in the neutral network's burning thicket.
 they moved across the screen howling but the sound turned down.
 this happened over & over again--the blue light leaking into the
      room like sand.
 burning into the brain in a finery of filamental fire.
 the laws which do not unravel into noise & make a kind of story of
      kinked plot
                                       which can't be straightened like a motel wire
                                       hanger looped around your wrists.
 the loop like a computer simulation--the thought of the thought--
                                       the image burning in now.
 we began to understand what they were--
                                       the thou & the shalt & the not



for  months he lay in bed over the
  
 difference between the bell rings & he rings
  
 the bell. did those  rings sound
  
 different? the invisible disturbance which
  
 is the bell's vibration beating at the air--a
  
 field effect--does it shift with the
  
 ringer's will? this, he thought, was the 
  
 smallest difference between things which the
  
 human mind could hold or almost hold, the
  
 thought-of-it falling away from the thinking,
  
 a penny rolling to the horizon & so to
  
 sleep . . .. he couldn't get up. it became clear
  
 that he was the murderer. everyone knows. a
  
 man standing at a podium reads from notes.
  
 in the audience people nod in immaculate
  
 suits, women & men. when i am done
  
 someone will transcribe what i say into speech.
  
 it will not resemble my notes. he is just the
  
 thing between his notes & his speech. this is
  
 only fair, that he be the air. some of the
  
 women wear hats with feathers in them, wild,
  
 candescent. in the audience is a boy named b,
  
 not the letter, not the note. another sound,
  
 neither letter nor note--



back of the church the busy forsythias bow
 and scrape to may and all these blessed stones
 stiff in their careful finery of words
 the mess of markers makes me go and browse.
  
 somehow the blocks of slate and marble hate
 to be cut and carved to the dimensions
 of mary monday's age and her virtues.
 at heart they hurt to be made literate
 and they are rebelling, fast as they can,
 shedding an edge, a letter, as they go
 --a year, a part of a skull, a bone--
 it hurts them to stand so long for this
 kind of death not theirs. fast as they can
 they are leaning away from their duty
 and look down longing for the warm sod.
 the prides and fears they stand witness to,
 the ladies and gents, are only whimsy now.
 they cease to reflect that wary pride
 the flesh beneath them took in lying down.
 to the last date line and death's-head-stare,
 the legend reads, there i've done it
 but these are only beginning,
 the blocks of shale forget their lines
 letting the sunlight and rain divide
 and subdivide their veins and bone.
 they do not care, they only feel 
 an unnatural heaviness, tottering so
 in the hot light. they long to be off and away,
 they toss and jibe in the sun
 a whole regatta of black sails, they are sailing away
 over the lumpy green yard of time, and never
 coming about for home until they capsize
 turned turtle by boys from central square.
  
 tired of holding--they are tired of holding up
 their always-leaning makes me hold my tongue
 and sit with them awhile. we heave
 our shoulders, or our shadows, on the mounds,
 while under the hills, memorials more fine
 lie lip to paper lip
                                  and keep their impossible word.



sewn straw, exact pattern. fields of rice-sprigs
 evenly set, a mile of herringbone tweed.
 the town, a sea of gunmetal, fish-scale tiles.
  
 by morning each floor a casserole of pillows,
 coverlets, comforters, towels    flown nests. imprint
 of bodies, fading. they fold the beds away,
 the room waits empty all day.
                                                        all day the bodies
 circle, leaving no impression on each
 other. tooled in the foundry of the streets.
 school-caps, factory-packed subway, miracle train
 one territorial imperative,
 an emperor's.
                           on his platform one yard square
 perched on a roof that slopes in waves of tiles
 up toward other tiled cascades, the karate student
 for  hours does running in place, deep knee bends
 on his surfboard perch. all his free time to make
 his body efficient, tight, exact, rising
 and falling, mint piston pumping in its shaft.



after the declaration by emperor
 to stop the war
 many people in tokyo killed themselves,
 for instance, in front of the imperial palace.
 but few people knows those facts.
  
 hence you must teach me
 where you got the news or what sort of book
 gave you the fact that quite few people knows.
 to know the fact of our nation's subjection
 is not so comfortable
 but the fact of many people's spontaneous death
 gives me more complicated feelings.
  
 in the matter of what william gass said
 i must describe my feelings. i went
 to nagasaki
 on an educational trip four years ago.
 i can recollect those serious moment
 which was given by the beamed materials
 in the memorial hall.
  
 but most youth after the war
 are indifferent to those
 nightmares
 because of our no experience. surely,
 i think, those barbarious conducts
 shouldn't be forgiven or forgotten at all
 and we must not close our eyes
 to the rebombing
 at any place
 in this world.
  
 in conclusion i may say that most people
 except sufferers
 or the like
 will not have ill feelings toward your country
 but they will reproach
 the suffocative fact
 in history.
  
 where were you when the world war ii was over.
 please share your experience of the war with me.
 i'm now interested in the wars concerned with japan
 for the past  years. if you tell me your reflections
 i can suspect more seriously.
 you have abandoned such cursed things as useless?
 in that war  million people were killed
 on the side of our nation, especially
 three hundred thousand people by the a-bomb.
 over the war between the imperialism
 and militarism america won a victory.
 what does this word mean?

 in tokyo our gallant boys
 dance rock-and-roll, squint eyes
 wary at standing easy. they leer and reel
 on a springboard tip and then
 jackknife toward the electronic noise . . .
  
 and charley, when time inc. said he said
 the president had his head
 wedged about vietnam
                    burning for honor or--who knows?
 the action he had said--
                    married the marines.
 he showered for vows on those
  
 who took his word who taught him
 shoot it out and shout yes sir yes sir
                    and sent him out like napalm
 obedient to any itchy finger.
  
 i hope the fields of minnesota gave perspective
 when he moved out
                                      as to the starting line
 on the command, survive, survive.

               what
 did i tell you 

when we met
 last and it
  
 after the leeches and the food
 on a break
                    in the rain
 was already up with you, charley?
  
 mouthing the big cigar
 like a gangster at the wheel . . .
  
                    cigarette between thumb and finger
                    the way we all even in junior high
                    learned not to
                    your men watching in wonder
  
                    him tasting the strange
                             turned officer so young
                    foreign taste
                    that smoke     and all was dark
                           except what sparks
                    he scattered there, stubbing it out
  
 what could we do for you
  
 you hugging your knees
  
                    who taught you
                    to raise your voice?
  
                  
  
 no more the wide mankato pearled with ice
                   under blue january sky
 your arm around the shoulder of the friend who ran faster
 no more the long hours pad in hand composing
                   reasons for your belief
 a belief in fathers has no reason
  
 no more the simple passion of going first
 your hatless straightness, the struggle, the deep worry,
                   the dark africa of being alive in a country
                   run by chiefs without tribes
 no more of all that, only your 
                   brief beauty in many hearts
 in a time when fathers bury their sons, and you
                   surrounded, cut down
 in a war you were fated never to see,
                   blinded by love for all men.



i remember the dusty floorboards of wood in the streetcar
 of the minneapolis street railway company
 and the varnished yellow banquettes of tight-knit rattan
 worn smooth by decades of passengers
 the worn gleaming brass grips at the corners of the seats
 and the motorman's little bell
 windows trembling in their casings as we crossed the avenue
 liberty dimes falling softly into the steel-rimmed hour glass
 the gnarled hand of the motorman near.
 my grandmother arranged herself against the seat
 her back as straight as a soldier's beside me
 her navy hat with velvet band
 and net veil down making her head seem distant,
 her dreaming smile and the patient roman nose,
 a repose so deep from my place
 i watched her when we rode like princes
 rattling past traffic stopped on the granite cobbles
 riding downtown together, my hands in hers
 all that so much
 that i love yet but feel no sadness for, that
 time crossed out like the trolley tracks taken up
 or entombed under the pliant blacktop of the modernized. 


tell me the way to the wedding
 tell me the way to the war,
 tell me the needle you're threading
 i won't raise my voice anymore.
  
 and tell me what axe you are grinding
 where the boy on the bivouac believes,
 what reel you are unwinding
 for the girl in her bed who grieves.
  
 while behind a derrick's girder
 he watches the sinking sun,
 he asks what he'll do for murder
 and what he will do for fun.
  
 will you read him the ways of war
 his miranda rights in sin,
 will you tell him what to ignore
 when he studies your discipline?
  
 he dozes off--but he shakes
 in a dream that he is the one
 death finds abed and wakes
 just as the night is done.
  
 tell me what boats go ashore
 riding the oil-dimmed tide,
 red streamers and black in store
 for the boy with a pain in his side.
  
 and tell me where they are heading
 tonight now tell me the score.
 tell me the way to their wedding
 i won't raise my own voice anymore.



i passed him by at first. from the photograph
 peered sepia eyes, blindered, unappeased
 from a lair of brows and beard one not amazed
 at anything, as if to have looked enough
 then turned aside worked best for him--as if
 night vision was the discipline that eased
 the weight of what he saw. a man's gaze posed
 too long in the sun goes blank comes to grief.
 that face could be a focus for this back room,
 for pack-rat papers strewn as if in rage,
 fond notes unread each wary eye a phial
 unstopped to let huge melville out, to calm
 the sea of pages melville in older age
 the grown man's sleepy defiance of denial.



after you left me forever,
 i was broken into pieces,
 and all the pieces flung into the river.
 then the legs crawled ashore
 and aimlessly wandered the dusty cow-track.
 they became, for a while, a simple roadside shrine
 a tiny table set up between the thighs
 held a dusty candle, weed-and-fieldflower chains
 placed reverently there by children and old women.
 my knees were hung with tin triangular medals
 to cure all forms of hysterical disease.
  
 after i died forever in the river,
 my torso floated, bloated in the stream,
 catching on logs or stones among the eddies.
 white water foamed around it, then dislodged it
 after a whirlwind trip, it bumped ashore.
 a grizzled old man who scavenged along the banks
 had already rescued my arms and put them by,
 knowing everything has its uses, sooner or later.
  
 when he found my torso, he called it his canoe,
 and, using my arms as paddles,
 he rowed me up and down the scummy river.
 when catfish nibbled my fingers he scooped them up
 and blessed his reusable bait.
 clumsy but serviceable, that canoe
 the trail of blood that was its wake
 attracted the carp and eels, and the river turtle,
 easily landed, dazed by my tasty red.
  
 a young lad found my head among the rushes
 and placed it on a dry stone.
 he carefully combed my hair with a bit of shell
 and set small offerings before it
 which the birds and rats obligingly stole at night,
 so it seemed i ate.
 and the breeze wound through my mouth and empty sockets
 so my lungs would sigh, and my dead tongue mutter.
 attached to my throat like a sacred necklace
 was a circlet of small snails.
 soon the villagers came to consult my oracular head
 with its waterweed crown.
 seers found occupation, interpreting sighs,
 and their papyrus rolls accumulated.
  
 meanwhile, young boys retrieved my eyes
 they used for marbles in a simple game
 till somebody's pretty sister snatched at them
 and set them, for luck, in her bridal diadem.
 poor girl when her future groom caught sight of her,
 all eyes, he crossed himself in horror,
 and stumbled away in haste
 through her dowered meadows.
  
 what then of my heart and organs,
 my sacred slit
 which loved you best of all?
 they were caught in a fisherman's net
 and tossed at night into a pen for swine.
 but they shone so by moonlight that the sows stampeded,
 trampled one another in fear, to get away.
 and the fisherman's wife, who had thirteen living children
 and was contemptuous of holy love,
 raked the rest of me onto the compost heap.
  
 then in their various places and helpful functions,
 the altar, oracle, offal, canoe and oars
 learned the wild rumor of your return.
 the altar leapt up, and ran to the canoe,
 scattering candle grease and wilted grasses.
 arms sprang to their sockets, blind hands with nibbled nails
 groped their way, aided by loud lamentation,
 to the bed of the bride, snatched up those unlucky eyes
 from her discarded veil and diadem, 
 and rammed them home. oh, what a bright day it was
 this empty body danced on the riverbank.
 hollow, it called and searched among the fields
 for those parts that steamed and simmered in the sun,
 and never would have found them.
  
 but then your great voice rang out under the skies
 my name--and all those private names
 for the parts and places that had loved you best.
 and they stirred in their nest of hay and dung.
 the distraught old ladies chasing their lost altar,
 and the seers pursuing my skull, their lost employment,
 and the tumbling boys, who wanted the magic marbles,
 and the runaway groom, and the fisherman's thirteen children
 set up such a clamor, with their cries of miracle
 that our two bodies met like a thunderclap
 in midday--right at the corner of that wretched field
 with its broken fenceposts and startled, skinny cattle.
 we fell in a heap on the compost heap
 and all our loving parts made love at once,
 while the bystanders cheered and prayed and hid their eyes
 and then went decently about their business.
  
 and here it is, moonlight again we've bathed in the river
 and are sweet and wholesome once more.
 we kneel side by side in the sand
 we worship each other in whispers.
 but the inner parts remember fermenting hay,
 the comfortable odor of dung, the animal incense,
 and passion, its bloody labor,
 its birth and rebirth and decay.



eating is touch carried to the bitter end.                                                                                           samuel butler ii 
i'm going to murder you with love
 i'm going to suffocate you with embraces
 i'm going to hug you, bone by bone,
 till you're dead all over.
 then i will dine on your delectable marrow.
  
 you will become my personal sahara
 i'll sun myself in you, then with one swallow
 drain your remaining brackish well.
 with my female blade i'll carve my name
 in your most aspiring palm
 before i chop it down.
 then i'll inhale your last oasis whole.
  
 but in the total desert you become
 you'll see me stretch, horizon to horizon,
 opulent mirage
 wisteria balconies dripping cyclamen.
 vistas ablaze with crystal, laced in gold.
  
 so you will summon each dry grain of sand
 and move toward me in undulating dunes
 till you arrive at sudden ultramarine
 a mediterranean to stroke your dusty shores
 obstinate verdure, creeping inland, fast renudes
 your barrens succulents spring up everywhere,
 surprising life and i will be that green.
  
 when you are fed and watered, flourishing
 with shoots entwining trellis, dome, and spire,
 till you are resurrected field in bloom,
 i will devour you, my natural food,
 my host, my final supper on the earth,
 and you'll begin to die again.


for john
at a party i spy a handsome psychiatrist,
 and wish, as we all do, to get her advice for free.
 doctor, i'll say, i'm supposed to be a poet.
 all life's awfulness has been grist to me.
 we learn that happiness is a chinese meal,
 while sorrow is a nourishment forever.
 my new environment is california dreamer.
 i'm fearful i'm forgetting how to brood.
 and, doctor, another thing has got me worried
 i'm not drinking as much as i should . . .
  
 at home, i want to write a happy poem
 on love, or a love poem of happiness.
 but they won't do, the tensions of every day,
 the rub, the minor abrasions of any two
 who share one space. ah, there's no substitute for tragedy
 but in this chapter, tragedy belongs
 to that other life, the old life before us.
 here is my aphorism of the day
 happy people are monogamous.
 even in california. so how does the poem play
  
 without the paraphernalia of betrayal and loss?
 i don't have a jealous eye or fear
 and neither do you. in truth, i'm fond
 of your ex-mate, whom i name my wife-in-law.
 my former husband, that old disaster, is now just funny,
 so laugh we do, in what cyril connolly
 has called the endless, nocturnal conversation
 of marriage. which may be the best part.
 darling, must i love you in light verse
 without the tribute of profoundest art?
  
 of course it won't last. you will break my heart
 or i yours, by dying. i could weep over that.
 but now it seems forced, here in these heaven hills,
the mourning doves mourning, the squirrels mating,
 my old cat warm in my lap, here on our terrace
 as from below comes a musical cursing
 as you mend my favorite plate. later of course
 i could pick a fight there is always material in that.
 but we don't come from fighting people, those
 who scream out red-hot iambs in their hate.
  
 no, love, the heavy poem will have to come
 from temps perdu, fertile with pain, or perhaps
 detonated by terrors far beyond this place
 where the world rends itself, and its tainted waters
 rise in the east to erode our safety here.
 much as i want to gather a lifetime thrift
 and craft, my cunning skills tied in a knot for you,
 there is only this useless happiness as gift.


tell us how the soul is bound and bentinto these knots, and whether any ever frees itself from such imprisonment. --canto xii, inferno 

i say, without a god there is no hell.
 there's only this--. she rustles for her keys.
 the apple tree sheds petal after petal.
  
 she says, let's take you to the hospital.
 the petals spin like sparks. i close my eyes 
 and say, without a god there is no hell,
  
 and there is only this. it's just as well.
 the lawn is red and white. she asks, who says?
 how do you know? the wind fells every petal.
  
 she says, let's take you to the hospital.
 i cannot breathe. i cannot tell her, yes--.
 because without a god there is no hell,
  
 as she whispers, talk to me, i know i will
 clamber--but not toward heaven, toward the sky,
 eyes winking behind petal after petal.
  
 the rope-burnt bark will flake away and fall.
 knot on my neck, the rest would be so easy
 i'll pray, without a god there is no hell,
 then slip through petals--through petal after petal.



for john fogleman

there are some things we just don't talk about--
 not even in the morning, when we're waking,
 when your calloused fingers tentatively walk
 the slope of my waist
                                          how love's a rust-worn boat,
 abandoned at the dock--and who could doubt
 waves lick their teeth, eyeing its hull? we're taking
 our wreckage as a promise, so we don't talk.
 we wet the tired oars, tide drawing us out.
  
 we understand there's nothing to be said.
 both of us know the dangers of this sea,
 warned by the tide-worn driftwood of our pasts--.
 but we've already strayed from the harbor. we thread
 a slow wake though the water--then silently,
 we start to row, and will for as long as this lasts.



					
					when he wakes up out of sleep, the brown boy remembers two things his white man calls and breaks the groans of kevin bacon, naked and writhing in pain on a hard and wet black street. bacon has been beaten with broken bottles and has had his chest smashed in with a large flaming couch section. a mob of whites poured gasoline all over his chiseled stomach and then lit him afire. brad pitt lay next to him, his stomach breathless and glistening in the flame's light.     the brown boy knows this is somewhere between movie and dream, staring at each stomach but more importantly, he knows that despite the fire, the bodies did not burn. they did not char or turn black. they simply shined in sweat.     the brown boy will commit to his memory, most, brad pitt's dying, and how he eventually turned over on his stomach, his penis turned down and scrape fucking the street--brad pitt ejaculating and on fire, the liquid shooting out of him as he looked up, staggered to his feet to let out something between groaning and laughter out to the black sky. though pitt had been beaten with bottles and wood, it was not clear where he was hurt, only that he was a screaming surface, dripping with lit gasoline and semen.     as the brown boy ponders this surface, the white man has chosen to phone his brown boy. their first conversation of the day is bound by this scene--and dutifully, for the white man, he wants to start from the beginning   brad pitt and kevin bacon are in a boxing ring in the middle of a football field. they are both wearing white boxer shorts, no gloves, and about to perform a dance routine. i am standing next to them, looking at brad pitt's hair flop down over his face. he smiles at me before the music starts. from everywhere, broken glass bottles hurl at their bodies, and they are splashed with gasoline. we are also in a dark alley lit by fire. the two are still standing, looking over at me, though i can't tell who is smiling. i only know brad pitt winks at me while kevin bacon is on the street, writhing as a large white flaming couch section is smashed onto his chest.   my mother was dead in the dream. i was looking through a dense stash of clothes in a cabinet. all of them were soiled, and none of the clothes were hers. i remember holding a pair of purple and green speedos that were woven to a pair of matching polyester tennis shorts. these shorts were my father's. i remember my mother making all of his tennis shorts. i also remember pulling out a pair of long sweatpants that were much too large for my mother and holding them up as crumbs fell from the legs. i tried to smell them, wanting to think of her alive.        what the brown boy doesn't say is that he wondered, in the dream, how his father was getting through this--living alone with only her smell left behind. or how he pulled the sweatpants up to his nose and mouth, absorbing the whole of her scent through his body. without revealing his father's grief or his own, the brown boy breathes in the smell of giorgio mixed with eleven years of shifts at the convalescent home, and gives the white man what he thought he wanted. he quickly shot to the end, where brad pitt grinds his fat cock in the pavement, the curve of it pushing down bent and spewing semen into the street.   kevin bacon stands up and groans, laughing as his bowels leak from his stomach. i was thinking about that before you called.        the brown boy knows the white man wants to hear the brown boy rise from sleep, hear the spill from his head in the morning without saying a word. though this morning, to this dream, the white man has two responses he calls the dream bizarre and says nothing about the brown boy's mother, only i feel sorry for brad pitt.


we say lightning has no wings
 when it slides down our houses
  
 we say loss is just a condition
 we acquire to bury our pity further
  
 we say the bleeding hands
 on the table filled with red wine
 imported products and passports
 are just reminders of 
 who we have become
  
 we have no titles no birthright
 no groves or shakespeare
 to return to
  
 we apologize for the fear
 growing out of our ribs
  
 apologize for the numbers
 still etched on our tongues



--
  
 one hundred breaths split the air
 as i lean
 on the only pine tree i find.
 it's early or late, it's breezy or hot.
 the fields are dry. summer is near.
 the horses are everywhere, 
 strangely galloping a dream,
 but i can't remember
 how to call them,
 so i stand back, watch them pass.
  
  
 --
  
 the first time i rode a horse
 my body found the music of fire,
 crackling the wind. an unbearable pleasure
 that also left me with a burn on the side of my leg.
 a sign, the horsekeeper told me, of longing.
 a need to return--to belong.
 after all, departure is like
 pushing the weight of our heart
 against the village
 whose name has kept us awake.
  
  
 --
  
 rafael came from somewhere in eurasia.
 i passed my hands through his mane--
 saw a history of conquests and battles,
 a field of hay, a mount of truth,
 heard a silent ring,
 his eyes asking me to go with him,
 to confess something sacred,
 to name something lustful.
 nothing of where he came from, 
 or who i was, disturbed us.
  
  
 --
  
 i knew he was different by the way he ran--
 without pause,
 without grace,
 without distraction,
 without ease.
 he was told how to move in the world
 and resented it.
 he knew he would never own anything.
  
  
 --
  
 he came toward me.
 it was a quiet afternoon.
 i stood unmoving.
 and we listened to the untitled music
 circling the earth like an anthem
 free of its nation.

 he was unfamiliar to me, 
 approaching as if he possessed the land.
 every morning he stopped five feet
 from the river.



the shadows of birds fading on a fighter's back
  
 the undressing of words on an unstamped postcard
  
 the wet swings in the distant park
  
 the jealousy of raindrops on the umbrella of lovers
  
 the laughter of a boy before a bird
  
 the song of two flutes, two swords, two bracelets, two fingers
  
 the stare of a wave before a pearl
  
 the yearning between the legs of a farmer's wife
  
 the opening of doors             closing midday
  
 the sudden howling of our muse--and 
  
 les ventails--disturbing the guest inside of us



everything's happening on the cusp of tragedy, the tip of comedy, the pivot of event.
 you want a placid life, find another planet. this one is occupied with the story's arc
 about to happen, on the verge, horizontal. you want another planet, try the moon.
 try any of the eight, try planet x. it's out there somewhere, black with serenity.
 how interesting will our times become? how much more interesting can they become?
  
 a crow with something dangling from its beak flaps onto a telephone pole top, daintily,
 and croaks its victory to other crows and tries to keep its morsel to itself.
 a limp shape, leggy, stunned, drops from the black beak's scissors like a rag.
 we drive past, commenting, and looking upward. a sunny morning, too cold to be nesting,
 unless that is a nest the crow has seized, against the coming spring.
  
 we've been at this historical site before, but not in any history we remember.
 the present has been cloaked in cloud before, and not on any holy mountaintop.
 to know the stars will one day fly apart so far they can't be seen
 is almost a relief. for the future flies in one direction--toward us.
 and the only way to sidestep it--the only way--is headed this way, too.
  
 so, look. that woman's got a child by the hand. she's dragging him across the street.
 he's crying and she's shouting, but we see only dumbshow. their breath is smoke.
 will she give in and comfort him? will he concede at last? we do not know.
 their words are smoke. in a minute they'll be somewhere else entirely.
 everyone in a minute will be somewhere else entirely. as the crow flies.



. 
 let us think of god as a lover
        who never calls,
 whose pleasure in us is aroused
        in unrepeatable ways,
 god as a body we cannot
        separate from desire,
 saying to us, your love
        is only physical.
 let us think of god as a bronze
        with green skin
 or a plane that draws the eye close
        to the texture of paint.
 let us think of god as life,
        a bacillus or virus,
 as death, an igneous rock
        in a quartz garden.
 then, let us think of kissing
        god with the kisses
 of our mouths, of lying with god,
        as sea worms lie,
 snugly petrifying
        in their coral shirts.
 let us think of ourselves
        as part of god,
 neither alive nor dead,
        but like alpha, omega,
 glyphs and hieroglyphs,
        numbers, data.

 first forgive the silence
        that answers prayer,
 then forgive the prayer
        that stains the silence.
  
 excuse the absence
        that feels like presence,
 then excuse the feeling
        that insists on presence.
  
 pardon the delay
        of revelation,
 then ask pardon for revealing
        your impatience.
  
 forgive god
        for being only a word,
 then ask god to forgive
        the betrayal of language.

 god of the syllable
        god of the word

 god of the sparrow's fall
        god of the spark

 the new day cancels dread
        and dawn forgives all sins,
 all the judgments of insomnia,
        as if they were only dreams.
  
 the ugly confrontation
        after midnight, with the mirror,
 turns white around the edges
        and burns away like frost.
  
 daylight undoes gravity
        and lightness responds to the light.
 the new day lifts all weight,
        like stepping off into space.
  
 where is that room you woke to,
        by clock-light, at  a.m.?
 nightmare's many mansions,
        falling, have taken it with them.
  
 the new day, the day's newness,
        and the wretchedness that, you thought,
 would never, never depart,
        meet--and there is goodbye.
  
 a bad night lies ahead
        and a new day beyond that--
 a simple sequence, but hard
        to remember in the right order.
  
 . 
 lord of dimensions and the dimensionless,
 wave and particle, all and none,
  
 who lets us measure the wounded atom,
 who lets us doubt all measurement,
  
 when in this world we betray you
 let us be faithful in another.



i think continually of those who were truly great.
 who, from the womb, remembered the soul's history
 through corridors of light, where the hours are suns,
 endless and singing. whose lovely ambition
 was that their lips, still touched with fire,
 should tell of the spirit, clothed from head to foot in song.
 and who hoarded from the spring branches
 the desires falling across their bodies like blossoms.
  
 what is precious, is never to forget
 the essential delight of the blood drawn from ageless springs
 breaking through rocks in worlds before our earth.
 never to deny its pleasure in the morning simple light
 nor its grave evening demand for love.
 never to allow gradually the traffic to smother
 with noise and fog, the flowering of the spirit.
  
 near the snow, near the sun, in the highest fields,
 see how these names are fted by the waving grass
 and by the streamers of white cloud
 and whispers of wind in the listening sky.
 the names of those who in their lives fought for life,
 who wore at their hearts the fire's centre.
 born of the sun, they travelled a short while toward the sun
 and left the vivid air signed with their honour.



someone spoke to me last night,
told me the truth. just a few words,
but i recognized it.
i knew i should make myself get up,
write it down, but it was late,
and i was exhausted from working
all day in the garden, moving rocks.
now, i remember only the flavor --
not like food, sweet or sharp.
more like a fine powder, like dust.
and i wasn't elated or frightened,
but simply rapt, aware.
that's how it is sometimes --
god comes to your window,
all bright light and black wings,
and you're just too tired to open it.



i am saying primroses lined the pathway of toothless hedges.

i am saying the ocean shimmered like corrugated steel in the 
morning sun.

the context of my story changes when you enter. then i am dung
on the wall of the nomad's field. then the everyday waking person.

i am nodding in your direction like fissures between dandelion fur.
seeing in your manner.

i am speaking your pace. slippage of silk slippers.

i say you are losing sight. i say your breasts are dry shells.

i am afraid of what i am capable of doing.

this is all a manner of stating how i prepare myself to be loved.


					
					her voice is a roundness. on full moon days, she talks about renouncing meat but the butcher has his routine. and blood.m's wisdom. still reliable.there are sounds we cannot hear but understand in motion. slicing of air with hips. crushing grass, saying these are my feet. i want my feet in my shadow. suffice to meet desires halfway.quiet. we say her chakras are in place.when the thermos shatters, she knows the direction of its spill. she knows how to lead and follow. know her from this.sounds we cannot hear. the wind blows and we say it is cool.night slips under the door. we are tucked into bed and kissed a fleeting one. through the curtains, her voice loosens like thread from an old blanket, row upon row. we watch her teeth in the dark and read her words. she speaks in perfect order, facing where the breeze can tug it towards canals stretching for sound.her faith abides by the cycle of the moon. see how perfect she is.


					
					late for the feast. let me guess, she said, everything workedagainst you.some pulverize experiences at the pool. when the air slaps, theyflip into the water and speak of the excitations of distress. thestratagems of delivering an annulled emotion. and how is one to read a nod? is a nod an exclamation?does one kiss after a nod?a woman mutters something about the tea being too weak.the walls threaten to expose us, shadows pinch as we mutterjouissance, jouissance, while the university teacher said the use ofthe word was a considerable error. a most lamentable error, givenhalf of us are illiterate and unattached. think of words in theirsystem of birth. now do you see, the teacher said. ah, see.dogs were barking for no reason.some of us went to the ghats and watched the dead burn. womanin white wailed, her hair a dumb struck line against her rockingspine. we look for other distractions in a place of death.in the afternoon meanings are extolled.we are asked to name our loves. i will not, he said, use commonlanguage to talk of love. i will not jump into the substancewithout reinforcement. he took his body to the breeze andswayed till we begged him to stop. the rain subsided but we werestill wet.thousands have died in a nod.
				

 

a hundred and one butter lamps are offered to my uncle who
is no more.

distraction proves fatal in death. a curtain of butter imprints
in air.

after the burning of bones, ashes are sent on pilgrimage. you are
dead, go into life, we pray. my uncle was a man given to giggles
in solemn moments.

memory springs like crocuses in bloom. self conscious and
precise.

without blurring the cornea, details are resuscitated. dried yak
meat between teeth. semblance of what is.

do not be distracted, uncle who is no more.

he does not see his reflection in the river. the arching of speech
over s as he is becoming.

curvature of spine as it cracked on a misty morning. a shadow
evades the wall.

you are no more, uncle who is no more.

every seven days he must relive his moment of expiration.
the living pray frequently amid burning juniper.

communication efforts require the right initiative.

somewhere along the line matters of motion and rest are resolved.

crows pick the last offerings. you are someone else, uncle no 
more.



although what glitters
         on the trees,
row after perfect row,
        is merely
the injustice 
        of the world,

the chips on the bark of each
        beech tree
catching the light, the sum
        of these delays
is the beautiful, the human
        beautiful,

body of flaws.
        the dead
would give anything
        i'm sure,
to step again onto
        the leafrot,

into the avenue of mottled shadows,
        the speckled
broken skins. the dead
        in their sheer
open parenthesis, what they 
        wouldn't give

for something to lean on
        that won't 
give way. i think i
        would weep
for the moral nature
        of this world,

for right and wrong like pools
        of shadow
and light you can step in
        and out of 
crossing this yellow beech forest,
        this buchen-wald,

one autumn afternoon, late
        in the twentieth
century, in hollow light,
        in gaseous light. . . .
to receive the light
        and return it

and stand in rows, anonymous,
        is a sweet secret
even the air wishes
        it could unlock.
see how it pokes at them
        in little hooks,

the blue air, the yellow trees.
        why be afraid?
they say when klimt
        died suddenly
a painting, still
        incomplete,

was found in his studio,
        a woman's body 
open at its point of 
        entry,
rendered in graphic,
        pornographic,

detail--something like
        a scream
between her legs. slowly,
        feathery,
he had begun to paint
        a delicate

garment his trademark
        over this mouth
of her body. the mouth
        of her face 
is genteel, bored, feigning a need
        for sleep. the fabric

defines the surface,
        the story,
so we are drawn to it,
        its blues
and yellows glittering
        like a stand

of beech trees late
        one afternoon
in germany, in fall.
        it is called
buchenwald, it is
        . in

the finished painting
        the argument 
has something to do
        with pleasure.



joined harmonising the best

so it needn't wait
phrase the question are you sure?
hanging three feet off the ground
silent, absolutely quiet
headquarters  we travelled north
clawing back small shelter
hung with screaming
on the same rig
blended in enthusiasm
as the race approached
through cracks in snow
free-falling into mind
alive with brightness shivering
instantly into sleep
changed, re-formed
they run, they run
with madness into chutes
of changed values
all of them conventional
vibrations of division
dare to refuse the glass
lazily through long green
discrete landing sites
to a transmitting unit
over the protective line
wave patterns in space
form black against
sifted patches of moonlight
birds move in the dark
their faint contours
singing small notes
to the rhythm of a train
so empty at this hour
silence in between
contains the words
things whiz past
once more
the sound of calculation
by indirect means
receives its full due
along the wet pavement
human flesh
fallen in all directions
to fresh eyes
something to do with the sky
senselessly dishevelled
resolves and fixes
the foundation
desirable to guard against
relative soundness of approach
including human shapes
used by the dealer
connecting them
to a sense of common
unforeseeable properties of relics
considered in place
so deceptive
their firesides play
optimism for its object
without arousing
constitutional tradition
beyond the rules of the game
hailstones imagine
moist sea air
disordered beyond it rise
drearier philosophies
to resist retrogression
faster than anything
directly stimulating receptors
attention moves
many possible representations
inside the heart
decayed into blackness
fine details of the scene
creep along for years
hard to become
immune to a predator
silhouettes of participants
dangle in their own data
faint green clouds
in almost pure alcohol
calibrate the equipment
to assume a more personal form
susceptible to psychic influences
does not contempt breed
often in disguise?
slipping past a window
on communal stairs
into faded yellow
flashed with orange
slanting through smoke
swished into a perfect dome
dissatisfied when calm returns
centered around a food animal
mastery of areas
managed to neutralise
subjects into waves
to destroy communication
 more easily on scanty pasture

the eagle has landed --apollo ii commander neil a. armstronga magnificent desolation -- air force colonel edwin e. buzz aldrin, jr.july , 
that afternoon in mid-july,
two pilgrims watched from distant space
the moon ballooning in the sky.
they rose to meet it face-to-face. 

their spidery spaceship, eagle, dropped
down gently on the lunar sand. 
and when the module's engines stopped, 
rapt silence fell across the land. 

the first man down the ladder, neil, 
spoke words that we remember now--
one small step... it made us feel
as if we were there too, somehow. 

when neil planted the flag and buzz
collected lunar rocks and dust,
they hopped like kangaroos because 
of gravity. or wanderlust?

a quarter million miles away, 
one small blue planet watched in awe. 
and no one who was there that day
will soon forget the sight they saw.


tom tigercat is noted
for his manners and his wit. 
he wouldn't think of lion,
no, he doesn't cheetah bit. 
tom never pretended 
to be something that he's not. 
i guess that's why we like him
and why he likes ocelot.


i was really in a muddle
looking over a mud puddle
'cause i didn't have a paddle
or a twig to ride the reef. 
but i said, oh, fiddle-faddle,
this is just a little piddle
of a second fiddle puddle
so i saddled up a leaf. 
i set sail on the puddle,
but i reached the muddy middle
and i rocked the leaf a little, 
then i gave it all i had. 
and i solved the mighty riddle
of the whole caboodle puddle
when i hopped up on the middle
of a beetle launching pad.


she looks for wiggly fishes,
at least so it appears,
to stuff inside the suitcase
that's swinging from her ears. 

and though she's very graceful
when flying round and round,
how does she get that faceful
of luggage off the ground? 



we dreamed of glowing children, 
their throats alive and cancerous, 
their eyes like lightning in the dark.

we were uneasy in our skins, 
sixth grade, a year for blowing up, 
for learning that nothing contains

that heat which comes from growing, 
the way our parents seemed at once 
both tall as cooling towers and crushed

beneath the pressure of small things-- 
family dinners, the evening news, 
the dead voice of the dial tone.

even the ground was ticking. 
the parts that grew grew poison. 
whatever we ate became a stone.

whatever we said was love became 
plutonium, became a spark 
of panic in the buried world.


alone in the library room, even when others
are there in the room, alone, except for themselves
there is the illusion of peace the air in the room

is stilled there are reading lights on the tables,
looking as if they're reading, looking as if 
they're studying the text, and understanding,

shedding light on what the words are saying
but under their steady imbecile gaze the page
is blank, patiently waiting not to be blank.

the page is blank until the mind that reads
crosses the black river, seeking the queen
of the underworld, persephone, where she sits

by the side of the one who brought her there from enna,
hades the mute, the deaf, king of the dead letter
she is clothed in the beautiful garment of our thousand

misunderstandings of the sacred text.


how do you know if it's love? she asks, 
and i think if you have to ask, it's not, 
but i know this won't help. i want to say 
you're too young to worry about it,
as if she has questions about medicare 
or social security, but this won't help either. 
you'll just know is a lie, and one truth, 
when you still want to be with them 
the next morning, would involve too 
many follow-up questions. the difficulty 
with love, i want to say, is sometimes 
you only know afterwards that it's arrived 
or left. love is the elephant and we 
are the blind mice unable to understand 
the whole. i want to say love is this 
desire to help even when i know i can't, 
just as i couldn't explain electricity, stars, 
the color of the sky, baldness, tornadoes, 
fingernails, coconuts, or the other things 
she has asked about over the years, all 
those phenomena whose daily existence 
seems miraculous. instead i shake my head. 
i don't even know how to match my socks. 
go ask your mother. she laughs and says, 
i did. mom told me to come and ask you.


lots of contemporaries--
but me is not my contemporary.

my birth without me
was a blemished offering on the collection plate.
a moment of flesh, imprisoned in flesh.

and when to the tip of this tongue of flesh
some word comes, it kills itself.
if saved from killing itself,
it descends to the paper, where a murder happens.

gunshot--
if it strikes me in hanoi
it strikes again in prague.

a little smoke floats up,
and my me dies like an eighth-month child.
will my me one day be my contemporary?



me--a book in the attic.
maybe some covenant or hymnal.
or a chapter from the kama sutra,
or a spell for intimate afflictions.
but then it seems i am none of these.
if i were, someone would have read me.

apparently at an assembly of revolutionaries
they passed a resolution,
and i am a longhand copy of it.
it has the police's stamp on it
and was never successfully enforced.
it is preserved only for the sake of procedure.

and now only some sparrows come,
straw in their beaks,
and sit on my body
and worry about the next generation.
how wonderful to worry about the next generation
sparrows have wings on them,
but resolutions have no wings
or resolutions have no second generation.

sometimes i think to catch the scent--
what lies in my future?
worry makes my binding come off.
whenever i try to smell,
just some fumes of bird shit.
o my earth, your future
me--your current state.



there were two kingdoms only
the first of them threw out both him and me.
the second we abandoned.

under a bare sky
i for a long time soaked in the rain of my body,
he for a long time rotted in the rain of his.

then like a poison he drank the fondness of the years.
he held my hand with a trembling hand.
come, let's have a roof over our heads awhile.
look, further on ahead, there
between truth and falsehood, a little empty space.




it must be somewhere, the original harmony,
somewhere in great nature, hidden.
is it in the furious infinite,
in distant stars' orbits,
is it in the sun's scorn,
in a tiny flower, in treegossip,
in heartmusic's mothersong
or in tears?
it must be somewhere, immortality,
somewhere the original harmony must be found
how else could it infuse 
the human soul,
that music?


a gust roused the waves,
leaves blew into the water,
the waves were ash-gray,
the sky tin-gray,
ash-gray the autumn.

it was good for my heart
there my feelings were ash-gray,
the sky tin-gray,
ash-gray the autumn. 

the breath of wind brought cooler air,
the waves of mourning brought separation
autumn and autumn
befriend each other.
 



with her hair closely cropped up to the nape
like dorian apollo's, the girl lay on the narrow
pallet, keeping her limbs stiffly frozen
within a heavy cloud she could not escape...

artemis emptied her quiver--every arrow
shot through her body. and though very soon
she'd be no virgin, like cold honeycomb,
her virgin thighs still kept her pleasure sealed...

as if to the arena, the youth came
oiled with myrrh, and like a wrestler kneeled
to pin her down and although he broke past

her arms that she had thrust against his chest, 
only much later, with one cry, face to face,
did they join lips, and out of their sweat, embrace...



a branch, the hand of apollo,the plane tree's polished, broad bough,spread above you, may it bring youthe universe's immortal peace.
you'd meet me on the broad and shining shore
            of pylos, so i'd planned,
with mentor's tall ship pulled up on the beach
            snug in the sand.

we would be bound, as those who sailed with the gods,
            in the winged friendship of youth,
and would take our seats in the stone thrones that time 
            and custom had made smooth

and meet that man who still in the third generation
            reigned serene, a sage
whose tales of travels and holy decrees had ripened
            in his mind with age--

at dawn, we'd attend the sacrifice to the gods,
            the ritual slaughters
of the three-year-old heifers, and hear the single cry
            that rose from his three daughters

when the axe thwacked, and the black-fringed, slow-rolling eye
            drowned in a swoon
of darkness, and the gilt horns were rendered idle,
            a hazy half moon.

my love imagined you, as a sister her brother,
            in your virginal bath,
how polycaste rinsed your naked body and dressed you
            in a robe of fine cloth.

i thought to prod you a little with my foot 
            as dawn was about to break
the gleaming chariot's yoked for us and ready.
            no time to lose awake

and to spend all day in the talk that comes and goes,
            or silence, when no one spoke,
while we drove the horses who were always leaning one way
            or another against the yoke,

but most of all i wanted to see your eyes,
            your deer-like eyes, behold
the palace of menelaus, and forget themselves
            in bronze and the gleam of gold,

unwavering gaze, sinking the sight so deep,
            you'd never remember
the figured silver, the ivory, gilded or white,
            the heavy amber, 

and i thought that i would say in a hushed voice
            leaning close to your ear,
watch out, my friend, because in a moment, soon,
            helen will appear

before our very eyes, the one and only
            daughter of the swan,
and then we will sink our eyelids in the river
            of oblivion.

                                             


so brightly i saw you but what grassy roads
            have led me to your tomb
and the blazing roses with which i strew your grave
            and make all rome abloom,

light the way unto your golden songs
            as though they were the brave,
armed bodies that turn to dust before one's eyes
            in an ancient, new-breached grave,

and all the worthy treasure of mycenae,
            the golden plunder
i thought to lay before you--goblet, sword,
            and diadem--past wonder,

a mask on your dead beauty like the mask
            that covered the face
of the king of the achaeans--all gold, all artifice,
            hammered upon death's trace.



look straight, and don't tremble, wreckage of my hanged race
a sarabande dancer, japanese muslin tight on her live-wire hips
arrives with the moonlight, fast as the tam-tam drums.
she'll take you to the grand esplanade where the gallows
tell your story, tell of your dim bronze halos
licked away by a pale man's greed.

leave your gallows tears behind,
the long-drawn vowels of the lost names of flowers,
the long-drawn cries of your burden of grain,
the long-drawn cries of your burden of seed-pods,
and the long-drawn cries of the seed-pods cut and hung.
shipwreck of my race, twisted in the wind-rush,
fall from your broken gallows, wrack, wreck, and driftwood, 
my bloodied race. 
my bloodied race fearful, scab-dried, sterile, paralyzed, 
the low-caste wallflowers trembling at a ball for mice--
no. leave your gallows, there, those the gallows of time-gone-by.
lift your chestnut-dark and heavy limbs, up from out the shipwreck's carnage,
and up through those long blue-green rolling waves.
sing the wind's songs, and collect what's needed, drop by shivering drop,
in this, your lenten fasting, in this, your sorcerer's midnight, under this, the whip.
leave the gallows, the sap of its cut-wood spits on your skin.
you'd hang there, yourself in effigy? no. live sap runs in the driftwood branch.
you'll play, gentle, a light wind in the shimmering green of a dancer's beaded muslin skirt,
and your broken music will move in the foolish grass that still believes in death--
leave your gallows-bones there, in the fool's green shroud . . .
scratch with the rusted nail of melody, because you live, wreckage of my race,
the sky will not forget you, nor the graveyard's earth, fertile and walled.
your blood still dances, a wreckage of joy, joy soured,
obstinate joy, wild and unbroken,
shipwreck of my race, sarabande.



handsome, like those foam-topped tidal waves breaking high, in little crystal globes.
handsome, like the breeze that lifts a little tuft of tulle. if tulle were life.
handsome, like a frozen face, tear-tracked, when the sun hammers down.
handsome. like fire.
handsome, like the bottomless sky, with that one proud penetrating star.

but handsome, too, like a sky that's an arching ocean, and an earth prone as an ocean's floor.
handsome ocean-sky, and earth-sea floor.
            the big question is where's the man in a scene like this?

handsome the man asleep. and the night sky swarms, tropic and wide.
handsome, in some ornamental, muggy midnight caught between cat's paws. sharp-nailed 
            they prick.
handsome the firefly swarms around you.
handsome, like a soap bubble grazing a little black dress. like a soap-bubble pricked with a pin.
handsomeness a rainbow, a rainbow an arrow, an arrow in my chest.
handsome, like shadows slow-rolling on a japanese screen. 
handsome motion.
handsome as life and poison.
sun-blood handsome. bleeding sun.

translated from the french by robert archambeau



around the bend of a phrase 
you return, it's dawn in a book, it's
a garden, one can
see everything, the dew, a moth
on a leaf and it's you
who rises suddenly amid the pages
and the book grows more lovely
because it's you
and you've not grown old, you walk
slowly to the door.



					
					someone, and no matter who, inhabits my head like it's an empty house, he enters, he leaves, he bangs each door behind him, powerless i put up with this ruckus. someone, and maybe it's me, palms my most private thoughts, he crumples them, returns them to dust. someone, and it's much later now, slowly walks across the room and, not seeing me, stops to contemplate the havoc. someone, and no matter where, collects the pieces of my shadow. 


ice glitters like it's good.
the whole world glitters,
sped towards ends,
we all fall in.

under the ice is water.
but under the world, between you
and the everything
of your vanishing . . .


                               


fire, air, water, and earth
still turning, spilling into each other.
he tuned the world tense,
made the elements restless

so any happiness we might contrive
of fire, or air, or water, or earth
cannot rest, has to reach higher
than earth, water, air, or fire.


                               


it's all echo--whatever world
keeps calling to you 
in the woods, in a rock, a deep wave--
just a lie that vanishes

as soon as it tricks you inside. 
shut up, go away, say to the world. 
and it does--into the woods, a rock, 
deep waves that keep calling you.


                               


when the sky's dark face
catches your eye again,
let memory write
of a darkness beyond this

days self-blinded, nights 
of searching untaught,
thinking your own thought,
light.


                               


wanting what you fear,
fearing your own desire
icicles at the heart
form to burn apart.

when, in this cycle
of suffering he sings,
does the martyr begin
to suspect himself?




it's as if she were an earn,
                                                                   gebidende prey for her eyrie.

suddenly she sees
                                                                   a fox on the westene.

we wither, unlike stars    die, unlike hills and cisterns.

ana shadowed my protector,    esteemed arbad, who's left us.

but ana do not grieve    all sparrows exit the feast hall.

novelties don't excite me,    nor wyrdstaef affright me.

men are like encampments    that soon become ruins.

they come with their kin,    leave only land behind when
        they go--

the last herdsman    rounding up the stragglers.

man's a shooting star    light turned to ash.

wealth and kin a stain    that soon wears away.

the work we do    inevitably gehrorene.

the wise grasp this    the foolish fight it and lose.

if my wyrd holds off a while,    my fingers reach out for its stick.

ana can tell you stories,    bent over the more ana try to straighten.

ana am like a battered sword    that hasn't gotten any less sharp.

don't leave me    the sparrow finds the exit suddenly--.

o you reproachful wifcynn    when the men go off

can your witchcraft tell us    who'll return?

do you faint    because they flet ofgefon?

you make everyone weep    for the burston bodies

of the irreplaceable friends    of your own youth.

but neither the witches    nor the necromancers know 

what the aelmihtig intends.    just ask them

hwr cm the men?    hwr cm our protectors?

they don't even know    when the rain storm will come



a blind man was riding an unheated train,
from bryansk he was traveling home with his fate.

fate whispered to him so the whole car could hear
and why should you care about blindness and war?

it's good, she was saying, you're sightless and poor.
if you were not blind, you'd never survive. 

the germans won't kill you, you're nothing to them.
allow me to lift that bag on your shoulder--

the one with the holes, the empty torn one.
let me just raise your eyelids wide open.

the blind man was traveling home with his fate,
now thankful for blindness. happy about it.



my poems fledglings, heirs, 
plaintiffs and executors,
the silent ones, the loud,
the humble and the proud.

as soon as the shovel of time
threw me onto the potter's wheel--
myself without kith or kin--
i grew beneath the hand, a miracle.

something stretched out my long neck
and hollowed round my soul
and marked on my back 
legends of flowers and leaves.

i stoked the birch in the fire
as daniel commanded
and blessed my red temper
until i spoke as a prophet.

i had long been the earth--
arid, ochre, forlorn since birth--
but you fell on my chest by chance
from beaks of birds, from eyes of grass.



					
					children grow in secret. they hide themselves in the depths and darker reaches of the house to become wild cats, white birches. one day when you're only half-watching the herd as it straggles back in with the afternoon dust, one child, the prettiest of them all, comes close and rises up on tiptoe to whisper i love you, i'll be waiting for you in the hay.shaking some, you go to find your shotgun you spend what's left of the day firing at rooks and jackdaws, uncountable at this hour, and crows.


					
					wherever the earth is crag and scrub, the goats are there--the black ones, girlishly skipping, leaping their little leaps from rock to rock. i've loved their nerve and frisk since i was small. once my grandfather gave me one of my own. he showed me how i could serve myself when i got hungry, from the full-feeling bags there like warmish wineskins, where i'd let my hands linger some before bringing my mouth close, so the milk wouldn't go to waste on my face, my neck, even my naked chest, which did happen sometimes, who knows if on purpose, my mind dwelling all the while on the savory-smelling vulvazinha. i called her maltesa she was my horse i could almost say she was my first woman.


you who please      your keenness with poems,
read closely here      can you discover 
this verse's framer?       finishes.
nobles enjoy it on earth,      but not without end, 
worldly ones.       must fail  
 in our strongholds      once our bodies scatter
their loaned treasure,      like  trickling through fingers.
then  and ear      require  skill 
in night's narrow cell       drives your craft, 
a kingly servitude.      now can you see
who shrewd words have      shown to men?
             remember my name,      o you who admire
the sound of this song      help succor me
and pray for my comfort.      soon i must pass 
alone, away      to look for a dwelling,
must travel so far      no telling where
beyond this world      to a yet-unknown
place in the earth.      so must each person,
unless he is granted      god-sent grace.
            let us call to god      again, more eager,
begging his blessing      in this bright creation
may we be welcomed      to his warm halls,
his home on high.      there is holiest happiness, 
there the king of angels      crowns the pure 
with a perishless prize.      now his praise endures 
masterful and marvelous,      and his might extends
endless and ageless      over all creation.      finit.




for my little ballads,
those strange, sunset-red laments,
spring paid me a gull's egg.

i bade my lover paint my portrait
                                            on its thick shell.
he painted a new bulb in brown soil--
on the other side, a powdery mound of sand.



the red sun rises
without intent
and shines the same on all of us.
we play like children under the sun.
one day, our ashes will scatter--
                                           it doesn't matter when.
now the sun finds our innermost hearts,
                                           fills us with oblivion
intense as the forest, winter and sea.



i spoke in a hurry, in a nervous hush,
because the time was short--
the lightning was shuddering,
slowing down, running.

or was that my blood,
the quiet diminishing of daily life?
it's time for me to go forth
into your tiny mustard seed.

in the house of my father, everything is fading,
in the house of the father, all the angels are crying,
because the anguish of a jaded, exhausted horse
sometimes finds its way even unto them.

one gray day, i was alive on this earth,
and amid the mist of day--in triumph--
the spirit may approach and look
so that you will see him, without seeing.

and, so, celebrate the meager light,
curse not the twilight.
if christ is to visit us
it will be on such pitiful days as these.

i was thinking god has abandoned me,
so, what of it--he is a priceless ray of light,
or a thin needle in the haystack of man. and cruel.
i have turned away from him--torment me no more.
but which of us is more cruel? more to be feared?
the one who has no body, of course.
he has made us endless, vast--
so that our grief will know no bounds.


providence, 




					
					september is a month like any other and unlike any other. it seems in september everything awaited will arrive in the calm air, in a particular scent, in the stillness of the quay. when september comes, i know i'm going to lose myself. the ants climbing my legs and a certain change of light tell me so. the air comes and goes beneath my dress, pressing the warm cloth against me, pressing me with the desire to find myself in the sea, that sea beaten deep gray and magnetized by neutrinos, thanks to which i can perform my observations and telekinetic communications. the salty, sticky wall of the malecn is covered with fish and forgotten hooks. i like to lick its sheen of salt and make my tongue salty and sticky. in that moment the rest of the city can vanish, it's just that sea and me, before all thought, all desire. then i undress and enter, knowing i'll find something, and that the boats--which seem suspended on the horizon, seem to have slipped their limits, motionless and painted there--are also mine...when i met you and you met me it was still september and we were strange and different and would be for a long time after--though i sometimes snagged you with certain secret hooks, shaping a sort of formless impression something strange and indefinable divided the outline of your body from the space around you, but without making a human form, and in your eyes the sunlight revolved like a bicycle's spoked wheel...the bicycle moves on and i'm carried along, filled with dry branches and coral. in my hair i wear the butterflies we collected together. the little house, one point amid the infinite, comes into view already we can see the windows, like little black voids, and their curtains beating in the wind. i squeeze your waist, the bicycle moves on even though the street is narrow the bicycle rolls on, rolls on against the spray. when you turn your head and see my hand, my hook snagged in a struggle of desire, the sun has turned immense in your eyes again. you make for the little house already in view, already at the edge of the curve...a naked man in lamplight is a magnificent animal his pointy shoulders jut out and cut off the light. a line of fuzz descends from his navel to where the darkness begins, where the skin tightens like the skin of a fig. his body--your body--is an arc i want to tighten, to overcome, to conquer. hidden behind a tree, i can see your eyes again. the mississippi is a big river with many tributaries. the arc tightens and closes. i throw an arm over you, a leg, a hand, a lip, hallucinations, an ear--as usual. my body moves on. the mississippi is a big river with many tributaries. its water burns in my thighs, in the course of my dreams the mississippi is a deep and torrential river situated in the united states, it is born in lake itasca, passes through st. paul, st. louis, memphis, new orleans, traverses , kilometers and slides and slides through a wide delta to the gulf of mexico. i'm in geography class. i like this class. the world just barely fits in my head. the map hangs before me with its spokes and points. someone made that all up, just to make me think i belong to one of those zones out there. all those castles and fortifications to toy with, the beginnings of everything that seems to be reality, but isn't, because we're not outside but inside the globe, that huge globe so stubborn in its sufficiency, and even far from the classroom nothing's different there's just the idea of that transparent globe that is my image of the world, always turning, imperfect and constant inside me. i like the maps and the instability of the geography that situates places in my head. i like using graph paper to plot the latitudes and longitudes i can't measure. i also like the geography professor, whose eyes i must constantly avoid in order not to drown myself. he doesn't know, he can't imagine, that while he lectures, while he looks at me, i draw fish in my notebook to throw in his river. the boy behind me won't stop looking at me, and whatever one does the others all follow, watching from the corners of their eyes. that's why i'm going to fold the page away from his gaze and make a true map where he won't find me, alone at my desk in the middle of the world...in the middle of the lake there's a boat and we're three--although the third may have already vanished for us--and i want to paddle and sit in the center. you've taken off your shirt the landscape appears and disappears. when i take the oars you want to teach me how to row over the edge. you try to teach me you take my hands--you're behind and above me. my fingers are lost in the middle of the boat. i'm wearing faded jeans and carrying a purple parasol. the oar descends toward the deep and tangles with seaweed. my hair hangs surly and limp on my wet shoulders. we try to steer but go nowhere. you explain the roundness of the earth the sharpened tip of the compass needle, always precise, marking contours, lines, limits. the shadow and truth of your body in the landscape appearances and disappearances when you try to comprehend the possible across great distances, the symmetry, forgetfulness, incarnation in other beings animals, plants, and later, men once again. you taught me all this, but i'm not a map and i hold still. i abandon my shoes and my dread of nearing the end the oar descends toward the deep, it is september. we don't move. i keep still to be different, that's why...


					
					we went into a market--they call it a grocery--and you can't imagine. fruit brilliant as magazine photos. all kinds of different oranges, grapefruits, mandarins, some tiny clementines with a blue sticker--morocco--they've come so far...the eggs are painted with colors corresponding to the days of the week you're supposed to eat them a different color for each opportunity. i felt dizzy, the gulf between myself and this place seemed insuperable. tears welled up in my eyes, i wanted desperately to flee, to get outside so i could breathe. i wanted to explain to phillis, the north american who had invited me, what was happening to me. i tried, but she couldn't understand you have to have felt it yourself the first time. for the first time my mind had crossed over five hundred years of development at jet speed and arrived in the future, a cold future, its display cases filled with artificial snow and artificial heat. there were a thousand things i never knew existed, a panoply of brand names and gadgets for every purpose. i felt like someone from the stone age, and realized most people on the planet never know the era they're living in, any more than they could know the quantity of living matter in this galaxy that surrounds us, or the milky complexity of the molecules in their own brains, and what's more they don't know that they'll die without ever knowing. i felt terror of that gloss, of the waxed fruit, of propaganda so refined it could dilute the existence of the strange things before my eyes, other sensations everything wanting to be used up, immediately, licked, tasted, eaten, packaged, mastered. i knew i couldn't stand this avalanche, this brilliant swarm, for long, these rows on rows of distant faces staring out at me from cardboard boxes. i'd seen nothing singular in the place, no unique thing i could separate out from the amorphous mass of texture and sensation. i began to move closer, imagining i walked with those who have never eaten meat or tasted cow's milk, who have never nursed except from the teat of a goat. those who have had only wildflowers to chew when the winter hunger comes. i approached closer still, imagining i walked with the salty ones, who collect their water from the public pipe. my nose began to bleed and phillis said it was the cold i knew that wasn't the problem. we were near the seafood display, i moved closer. fish have always aroused in me both horror and desire. i moved closer, like a lost child feeling her way through space toward something of hers that's hidden. i brushed the shells with my fingertips, they were smooth and delicate, but obviously artificial, made to be used once and thrown away. at first touch they might seem real, pearly, perfect, but they're actually plastic, and they've never even seen any sea.



                                     

under the long green hair of pepper trees,
the writers and composers work the street.
bach's new score is crumpled in his pocket,
dante sways his ass-cheeks to the beat.

                                     

the city is named for the angels,
and its angels are easy to find.
they give off a lubricant odor,
their eyes are mascara-lined
at night you can see them inserting
gold-plated diaphragms
for breakfast they gather at poolside
where screenwriters feed and swim.

                                     

every day, i go to earn my bread
in the exchange where lies are marketed,
hoping my own lies will attract a bid.

                                     

it's hell, it's heaven the amount you earn
determines if you play the harp or burn.

                                     

gold in their mountains,
oil on their coast
dreaming in celluloid
profits them most.



no need to drive a nail into the wall
to hang your hat on
when you come in, just drop it on the chair
no guest has sat on.

don't worry about watering the flowers--
in fact, don't plant them.
you will have gone back home before they bloom, 
and who will want them?

if mastering the language is too hard,
only be patient
the telegram imploring your return
won't need translation.

remember, when the ceiling sheds itself
in flakes of plaster,
the wall that keeps you out is crumbling too, 
as fast or faster.


translated from the german by adam kirsch


maybe my soul is straight and good,
but she's got to lug my heart, my blood,
which all hurts because it's crooked
its weight sends her staggering.
she has no bed, she has no home,
she merely hangs on my sharp bones,
flapping her terrible wings.

and my hands are completely shot, 
shriveled, worn here, take a look
at how they clammily, clumsily hop
like rain-crazed toads.
as for all the other stuff,
it's all used up and sad and old--
why doesn't god haul me out to the muck
and let me drop.

is it because of my mug
with its frowning mouth?
so often i would itch
to be luminous and free of fog 
but nothing would approach
except big dogs.
and the dogs got zilch.



for mary peace
then i led her to the river
certain she was still a virgin
though she had a husband.
the fourth friday in july,
as good as on a promise.
the street lights were vanishing
and the crickets flaring up.
last bend out of town
i brushed her sleepy breasts.
they blossomed of a sudden
like the tips of hyacinths
and the starch of her petticoat
bustled in my ear like silk
slit by a dozen blades.
the pines, minus their halo 
of silver, grew huger
and the horizon of dogs
howled a long way from the river.

past the blackberry bushes,
the rushes and whitethorn,
beneath her thatch of hair,
i made a dip in the sand.
i took off my neckerchief.
she unstrapped her dress.
me my gun and holster,
she her layers of slips...
not tuberose, not shell, 
has skin as half as smooth
nor does mirror glass
have half the shimmer.
her hips flitted from me
like a pair of startled tench
the one full of fire,
the other full of cold.
that night i might
as well have ridden
the pick of the roads
on a mother-of-pearl mare
without bridle or stirrups.
gentleman that i am,
i won't say back the scraps
she whispered to me.
it dawned out there 
to leave my lip bitten.
filthy with soil and kisses,
i led her from the river
and the spears of lilies
battled in the air.

i behaved only the way
a blackguard like me behaves.
i offered her a big creel
of hay-colored satins.
i had no wish to fall for her.
she has a husband after all,
though she was still a virgin
when i led her to the river.



what a thing it would be, if we all could fly.
but to rise on air does not make you a bird.

i'm sick of the hiss of champagne bubbles.
it's spring, and everyone's got something to puke.

the things we puke flights of stairs,
a skyscraper soaring from the gut,

the bills blow by on the april breeze
followed by flurries of razor blades in may.

it's true, a free life is made of words.
you can crumple it, toss it in the trash,

or fold it between the bodies of angels, attaining
a permanent address in the sky.

the postman hands you your flight of birds
persisting in the original shape of wind.

whether they're winging toward the scissors' v
or printed and plastered on every wall

or bound and trussed, bamboo frames wound with wire
or sentenced to death by fire

you are, first
and always, ash.

broken wire, a hurricane at each end.
fire trucks scream across the earth.

but this blaze is a thing of the air.
raise your glass higher, toss it up and away.

few know this kind of dizzy glee
an empty sky, a pair of burning wings.



where the immemorial and the instant meet, opening and distance appear.
through the opening a door, crack of light.
behind the door, a kitchen.

where the knife rises and falls, clouds gather, disperse.
a lightspeed joining of life and death, cut 
in two halves of a sun, of slowness.

halves of a turnip.
a mother in the kitchen, a lifetime of cuts.
a cabbage cut into mountains and rivers,
a fish, cut along its leaping curves,
laid on the table
still yearning for the pond.

summer's tofu
cut into premonitions of snow. 
a potato listens to the onion-counterpoint 
of the knife, dropping petals at its strokes
self and thing, halves of nothing
at the center of time.
where gone and here meet, the knife rises, falls.

but this mother is not holding a knife.

what she has been given is not a knife
but a few fallen leaves. 
the fish leaps over the blade from the sea
to the stars. the table is in the sky now, 
the market has been crammed into the refrigerator,
and she cannot open cold time.
 



i turn around.
          i feel monday's well-shaven face lightly
          caress my left shoulder

          most cherished part 
          most crucial here and now 



we met in a coastal village
spent a lovely night without leaving an address 
going separate ways. three years later
we meet again by coincidence.
the whole
three years spun a novel
we abandoned
they fail to recognize themselves
as though meeting in another story 
for an encounter.
one asks who are you, so cold and weary
the other says i only know a thread is loose on my sweater
            the more you pull it, the more it lengthens
            until i completely vanish.



from daddy sprung my inborn ribaldry.
his crudeness destined me to be the same.
a seedlet, flowered from a shitty heap, 
i came, the crowning glory of his aim.

from mother i inherited ennui, 
the leg irons of the queendom i once rattled.
but i won't let such chains imprison me. 
and there is just no telling what this brat'll...

this marriage thing? we snub our nose at it.
what's pearl turns piss, what's classy breeds what's smutty.
but like it? lump it? neither's exigent.
and i'm the end result of all that fucking.

do what you will this world's your oyster, pet.
but be forewarned. the sea might drown you yet. 



every day a wilderness--no   
shade in sight. beulah 
patient among knicknacks,   
the solarium a rage 
of light, a grainstorm 
as her gray cloth brings 
dark wood to life. 

under her hand scrolls 
and crests gleam 
darker still. what 
was his name, that 
silly boy at the fair with 
the rifle booth? and his kiss and   
the clear bowl with one bright   
fish, rippling 
wound 

not michael-- 
something finer. each dust   
stroke a deep breath and   
the canary in bloom. 
wavery memory home   
from a dance, the front door   
blown open and the parlor   
in snow, she rushed 
the bowl to the stove, watched   
as the locket of ice 
dissolved and he 
swam free. 

that was years before 
father gave her up 
with her name, years before   
her name grew to mean   
promise, then   
desert-in-peace. 
long before the shadow and   
sun's accomplice, the tree. 

maurice.


eastham, massachusetts 
one of the spectators is disappointed
 there isn't a guide to explain
 the beaching, the scientists busy
 cutting into ninety-four pilot whales
 stranded on the salt grass.
 no one knows why and, try as the rescue team
 might, not one whale will go back to water.
 so they're injected to speed up the dying,
  
 lined up like lumber and sawed into,
 except when the black skin splits
 we can't stop staring, their meat is so read.
 i don't want to know why this happens--
 what parasite or geomagnetic anomaly
 finished their love of motion. why should
 anything have to leave this world
 when water can cycle from atmosphere
 down to land, the ocean and back
 to forgiving sky.
  
                                       i'm on my way to connecticut
 where my father has a little vegetation
 on his heart valve--that's how the intern
 describes it, trying to minimize
 the danger of him slipping
 into a haze so cold, some nights,
 bone-cold, his hand can't get from
 his plate to his mouth.
  
                                                   rain slicks the highway
 slowing me down. the same water
 fattened into snow in the woods
 of my childhood, the whiteness
 unbroken except where my father
 cut trails and taught me to ski,
 laying down the herringbone behind him
 as he broke up hills that left me
 with legs made of slush. he wanted me strong,
 no patience for pain. no choice
 but to find the muscle to follow. even now
 when he boasts how i zigzagged
 the breakneck hills in an icestorm,
 there's no hint of my knee-chattering fear,
 slats skittering out of control,
 each run a victory of luck more than will,
 each ride up the lift a prayer for my bones.
 i wonder how it is for him now
 there in the ward where whiteness can't hide
 the cold blank that's ahead. when the whales
 beached, spectators came like pilgrims,
 each new arrival scanning the faces
 of those heading back to their cars
 to see how it changed them
 to survey so much death. nothing showed.
 their eyes followed the asphalt,
 heads bent in private devotion.
  
                                                     there in a room
 where others have died, my father
 keeps a record of each test and drug.
 he watches medicine drip into his arm
 and circle in the dark of his blood.
 i believe it will heal him, as i believe
 in the strength of my blood
 to protect me from failures of will. once
 when my grandmother at ninety-six
 lay delirious with pneumonia,
 pitching on her high horsehair bed,
 she saw three crows perched on the dresser.
  
               they smell so awful, she said.
 please, open the window. let them out.
 it was my father who did what she asked.
 and the crows flew out, carrying her fever
 over the treeline, dissolving into sky,
 and she lived. whatever she saw,
 by love, luck or dumb yankee will,
 it was true. that's what i mean by medicine. 


pomegranates fell from the trees
 in our sleep. if we stayed
 in the sun too long
 there were aloes
 to cool the burn.
 henbane for predators
 and succulents when the rain was scarce.
  
 there was no glorified past
 to point the way
 true and natural
 for the sexes to meet.
 he kept looking to the heavens
 as if the answer were anywhere
 but here. i was so bored
 with our goodness
 i couldn't suck the juice
 from one more pear.
  
 it's here, i kept telling him,
 here, rooted in the soil
 like every other tree
 you know. and i wove us
 a bed of its uppermost branches.


me trying to understand say whence
 say whither, say what, say me with a pencil walking,
 say reading the dictionary, say learning medieval
 latin, reading spengler, reading whitehead,
 william james i loved him, swimming breaststroke
 and thinking for an hour, how did i get here?
 or thinking in line, say the  streetcar
 or  or  swissvale,
 that would take me elsewhere, me with a textbook
 reading the pre-socratics, so badly written,
 whoever the author was, me on the floor of
 the lighted stacks sitting cross-legged,
 walking afterwards through the park or sometimes
 running across the bridges and up the hills,
 sitting down in our tiny diningroom,
 burning in a certain way, still burning.



he'll have been the last of his kind here then.
 the flagstones, dry-stone walls, the slumping thatch,
 out-offices and cow cabins, the patch
 of haggard he sowed spuds and onions in--
 all of it a century out of fashion--
 all giving way to the quiet rising damp
 of hush and vacancy once he is gone.
 those long contemplations at the fire, cats
 curling at the door, the dog's lame waltzing,
 the kettle, the candle and the lamp--
 all still, all quenched, all darkened--
 the votives and rosaries and novenas,
 the pope and kennedy and sacred heart,
 the bucket, the basket, the latch and lock,
 the tractor that took him into town and back
 for the pension cheque and messages and pub,
 the chair, the bedstead and the chamber pot,
 everything will amount to nothing much.
 everything will slowly disappear.
 and some grandniece, a sister's daughter's daughter,
 one blue august in ten or fifteen years
 will marry well and will inherit it
 the cottage ruins, the brown abandoned land.
 they'll come to see it in a hired car.
 the kindly liverpudlian she's wed,
 in concert with a local auctioneer,
 will post a sign to offer site for sale.
 the acres that he labored in will merge
 with a neighbor's growing pasturage
 and all the decades of him will begin to blur,
 easing, as the far fields of his holding did,
 up the hill, over the cliff, into the sea.


afterward, the compromise.
 bodies resume their boundaries.
  
 these legs, for instance, mine.
 your arms take you back in.
  
 spoons of our fingers, lips
 admit their ownership.
  
 the bedding yawns, a door
 blows aimlessly ajar
  
 and overhead, a plane
 singsongs coming down.
  
 nothing is changed, except
 there was a moment when
  
 the wolf, the mongering wolf
 who stands outside the self
  
 lay lightly down, and slept.


we were dancing--it must have 
 been a foxtrot or a waltz,
 something romantic but
 requiring restraint,
 rise and fall, precise
 execution as we moved 
 into the next song without
 stopping, two chests heaving
 above a seven-league
 stride--such perfect agony,
 one learns to smile through,
 ecstatic mimicry
 being the sine qua non
 of american smooth.
 and because i was distracted
 by the effort of 
 keeping my frame
 the leftward lean, head turned
 just enough to gaze out
 past your ear and always
 smiling, smiling,
 i didn't notice
 how still you'd become until
 we had done it
 for two measures?
 four?--achieved flight,
 that swift and serene
 magnificence,
 before the earth
 remembered who we were
 and brought us down.

 black swollen fruit dangling on a limb
 red forgotten flesh sprayed across the prairie
 parched brown vines creeping over the wall
 yellow winged pollen, invisible enemies
  
 boluses without homesteads, grubs without a voice
 burrowed deeply into this land's dark, dark heart
 someday, our pods and pupae shall turn in the earth
 and burgeon into our motherlode's bold beauty

 we're a seed on the manure, on the sole of your shoe
 we're the louse trapped in your hank of golden hair
 we're the sliver that haunts beneath your thumbnail

 we're the package wrapped, return address unknown
 we're the arm lowered again, again, a bloodied reverie
 we've arrived shoeless, crutchless, tousle-haired, swollen-bellied
 we shall inherit this earth's meek glory, as foretold

 they gave you a title, but you were too proud to wear it
 they gave you the paterland, but you were too lazy to farm it
  
 your condo is leaking, but you're too angry to repair it
 your dress has moth holes, but you're too sentimental to toss it
  
 you're too bored to play the lute, it hangs on the wall like an ornament
 the piano bites you, it's an eight-legged unfaithful dog
  
 love grows in the garden, but you're too impudent to tend it
 a nice hakka boy from ogden, so hardworking, so kind

 the same lipstick red and it comes off on your coffeecup
 the same stars come around and around and around
 the same sun tarries in the late noon sky
 the same word for mom ah ma, madre, mere, majka
 the same birthbabe bald, purplish, you slap to make cry
 the same stench mother's milk, shit and vomit
 the same argument between a man and a woman
 the same dog, hit by a car, the same escaped canary
 the same turkey for thanksgiving, christmas and the new year

 the same soup chicken, though the veggies may vary
 the same rice for supper white, brown or wild
 the same stars come around and around and around
 the same sun dips her head into the ocean
 the same tree in the same poem by the same poet
 the same old husband saggy breasts, baggy thighs
 the same blackness whether we sleep or die

i want to write a love poem for the girls i kissed in seventh grade,
 a song for what we did on the floor in the basement
  
 of somebody's parents' house, a hymn for what we didn't say but thought
 that feels good or i like that, when we learned how to open each other's mouths
  
 how to move our tongues to make somebody moan. we called it practicing, and
 one was the boy, and we paired off--maybe six or eight girls--and turned out
  
 the lights and kissed and kissed until we were stoned on kisses, and lifted our
 nightgowns or let the straps drop, and, now you be the boy
  
 concrete floor, sleeping bag or couch, playroom, game room, train room, laundry.
 linda's basement was like a boat with booths and portholes
  
 instead of windows. gloria's father had a bar downstairs with stools that spun,
 plush carpeting. we kissed each other's throats.
  
 we sucked each other's breasts, and we left marks, and never spoke of it upstairs
 outdoors, in daylight, not once. we did it, and it was
  
 practicing, and slept, sprawled so our legs still locked or crossed, a hand still lost
 in someone's hair . . . and we grew up and hardly mentioned who
  
 the first kiss really was--a girl like us, still sticky with moisturizer we'd 
 shared in the bathroom. i want to write a song
  
 for that thick silence in the dark, and the first pure thrill of unreluctant desire,
 just before we'd made ourselves stop.

                              washed.
  
 when washing was--when clean could not be.
 to wrap the body in cotton.              what imprisons.
  
                              when carrying humped--
  
 and these bald knuckles from her.
 the lips tight. damp.              this desire.
  
 beyond that.              a tiny voice.
  
 the foreign woman
 who bends over--is spotted.
 her wind is taken.
  
  
                                                                      
  
 a closed back.           turned in.           centered.            a world shut out.
 the infinite lines welt.          her voice is open.          transparent.
 dissolved.            a tunnel protector.           a subtle skin.          olivia.
  
 hold these shoes to the sun. they are just shoes.
 what the girl has not. how secret the burden. carrying nothing.
 and common.            breathe.
  
 this moment open.            she wrenches.             falls into--
 this small casing inflamed.             she scrubs.             and is common.
  
  
                                                                       
  
 what did negro replace?
                       claiming what could have been
                       their strange feet making a way.
  
 and what metaphor?
 what could call the horrors?
  
 pressing hands we cannot decipher.
 an arched woman hunches in.
 presence.           birth.              our bracelet.
  
 who navigated wooden ships?
                         this hardened ankle sucks black earth.
                         her slight life.
  
 help us poison position.
 and olivia, the mouth of his children
 from the mouth of my vagina.
 and olivia, what no memory can recall
 lost eternally inside covered wagons.
  
  
                                                                        
  
 walk eternities. feet thick as throats.
 what will become a life.
  
 when do voices gain earth?
 the finest grain solved between the thumb and forefinger.
 reads like the slightest movement of a hip.
  
 and nothing is left but time.             and god.              and the dense night.
 against skins.
  
 what is simple
 is nothing.
  
 imagine history.
 an entire race
 looks into 
 the slit camera eye.
  
  
                                                                      
  
 speak of going back,
 of gathering the horses,
 the prized memoirs
 that have nothing to do with place.
 and pack like a boy
 who leaves his slivered home.
  
 about land.
  
 what is familiar
 is the warm spice
 of a girl oiled
 in lavender.
  
 into oceans.
  
 lie and almost remember--
 almost breathe soiled air and ire.
  
 count foreign.
 make sense
 of the sounded boots
 that exhaled fate.
  
  
                                                                         
  
 the footsteps are wet. desire is wet.
 is going step by step--
 the ash trail is wicked. the thicket wept.
  
 must be quieted--the vast space between the--there.
 these tittied deities--our orishas--
 how they seized what they did not know.
  
 every element is bare. like ruptured mouths--
 who could not say--who uttered--who died not pronouncing.

                                             i am in this fist.
                                             i am a witness in exile.

needed          explanation
  
 because of the mystic nature        of the theory
  
 and our reliance          on collective belief
  
 i could not visualize the end
  
 the tools that paved the way broke
  
 the body the foundation the exact copy of the real
  
 our surfaces were covered
  
 our surfaces are all covered
  
 actual hands appear but then there is writing
  
 in the cave       we were deeply impressed
  
 as in addicted to results
  
 oh and dedication training     the idea of loss of life
  
 in our work we call this emotion
  
 how a poem enters into the world
  
 there is nothing wrong with the instrument
  
 as here i would raise my voice but
  
 the human being and the world cannot be equated
  
 aside from the question of whether or not we are alone
  
 and other approaches to nothingness
  
 the term subjectthe term only
  
 also opinion and annihilation
  
 the body's minutest sensation of time
  
 the world, it is true, has not yet been destroyed
  
 intensification      void
  
 we are amazed
  
 uselessness is the last form love takes
  
 so liquid till the forgone conclusion
  
 here we are, the forgone conclusion
  
 so many messages transmitted they will never acquire meaning
  
 do you remember          my love my archive
  
 touch me here
  
 give birth to       a single idea
  
 touch where it does not lead to war
  
 show me    exact spot

 nerves wearing only moonlight lie down
  
 lie still patrol yr cage

look she said this is not the distance
 we wanted to stay at--we wanted to get
 close, very close. but what
 is the way in again? and is it
  
 too late? she could hear the actions
 rushing past--but they are on
 another track. and in the silence,
 or whatever it is that follows,
  
 there was still the buzzing motes, spores,
 aftereffects and whatnot recalled the morning after.
 then the thickness you can't get past called waiting.
  
 then the you, whoever you are, peering down to see if it's
                                                                       done yet.
 then just the look on things being looked-at.
 then just the look of things being seen.


i dig my hands into the absolute. the surface

 into shingled, grassed clusters lifts.
 if i press, pick-in with fingers, pluck,
 i can unfold the loam. it is tender. it is a tender
 maneuver, hands making and unmaking promises.

 bacteria, milky roots, pilgrimages of spores, deranged

 slogged and clutched-firm with decisions, overridings,

 on them alone in the small wood.
 white hands in the black-green glade,
 opening the muddy cartoon of the present, taking the tiny roots
                                                                                         of the moss
 apart, hired hands, curiosity's small army, so white
                                                         in these greens--
 make your revolution in the invisible temple,
 make your temple in the invisible
 revolution--i can't see the errands you run, hands gleaming
                                                             for this instant longer
 like tinfoil at the bottom here of the tall
                                       whispering oaks . . .
 listen, boccioni the futurist says a galloping horse

 legs it has twenty--and at c there is no sequence
 because there is no time--and since
 at lightspeed, etc. everything is simultaneous my hands
 serrated with desires, shoved into these excavated

 --mauve, maroons, gutters of flecking golds--
 my hands are living in myriad manifestations
                                                        of light. . . .
 all forms of imitation are to be despised.
 all subjects previously used must be discarded.
 at last we shall rush rapidly past objectiveness . . .
 oh enslavement, will you take these hands
                                        and hold them in
 for a time longer? tops of the oaks, do you see my tiny
                                                                       golden hands
 pushed, up to the wrists,
 into the present? star i can't see in daylight, young, light
                                                                      and airy star--
 i put the seed in. the beam moves on.


i was climbing up the sliding board
when suddenly i felt
a mosquito bite my bottom
and it raised a big red welt. 

so i said to that mosquito,
i'm sure you wouldn't mind
if i took a pair of tweezers
and i tweezered your behind

he shriveled up his body
and he shuffled to his feet,
and he said, i'm awfully sorry
but a skeeter's got to eat
still, there are mosquito manners,
and i must have just forgot 'em.
and i swear i'll never never never
bite another bottom.

but a minute later archie hill
and buck and theo brown
were horsing on the monkey bars,
hanging upside down. 
they must have looked delicious
from a skeeter's point of view
'cause he bit 'em on the bottoms,
archie, buck and theo too

you could hear 'em goin' holy
you could hear 'em goin' whack
you could hear 'em cuss and holler,
goin' smack, smack, smack.

a mosquito's awful sneaky,
a mosquito's mighty sly,
but i never never never
thought a skeeter'd tell a lie.

it was such a lovely day
till i stumbled in the way
of a van that carries vinegar to stores. 
when i glared up at the man--
operator of the van--
he said, vinegar, it never rains but pours

now a skunk was standing by. 
and i thought that i would cry
from the vinegar that sprayed and soaked my clothes,
when the driver kindly yells,
watch that animal. it smells--
and the skunk ran off, a hankie to her nose.


toad gots measles
frog gots mumps
both gots such
disgusting bumps. 

they so ugly
it's a sin.
they be jumpin'

pay no mind
these creepy items
close my eyes
i bite 'ems, bite 'ems.


we used to have a single cow,
we called her mrs. rupple. 
but she got struck by a lightning bolt,
and now we have a couple. 

she's walking sort of funny now,
oh pity her poor calf. 
old mrs. rupple gives no milk,
she gives us half-and-half.


when i was a boy
 in looziana,
 we wore blue jeans
 and a red bandanna.
  
 my folks moved up
 to the state of maine,
 we wore duck shoes
 in slicker-suit rain.
  
 my folks moved down
 to the state of texas,
 we wore brand names
 like lazy x's.
  
 now that we're living
 it up in vermont,
 we wear pretty much
 whatever we want.
 


december , title ix of the  education act is signed, providing for equal opportunity in athletics for girls as well as boys.
the year was 
when little leaguers learned the score.
president ford took out his pen,
and signed a law that said from then
on women too would have the chance
to wear the stripes and wear the pants.
now what you hear, as flags unfurl,

					in the heavy fashion magazines strewn here and there around the house the photos of objects and people mouth the word money, but you, assuming no one wants you anymore, mishear the message as meaning. arousal follows. the lives of the rich are so fabulous the destruction of the poetical lies heavily on their hands, as on their swollen notion that we are always watching. there is nothing behind the mask. nothing suffocating under its pressure, no human essence trying to get out.     awareness, always awareness. don't you see how these elaborate masks are turning you into a zombie? the private life is not for the eye but for the endless interior. it is trying to push all this crap aside and find the missing line. nobody, least of all the future, cares about the outcome of this quest.      it is easy to lose, through meddling or neglect, an entire aspect of existence. and sometimes, to cultivate a single new thought, you need not only silence but an entirely new life.
				

 

i called a man today. after he said
 hello and i said hello came a pause
 during which it would have been
  
 confusing to say hello again so i said
 how are you doing and guess what, he said
 fine and wondered aloud how i was
  
 and it turns out i'm ok. he
 was on the couch watching cars
 painted with ads for budweiser follow cars
  
 painted with ads for tide around an oval
 that's a metaphor for life because
 most of us run out of gas and settle
  
 for getting drunk in the stands
 and shouting at someone in a t-shirt
 we want kraut on our dog. i said
  
 he could have his job back and during
 the pause that followed his whiskers
 scrubbed the mouthpiece clean
  
 and his breath passed in and out
 in the tidal fashion popular
 with mammals until he broke through
  
 with the words how soon thank you
 ohmygod which crossed his lips and drove
 through the wires on the backs of ions
  
 as one long word as one hard prayer
 of relief meant to be heard
 by the sky. when he began to cry i tried
  
 with the shape of my silence to say
 i understood but each confession
 of fear and poverty was more awkward
  
 than what you learn in the shower.
 after he hung up i went outside and sat
 with one hand in the bower of the other
  
 and thought if i turn my head to the left
 it changes the song of the oriole
 and if i give a job to one stomach other
  
 forks are naked and if tonight a steak
 sizzles in his kitchen do the seven
 other people staring at their phones
  
 hear?



that there are things that can never be the same about
 my face, the houses, or the sand, that i was born under the
 sign of the sheep, that like abraham lincoln i am serious
 but also lacking in courage,
  
 that from this yard i have been composing a great speech,
 that i write about myself, that it's good to be a poet, that i look
 like the drawing of a house that was pencilled by a child,
 that curiously, i miss him and my mind is not upon the pleaides,
 that i love the ocean and its foam against the sky,
  
 that i am sneezing like a lion in this garden that he knows
 the lilies of his nile, distant image, breakfast, a flock of birds
 and sparrows from the sky,
  
 that i am not the husband of cassiopeia, that i am not
 the southern fish, that i am not the last poet of civilization,
 that if i want to go out for a walk and then to find myself
 beneath a bank of trees, weary, that this is the life that i had,
  
 that curiously i miss the sound of the rain pounding
 on the roof and also all of oakland, that i miss the sounds of
 sparrows dropping from the sky, that there are sparks behind
 my eyes, on the radio, and the distant sound of sand blasters,
 and breakfast, and every second of it, geometric, smoke
 from the chimney of the trees where i was small,
  
 that in january, i met him in a bar, we went
 home together, there was a lemon tree in the back yard,
 and a coffee house where we stood outside and kissed,
  
 that i have never been there, curiously, and that it never was
 the same, the whole of the island, or the paintings of the stars,
 fatherly, tied to sparrows as they drop down from the sky,
  
 o rattling frame where i am, i am where there are still
 these assignments in the night, to remember the texture
 of the leaves on the locust trees in august, under the
 moonlight, rounded, through a window in the hills,
  
 that if i stay beneath the pole star in this harmony of
 crickets that will sing, the bird sound on the screen,
 the wide eyes of the owl form of him still in the dark,
 blue, green, with shards of the pacific,
  
 that i do not know the dreams from which i have come,
 sent into the world without the blessing of a kiss, behind the
 willow trees, beside the darkened pansies on the deck beside
 the ships, rocking, i have written this, across the back of the 
 sky, wearing a small and yellow shirt, near the reptile house,
 mammalian, no bigger than the herd,
  
 that i wrote the history of the war waged between the
 peloponnesians and the south, that i like to run through
 shopping malls, that i've also learned to draw, having been
 driven here, like the rain is driven into things, into the
 ground, beside the broken barns, by the railroad tracks,
 beside the sea, i, thucydides, having written this, having
 grown up near the ocean.
 


lathe of the ocean. perpetual
 motion machine of the waves. everything still
 being turned and shaped to a shape nobody
 foresees ten years ago, was it, when we
  
 walked that shore, too earnest and sheepish
 to hold hands? the wind cutting through our clothes
 cleansed and burned, the chill off the atlantic
 an ache we courted in our dumbstruck talk
  
 callow, expectant, what wouldn't love give?
 cavalcanti's ray from mars, dante's wheel that moves
 the planets and the stars, how nervous
 we were, awkward and shivering like this,
  
 do you like it like this? up all night,
 then waking to the smell of flannel and sweat,
 we lay grateful, winded, goosefleshed in the chill,
 our own atmosphere rich and breathable
  
 we drank round the clock, embracing extremes,
 too hurried and heartsore to think of time
 out fishing after midnight, we watched schools of squid
 slide and shimmer, tentacles tight-wrapped
  
 around our gig's hooks yanked from the water,
 they spouted jets of ink, then pulsed and quivered
 and faded to dead-white, their eyes, resigned and sober,
 opening wider and widerten years more,
  
 and will either of us remember
 that ink sticky on our hands, the moon-glare
 rippling as we knelt underneath the pier
 and scrubbed and scrubbed our hands in the dark water?
 


wiretaps and tapes, concealed
 bugs and mikes,
                            intercepted letters
 full of passionate declarations, contradictory
 intelligence--
                            how attached he'd grown
 to the subject's documents, revising and rearranging
 the influx of intelligence
 with a sentiment, he acknowledged, almost
                            like love he felt
 the cool gray eyes of his superiors
 trained on him, rebuking him
                            for swerving, for letting
 himself go--such tender obsession
 occasioned by the file
                            not quite the professional style
 he or the agency expected
  
 but such official loyalties
                            seemed mere protocol to this--
 what was wrong with him,
                            he wondered, that he construed
 the documents to make the subject
 seem a hero,
                            a bastard whose sole patrimony
 was a pair of shoes and a rusted sword
 left by an unknown father beneath a stone?
  
 and yet his exploits in the tabloids,
 the headlines screaming,
  
 scourge of monsters strikes again
 hero founds republic
  
                            were these heroic
 different in kind from the rumors,
 unverified,
                            of a rape, a murder?
  
 --but to have met undisguised the devouring monster
 to have escaped the twisting tunnels of the maze
  
 on balance, for such a life,
                            the hero's reputation wasn't bad
 think of the opportunities for evil
                            a man of such qualities must have had
 how well he knew him--an essential innocence
 that followed impulse, blind
 to protocol, not noticeably more kind
                            than he was cruel.
 but to stamp case closed and cease
                            gathering intelligence,
 to give the hero up, almost, he admitted,
 like a lover
                            such limits the hero
 unknowingly transgressed
 and the agency, cold-blooded where
                            limits were concerned mere protocol?--
 more like a second backbone, committed
                            to keeping order, could not afford
 such sentiments--the chief of security
 felt an awful pang that the work of intelligence
                            should lead to this
  
 he leaned back in his chair and sighed
                            a forged genealogy certifying
 that the hero's father was a king a mutual
 assistance pact
                            to aid in taking back the usurped crown
 he could see them now, the wind
 blowing lightly, the two of them sweating
 as they climbed the cliff, discussing
                            the terms, exchanging information,
 intelligence--
                            how would his own face look
 staring down across the sea
                            as he gestured earnestly toward
 some island, saying,
                            according to our sources,
 the tax revenues
                            and then, edging
 the hero closer to the cliff, pointing
                            out the harbor, he'd push.
 


when i woke the darkness was so thick,
 so palpable and black that my eyes
 seemed blind as stone staring into stone.
  
 the blade that i had dreamed, efficient and quick
 as it cut into my thigh, cleaning a gangrened
 wound infected to the bone, seemed poised
  
 above my throat close-grained, impenetrable,
 the blackness rose before me like a wall.
 and then off in the next room, nervous, light,
  
 a soft padding as of an animal
 raced like my heartbeat in my temples
 round and round, trapped, stealthily desperate
  
 as if hunting its own track, terrified
 and captivated by its own odor.
 skin cool in the night air, eyes drilling
  
 through the dark, who i was before i
 slept had burned off like a vapor
 so that amnesiac and pure, witnessing
  
 my terror that i no longer recognized
 as my own, my mind floated beyond me
 to confront that frantic, closing footfall
  
 as jacob dreaming met his dark angel--
 though in my wrestling nothing blessed me
 or promised any blessing but was a mask whose eyes
  
 were all black pupil, blind as molten tar.
 i strained to see what paced there, my eyes burning
 through the dark until a pair of eyes blazed
  
 back across the blackness, an insistent, glazed
 staring that shimmered and disappeared.
 the shining blade plunged at my throat, my mind
  
 stretched and twisted, its wires tightening
 and turning as the creature lunged back and forth
 and with a deep-throated yowling, thrashing
  
 and thrashing to fight clear of its own circling,
 cleanly leapt away. i reached for the knife
 but gripped only air, my eyes pressing
  
 deeper and deeper into the night's black stone,
 cutting the way the knife had cut into my wound,
 probing for the white shining of the bone
  
 what had i become? what darkness had my dream
 led me down into? too frightened even 
 to move, i lay bound and sweating in
  
 the sheets, the moon a warning-bell beating
 on the glass, its light carving out the curtains
 like the shadow of a wing across the windowpane.
 


for lem 
as if your half-witted tongue
 spoke with an eloquence
 death bestows, i heard your voice
 muffled through the dark
 layers of cemetery loam
  
 they found me black-suited
 in the shuttered half-dark, my eyes
 dug like claws into the clouds'
 soft feather-turnings. what kept me
 separate the broiling sun
  
 of intellect now shone on fiercely
 in the sheep-pens stinking
 of dung and lanolin,
 i buried my face in the ewe's
 swollen side and listened
  
 for the lamb the way
 the night sky listens
 to the synapse-fire
 of meteors, the fibrillating
 heartbeat of the stars.
  
 i heard the cells crackle
 into being, the embryonic
 brain begin to burn
 hunger. thirst. beneath my ear
 my own disastrous birthing,
  
 the umbilicus strangling
 like a whip around my neck,
 shoved through the momentary
 breach memory tore open--
 dying revealed to me my birth,
  
 how half my brain went dark,
 one side of a universe
 pinched out like a candle
 just smart enough to sense
 my difference, yet not know why--
  
 even my death was the thrust
 of a bewildering punchline on thanksgiving
 morning mouthwatering
 pain shoved like a spit
 from my bowels to my brain.
 


and with great fear i inhabit the middle of the night
what wrecks of the mind await me, what drugs
to dull the senses, what little i have left,
what more can be taken away?

the fear of travelling, of the future without hope
or buoy. i must get away from this place and see
that there is no fear without me that it is within
unless it be some sudden act or calamity

to land me in the hospital, a total wreck, without
memory again or worse still, behind bars. if
i could just get out of the country. some place
where one can eat the lotus in peace.

for in this country it is terror, poverty awaits or
am i a marked man, my life to be a lesson
or experience to those young who would trod
the same path, without god

unless he be one of justice, to wreak vengeance
on the acts committed while young under un-
due influence or circumstance. oh i have
always seen my life as drama, patterned

after those who met with disaster or doom.
is my mind being taken away me.
i have been over the abyss before. what
is that ringing in my ears that tells me

all is nigh, is naught but the roaring of the winter wind.
woe to those homeless who are out on this night.
woe to those crimes committed from which we
can walk away unharmed.

so i turn on the light
and smoke rings rise in the air.
do not think of the future there is none.
but the formula all great art is made of.

pain and suffering. give me the strength
to bear it, to enter those places where the
great animals are caged. and we can live
at peace by their side. a bride to the burden

that no god imposes but knows we have the means
to sustain its force unto the end of our days.
for that is what we are made for for that 
we are created. until the dark hours are done.

and we rise again in the dawn.
infinite particles of the divine sun, now
worshipped in the pitches of the night.


march th and the snow flees like eloping brides
into rain. the imperceptible change begins
out of an old rage and glistens, chaste, with its new
craving, spring. may your desire always overcome
 
your need your story that you have to tell,
enchanting, mutable, may it fill the world
you believe a sunny view, flowers lunging
from the sill, the quilt, the chair, all things
 
fill with you and empty and fill. and hurry, because
now as i tire of my studied abandon, counting
the days, i'm sad. yet i trust your absence, in everything
wholly evident the rain in the white basin, and i
 
vigilant. 
 


trees have whole streets
                                           of when they were planted
plaqued with when the city is
                                              to inherit them dead
of age almost all at once as if
                                            a natural bombing.
 
 
people see a bill not figured in,
                                                      a blood red
collection come
                   like fall's leaf    due without fail
an unseen cost of the design
                               pale bud and yellow blossom--
 
 
though seeming little to do this time
                                       with tense spring
in the window
                                of dead and dying trees' terms up,
with expecting a life by life replacement--
                     not this plague of life's time
 
 
as a season across the city.
                                             by trial we do, but don't
know how death counts the rings
                                                   from trees to clocks,
species to singled soul
                                          at its hour. or on history's days we all die at once.



but for a low bank of cloud,
         clear morning,    empty sky.
 
the bright band of light beneath  the cloud's gray
       i thought at first was open distance,    but it's ice
 
that by extension raised the lake above the lip of blue lake
       and spilled it farther out than that horizon
 
along the sky
       and floods the clouds.
 
 
      seeing the distant level further
unfurl into the sky says not to trust
 
      blue line as terminus
when a meniscus of ice
 
       can ride up that wall of the skyline,
a measure of illusion how close
 
       the eye can be to filled
with seeing,        to widen instead the tube of that measure
 
 
of sight we are given.        there is the larger
        lake the wider look we open
 
eyes to see. that glance of the lip
        put in a bigger cylinder falls away,
 
but how much deeper the spring
       to fill the cup.
 
as if the surface we are seeing
        drops          the more seeing is added,
 
 
       while we feel the stories well as our height
from which to see.         and watch the dawns coming.
 
i seem to be emptying
of time        the more time i put in,
 
       and see like a man with weathered eyes enough
to face to face up   to the sight's field expanded
 
       to insight.    to the dark the lake can turn
and curl up like a map for poems to have
 
 
these likenesses to graph,
        then come un-scrolled from semblance back
 
to just this lake.        water
       cities are led to        layout
 
beside.      but never in stillness
       always the restoration to change,
 
from ice, from cloud, turning to clear
        liquid--as is most of our body
 
 
        water--       thinned sheet, layer
that if written        on or with,         a bearing
 
a name chiseled on water
       disappears.    



       as at the far edge of circling the country,
facing suddenly the other ocean,
the boundless edge of what i had wanted
to know, i stepped
      into my answers' shadow ocean,
 
the tightening curl of the corners
of outdated old paperbacks,    breakers,
a crumble surf of tiny dry triangles around
       my ankles sinking in my stand
 
taken      that the horizon written
by the spin of my compass is          that this is
is not enough         a point to turn around on,
 
       is like a skin      that falls short of edge
as a rug,     that covers a no longer
natural spot, no longer existent
to live on from,    the map of my person
        come to the end of,       but not done.
 
        that country crossed was what i could imagine,
and that little spit of answer is the shadow--
not the ocean which casts it--      that i step next
into       to be cleansed of question.
 
      but not of seeking      it as
if simplified for the seeking,
       come to its end at this body.



i have to leave early in the dark
and hungry to avoid
crossing the snow as the noon
 
burns the crust
into an un-servable lake
slush instead of the crisp bridge
 
that would be in order
to get me over the ridge
 
my journal is already laundered clean
of my words      and my instructions
have dissolved
 
into a white mash       a washed bone
ball         rolled into itself
of all i have in the world       in my pocket
 
 
the ink is thin the paper is poor
my eyes balance on the pale
words around which a stream
 
flows     almost erasing
the way across
the idea
 
shadows         the black flowers
of the light self
-sowing through the trees
 
dark gardens        of midnight
for the gray-white morning
hour        of blindness
 
in print miles before i am
to arrive        here
 
to approach the waiting milestone
dims whatever else of its lantern
til only the placed light there is on me.
 
in this light       barely      but used to it
i can make out the staggered columns of my account
as if back through weren't the real distance
 
the thin chest flag pinned on by each ridge
the titled introduction taking your coat each storm.
 
 
my letters and ribbons have been the natural--
strengths on their way to the more--
natural weaknesses--         and loss.        yet--
 
i wonder where i thought i was going--
to 've done what you must pass
examinations for before i took any.



and if sun comes
how shall we greet him?
shall we not dread him,
shall we not fear him
after so lengthy a
session with shade?
 
though we have wept for him,
though we have prayed
all through the night-years--
what if we wake one shimmering morning to
hear the fierce hammering
of his firm knuckles
hard on the door?
 
shall we not shudder?--
shall we not flee
into the shelter, the dear thick shelter
of the familiar
propitious haze?
 
sweet is it, sweet is it
to sleep in the coolness
of snug unawareness.
 
the dark hangs heavily
over the eyes.
 



when it is cold it stinks, and not till then.
the seasonable or more rabid heats
of love and summer in some other cities
unseal the all too human not in his.
when it is cold it stinks, but not before
 
smells to high heaven then most creaturely
when it is cold. it stinks, but not before
his freezing eye has done its best to maim,
to amputate limbs, livelihood and name,
abstracting life beyond all likelihood.
 
when it is cold it stinks, and not till then
can it be fragrant. on canal and street,
colder and colder, murphy to molloy,
the weather hardens round the idiot boy,
the gleeful hero of the long retreat.
 
when he is cold he stinks, but not before,
this living corpse. the existential weather
smells out in these abortive minims, men
who barely living therefore altogether
live till they die and sweetly smell till then.



x, whom society's most mild command,
for instance evening dress, infuriates,
in art is seen confusingly to stand
for disciplined conformity, with yeats.
 
taxed to explain what this resentment is
he feels for small proprieties, it comes,
he likes to think, from old enormities
and keeps the faith with famous martyrdoms.
 
yet it is likely, if indeed the crimes
his fathers suffered rankle in his blood,
that he find least excusable the times
when they acceded, not when they withstood.
 
how else explain this bloody-minded bent
to kick against the prickings of the norm
when to conform is easy, to dissent
and when it is most difficult, conform?



a queer thing about those waters there are no
birds there, or hardly any.
i did not miss them, i do not remember
missing them, or thinking it uncanny.
 
the beach so-called was a blinding splinter of limestone,
a quarry outraged by hulls.
we took pleasure in that the emptiness, the hardness
of the light, the silence, and the water's stillness.
 
but this was the setting for one of our murderous scenes.
this hurt, and goes on hurting
the venomous soft jelly, the undersides.
we could stand the world if it were hard all over.



chemicals ripen the citrus
there are rattlesnakes in the mountains,
and on the shoreline
hygiene, inhuman caution.
 
beef in cellophane
tall as giraffes,
the orange-rancher's daughters
crop their own groves, mistrustful.
 
perpetual summer seems
precarious on the littoral. we drive
inland to prove
the risk we sense. at once
 
winter claps-to like a shutter
high over the ojai valley, and discloses
a double crisis,
winter and drought.
 
ranges on mountain-ranges,
empty, unwatered, crumbling,
hot colours come at the eye.
it is too cold
 
for picnics at the trestle-tables. claypit
yellow burns on the distance.
the phantom walks
everywhere, of intolerable heat.
 
at ventucopa, elevation
two-eight-nine-six, the water hydrant frozen,
deserted or broken settlements,
gasoline stations closed and boarded.
 
by nightfall, to the snows
and over the mile on tilted
mile of the mountain park
the bright cars hazarded.



northward i came, and knocked in the coated wall
at the door of a low inn scaled like a urinal
with greenish tiles. the door gave, and i came
 
home to the stone north, every wynd and snicket
known to me wherever the flattened cat
squirmed home to a hole between housewall and paving.
 
known and in the turns of it, no welcome,
no flattery of the beckoned lighted eye
from a rose of the rose-brick alleys of toulouse.
 
those more than tinsel garlands, more than masks,
unfading wreaths of ancient summers, i
sternly cast off. a stern eye is the graceless
 
bulk and bruise that at the steep uphill
confronts me with its drained-of-colour sandstone
implacably. the church. it is good friday.
 
goodbye to the middle ages although some
think that i enter them, those centuries
of monkish superstition, here i leave them
 
with their true garlands, and their honest masks,
every fresh flower cast on the porch and trodden,
raked by the wind at the church door on this friday.
 
goodbye to all the centuries. there is
no home in them, much as the dip and turn
of an honest alley charmingly deceive us.
 
and not yet quite goodbye. instead almost
welcome, i said. bleak equal centuries
crowded the porch to be deflowered, crowned.



stooped to truth and moralized his song
spring pricks a little. i get out the maps.
time to demoralize my song, high time.
vernal a little. primavera. first
green, first truth and last.
high time, high time.
 
a high old time we had of it last summer?
i overstate. but getting out the maps
look up the valley of the brenne,
louise de la vallire syntax collapses.
high time for that, high time.
 
to chteau-renault, the tannery town whose marquis
rooke and james butler whipped in vigo bay
or so the song says, an amoral song
like ronsard's where we go today
perhaps, perhaps tomorrow.
 
tomorrow and tomorrow and get well
philip's black-sailed familiar, avaunt
or some word as ridiculous, the whole
diction kit begins to fall apart.
high time it did, high time.
 
high time and a long time yet, my love
get out that blessed map.
ageing, you take your glasses off to read it.
stooping to truth, we potter to montoire.
high time, my love. high time and a long time yet.



no moss nor mottle stains
my parents' unmarked grave
my word on them remains
stouter than stone, you told me.
 
martyred to words, you have thought,
should be your epitaph
at other times you fought
my self-reproaches down.
 
though bitterly once or twice
you have reproached me with how
everything ended in words,
we both know better now
 
you understand, i shall not
if i survive you care
to raise a headstone for
you i have carved on air.



i ply with all the cunning of my art
this little thing, and with consummate care
i fashion it--so that when i depart,
those who come after me shall find it fair
and beautiful. it must be free of flaws--
pointing no laborings of weary hands
and there must be no flouting of the laws
of beauty--as the artist understands.
 
through passion, yearnings infinite--yet dumb--
i lift you from the depths of my own mind
and gild you with my soul's white heat to plumb
the souls of future men. i leave behind
this thing that in return this solace gives
he who creates true beauty ever lives.
 


the wind that makes your hair grow faster
opens a child's mouth full of strawberry and sand.
slow and sure 
on the scales of the ocean
the child's head outweighs the sun.

inside of the wind-- 
                                       a blister of a church,
its walls thicker than the space from wall to wall
where the wind shifts shade and light
like two rival chess pieces
or two unmatched pieces of furniture. 
inside of the church--such a stillness
that when a feather floats down in a fist of dust
it becomes a rock by the time it hits the ground.

organ pipes glint like a cold radiator,
contained in a case of a carved tree, its branches
tied up with a snake.
organ pedals, golden and plump, are the tree's only fruit.

it is all about the release of weight 
the player crushes the pedals like grapes underneath his feet.
my body, like an inaccurate cashier, adds your weight to itself.
your name, called into the wind,
slows the wind down.

when a body is ripe, it falls and rots from the softest spot. 

only when a child slips and drops off a tree,
the tree suddenly learns that it is barren. 



a woman's hallelujah washes the foot of mocking bird 
hill, her face eclipsed by her black mouth, 
her eyes rolled up like workman's sleeves. 
stirred up, a fly speaks in the tongue of the hotel 
doorbell, where, on the sun-ridden straw terrace 
my salvation means less than praise
to a dumb child. damned, blinded by ice cubes, 
the fly surrenders its life into the waiter's clean hands. 

behind the kitchen of the mocking bird hotel
a rooster repeats hallelujah until it loses its head.
a man harvests the family tree before his forefathers'
features have a chance to ripen on their faces. parakeets 
watch him from the bare nerves of the garden. he harvests 
before the worms that eat his father turn into demons.

do not eat the fruit from your family tree. you have
eyes not to see them, hands not to pick them, teeth
not to bite them, tongue not to taste them even in speech. 
the waiter slashes the table with our bill. we descend 
mocking bird hill without raising dust. dogs, 
their fur hanging like wet feathers off their backs, 
piss yellow smoke without lifting a leg. gulls 
smash their heads between their wings. 
light lays the eggs of shadows under the shrubs. 
produce shacks stand empty like football gates. 
what appeared blue from afar, turns green. 
                 i hold it all in, even my own urine. 
but the mother of vowels slumps from my throat 
like the queen of a havocked beehive. 

higher than hallelujah rising like smoke over the hill,
i scream at the top of that green lung, 
                                                                    why, in the mocking bird 
hell, do you value your blood over your sweat,
that bitterness over this salt, that wound over this 
crystal? but often, to shed light on the darkness, light 
isn't enough. often what i need is even a darker
darkness. like in those hours before the sun incriminates this
hotel, his two nostrils that illuminate our benighted bodies. 



sei allem abschied voran half

a line from rilke's die sonettean orpheus as my motto,

i rehearsed my elegiac artbe in advance of all parting

and won, i thought, with each song deeper,until i stood before the keeper

in whom i've come to recognize myself.



					
					first, j. robert oppenheimer wrote his paper on dwarf stars--what happens to a massive star that burns out? he asked. his calculations suggested that instead of collapsing it would contract indefinitely, under the force of its own gravity. the bright star would disappear but it would still be there, where there had been brilliance there would be a blank. soon after, workers built oak ridge, the accumulation of cemesto hutments not placed on any map. they built a church, a school, a bowling alley. from all over, families drove through the muddy ruts. the ground swelled about the ruts like flesh stitched by sutures. my father, a child, watched the loads on the tops of their cars tip. gates let everyone in and out with a pass. forbidden to tell anyone they were there, my father's family moved in, quietly, behind the chain-link fence. niels bohr said, this bomb might be our great hope. my father watched his parents eat breakfast his father opened his newspaper across the plate of bacon and eggs, his mother smoked camel straights, the ash from her cigarette cometing across the back of the obituaries. they spoke little. increasingly the mother drank wild turkey with her women friends from the bowling league. generators from the y- plant droned their ambition. there were no birds. general leslie groves marched the boardwalks, yelled, his boots pressed the slates and the mud bubbled up like viscera. my father watched his father enter the plant. my shy father went to the library, which was a trailer with a circus tent painted on the side. there he read the definition of uranium which was worn to a blur. my father read one hardy boys mystery after another. it was august . the librarian smiled sympathetically at the -year-old boy. time to go home, the librarian said. they named the bomb little boy. it weighed , pounds. it was the size of a go-kart. on the battle cruiser augusta, president truman said, this is the greatest thing in history. that evening, my father's parents mentioned japanese cities. everyone was quiet. it was the quiet of the exhausted and the innocent. the quietness inside my father was building and would come to define him. i was wrong to judge it. speak, father, and i will listen. and if you do not wish to speak, then i will listen to that.
				

 

i had heard the story before 
about the two prisoners, alone 
in the same cell, and one 
gives the other lessons in a language. 
day after day, the pupil studies hard--
what else does he have to do?--and year 
after year they practice, 
waiting for the hour of release. 
they tackle the nouns, the cases, and genders, 
the rules for imperatives and conjugations, 
but near the end of his sentence, the teacher 
suddenly dies and only the pupil 
goes back through the gate and into the open 
world. he travels to the country of his new 
language, fluent, and full of hope. 
yet when he arrives he finds 
that the language he speaks is not 
the language that is spoken. he has learned 
a language one other person knew--its inventor, 
his cell-mate and teacher.
                          and then the other 
evening, i heard the story again. 
this time the teacher was gombrowicz, the pupil 
was his wife. she had dreamed of learning 
polish and, hour after hour, for years 
on end, gombrowicz had been willing to teach 
her a polish that does not and never 
did exist. the man who told 
the story would like to marry his girlfriend. 
they love to read in bed and between
them speak three languages. 
they laughed--at the wife, at gombrowicz, it wasn't
clear, and i wasn't sure that they 
themselves knew what was funny. 
i wondered why the man had told 
the story, and thought of the tricks 
enclosure can play. a nod, or silence, 
another nod, consent--or not, as a cloud 
drifts beyond the scene and the two 
stand pointing in different directions 
at the very same empty sky.
                           even so, there was something 
else about the story, like teaching 
a stunt to an animal--a four-legged 
creature might prance on two legs 
or a two-legged creature might 
fall onto four.
                           i remembered, 
then, the miscarriage, and before that 
the months of waiting like baskets filled 
with bright shapes, the imagination 
run wild. and then what arrived
the event that was nothing, a mistaken idea, 
a scrap of charred cloth, the enormous 
present folding over the future, 
like a wave overtaking 
a grain of sand. 
                           there was a myth 
i once knew about twins who spoke 
a private language, though one 
spoke only the truth and the other 
only lies. the savior gets mixed 
up with the traitor, but the traitor 
stays as true to himself as a god. 

all night the rain falls here, falls there,
and the creatures dream, or drown, in the lair.



some days i am happy to be no one
the shifting grasses 

in the may winds are miraculous enough
as they ripple through the meadow of lupine

the field as iridescent as a renaissance heaven
& do you see that boy with his arms raised 

like one of raphael's angels held within
this hush & this pause & the sky's lapis expanse?

that boy is my son & i am his only father
even when i am no one


i saw my mother standing there below me
on the narrow bank just looking out over the river

looking at something just beyond the taut middle rope 
of the braided swirling currents

then she looked up quite suddenly to the far bank
where the densely twined limbs of the cypress

twisted violently toward the storm-struck sky
there are some things we know before we know

also some things we wish we would not ever know
even if as children we already knew      & so

standing above her on that bridge that shuddered 
each time the river ripped at its wooden pilings 

i knew i could never even fate willing ever 
get to her in time




raccoon you better be cool

thought i saw you on broadway
eating king fish's barbecue

some people claim raccoon you pretty
swear raccoon tame like a kitty 

but raccoon bites you if you get too close

i saw raccoon on lenox avenue
stealing milk from a baby 

thought i saw a black cat on the corner
but it was nothing but old raccoon

raccoon let me school you 

raccoon you know you too country
you better leave the city

raccoon they got rats in new york city
big as you and just as ornery 

nobody in harlem studying you raccoon
so you better go about your business

raccoon you better get wise
look what playing possum got the possum 



the slice i ate i want it back
those crumbs i swept up
i'd like my share again
i can still taste it like it was 

the memory by itself is delicious
each bite was a small miracle 
both nourishing and sweet 
i wish i had saved just a little bit 

i know it wasn't a literal cake
it's the thought that counts
like a gift that's not store-bought
making it even more special  

like a dream that makes you
want to go back to sleep
you can't have your cake
and eat it too momma said 

i was defiant and hardheaded
and answered yes i can too
the look she gave me said boy 
i hope you aren't a fool all your life



an asparagus eating contest--
i thought i'd misheard.

downstairs the rude old man
lays tile, makes demasiado noise.
i fell asleep at last around  am
and he woke me an hour later or so
it is better i don't look
at the clock. by this means
i clock my progress i know now
it is sometimes better not to 
know. i have midnight equilibrium 
but it is gone by  am.

thank you for cloud of sparrows,
man who wrote it. i read all night.
thank you for the pen from iran, kamyar.
its myriad stars have just run out of ink 
eleven years on.

thank you, sun, for leaf shadows
on horrible carpet in horrible box
i live in and for tree by which i mean
what's living. i think of the gardens
i planted and left. i think of beets,
of beans and asparagus. then
on the radio, hear the contest.

the noise of ten lanes of traffic
does not cancel the consolation
of seeing the wind 
in the sweetgum leaves. 
the experience of this 
is my food and my sleep.

as at some strange customs,
i declare.  



it must be awful, she said to the dog locked in it
as she left the kitchen that wasn't hers, closing its door,
to head up the stairs with every good thing she could find
to eat in her arms

                            to eat in her arms--o katherine

                                          not to have any arms.



if i were in a book it would be the book
in which some lesser angel bemoans
the state of my soul

and is comforted for it
and is corrected for it

by some greater angel who knows
as the reader knows that it is not one's soul
that suffers the indignities of ignobility 
the inability to curb the petty smallness
of spirit, ungladness in the company
of bureaucrats, anger's decay,

in the sense that my soul itself cannot be
harmed nor tarnished though it can witness
my sorrow on finding that illness alters me
from the self i thought i'd more or less known. 

what can one do about one's nature?
i look at the spider that's finally 
restrung its great wheel away from the door.

i'd like to close the door, go away,
leaving the spider be.
i'd like to preclude the possibility
of angel, as of prey.



coinage of the not-yet-wholly-
             hardened custodians of public 
health, as health is roughly measured 
             in the rougher parts of dearborn.

meaning, how many parents,
             when things get bad, are wearing
what they've slept in when they come 
             to pick up the kids at school. 

the best of talk, said someone
             once, is shop talk we can go 
to it as to a well. but manifolds
             and steering racks are going

the way of the wells--offshore--

with-the-wrench-when-the-foreman-
             has-sped-the-line-up

             despair among the people
you are paid to help. despair, 
             sometimes, of helping. in

the winter dawn a decade and a half
             ago, we'd gather around
the school bus stop--the unshaved
             fathers, mothers, dogs,

the siblings in their snowsuits--so
             the children bound for
johnson elementary might have
             a proper sending-off.
    
the privileged of the earth, in our
             case words and stars
and molecules were all our care,
             a makeshift village blessed

with time and purpose. and
             a school bus stop,
to make it seem like life. by far my 
             favorites were the russian

mathematicians bathrobes hanging
             below their parkas, cigarettes
scattering ash, their little ones for the
             moment quite forgotten, they 

would cover the walls of the shelter 
             with what 
to most of us was greek but was 
             no doubt of urgent consequence 

for quantum fields. so filled with joy 
             their permanent markers on the  
brick. and then 
             the bus, and then the children off 

without us and our little human pretext 
             gone. fragile the minutes.
fragile the line between wonder
             and woe. the poet when he

wrote about our parents in the garden
             gave them love and rest
and mindfulness. but first 
             he gave them honest work.



she came into my view as vivid as
somebody on a screen in a movie seen,
elegant in the focus of my eye.

birdboned. quick and light. not wearing pajamas.
the little run resembling playfulness.
calling out something, screaming something or other

as if her little mouth was fervently singing,
as if you couldn't hear what the words could be,
because of the singing. i had her in my sight.

other people were there, wearing pajamas, 
streaming out of some hideyhole or other
into the way that that was how i saw them.

the trees of the kind that grew there establish the place.
we know that way the story of what it was.



the style a form of concealment the way style is.
his manners seemed a parody, almost, 
of manners, a movie star of bygone days

strangely elaborate, highly stylized manners,
complicit with his fame and with your praise
looking toward you and then away from you,

star-like, movie-star-like, a dance routine,
the walk almost a glide, or elegant shuffle,
always on the verge of veering away,

circling away and over to the other side
of the frozen skating arena that he was on
a dancer's courtesy, the courtesy,

i mean, of the dancer to the audience,
flirtatious and familiar, only for you,
and entirely impersonal and withheld.

all of the above, though, maybe, misses the point,
because it seems to say he knew about
what he was doing or what the style was for,

and nothing let one be sure that this was so
a look on his face of amusement, as if he knew
a secret that he shared with you and yet

kept to himself, as if it only showed 
the cryptogram but wouldn't provide the key
to read it with. but could he read the code?

one night, late at night, as we were driving
home from having had dinner out, in boston,
we saw him figure skating through charles street circle,

right through and among the circling lights of cars
as if with champion skill on thin ice whirling
oblivious to the astonished blaring horns,

as a dancer or skater seems, while dancing to
the music that we hear, oblivious to
the music that we hear and listening to

some other music heard from somewhere else.
so peter moved like a dancer or skater through 
and among the dangerous outraged cars as if

untouchable and untouched and moving to
the sounds of something else from somewhere else--
the music maybe of his madness was it?

it was as if he skated in solitude
and glided whirling on a lonely tarn
far out away from everything there is.



they said, my saints, my slogan-sayers sang,   
be good, my child, in spite of all alarm. 

they stood, my fathers, tall in a row and said,   
be good, be brave, you shall not come to harm. 

i heard them in my sleep and muttering dream,   
and murmuring cried, how shall i wake to this? 

they said, my poets, singers of my song,   
we cannot tell, since all we tell you is 

but history, we speak but of the dead.   
and of the dead they said such history 

their beards were blazing with the truth of it   
as made of much of me a mystery. 



by the last few times we saw her it was clear 
that things were different. when you tried to help her   
get out of the car or get from the car to the door 
or across the apartment house hall to the elevator   
there was a new sense of heaviness   
or of inertia in the body. it wasn't   
that she was less willing to be helped to walk 
but that the walking itself had become less willing.   
maybe the stupid demogorgon blind   
recalcitrance of body, resentful of the laws   
of mind and spirit, was getting its own back now, 
or maybe a new and subtle, alien,   
intelligence of body was obedient now   
to other laws weight is the measure of 
the force with which a body is drawn downward 
to the center of the earth inertia is   
the tendency of a body to resist   
proceeding to its fate in any way   
other than that determined for itself. 

that evening, at the bromells' apartment, after 
she had been carried up through the rational structure   
by articulate stages, floor after flashing floor, 
and after we helped her get across the hall, 
and get across the room to a chair, somehow   
we got her seated in a chair that was placed   
a little too far away from the nearest table,   
at the edge of the abyss, and there she sat, 
exposed, her body the object of our attention-- 
the heaviness of it, the helpless graceless leg, 
the thick stocking, the leg brace, the medical shoe. 

at work between herself and us there was   
a new principle of social awkwardness   
and skillfulness required of each of us.   
our tones of voice in this easy conversation   
were instruments of marvelous finesse,   
measuring and maintaining with exactitude   
the fact or condition of the difference 
there was between us, both in space and time. 

her smiling made her look as if she had 
just then tasted something delicious, the charm   
her courtesy attributed to her friends. 

this decent elegant fellow human being 
was seated in virtue, character, disability,   
behind her the order of the ranged bookshelves,   
the windows monitored by venetian blinds-- 
these can be raised or lowered numerous slats,   
horizontally arranged, and parallel, 
which can be tilted so as to admit 
precisely the desired light or air. 

we were all her friends, maggie, and bill, and anne,   
and i, and the nice boston brahmin elderly man   
named duncan, utterly friendly and benign. 
and of course it wasn't whether or not the world   
was benign but whether it looked at her too much.   
she wasn't painfully shy but just the same   
i wouldn't be surprised if there had been   
painfulness in her shyness earlier on, 
say at dancing school. like others, though, she had   
survived her childhood somehow. nor do i mean   
she was unhappy. maybe more or less so   
before her marriage. one had the sense of trips   
arranged, committees, concerts, baffled courage   
living it through, giving it order and style.   
and one had the sense of the late marriage as of   
two bafflements inventing the sense they made   
together. the marriage seemed, to the outside world,   
and probably was, radiant and triumphant,   
and i think that one could almost certainly say   
that during the last, heroic, phase of things,   
after his death, and after the stroke, she had   
by force of character and careful management,   
maintained a certain degree of happiness. 

the books there on the bookshelves told their stories, 
line after line, all of them evenly spaced, 
and spaces between the words. you could fall through the spaces.
in one of the books dr. johnson told the story   
in the scale of being, wherever it begins,   
or ends, there are chasms infinitely deep   
infinite vacuities...for surely, 
nothing can so disturb the passions, or   
perplex the intellects of man so much,   
as the disruption of this union with   
visible nature, separation from all 
that has delighted or engaged him, a change 
not only of the place but of the manner   
of his being, an entrance into a state 
not simply which he knows not, but perhaps   
a state he has not faculties to know. 

the dinner was delicious, fresh greens, and reds,   
and yellows, produce of the season due, 
and fish from the nearby sea and there were also   
ashes to be eaten, and dirt to drink. 



it was as if a flower bloomed as if
its muttering root and stem had suddenly spoken,

uttering on the air a poem of summer,
the rose the utterance of its root and stem.

thus her beautiful face, the crippled girl's,
was like the poem spoken by her body--

the richness of that face--most generous
in what it keeps, giving in its having.

the rose reserves the sweetness that it yields,
petal on petal, telling its own silence,

her beauty saying from its thorny stalk
that what it is is kept as it is given.



the sea bit,
as they said it would,
and the hill slid,
as they said it would,
and the poor dead
nodded agog
the poor head.

o topmost lofty
tower of troy,
the poem apparently
speaks with joy
of terrible things.
where is the pleasure
the poetry brings?

tell if you can,
what does it make?
a city of man
that will not shake,
or if it shake,
shake with the splendor
of the poem's pleasure.



you lie in our bed as if an orchard were over us.

you are what's fallen from those fatal boughs.

where will we go when they send us away from here?



a man and a woman are sitting at a table.
it is supper time. the air is green. the walls
are white in the green air, as rocks under water
retain their own true color, though washed in green.
i do not know either the man or the woman,
nor do i know whatever they know of each other.
though washed in my eye they keep their own true color.

the man is all his own hunched strength, the body's
self and strength, that bears, like weariness,
itself upon itself, as a stone's weight
bears heavily on itself to be itself.
heavy the strength that bears the body down.
and the way he feeds is like a dreamless sleep.
the dreaming of a stone is how he feeds.

the woman's arms are plump, mottled a little
the flesh, like standing milk, and on one arm
a blue bruise, got in some household labor or other,
flowering in the white. her staring eye,
like some bird's cry called from some deepest wood,
says nothing of what it is but what it is.
such silence is the bird's cry of the stone.



the unclean spirits cry out in the body 
or mind of the guest ellen in a loud voice 
torment me not, and in the fury of her unclean 
hands beating the air in some kind of unending torment-- 
nobody witnessing could possibly know the event   
that cast upon her the spell of this enchantment. 

almost all the guests are under some kind of enchantment   
of being poor day after day in the same body 
of being witness still to some obscene event 
of listening all the time to somebody's voice 
whispering in the ear things divine or unclean, 
in the quotidian of unending torment. 

one has to keep thinking there was some source of torment,   
something that happened someplace else, unclean.   
one has to keep talking in a reasonable voice 
about things done, say, by a father's body 
to or upon the body of ellen, in enchantment 
helpless, still by the unforgotten event 

enchanted, still in the old forgotten event 
a prisoner of love, filthy ellen in her torment,   
guest ellen in the dining hall in her body, 
hands beating the air in her enchantment,   
sitting alone, gabbling in her garbled voice   
the narrative of the spirits of the unclean. 

she is wholly the possessed one of the unclean. 
maybe the spirits came from the river. the enchantment   
entered her, maybe, in the northeast kingdom. the torment,   
a thing of the waters, gratuitous event, 
came up out of the waters and entered her body 
and lived in her in torment and cried out in her voice. 

it speaks itself over and over again in her voice,   
cursing maybe or not a familiar obscene event   
or only the pure event of original enchantment   
from the birth of the river waters, the pure unclean   
rising from the source of things, in a figure of torment   
seeking out ellen, finding its home in her poor body. 

her body witness is, so also is her voice,   
of torment coming from unknown event 
unclean is the nature and name of the enchantment. 



in memoriam mary ann, 
the five or six of them, sitting on the rocks 
out at lanesville, near gloucester it is like
listening to music. several of them are teachers,
one is a psychologist, one is reading a book,
the page glares white in the summer sunlight
others are just sunning themselves, or just
sitting there looking out over the water
a couple of them seem to be talking together
from this far off you can't hear what they are saying.

the day is hot, the absolute middle of summer.
someone has written an obscenity 
in huge letters on the rocks above and behind
this group of people, and someone else, one of them,
maybe, or maybe a neighbor, the owner of one
of the cottages up behind and back in the woods,
has tried to erase it and only partly done so,
so that for years it will say hoarsely fuck
to the random winds and to the senseless waves.

one of them is sitting with her back turned
to me and to the others on the rocks. the purple
loosestrife and the tigerlilies are like the flags
of some celebration they bloom along the edge
of a small stream that makes its way unseen
down to the rocks and sand. her shoulders are round,
and rather luxuriously heavy, and the whole figure
has a youthful and graceful amplitude of being
whose beauty will last her her whole life long.

the voices of some people out in a boat somewhere
are carried in over the water with surprising
force and clarity, though saying i don't know what
happiness unhappiness something about the conditions
of all such things work done, not done the saving
of the self in the intense work of its singleness,
learning to live with it. their lives have separate ends.
suddenly she turned her head and seems to look
toward me and toward the others on the rocks,

so that her body, turned away, is more expressive
than her blank face, a pure reflector of light.



their jeans sparkled, cut off
way above the knee, and my
friends and i would watch them
from my porch, books of poems
lost in our laps, eyes wide as
tropical fish behind our glasses.

their football flashed from hand
to hand, tennis shoes gripped
the asphalt, sweat's spotlight on
their strong backs. we would
dream of hugging them, and crouch
later in weird rooms, and come.

once their ball fell our way
so two of them came over, hands
on their hips, asking us to
throw it to them, which arthur did,
badly, and they chased it back.
one turned to yell, thanks

and we dreamed of his long
teeth in our necks. we 
wanted them to wander over,
place deep wet underarms to
our lips, and then their white
asses, then those loud mouths.

one day one guy was very tired,
didn't move fast enough,
so a car hit him and he sprawled
fifty feet away, sexy, but he was
dead, blood like lipstick, then
those great boys stood together

on the sidewalk and we joined them,
mixing in like one big friendship
to the cops, who asked if we were,
and those boys were too sad to counter.
we'd known his name, tim, and how
he'd turned to thank us nicely

but now he was under a sheet
anonymous as god, the big boys crying,
spitting words, and we stunned
like intellectuals get, our high
voices soft as the tinkling of a 
chandelier on a ceiling too high to see.


stumps. railroad tracks. early sicknesses,
the blue one, especially.
your first love rounding a corner,
that snowy minefield.
 
whether you step lightly or heavily,
you have to get over to that tree line a hundred yards in the distance
before evening falls,
letting no one see you wend your way,
 
that wonderful, old-fashioned word, wend,
meaning to proceed, to journey,
to travel from one place to another,
as from bed to breakfast, breakfast to imbecile work.
 
you have to get over your resentments,
the sun in the morning and the moon at night,
all those shadows of yourself you left behind
on odd little tables.
 
tote that barge lift that bale you have to
cross that river, jump that hedge, surmount that slogan,
crawl over this ego or that eros,
then hoist yourself up onto that yonder mountain.
 
another old-fashioned word, yonder, meaning
that indicated place, somewhere generally seen
or just beyond sight. if you would recover,
you have to get over the shattered autos in the backwoods lot
 
to that bridge in the darkness
where the sentinels stand
guarding the border with their half-slung rifles,
 warned of the likes of you. 


because i have come to the fence at night, 
the horses arrive also from their ancient stable. 
they let me stroke their long faces, and i note 
in the light of the now-merging moon

how they, a morgan and a quarter, have been 
by shake-guttered raindrops 
spotted around their rumps and thus made 
appaloosas, the ancestral horses of this place.

maybe because it is night, they are nervous, 
or maybe because they too sense 
what they have become, they seem 
to be waiting for me to say something

to whatever ancient spirits might still abide here, 
that they might awaken from this strange dream, 
in which there are fences and stables and a man 
who doesn't know a single word they understand.


yet the after is still a storm
as witness bent shadbush
and cord grass in stillness
 
sand littered with the smallest of fragments
whether shell or bone
that city we are far from
 
is still frozen, still in ruins
except its symmetries be renewed
by sleep, its slant colors redeemed
 
nothing has changed but its name
and the air that it breathes
there's still no truth in making sense
 
while the ash settles, so fine that
planes keep falling from the sky
and the name once again to be the old one
 
saint something, saint gesture, saint entirely the same
as if nothing or no one had been nameless in the interim
or as if still could be placed beside storm
 
that simply, as in a poem
have you heard the angels with sexed tongues,
met the blind boy who could see with his skin,
 
his body curled inward like a phrase,
like an after in stillness or a letter erased
have you seen what's written on him
 
as question to an answer or calendar out of phase
add up the number of such days
add illness and lilt as formed on the tongue
 
add that scene identical with its negative,
that sentence which refuses to speak,
present which cannot be found



the bend in the river followed us for days
and above us the sun
doubled and redoubled its claims
 
now we are in a house
with forty-four walls
and nothing but doors
 
outside the trees, chokecherries, mulberries and oaks
are cracking like limbs
we can do nothing but listen
 
or so someone claims,
the ice man perhaps, all enclosed in ice
though the light has been shortening our days
 
and coloring nights the yellow of hay,
scarlet of trillium, blue of block ice
words appear, the texture of ice,
 
with messages etched on their shells
minna , big max and little sarah,
this hour ago
 
everyone watched as the statues fell
enough of such phrases and we'll have a book
enough of such books
 
and we'll have mountains of ice
enough to balance our days with nights
enough at last to close our eyes
 



it is scribbled along the body
impossible even to say a word
 
an alphabet has been stored beneath the ground
it is a practice alphabet, work of the hand
 
yet not, not marks inside a box
for example, this is a mirror box
 
spinoza designed such a box
and called it the eighth sky
 
called it the nevercadabra house
as a joke
 
yet not, not so much a joke
not notes for electronic harp
 
on a day free of sounds
but i meant to write clouds
 
at night these same boulevards fill with snow
lancers and dancers pass a poisoned syringe,
 
as you wrote, writing of death in the snow,
patroclus and a pharoah on rue ravignan
 
it is scribbled across each body
impossible even to name a word
 
look, you would say, how the sky falls
at first gently, then not at all
 
two chemicals within the firefly are the cause,
twin ships, twin nemeses
 
preparing to metamorphose
into an alphabet in stone

the book of company which
i put down and can't pick up
 
the trans-siberian disappearing,
the blue train and the shadow train
 
her body with ridges like my skull
two children are running through the lion cemetery
 
five travelers are crossing the lion bridge
a philosopher in a doorway insists
 
that there are no images
he whispers instead possible worlds
 
the mind-body problem
the tale of the color harpsichord
 
skeleton of the world's oldest horse
the ring of o dwindles
 
sizzling around the hole until gone
false spring is laughing at the snow
 
and just beyond each window
immense pines weighted with snow
 
a philosopher spreadeagled in the snow
holds out his third meditation
 
like a necrotic star. he whispers
archery is everywhere in decline,
 
photography the first perversion of our time
reach to the milky bottom of this pond
 
to know the feel of bone,
a knuckle from your grandfather's thumb,
 
the maternal clavicle, the familiar
arch of a brother's brow
 
he was your twin, no doubt,
forger of the unicursal maze
 
my dearest tania, when i get a good position in the courtyard
i study their faces through the haze
 
dear tania, don't be annoyed,
please, at these digressions
 
they are soldering the generals
back onto their pedestals
 
 
                                                                                                          for a. c.



yes, i was born on the street known as glass--as paper, scissors or rock.
 
several of my ancestors had no hands.
 
several of my ancestors used their pens
 
in odd ways.
 
a child of seven i prayed for breath.
 
each day i passed through the mirrored x
 
 
 
into droplets of rain congealed around dust.
 
i never regretted this situation.
 
though patient as an alchemist i failed to learn english.
 
twenty years later i burned all my furniture.
 
likewise the beams of my house
 
to fuel the furnace.
 
 
 
once i bought an old boat.
 
i abandoned the tyrannical book of my dreams
 
and wrote about dresses, jewels, furniture and menus
 
eight or ten times in a book of dreams.
 
it sets me to dreaming when i dust it off.
 
our time is a between time best to stay out of it.
 
 
 
send an occasional visiting card to eternity or a few stanzas to the living
 
so they won't suspect we know they don't exist.
 
sign them sincerely yours, warmest regards, thinking of you or
deepest regrets.
 
brown river outside my window, an old boat riding the current.
 
what i like most is to stay in my apartment.
 
so that is my life, pared of anecdotes.
 
 
 
i go out occasionally to look at a dance.
 
otherwise the usual joys, worries and inner mourning.
 
occasionally in an old boat i navigate the river
 
when i find the time.
 
water swallows the days.
 
i think maybe that's all
 
 
 
i have to say
 
except that an irregular heart sometimes speaks to me.
 
it says, a candle is consuming a children's alphabet.
 
it says, attend to each detail of the future-past.
 
last night the moon was divided precisely in half.
 
today a terrifying wind.
 



how did i get so old, 
i wonder, 
contemplating 
my th birthday. 
dyslexia smiles
i'm  in fact.

there are places 
where at  they start 
counting backwards 
in japan 
they start again 
from one.

but the numbers 
hardly matter. 
it's the physics 
of acceleration i mind, 
the way time speeds up 
as if it hasn't guessed

the destination-- 
where look 
i see my mother 
and father bearing a cake, 
waiting for me
at the starting line.

for it was the first day of rosh ha'shanah, new year's day, day of remembrance, of ancient sacrifices and averted calamities.
for i started the day by eating an apple dipped in honey, as ritual required.
for i went to the local synagogue to listen to the ram's horn blown.
for i asked our father, our king, to save us for his sake if not for ours, for the sake of his abundant mercies, for the sake of his right hand, for the sake of those who went through fire and water for the sanctification of his name.
for despite the use of a microphone and other gross violations of ceremony, i gave myself up gladly to the synagogue's sensual insatiable vast womb.
for what right have i to feel offended?
for i communed with my dead father, and a conspicuous tear rolled down my right cheek, and there was loud crying inside me.
for i understood how that tear could become an orb.
for the hebrew melodies comforted me.
for i lost my voice.
for i met a friend who asked is this a day of high seriousness and when i said yes he said it has taken your voice away.
for he was right, for i felt the strong lashes of the wind lashing me by the throat.
for i thought there shall come a day that the watchmen upon the hills of ephraim shall cry, arise and let us go up to zion unto the lord our god.
for the virgin shall rejoice in the dance, and the young and old in each other's arms, and their soul shall be as a watered garden, and neither shall they learn war any more.
for god shall lower the price of bread and corn and wine and oil, he shall let our cry come up to him.
for it is customary on the first day of rosh ha'shanah to cast a stone into the depths of the sea, to weep and pray to weep no more.
for the stone represents all the sins of the people.
for i asked you and molly to accompany me to cascadilla creek, there being no ocean nearby.
for we talked about the psalms of david along the way, and the story of hannah, mother of samuel, who sought the most robust bard to remedy her barrenness.
for isaac said i see the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for the offering?
for as soon as i saw the stone, white flat oblong and heavy, i knew that it had summoned me.
for i heard the voice locked inside that stone, for i pictured a dry wilderness in which, with a wave of my staff, i could command sweet waters to flow forth from that stone.
for i cast the stone into the stream and watched it sink to the bottom where dozens of smaller stones, all of them black, gathered around it.
for the waterfall performed the function of the chorus.
for after the moment of solemnity dissolved, you playfully tossed molly into the stream.
for you tossed her three times, and three times she swam back for her life.
for she shook the water off her body, refreshed.
for you removed the leash from her neck and let her roam freely.
for she darted off into the brush and speared a small gray moving thing in the neck.
for this was the work of an instant.
for we looked and behold the small gray thing was a rat.
for molly had killed the rat with a single efficient bite, in conformance with jewish law.
for i took the rat and cast him into the stream, and both of us congratulated molly.
for now she resumed her noble gait.
for she does not lie awake in the dark and weep for her sins, and whine about her condition, and discuss her duty to god.
for i'd as lief pray with your dog molly as with any man.
for she knows that god is her savior.
 


					
					i beg to dicker with my silver-tongued companion, whose lips are ready to read my shining gloss. a versatile partner, conversant and well-versed in the verbal art, the dictionary is not averse to the solitary habits of the curiously wide-awake reader. in the dark night's insomnia, the book is a stimulating sedative, awakening my tired imagination to the hypnagogic trance of language. retiring to the canopy of the bedroom, turning on the bedside light, taking the big dictionary to bed, clutching the unabridged bulk, heavy with the weight of all the meanings between these covers, smoothing the thin sheets, thick with accented syllables--all are exercises in the conscious regimen of dreamers, who toss words on their tongues while turning illuminated pages. to go through all these motions and procedures, groping in the dark for an alluring word, is the poet's nocturnal mission. aroused by myriad possibilities, we try out the most perverse positions in the practice of our nightly act, the penetration of the denotative body of the work. any exit from the logic of language might be an entry in a symptomatic dictionary. the alphabetical order of this ample block of knowledge might render a dense lexicon of lucid hallucinations. beside the bed, a pad lies open to record the meandering of migratory words. in the rapid eye movement of the poet's night vision, this dictum can be decoded, like the secret acrostic of a lover's name.


a black bear sits alone
in the twilight, nodding from side
to side, turning slowly around and around
on himself, scuffing the four-footed
circle into the earth. he sniffs the sweat
in the breeze, he understands
a creature, a death-creature,
watches from the fringe of the trees,
finally he understands
i am no longer here, he himself
from the fringe of the trees watches
a black bear
get up, eat a few flowers, trudge away,
all his fur glistening
in the rain.
 
and what glistening sancho fergus,
my boychild, had such great shoulders,
when he was born his head
came out, the rest of him stuck. and he opened
his eyes his head out there all alone
in the room, he squinted with pained,
barely unglued eyes at the ninth-month's
blood splashing beneath him
on the floor. and almost
smiled, i thought, almost forgave it all in advance.
 
when he came wholly forth
i took him up in my hands and bent
over and smelled
the black, glistening fur
of his head, as empty space
must have bent
over the newborn planet
and smelled the grasslands and the ferns.

for thomas
from the five good emperors
 i have learned that there were five good emperors,
  
 from the lemon tree i've planted
 now i know that leaves unpummeled yet will drop,
  
 from the clock, the time, it's five p.m.,
 from the sun the length of day,
  
 from quercus borealis, the queer names of the leaves
 of all the trees,
  
 from burning i've learned burning,
 from the aster family chickory abounds,
  
 from hawkweed of the colors bright,
 from sleeping, of my dreams,
  
 from mosquitoes, scratching, from fishes, fishing,
 from turkeys how to run and how to hop,
  
 from erect perennials i've learned to reach the shelf,
 from my cats to lick the dark part of the tin,
  
 from the sparrows i've learned this and that,
 from germanic tribes, to gather thoughts in herds,
  
 from the window blinds, from the sun decayed,
 from the heart, a brimming record braised and turned.



on this most perfect hill
 with these most perfect dogs
 are these most perfect people
 and this most perfect fog
  
 in this most perfect fog
 that is the middle of the sea
 inside the perfect middle of
 the things inside that swing
  
 in this most perfect rhyme
 that takes up what it sees,
 with perfect shelter from the 
 rain as perfect as can be,
  
 in this most perfect day
 at the apex of the sun
 runs this most perfect
 frog song that is roiling
 from the mud
  
 in these most perfect habits
 of the waving of the trees,
 through this imperfect language
 rides a perfect brilliancy.



for brad gooch
we snort all our coke
 on the way to the party.
 we bring the new album.
 we dance while we listen.
  
 the band is two women
 whose husbands control them.
 they do not speak our language.
 each syllable's an obstacle.
  
 they are in love with a man.
 he is in love with another.
 but they're in no hurry.
 they could wait forever.
  
 and when they are out
 on the make for a lover,
 they'll always find him.
 they are the tigers.
  
 we are stoned too stoned to.
 we dance till we're tired
 and listen to lyrics
 we mouth like a language.
  
 what we feel, when we
 hear them, is inexpressible.
 we can't put into words.
 maybe our dances show it.
  
 abba lives for their music.
 we long for each other.
 they see what we're doing.
 they put it on record.
  
 they play it, we listen.
 we are absolutely stunned.
 we feel, and they know
 more than anyone can say.



the scene changes
  
 five hours later and
 i come into a room
 where a clock ticks.
 i find a pillow to 
 muffle the sounds i make.
 i am engaged in taking away
 from god his sound.
 the pigeons somewhere
 above me, the cough
 a man makes down the hall,
 the flap of wings
 below me, the squeak
 of sparrows in the alley.
 the scratches i itch
 on my scalp, the landing
 of birds under the bay
 window out my window.
 all dull details 
 i can only describe to you,
 but which are here and 
 i hear and shall never
 give up again, shall carry
 with me over the streets
 of this seacoast city,
 forever oh clack your
 metal wings, god, you are
 mine now in the morning.
 i have you by the ears
 in the exhaust pipes of
 a thousand cars gunning
 their motors turning over
 all over town.

i sit in lees. at  pm with
 jimmy the pusher. he teaches me 
 ju ju. hot on the table before us
 shrimp foo yong, rice and mushroom
 chow yuke. up the street under the wheels
 of a strange car is his stash--the ritual.
 we make it. and have made it.
 for months now together after midnight.
 soon i know the fuzz will
 interrupt, will arrest jimmy and 
 i shall be placed on probation. the poem
 does not lie to us. we lie under
 its law, alive in the glamour of this hour
 able to enter into the sacred places
 of his dark people, who carry secrets
 glassed in their eyes and hide words
 under the coats of their tongue.

our age bereft of nobility
         how can our faces show it?
 i look for love.
         my lips stand out
 dry and cracked with want
                                      of it.
                                     oh it is well.
 my poem shall show the need for it.
  
                         again we go driven by forces
        we have no control over. only
                                                     in the poem
       comes an image that we rule
                       the line by the pen
 in the painter's hand one foot 
                               away from me.
  
                               drawing the face
                               and its torture.
 that is why no one dares tackle it.
                     held as they are in the hands
                                 of forces they
                     cannot understand.
                                                        that despair
         is on my face and shall show
         in the fine lines of any man.
  
 i had love once in the palm of my hand.
 see the lines there.
                                       how we played
 its game, are playing now
 in the bounds of white and heartless fields.
  
 fall down on my head, love,
 drench my flesh in the streams 
                                 of fine sprays. like
                                        french perfume
 so that i light up as
                                      mountain glorys
 and i am showered by the scent
                           of the finished line.
  
                                              no circles
                        but that two parallels do cross
 and carry our souls and bodies
        together as the planets,
                      showing light on the surface
                             of our skin, knowing
                      that so much of it flows through
                            the veins underneath.
                      our cheeks puffed with it.
                            the pockets full.
  
  
                                .
  
 pushed on by the incompletion
               of what goes before me
 i hesitate before this paper
               scratching for the right words.
  
 paul klee scratched for seven years
               on smoked glass, to develop
               his line, lavigne says, look
 at his face he who has spent 
              all night drawing mine.
  
        the sun also
 rises on the rooftops, beginning
 w violet. i begin in blue
 knowing why we are cool.
  
  
                                 .
  
 my middle name is joseph and i
 walk beside an ass on the way to what
 bethlehem, where a new babe is born.
  
        not the second hand of yeats but 
        first prints on a cloudy windowpane.
  
 america, you boil over
  
  
                                  .
  
        the cauldron scalds.
        flesh is scarred. 
        eyes shot.
  
        the street aswarm with 
        vipers and heavy armed bandits.
        there are bandages on the wounds
        but blood flows unabated. the bath-
        rooms are full. oh stop up
                                                       the drains.
                               we are run over.
  
  
                                   .
  
 let me ramble here.
 yet stay within my own yardlines.
 i go out of bounds
             without defense,
 oh attack.
  
  
                                    . 
  
    at last the game is over
                                              and the line lengthens.
    let us stay with what we know.
  
 that love is my strength, that
 i am overpowered by it
                                         desire
                                                   that too
 is on the face gone stale.
 when green was the bed my love
 and i laid down upon.
 such it is, heart's complaint,
 you hear upon a day in june.
 and i see no end in view
 when summer goes, as it will,
 upon the roads, like singing
 companions across the land.
  
 go with it man, if you must, 
 but leave us markers on your way.
  
 south of mission, seattle,
 over the sierra mountains,
 the middle west and michigan,
 moving east again, easy
 coming into chicago and
 the cattle country, calling
 to each other over canyons,
 careful not to be caught
 at night, they are still out,
 the destroyers, and down
 into the south, familiar land,
 lush places, blue mountains
 of carolina, into black mountain
 and you can sleep out, or
 straight across into states
  
 i cannot think of their names.
  
 this nation is so large, like
 our hands, our love it lives
 with no lover, looking only
 for the beloved, back home
 into the heart, new york,
 new england, vermont green
 mountains, and massachusetts
 my city, boston and the sea.
 again to smell what this calm
 ocean cannot tell us. the seasons.
 only the heart remembers
 and records in words
 of works
 we lay down for those men
 who can come to them.
  
  
                                     .
  
 at last. i come to the last defense.
  
 my poems contain no 
                      wilde beestes, no
 lady of the lake music
 of the spheres, or organ chants,
  
 yet by these lines
 i betray what little given me.
  
 one needs no defense.
  
              only the score of a man's
              struggle to stay  with
              what is his own, what
              lies within him to do.
  
              without which is nothing,
              for him or those who hear him
              and i come to this,
              knowing the waste, leaving 
  
              the rest up to love
              and its twisted faces
              my hands claw out at
              only to draw back from the
              blood already running there.
  
              oh come back, whatever heart
              you have left. it is my life
              you save. the poem is done.

god love you
    dana my lover
 lost in the horde
 on this friday night,
  men are moving up
 & down from the bath
 room to the bar.
 remove this desire
 from the man i love.
 who has opened
    the savagery 
 of the sea to me.
  
 see to it that 
 his wants are filled
 on california street
 bestow on him lar-
 gesse that allows him
 peace in his loins.
  
 leave him not
 to the moths.
 make him out a lion
 so that all who see him
 hero worship his
 thick chest as i did
 moving my mouth
 over his back bringing
 our hearts to heights
 i never hike over
    anymore.
 let blond hair burn
 on the back of his
 neck, let no ache
 screw his face
 up in pain, his soul
    is so hooked.
 not heroin.
 rather fix these
 hundred men as his
 lovers & lift him
 with the enormous bale
 of their desire.
  
 ..



for i have seen love
 and his face is choice heart of hearts,
 a flesh of pure fire, fusing from the center
 where all motion is one.
  
 and i have known
 despair that the face has ceased to stare 
 at me with the rose of the world
 but lies furled
  
 in an artificial paradise it is hell to get into.
 if i knew you were there
 i would fall upon my knees and plead to god
 to deliver you in my arms once again.
  
 but it is senseless to try.
 one can only take means to reduce misery,
 confuse the sensations so that this face,
 what aches in the heart and makes each new
  
 start less close to the source of desire,
 fade from the flesh that fires the night,
 with dreams and infinite longing.



yes i put her away.
       but now life flares up
    as safe as china in a cup
    you hear the droppings
              of her heart.
  
    leaves rustle on the windowpane.
 three o'clock turns round again.
 the man in the moon grows full
 of her death while earth awaits
    beneath
 to receive her ashes on the wind.
  
        yes, earth owns the wind
        as i her life
        whom i have never seen
        nor been with
 still within our hearts there lies
           this communion
              of all that dies
    we held in common
    because without it
  
 we become more common than the dust.
  
  
                             .
  
 clay cannot create her features
 nor mirror reveal her mouth
  
 photograph not show her form
 full with self, so put away
  
 her picture from the shelf
 and turn instead to living
  
 woman on the couch, decked with flowers
 as if it were she laid out,
  
 and not sylvia, in the woods.
  
  
                              .
  

address to the woman
 
 tell her that may not rise again
 she sings still in our breath.
  
 tell her that may not breathe again
 she moves yet beneath the moon.
  
 tell her that may not weave again
 her hands are dawns within our eyes.
  
 tell her that may not speak again
 her words are warnings in the wood.



o poetry, visit this house often,
 imbue my life with success,
 leave me not alone,
 give me a wife and home.
  
 take this curse off
 of early death and drugs,
 make me a friend among peers,
 lend me love, and timeliness.
  
 return me to the men who teach
 and above all, cure the 
 hurts of wanting the impossible
 through this suspended vacuum.
  




to somes
  
 from incarceration, taunton state hospital, 
  
 gaunt, ugly deformed
  
 broken from the womb, and horribly shriven
 at the labor of their forefathers, if you check back
  
 scout around grey before actual time
 their sordid brains don't work right,
 pinched men emaciated, piling up railroad ties and highway
 ditches
 blanched women, swollen and crudely numb
 ered before the dark of dawn
  
 scuttling by candlelight, one not to touch, that is, a signal panic
 thick peasants after the attitude
  
 at that time of their century, bleak and centrifugal
 they carry about them, tough disciplines of copper indianheads.
  
 there are worse, whom you may never see, non-crucial around the
 spoke, these you do, seldom
 locked in taunton state hospital and other peon work farms
 drudge from morning until night, abandoned within destitute
 crevices odd clothes
 intent on performing some particular task long has been far
 removed
 there is no hope, they locked-in key's housed of course
  
 and there fed, poorly
 off sooted, plastic dishes, soiled grimy silver knives and forks,
 stamped department of mental health spoons
 but the unshrinkable duties of any society
 produces its ill-kempt, ignorant and sore idiosyncrasies.
  
 there has never been a man yet, whom no matter how wise
 can explain how a god, so beautiful he can create
 the graces of formal gardens, the exquisite twilight sunsets
 in splendor of elegant toolsmiths, still can yield the horror of
  
 dwarfs, who cannot stand up straight with crushed skulls,
 diseases on their legs and feet unshaven faces of men and women,
 worn humped backs, deformed necks, hare lips, obese arms
 distended rumps, there is not a flame shoots out could ex-
 tinguish the torch of any liberty's state infection.
  
 , my mother was born, i am witness t-
 o the exasperation of gallant human beings at g-
 od, priestly fathers and her highness, holy mother the church
 persons who felt they were never given a chance, had n-
 o luck and were flayed at suffering.
  
 they produced children with phobias, manias and depression,
 they cared little for their own metier, and kept watch upon
 others, some chance to get ahead
  
 yes life was hard for them, much more hard than for any blo
 ated millionaire, who still lives on
 their hard-earned monies. i feel i shall
 have to be punished for writing this,
 that the omniscient god is the rich one,
 cared little for looks, less for art,
 still kept weekly films close for the
 free dishes and scandal hot. some how
 though got cheated in health and upon
 hearth. i am one of them. i am witness
 not to whitman's vision, but instead the 
 poorhouses, the mad city asylums and re-
 life worklines. yes, i am witness not to 
 god's goodness, but his better or less scorn.

like a woman hurrying to her lover
night comes to the room of the world
and lies, yielding and content
against the cool round face
of the moon.

night is a curious child, wandering
between earth and sky, creeping
in windows and doors, daubing
the entire neighborhood
with purple paint.

night's brittle song, sliver-thin
shatters into a billion fragments
of quiet shadows
at the blaring jazz
of a morning sun. 
 


inventing a horse is not easy.
one must not only think of the horse.
one must dig fence posts around him.
one must include a place where horses like to live
 
or do when they live with humans like you.
slowly, you must walk him in the cold
feed him bran mash, apples
accustom him to the harness
 
holding in mind even when you are tired
harnesses and tack cloths and saddle oil
to keep the saddle clean as a face in the sun
one must imagine teaching him to run
 
among the knuckles of tree roots,
not to be skittish at first sight of timber wolves,
and not to grow thin in the city,
where at some point you will have to live
 
and one must imagine the absence of money.
most of all, though the living weight,
the sound of his feet on the needles,
and, since he is heavy, and real,
 
and sometimes tired after a run
down the river with a light whip at his side,
one must imagine love
in the mind that does not know love,
 
an animal mind, a love that does not depend
on your image of it,
your understanding of it
indifferent to all that it lacks
 
a muzzle and two black eyes
looking the day away, a field empty
of everything but witchgrass, fluent trees,
and some piles of hay.


i have walked through many lives,
some of them my own,
and i am not who i was,
though some principle of being
abides, from which i struggle
not to stray.
when i look behind,
as i am compelled to look
before i can gather strength
to proceed on my journey,
i see the milestones dwindling
toward the horizon
and the slow fires trailing
from the abandoned camp-sites,
over which scavenger angels
wheel on heavy wings.
oh, i have made myself a tribe
out of my true affections,
and my tribe is scattered
how shall the heart be reconciled
to its feast of losses?
in a rising wind
the manic dust of my friends,
those who fell along the way,
bitterly stings my face.
yet i turn, i turn,
exulting somewhat,
with my will intact to go
wherever i need to go,
and every stone on the road
precious to me.
in my darkest night,
when the moon was covered
and i roamed through wreckage,
a nimbus-clouded voice
directed me
live in the layers,
not on the litter.
though i lack the art
to decipher it,
no doubt the next chapter
in my book of transformations
is already written.
i am not done with my changes.


an agitation of the air,
a perturbation of the light
admonished me the unloved year
would turn on its hinge that night.
 
i stood in the disenchanted field
amid the stubble and the stones,
amazed, while a small worm lisped to me
the song of my marrow-bones.
 
blue poured into summer blue,
a hawk broke from his cloudless tower,
the roof of the silo blazed, and i knew
that part of my life was over.
 
already the iron door of the north
clangs open birds, leaves, snows
order their populations forth,
and a cruel wind blows.
 


the last full moon of february
stalks the fields barbed wire casts a shadow.
rising slowly, a beam moved toward the west
stealthily changing position
 
until now, in the small hours, across the snow
it advances on my pillow
to wake me, not rudely like the sun
but with the cocked gun of silence.
 
i am alone in a vast room
where a vain woman once slept.
the moon, in pale buckskins, crouches
on guard beside her bed.
 
slowly the light wanes, the snow will melt
and all the fences thrum in the spring breeze
but not until that sleeper, trapped
in my body, turns and turns. 
 


tonight is a drunk man, 
his dirty shirt.

there is no couple chatting by the recycling bins, 
offering to help me unload my plastics.

there is not even the black and white cat 
that balances elegantly on the lip of the dumpster.

there is only the smell of sour breath. sweat on the collar of my shirt. 
a water bottle rolling under a car. 
me in my too-small pajama pants stacking juice jugs on neighbors' juice jugs.

i look to see if there is someone drinking on their balcony. 

i tell myself i will wave.


i drove to oak park, took two tours,
 and looked at some of the houses.
 i took the long way back along the lake.
 the place that i came home to--a cavernous
 apartment on the east side of milwaukee--
 seems basically a part of that tradition,
 with the same admixture of expansion and restraint
 the space takes off, yet leaves behind a nagging
 feeling of confinement, with the disconcerting sense
 that while the superficial conflicts got resolved,
 the underlying tensions brought to equilibrium,
 it isn't yet a place in which i feel that i can live.
 imagine someone reading. contemplate a man
 oblivious to his settings, and then a distant person
 standing in an ordinary room, hemmed in by limitations,
 yet possessed by the illusion of an individual life
 that blooms within its own mysterious enclosure,
 in a solitary space in which the soul can breathe
 and where the heart can stay--not by discovering it,
 but by creating it, by giving it a self-sustaining
 atmosphere of depth, both in the architecture,
 and in the unconstructed life that it contains.
 in a late and very brief remark, freud speculates
 that space is the projection of a psychic apparatus
 which remains almost entirely oblivious to itself
 and wright extols that primitive sense of shelter
 which can turn a house into a refuge from despair.
 i wish that time could bring the future back again
 and let me see things as they used to seem to me
 before i found myself alone, in an emancipated state--
 alone and free and filled with cares about tomorrow.
 there used to be a logic in the way time passed
 that made it flow directly towards an underlying space
 where all the minor, individual lives converged.
 the moments borrowed their perceptions from the past
 and bathed the future in a soft, familiar light
 i remembered from home, and which has faded.
 and the voices get supplanted by the rain,
 the nights seem colder, and the angel in the mind
 that used to sing to me beneath the wide suburban sky
 turns into dreamwork and dissolves into the air,
 while in its place a kind of monument appears,
 magnificent in isolation, compromised by proximity
 and standing in a small and singular expanse--
 as though the years had been a pretext for reflection,
 and my life had been a phase of disenchantment--
 as the faces that i cherished gradually withdraw,
 the reassuring settings slowly melt away,
 and what remains is just a sense of getting older.
 in a variation of the parable, the pure of heart
 descend into a kingdom that they never wanted
 and refused to see. the homely notions of the good,
 the quaint ideas of perfection swept away like
 adolescent fictions as the real forms of life
 deteriorate with manically increasing speed,
 the kind man wakes into a quiet dream of shelter,
 and the serenity it brings--not in reflection,
 but in the paralyzing fear of being mistaken,
 of losing everything, of acquiescing in the
 obvious approach the house shaped like a box
 the life that can't accommodate another's--
 as the heart shrinks down to tiny, local things.
  
 why can't the more expansive ecstasies come true?
 i met you more than thirty years ago, in ,
 in mrs. wolford's eighth grade history class.
 all moments weigh the same, and matter equally
 yet those that time brings back create the fables
 of a happy or unsatisfying life, of minutes
 passing on the way to either peace or disappointment--
 like a paper calendar on which  it's always autumn
 and we're back in school again or a hazy afternoon
 near the beginning of october, with the world series
 playing quietly on the radio, and the windows open,
 and the california sunlight filling up the room.
 when i survey the mural stretched across the years
 --across my heart--i notice mostly small, neglected
 parts of no importance to the whole design, but which,
 in their obscurity, seem more permanent and real.
 i see the desks and auditorium, suffused with
 yellow light connoting earnestness and hope that
 still remains there, in a space pervaded by a 
 soft and supple ache too deep to contemplate--
 as though the future weren't real, and the present
 were amorphous, with nothing to hold on to,
 and the past were there forever. and the art
 that time inflicts upon its subjects can't 
 eradicate the lines sketched out in childhood, 
 which harden into shapes as it recedes.
 i wish i knew a way of looking at the world
 that didn't find it wanting, or of looking at my
 life that didn't always see a half-completed
 structure made of years and filled with images
 and gestures emblematic of the past, like gatsby's
 light, or proust's imbalance on the stones.
 i wish there were a place where i could stay
 and leave the world alone--an enormous stadium
 where i could wander back and forth across a field
 replete with all the incidents and small details
 that gave the days their textures, that bound the
 minutes into something solid, and that linked them
 all together in a way that used to seem eternal.
 we used to go to dances in my family's ancient
 cadillac, which blew up late one summer evening
 climbing up the hill outside del mar. and later
 i can see us steaming off the cover of the beatles'
 baby-butcher album at your house in mission bay
 and three years later listening to the velvet
 underground performing in a roller skating rink.
 years aren't texts, or anything like texts
 and yet i often think of  that way, as though
 that single year contained the rhythms of the rest,
 as what began in hope and eagerness concluded in
 intractable confusion, as the wedding turned into a
 puzzling fiasco over poor john godfrey's hair.
 the parts were real, and yet the dense and living
 whole they once composed seems broken now, its
 voice reduced to disembodied terms that speak to me
 more distantly each day, until the tangled years
 are finally drained of feeling, and collapse into a 
 sequence of the places where we lived your parents'
 house in kensington, and mine above the canyon
 then the flat by sears in cambridge, where we
 moved when we got married, and the third floor
 of the house on francis avenue, near harvard square
 the big apartment in milwaukee where we lived the 
 year that john was born, and last of all the
 house in whitefish bay, where you live now
 and all those years came inexplicably undone
 in mid-july. the sequence ended late last year.
 suppose we use a lifetime as a measure of the world
 as it exists for one. then half of mine has ended,
 while the fragment which has recently come to be
 contains no vantage point from which to see it whole.
 i think that people are the sum of their illusions,
 that the cares that make them difficult to see
 are eased by distance, with their errors blending
 in an intricate harmony, their truths abiding 
 in a subtle spark or psyche each incomparable,
 yet each the same as all the others and their
 disparate careers all joined together in a tangled
 moral vision whose intense, meandering design
 seems lightened by a pure simplicity of feeling,
 as in grief, or in the pathos of a life
 cut off by loneliness, indifference or hate,
 because the most important thing is human happiness--
 not in the sense of private satisfactions, but of
 lives that realize themselves in ordinary terms
 and with the quiet inconsistencies that make them real.
 the whole transcends its tensions, like the intimate
 reflections on the day that came at evening, whose
 significance was usually overlooked, or misunderstood,
 because the facts were almost always unexceptional.
 two years ago we took our son to paris. last night
 i picked him up and took him to a lou reed show,
 and then took him home. i look at all the houses as i
 walk down hackett avenue to work. i teach my classes,
 visit friends, cook introspective meals for myself,
 yet in the end the minutes don't add up. what's lost
 is the perception of the world as something good
 and held in common as a place to be perfected
 in the kinds of everyday divisions and encounters
 that endowed it with integrity and structure,
 and that merged its private moments with the past.
 what broke it into pieces? what transformed the 
 flaws that gave it feeling into objects of a deep and
 smoldering resentment--like coming home too early,
 or walking too far ahead of you on the rue jacob?
 i wish that life could be a window on the sun,
 instead of just this porch where i can stand and
 contemplate the wires that lace the parking lot
 and feel it moving towards some unknown resolution.
 the guggenheim museum just reopened. tonight i
 watched a segment of the news on pbs--narrated by a 
 woman we met years ago at bob's--that showed how
 most of wright's interior had been restored,
 and how the ramp ascends in spirals towards the sky.
 i like the houses better--they flow in all directions,
 merging with the scenery and embodying a milder,
 more domestic notion of perfection, on a human scale
 that doesn't overwhelm the life that it encloses.
 isn't there a way to feel at home within the
 confines of this bland, accommodating structure
 made of souvenirs and emblems, like the hammock
 hanging in the backyard of an undistinguished
 prairie school house in whitefish bay--the lineal,
 reduced descendant of the flameproof wright house
 just a block or two away from where i live now?
 i usually walk along the street on sunday,
 musing on how beautiful it seems, how aspects of it
 recapitulate the oak park house and studio, with
 open spaces buried in a labyrinthine interior,
 and with the entrance half-concealed on the side--
 a characteristic feature of his plans that made it
 difficult to find, although the hope was that in
 trying to get inside, the visitor's eye would come to 
 linger over subtleties he might have failed to see--
 in much the way that in the course of getting older,
 and trying to reconstruct the paths that led me here,
 i found myself pulled backwards through these old,
 uncertain passages, distracted by the details,
 and meeting only barriers to understanding why the
 years unfolded as they did, and why my life
 turned out the way it has--like his signature
 pathway of discovery, with each diversion
 adding to the integrity of the whole.
  
 there is this sweep life has that makes the 
 accidents of time and place seem small.
 everything alters, and the personal concerns 
 that love could hold together for a little while
 decay, and then the world seems strange again,
 and meaningless and free. i miss the primitive
 confusions, and the secret way things came to me
 each evening, and the pain. i still wonder
 where the tears went, standing in my room each day
 and quietly inhabiting a calm, suspended state
 enveloped by the emptiness that scares and thrills me,
 with the background noise cascading out of nothing
 like a song that makes the days go by, a song
 incorporating everything--not into what it says,
 but simply in the way it touches me, a single
 image of dispersal, the inexhaustible perception
 of contingency and transience and isolation.
 it brings them back to me. i have the inwardness
 i think i must have wanted, and the quietude,
 the solitary temper, and this space where i can
 linger with the silence curling all around me
 like the sound of pure passage, waiting here
 surrounded by the furniture, the books and lists
 and all these other emblems of the floating world,
 the prints of raindrops that begin as mist, that fall
 discreetly through the atmosphere, and disappear.
 and then i feel them in the air, in a reserved,
 more earthly music filled with voices reassembling
 in a wellspring of remembrance, talking to me again,
 and finding shelter in the same evasive movements
 i can feel in my own life, cloaked in a quiet
 dignity that keeps away the dread of getting old,
 and fading out of other people's consciousness,
 and dying with its deepest insecurities and fears
 concealed by their own protective colorations,
 as the mind secretes its shell and calls it home.
 it has the texture of an uncreated substance,
 hovering between the settings it had come to love
 and some unformulated state i can't imagine--
 waiting for the telephone to ring, obsessed with 
 ways to occupy these wide, unstructured hours,
 and playing records by myself, and waking up alone.
 all things are disparate, yet subject to the same
 intense, eradicating wills of time and personality,
 like waves demolishing the walls love seemed to build
 between our lives and emptiness, the certainty they
 seemed to have just two or three short years ago,
 before the anger spread its poison over everything.
 i think about the way our visions locked together
 in a nightmare play of nervousness and language,
 living day to day inside the concentrated
 force of that relentless argument, whose words
 swept over us in formless torrents of anxiety, two
 people clinging to their versions of their lives
 almost like children--living out each other's
 intermittent fantasies, that fed upon themselves
 as though infected by some vile, concentrated hatred
 who then woke up and planned that evening's dinner.
 it's all memories now, and distance. miles away
 the cat is sleeping on the driveway, john's in school,
 and sunlight filters through a curtain in the kitchen.
 nothing really changes--the external world intrudes
 and then withdraws, and then becomes continuous again.
 i went downtown today and got a lamp with pendant
 lanterns made of opalescent art glass--part, i guess,
 of what this morning's paper called the wright craze.
 i like the easy way the days go by, the parts of aging
 that have come to seem familiar, and the uneventful
 calm that seems to settle on the house at night.
 each morning brings the mirror's reassuring face,
 as though the years had left the same enduring person
 simplified and changed--no longer vaguely desperate,
 no longer torn, yet still impatient with himself
 and still restless but drained of intricacy and rage,
 like a mild paradox--uninteresting in its own right,
 yet existing for the sake of something stranger.
 now and then our life comes over me, in brief,
 involuntary glimpses of that world that blossom
 unexpectedly, in fleeting moments of regret
 that come before the ache, the pang that gathers
 sharply, like an indrawn breath--a strange and 
 thoughtful kind of pain, as though a steel
 band had somehow snapped inside my heart.
 i don't know. but what i do know is that 
 none of it is ever going to come to me again.
 why did i think a person only distantly like me
 might finally represent my life? what aspects
 of my attitudes, my cast of mind, my inconclusive
 way of tossing questions at the world had i
 supposed might realize another person's fantasies
 and turn her into someone else--who gradually became
 a separate part of me, and argued with the very 
 words i would have used, and looked at me through
 eyes i'd looked at as though gazing at myself?
 i guess we only realize ourselves in dreams,
 or in these self-reflexive reveries sustaining
 all the charms that contemplation holds--until the
 long enchantment of the soul with what it sees
 is lifted, and it startles at a space alight with
 objects of its infantile gaze, like people in a mall.
 i saw her just the other day. i felt a kind of 
 comfort at her face, one tinctured with bemusement
 at the strange and guarded person she'd become--
 attractive, vaguely friendly, brisk too brisk,
 but no one i could think might represent my life.
 why did i even try to see myself in what's outside?
 the strangeness pushes it away, propels the vision
 back upon itself, into these regions filled with 
 shapes that i can wander through and never see,
 as though their image were inherently unreal.
 the houses on a street, the quiet backyard shade,
 the room restored to life with bric-a-brac--
 i started by revisiting these things, then slowly
 reconceiving them as forms of loss made visible
 that balanced sympathy and space inside an
 abstract edifice combining reaches of the past
 with all these speculations, all this artful
 preening of the heart. i sit here at my desk,
 perplexed and puzzled, teasing out a tangled
 skein of years we wove together, and trying to
 combine the fragments of those years into a poem.
 who cares if life--if someone's actual life--is
 finally insignificant and small? there's still a
 splendor in the way it flowers once and fades
 and leaves a carapace behind. there isn't time to
 linger over why it happened, or attempt to make its
 mystery come to life again and last, like someone
 still embracing the confused perceptions of himself
 embedded in the past, as though eternity lay there--
 for heaven's a delusion, and eternity is in the details,
 and this tiny, insubstantial life is all there is.
 --and that would be enough, but for the reoccurring
 dreams i often have of you. sometimes at night
 the banished unrealities return, as though a room
 suffused with light and poetry took shape around me.
 pictures line the walls. it's early summer.
 somewhere in remembrance of things past, marcel,
 reflecting on his years with albertine--with x--
 suggests that love is just a consciousness of distance,
 of the separation of two lives in time and space.
 i think the same estrangement's mirrored in each life,
 in how it seems both adequate and incomplete--part
 day-to-day existence, part imaginary construct
 beckoning at night, and sighing through my dreams
 like some disconsolate chimera, or the subject
 of a lonely, terrifying sadness or the isolation
 of a quiet winter evening, when the house feels empty,
 and silence intervenes. but in the wonderful
 enclosure opening in my heart, i seem to recognize
 our voices lilting in the yard, inflected by the
 rhythms of a song whose words are seamless
 and whose lines are never-ending. i can almost
 see the contours of your face, and sense the
 presence of the trees, and reimagine all of us
 together in a deep, abiding happiness, as if the
 three of us inhabited a fragile, made-up world
 that seemed to be so permanent, so real.
 i have this fantasy it's early in the evening.
 you and i are sitting in the backyard, talking.
 friends arrive, then drinks and dinner, conversation
  
 the lovely summer twilight lasts forever
  
                                        what's the use?
 what purpose do these speculations serve? what
 mild enchantments do these meditations leave?
 they're just the murmurs of an age, of middle age,
 that help to pass the time that they retrieve
 before subsiding, leaving everything unchanged.
 each of us at times has felt the future fade,
 or seen the compass of his life diminished,
 or realized some tangible illusion was unreal.
 driving down to evanston last week, i suddenly 
 remembered driving down that road eight years ago,
 so caught up in some story i'd just finished
 that i'd missed the way the countryside was changing--
 how in place of trees there now were office towers
 and theme parks, parts of a confusingly panoply of
 barns and discount malls transfiguring a landscape
 filled with high, receding clouds and rows of flimsy
 houses in what used to be a field. i thought of
 other people's lives, and how impossible it seemed
 to grasp them on the model of my own--as little
 mirrors of infinity--or sense their forms of 
 happiness, or in their minor personal upheavals
 feel the sweep of time reduced to human scale
 and see its abstract argument made visible.
 i thought of overarching dreams of plenitude--
 how life lacks shape until it's given one by love,
 and how each soul is both a kingdom in itself
 and part of some incorporating whole that
 feels and has a face and lets it live forever.
 all of these seemed true, and cancelled one another,
 leaving just the feeling of an unseen presence
 tracing out the contours of a world erased,
like music tracing out the contours of the mind--
 for life has the form of a winding curve in space
 and in its wake the human figure disappears.
 look at our surroundings--where a previous age
 could visualize a landscape we see borders,
 yet i think the underlying vision is the same
 a person positing a world that he can see
 and can't contain, and vexed by other people.
 everything is possible some of it seemed real
 or nearly real, yet in the end it spoke to me alone,
 in phrases echoing the isolation of a meager
 ledge above a waterfall, or rolling across a vast,
 expanding plain on which there's always room,
 but only room for one. it starts and ends
 inside an ordinary room, while in the interim
 brimming with illusions, filled with commonplace
 delights that make the days go by, with simple
 arguments and fears, and with the nervous
 inkling of some vague, utopian conceit
 transforming both the landscape and our lives,
 until we look around and find ourselves at home,
 but in a wholly different world. and even those 
 catastrophes that seemed to alter everything
 seem fleeting, grounded in a natural order
 all of us are subject to, and ought to celebrate.
 --yet why? that things are temporary doesn't 
 render them unreal, unworthy of regretting.
 it's not as though the past had never happened
 all those years were real, and their loss was real,
 and it is sad--i don't know what else to call it.
 i'm glad that both of us seem happy. yet what
 troubles me is just the way what used to be a world
 turned out, in retrospect, to be a state of mind,
 and no more tangible than that. and now it's gone,
 and in its place i find the image of a process
 of inexorable decay, or of some great unraveling
 that drags the houses forward into emptiness
 and backwards into pictures of the intervening days
 love pieced together out of nothing. and i'm
 certain that this austere vision finally is true,
 and yet it strikes me as too meager to believe.
 it comes from much too high above the world
 and seems to me too hopeless, too extreme--
 but then i found myself one winter afternoon
 remembering a quiet morning in a classroom
 and inventing everything again, in ordinary
 terms that seemed to comprehend a childish
 dream of love, and then the loss of love,
 and all the intricate years between. 
 


having been blown away
by a book
i am in the gutter
at the end of the street
in little pieces
like the alphabet
mother do not worry
letters are not flesh
though there's meaning in them
but not when they are mean
my letters to you were mean
i found them after you died
and read them and tore them up
and fed them to the wind
thank you for intruding
i love you now leave
also at the end of the street
there is a magnolia tree
the white kind
that tatters
after it blooms
so the tree winds up
in the street
our naked shivering bodies
must be at some distance
missing us    come back
come back they cry
come home
put down that book
whenever you read
you drift away on a raft
you like your parrot
more than you like me
and stuff like that
dear father
you always were a bore
but i loved you more
than interesting things
and in your honor
i've felt the same about myself
and everyone i've ever met
i like to read in tree houses
whenever i can    which is seldom
and sometimes never
the book that blew me away
held all the problems
of the world
and those of being alive
under my nose
but i felt far away from them
at the same time
reading is like that
i am sorry i did not
go to your funeral
but like you said
on the phone
an insect cannot crawl
to china
here at the end of the street
the insects go on living
under the dome
of the pacific sky
if mary and joseph
had walked the sixty miles
to bethlehem vertically
they would have found
themselves floating
in the outer pitch of space
it would have been cold
no inns
a long night
in the dark endless
and when they began to cry
the whole world would think
something had just been born
i like to read into things
as i am continually borne forward
in time by the winds like the snow
dear sister
you were perfect in every way
like a baby
please tell brother
the only reason
we never spoke
was out of our great love
for each other
which made a big wind
that blew us apart
i think i am coming back
i feel shoulders
where a parrot could land
though a tree would be
as good a place as any
you cannot teach a tree to talk
trees can say    it is spring
but not    though bright sunlight
can also be very sad
have you noticed?


women who lie alone at midnight
because there is no one else to lie to

women who lie alone at midnight
at noon in the laundromat
destroying their own socks

women who lie alone at midnight
hans brinker, or the silver skates

women who lie alone at midnight
as the first furl of starlight
pearls the moon with nacre

women who lie alone at midnight
sending a postcard bearing
the face of a bawling infant
who cries i am for the new

women who lie alone at midnight
reciting the names of shoes

women who lie alone at midnight
spurting unjustified tears,
the kind that run sideways
never reaching the mouth,
the kind you cannot swallow

women who lie alone at midnight
singing breast away the burden of my tender
and afterwards burp

women who lie alone at midnight
obeying the laws of physics
women who let their dreams curl at the end
women in a monastery of flamingos

women who die alone at midnight
contributing to the end, to 
lost time, to the rain and flies,
seeing the bird they saw trapped in the airport
surviving by the water fountain

what's more, try it sometime
it works


god put his finger on my sacrum
and he lifted me, he set me
in the center of the universe,
the curious desire
of my chronically lonely life.

it was cold and dark and lonely
and i was scared.

there were no accessories.
i burst into tears over nothing.

what would jimmy schuyler do?
wwjsd?

and as quietly as the sound of kleenex
being pulled from a box,
i sneezed.

and morning, that goddess,
as if she were slightly deaf,
barely lifted her head off the horizon
before laying back down.

and a rose opened her portals
and the scent ran up an elephant's trunk,
or tried to.

such a long way for everything to travel

from here i look like a front moving in

an icy purple light
a poet would say belonged to a perfume stopper
belonging to his mother.
when it was her nipple.

you know, neither in the past
or in the future.



when we talk about when to tell the kids,
we are so together, so concentrated.
i mutter, i feel like a killer. i'm
the killer--taking my wrist--he says,
holding it. he is sitting on the couch, 
the old indigo chintz around him, 
rich as a night sea with jellies, 
i am sitting on the floor. i look up at him,
as if within some chamber of matedness,
some dust i carry around me. tonight,
to breathe its magellanic field is less
painful, maybe because he is drinking
a wine grown where i was born--fog,
eucalyptus, sempervirens--and i'm
sharing the glass with him. don't catch
my cold, he says, --oh that's right, you want
to catch my cold. i should not have told him that,
i tell him i will try to fall out of 
love with him, but i feel i will love him
all my life. he says he loves me
as the mother of our children, and new troupes
of tears mount to the acrobat platforms
of my ducts and do their burning leaps.
some of them jump straight sideways, and, for a
moment, i imagine a flurry
of tears like a whirra of knives thrown
at a figure, to outline it--a heart's spurt 
of rage. it glitters, in my vision, i nod
to it, it is my hope.


i hunted heaven
for him.

no dice.

too uppity,
it was. not enough

music, or dark dirt.

i begged the earth empty
of him. death

believes in us whether
we believe

or not. for a long while
i watch the sound

of a boy bouncing a ball
down the block

take its time
to reach me. father,

find me when
you want. i'll wait.



wisdom is a kindly spirit but does it love me? and righteousness? there's nothing in it.
to poetry i leave my senses, my deregulation, custodial duties, and to be a janitor is a great consolation.
it gave me my mother back through all her years.
to love these children, so full of neurons and consciousness. what joy to clean up and put a shine on their mess.
to my mother i leave my veil, my wing, the window and time. i, artifact. in this age the hand is a voice.
i leave the voice, the wonder, the mirror, and my lens, bent and beholden to the worm, leaf-work in wrought iron, eerie illuminations and deep-sea vision.
i've seen the eurostar, the drunken boat, and davy jones' locker. i've seen spanish galleons and the h.s. mauberley covered in brine.
there is this line from cloud dander to the solo bulb of mourning, a string through common prayer.
i like it when the gray-green shadows suddenly dayglo over the rushes. the wind in my head.
to write is an equal and opposite reaction my comrade, communard, my friendo.
what is it finally thinking what in winter's dusty alcove, the body tocks. the day was cloudy. the light muddy, dreary when they took it down.
to times roman i give my stammer, my sullenness, my new world violence, form and all that, forms, and all that paper, gusts. little buttress.     
i send love and weapons to everyone possessed with night visions.
when those green lights flash and blink, is that it? when the it continues strangely for a bit, then falls into a line, is it over?
i quantified daily the wonder in the grain.
i found i was over and singular yet many, the many and the singular, the many and the evolutionary, the many in the grain. many more.
who in hell am i writing for?
this vision is silly, teenage, and mine, a spot on the negative, a hole in composition. i quantify, i loaf, i wonder, i find, i rev.    
here the days' mud, night is a satellite, and anger, my cleft, my birthmark and star.
anger might be a better way to say i love you, truer than how are you in space? are you cold, can i get you a blanket?
to the polestar i leave my alien regalia, my off-world headdress. i leave acoustic forms in time, blooming, sudsy, inconsolable.
if you are unsatisfied, then welcome.    
here there are people working every corner of every inch of grass. the meticulously arranged outside reminds me of ocean and feels old.
in space the letterforms i love oscillate in waves.
i lose myself in waves speaking the half of me that forgot to say goodbye when i meant to say how come.
memory continues to bloom. more songs about death and dying, songs of inexperience.
more songs about being and loss, being in loss, more songs about seeing and feeling.
if you are critical, all the better to see and to miss it, to misunderstand, to fail at empathy and love, to not understand love and to love, to be diseverything and to love, whatever.
to mercy i leave whatever.



for you anthophilous, lover of flowers, 
green roses, chrysanthemums, lilies retrophilia, 
philocaly, philomath, sarcophilous--all this love,
of the past, of beauty, of knowledge, of flesh this is
catalogue & counter philalethist, negrophile, neophile.
a negro man walks down the street, taps newport
out against a brick wall & stares at you. love 
that lygophilia, lithophilous. be amongst stones,
amongst darkness. we are glass house. philopornist,
philotechnical. why not worship the demimonde?
love that--a corner room, whatever is not there, 
all the clutter you keep secret. palaeophile,
ornithophilous you, antiquarian, pollinated by birds.
all this a way to dream green rose petals on the bed you love 
petrophilous, stigmatophilia live near rocks, tattoo hurt
for you topophilia what place do you love? all these words 
for love for you, all these ways to say believe 
in symphily, to say let us live near each other.



for near is where you'll meet what you have wandered 
far to find. and near is where you'll very likely see 
how far the near obtains. in the dark katholikon
the lighted candles lent their gold to give the eye
a more than common sense of what lay flickering
just beyond the ken, and lent the mind a likely
swoon just shy of apprehension. it was then
that time's neat artifice fell in and made for us
a figure for when time would slip free altogether.
i have no sense of what this means to you, so little
sense of what to make of it myself, save one lit glimpse 
of how we live and move, a more expansive sense in whom.


the birdhouse made from a gourd is wired
to a flanged loop of steel and screwed to the southeast post
of the shack. two holes at the top--near where the stem was,
for a thong of leather to hang it by, which long ago broke--
are now the fingerholes of the mournful wind instrument it's become.
the broad round bowl of it makes a sort of birdly
basso profundo that pearls through the steel, into the post,
the floor joists and walls in two notes a slightly sharp d
and an equally sharp f, says the guitar tuner,
which explains why all my thinking these days
is in b-flat, a difficult key for all but the clarinet
and this sudden covey of nuthatches, whose collective woe
makes it a minor chord i am in the middle of.
nothing to do but hoist such silks as the luff
of limbs and needles suggests, and sail on,
the barely-escaped-from-the-cat chipmunk chattering
like a gull, and the mountain's last drift of snow
resembling the back of a sounding whale. hear the thrum of the rigging,
daggoo? hear its profoundest woo, its sensible gobbledy-goo
and doo-wop, the boo-hoos of the spheres, by vectors and veers,
by tacks and refractal jabberings, taking us deeper into the weirdness
of the ghost sea those prairie hills were the bottom of once,
this nowhere we shall not be returning from.
draw the lines assume the crow's nest, pip. this ship
sails on music and wind, and away with birds.


lucy doolin, first day on the job, stroked his goatee
and informed the seven of us in his charge
his name was short for lucifer, and that his father, a man
he never knew, had been possessed,
as his mother had told him, of both an odd sense of humor
and a deep and immitigable bitterness. also 
that the same man had named lucy's twin brother,
born dead, jesus christ. these facts, he said,
along with his tattoos and mohawked black hair,
we should, in our toils on his behalf, remember.

as we should also always remember to call him
only by that otherwise most womanly diminutive,
and never, he warned, by his given nor surname,
least of all with the title mister attached,
which would remind him of that same most hated father
and plunge him therefore into a mood
he could not promise he would, he said, behave 
appropriately within. fortunately, our job,
unlike the social difficulties attached thereto,
was simple collect the trash from the county's back roads.

although, given lucy's insistence on thoroughness,
this meant not only beer cans and bottles,
all manner of cast-off paper and plastics, but also
the occasional condom too, as well as the festering
roadkill fresh and ridden with maggotry,
or desiccate and liftable only from the hot summer tar
with a square-bladed shovel, all of which was to be tossed
into the bed of the township flatbed truck we ourselves
rode to and from the job in. by fifty-yard increments
then we traveled. he was never not smoking a cigarette.

late every afternoon, at the dump, while we unloaded
our tonnage of trash, he sat with stump mccarriston,
sexton of the dump and the dump's constant resident,
in the shade, next to a green, decrepit trailer
we marveled at and strangely envied, since every inch
of wall we could see through the open door
was plastered with fold-outs and pages
from every stump-salvaged playboy and nudie magazine
he had ever found among the wreckage there.
stump, we understood, was the ugliest man on earth.

even had lucy not told us so, we would have known,
by the olfactory rudeness within twenty yards
of his hovel, that he never bathed. and once,
while we shoveled and scraped, he took up the .
from the rack beside his door and popped
with amazing accuracy three rats not fifty feet from us,
then walked to their carcasses, skinned them out,
and hung their hides on a scavenged grocery store rack
to dry. he was making, lucy explained, a rat hide
coat we could see, come the fall, except for school.

as for school, it was a concept stump could not fathom
and lucy had no use for, on the truck's dash
all that summer robert burton's anatomy of melancholy,
a tome he said he'd read already eleven times,
this summer being the twelfth. we thought, in some way,
it might have had to do with something like the gallery
stump's trailer contained, the first word of its title
meaning something to us, the last nothing at all.
there were things about men we might be
unable ever to know, which we somehow knew was lucky.

and lucky, incidentally, was the name of the cat,
fat and mangy, that, once stump was back in the shade
with lucy, began, one by one, to consume the hideless rats.
the town we came from was sinking into the emptiness
of a thousand abandoned coal mine shafts beneath it,
and rats were more common than hares
and universally despised. they shamed us, it seemed,
as we were shamed by ignorance and curiosity--
the bodies of those women on the walls, the provenance
of rats the very earth offered up like a plague,

the burden of a name like lucifer or stump,
whose name, as it was scrawled on his mailbox,
seemed to be stumplin reilly mccarriston, esquire.
of the seven of us, one would die in vietnam,
one, after medical school, would hang himself
from a beam in his parents' basement, the others
merely gone, vanished in actuality if not in memory.
leaving me, alone, to tell this story. how stump
would spend his last twenty years in prison,
having shot lucy--one slender, flattening . slug

through the forehead--as he stood fifty feet away, 
balanced atop the tub of an ancient wringer washer,
arms extended, like jesus christ, said stump,
whose trailer was bulldozed into the dump itself
even before the trial, and who, no doubt, by some
court-appointed lawyer if not the appalled sheriff himself,
was forced to bathe and shave, to step into the unknown country
of a scentless white shirt and black businessman's trousers,
in order to offer his only yet most sincere defense,
that lucifer--mr. doolin, as the court insisted--had told him to.


for andrew o'hagan
three moons in the sky
the night they found him
drowned in sawtan's bog
just his cap, sitting there
and his wee fat hands poking out.
it was no loss 
to the village, i told them 
next morning,
and the villagers agreed. 
horn-daft, he was,
havering and glaikit
and scaring the children.
i mind that time
he picked up a mouse
and ate it, quick, 
in two mouthfuls
set the tail aside
on the ground
like a cocktail stick.

i used her well, after that,
his jennie,
still in her widow's weeds,
gilping into her
whenever i could,
in the barn or the boathouse
or off in the fields.
she slipped two or three out at least,
and sank each one in a lobster creel.
her head was away
by the end, as mad as her man
and no good to me.
she sleeps now 
under beinn ruadhainn, her face 
covered in ivy, 
scab, and sticky-willow.

the dreams came then.
last night, the burning loch, 
so full of bairns
they bobbed to the surface 
with their hair on fire
black snow fingers 
coming through the floorboards
rain like razor blades
the foosty-faced man, 
there at every corner,
hands furred with grey-mould.
and her, as always, 
star-naked, hatching
in the herring-nets.
the last i remember 
was my body being driven
with sticks through the town
to sawtan's brae, and hanged.

i broke from sleep and sat up sweating, 
dream-fleyed in the dark.
i groped around for the matches
and the matches were put in my hand.



stop belonging to me so much, face-head.
leave me to my child and my flowers.

i can't run with you hanging on to me like that.
it's like having ten dogs on a single lead

and no talent for creatures.
no hands, no trees. not my dogs, nobody's.

don't you have a place to go, face-head? 
deep into the brick basement of another life? 

to kill some time, i mean. that furnace 
light could take a shine to you. 

there are always places, none of them mine. 
and always time--rainbow sugar show 

of jimmies falling from ice cream's sky--
but that stuff's extra, it's never in supply. 

never, however, acres of it. violet beans 
and sarcasm. too many flavors of it. 

all those prodigal particles, 
flimsily whimsical miracles, an embarrassment 

of glitches. the chorus just more us. 
but nowhere bare and slippery have i 

got a prayer. if i had two hands 
to rub together i wouldn't waste the air.


when you show yourself to the woman 
you love, you don't know your fear

is not fear, itself. you have never been good,
but now you are so good,

who are you? is it the liquidity of her skin
that bathes the world for you,

or her face, captured like a she-lion
in your own flesh?

this summerbed is soft with ring upon ring 
upon ring of wedding, the kind

that doesn't clink upon contact, the kind
with no contract,

the kind in which the gold is only only light. 
cloud covers and lifts, 

and sleep and night and soon enough, love's
big fire laughs at a terrible burn, 

but only only because pain absorbs excess 
joy and you shouldn't flaunt 

your treasures in front of all day's eyes.


i am dreaming of a house just like this one

but larger and opener to the trees, nighter

than day and higher than noon, and you,

visiting, knocking to get in, hoping for icy

milk or hot tea or whatever it is you like. 

for each night is a long drink in a short glass. 

a drink of blacksound water, such a rush 

and fall of lonesome no form can contain it.

and if it isn't night yet, though i seem to 

recall that it is, then it is not for everyone.

did you receive my invitation? it is not 

for everyone. please come to my house

lit by leaf light. it's like a book with bright

pages filled with flocks and glens and groves

and overlooked by pan, that seductive satyr

in whom the fish is also cooked. a book that 

took too long to read but minutes to unread--

that is--to forget. strange are the pages 

thus. nothing but the hope of company.

i made too much pie in expectation. i was 

hoping to sit with you in a tree house in a 

nightgown in a real way. did you receive

my invitation? written in haste, before 

leaf blinked out, before the idea fully formed.

an idea like a storm cloud that does not spill

or arrive but moves silently in a direction. 

like a dark book in a long life with a vague

hope in a wood house with an open door.


her wattled fingers can't
stroke the keys with much
grace or assurance anymore,
and the tempo is always
rubato, halting, but still
that sound--notes quivering
and clear in their singularity,
filing down the hallway--
aches with pure intention, the
melody somehow prettier
as a remnant than
whatever it used to be.


now he has silver in him. when sometime
death shall boil down unnecessary fat
to reach the nub of our identity,
             when in the run of crime
the skull is rifled for the gold in teeth,
and chemistry has eaten from the spine
superfluous life and vigor, why then he
will show a richness to be wondered at,
             and shall be thought a mine
whose claim and stake are stone and floral wreath.

the body burns away, and burning gives
light to the eye and moisture to the lip
and warmth to our desires, but it burns
             whatever body lives
into extinction though it wear a plate
of armor in it therefore do we thrive
in fear of fire, in terror of the ship
that carries us to fire. a soldier learns
             to bear the silver weight
where in his head the fire is most alive.


night, the fat serpent, slipped among the plants,
intent upon the apples of his eyes
a heavy bandoleer hung like a prize
around his neck, and tropical red ants
mounted his body, and he heard advance,
little by little, the thin female cries
of mortar shells. he thought of paradise.
such is the vision that extremity grants.

in the clean brightness of magnesium
flares, there were seven angels by a tree.
their hair flashed diamonds, and they made him doubt
they were not really from elysium.
and his flesh opened like a peony,
red at the heart, white petals furling out.


i would invoke that man
who chipped for all posterity an ass
             the one that jesus rode
out of hard stone, and set its either wing
among the wings of the most saintly clan
on chartres cathedral, and that it might sing
             the praise to all who pass
             of its unearthly load,
hung from its neck a harp-like instrument.
             i would invoke that man
             to aid my argument.

             the ass smiles on us all,
being astonished that an ass might rise
             to such sure eminence
not merely among asses but mankind,
simpers, almost, upon the western wall
in praise of folly, who midst sow and kine,
             saw with its foolish eyes
             gold, myrrh, and frankincense
enter the stable door, against all odds.
             the ass smiles on us all.
             our butt at last is god's.

             that man is but an ass--
more perfectly, that ass is but a man
             who struggles to describe
our rich, contingent and substantial world
in ideal signs the dunged and pagan grass,
misted in summer, or the mother-of-pearled
             home of the bachelor-clam.
             a cold and toothless tribe
has he for brothers, who would coldly think.
             that man is but an ass
             who smells not his own stink.

             for all his abstract style
speaks not to our humanity, and shows
             neither the purity
of heaven, nor the impurity beneath,
and cannot see the feasted crocodile
ringed with st. francis' birds to pick its teeth,
             nor can his thought disclose
             to normal intimacy,
siamese twins, the double-beasted back,
             for all his abstract style
             utters our chiefest lack.

             despite his abstract style,
pickerel will dawdle in their summer pools
             lit by the flitterings
of light dashing the gusty surfaces,
or lie suspended among shades of bile
and lime in fluent shift, for all he says.
             and all the grey-haired mules,
             simple and neuter things,
will bray hosannas, blessing harp and wing.
             for all his abstract style,
             the ass will learn to sing.





the work has been going forward with the greatest difficulty, chiefly because i cannot concentrate. i have no feeling about whether what i am writing is good or bad, and the whole business is totally without excitement and pleasure for me. and i am sure i know the reason. it's that i can't stand leaving unresolved my situation with pat. i hear from her fairly frequently, asking when i plan to come back, and she knows that i am supposed to appear at the poetry reading in the middle of january. it is not mainly loneliness i feel, though i feel it but i have been lonely before. it is quite frankly the feeling that nothing is really settled between us, and that in the mean time i worry about how things are going to work out. this has made my work more difficult than it has ever been before.

  from a letter to his parents dated november , , rome.

hardly enough for me that the pail of water
              alive with the wrinkling light
              brings clearness home and whiter
than mind conceives the walls mature to white,
or that the washed tomatoes whose name is given
              to love fulfill their bowl
              and the roman sea is woven
together by threading fish and made most whole.

i delight in each of these, delight moreover
              in the dark skill of those hands
              closer to wise than clever
of our blind italian landlady who stands
her shoes fouled with the lustful blood of rabbit
              lightly dispatched and dressed
              fixing it to the gibbet
of the clothesline where the laundry sails to rest.

these textures solicit of us our instant homage
              but are disparate senseless things
              unless a reigning image
bring them to purpose as your presence brings
the world in offering, like a chaplet worn
              in aphrodite's name,
              the furious unicorn
come to the virgin's lap tethered and tame.

and thus it is as you stand in this morning's shadows
              where ancient chamber pots
              are grown to little meadows
of mint and parsley surely it's love unknots
the winds for ulysses and recalls to man
              a summer without cease
              sprung from the same dishpan
onion and lily work their primal peace.


my dear, your eyes are weary
rest them a little while.
assume the languid posture
of pleasure mixed with guile.
outside the talkative fountain
continues night and day
repeating my warm passion
in whatever it has to say.

             the sheer luminous gown
                           the fountain wears
             where phoebe's very own
                           color appears
             falls like a summer rain
                           or shawl of tears.

thus your soul ignited
by pleasure's lusts and needs
sprays into heaven's reaches
and dreams of fiery deeds.
then it brims over, dying, 
and languorous, apart,
drains down some slope and enters
the dark well of my heart.

             the sheer luminous gown
                           the fountain wears
             where phoebe's very own
                           color appears
             falls like a summer rain
                           or shawl of tears.

o you, whom night enhances,
how sweet here at your breasts
to hear the eternal sadness
of water that never rests.
o moon, o singing fountain,
o leaf-thronged night above,
you are the faultless mirrors
of my sweet, bitter love.

             the sheer luminous gown
                           the fountain wears
             where phoebe's very own
                           color appears
             falls like a summer rain
                           or shawl of tears. 




dark and amusing he is, this handsome gallant,
           of chamois-polished charm,
athlete and dancer of uncommon talent--
           is there cause for alarm
in his smooth demeanor, the proud tilt of his chin,
           this cavaliere servente, this harlequin?

gentle and kindly this other, ardent but shy,
           with an intelligence
who would not glory to be guided by--
           and would it not make sense
to trust in someone so devoted, so
           worshipful as this tender, pale pierrot?

since both of them delight, if i must choose
           i win a matchless mate,
but by that very winning choice i lose--
           i pause, i hesitate,
putting decision off, says columbine,
and while i hesitate, they both are mine.


they're all dressed up in carmine 
floor-length velvet gowns, their upswirled hair 
festooned with matching ribbons 
their fresh hopes and our fond hopes for them 
infuse this sort-of-music as if happiness could actually be 
each-plays-her-part-and-all-will-take-care-of-itself. 
their hearts unscarred under quartz lights 
beam through the darkness in which we sit 
to show us why we endured at home 
the squeaking and squawking and botched notes 
that now in concert are almost beautiful, 
almost rendering this heartrending music 
composed for an archduke who loved it so much 
he spent his fortune for the musicians 
who could bring it brilliantly to life.


the conversations of the french

quarter mules in their stables
after a full day of pulling
tourists and voters over cobble-
stones is not espresso witty
and in their dark no tvs feed
them news of the ends of mules
elsewhere in the middle east
and west. in our stables the ends
of others are a fact of atmosphere.
the yoyos on the mystery island
nextdoor are revving familiar tools
in backyard now gripped by failure
first of electricity than of
a meaner something that'll grow
into nothing we'll know in the a.m.
once they were visitors like us
then they grew mulish in their
bubbles and pulled whatever
was put around their necks in-
cluding a banner that said, about
what kills us we know little.
on certain nights after a good
internal fight we hear the voice-
less others through the glass
fearfully sweet'n'soft like dough.
oh let the monsters in. help us
rise above our not seeing them,
may they let us into their eyes
as well. banish the blindness
of these cobblestones, clop, clop.
but pffsst our notes are in-
complete. loving you was
never on the agenda. better
to sing as roughly as the stones.
on memorial day we had one
thousand hotdogs & counting.
didn't visit a single graveyard.
we the grant wood folks scan
the sky for incoming missiles
blips ourselves we understand
timing and touring in america.
the gilded dads in the portraits
sought the idealized continuity
now moving before us democratically
in showers of pixels and dots.
i'll go with the distracted mariner,
my lover, and we'll be in the world.
it will be late by then and dark.
we lyric virgin mules keep our
book of hours in a dream apart,
having stranded a billion turistas.
but we could not break the chummy hand.
ready to brave the snow without a hat,
severe weather notwithstanding,
we merely nod and understand.
  
 


side by side through the streets at midnight,
 roaming together,
 through the tumultuous night of london,
 in the miraculous april weather.
 
roaming together under the gaslight,
 day's work over,
 how the spring calls to us, here in the city,
 calls to the heart from the heart of a lover
 
cool to the wind blows, fresh in our faces,
 cleansing, entrancing,
 after the heat and the fumes and the footlights,
 where you dance and i watch your dancing.
 
good it is to be here together,
 good to be roaming,
 even in london, even at midnight,
 lover-like in a lover's gloaming.
 
you the dancer and i the dreamer,
 children together,
 wandering lost in the night of london,
 in the miraculous april weather.
 


we have walked in love's land a little way,
 we have learnt his lesson a little while,
 and shall we not part at the end of day,
 with a sigh, a smile?
a little while in the shine of the sun,
 we were twined together, joined lips, forgot
 how the shadows fall when the day is done,
 and when love is not.
we have made no vows--there will none be broke,
 our love was free as the wind on the hill,
 there was no word said we need wish unspoke,
 we have wrought no ill.
so shall we not part at the end of day,
 who have loved and lingered a little while,
 join lips for the last time, go our way,
 with a sigh, a smile?
 


loving in truth, and fain in verse my love to show,
that the dear she might take some pleasure of my pain,
pleasure might cause her read, reading might make her know,
knowledge might pity win, and pity grace obtain,--
i sought fit words to paint the blackest face of woe,
studying inventions fine, her wits to entertain,
oft turning others' leaves, to see if thence would flow
some fresh and fruitful showers upon my sunburned brain.
but words came halting forth, wanting invention's stay
invention, nature's child, fled step-dame study's blows,
and others' feet still seemed but strangers in my way.
thus great with child to speak, and helpless in my throes,
biting my truant pen, beating myself for spite
fool, said my muse to me, look in thy heart and write.
 


i must go down to the seas again, to the lonely sea and the sky,
and all i ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by
and the wheel's kick and the wind's song and the white sail's shaking,
and a grey mist on the sea's face, and a grey dawn breaking,
 
i must go down to the seas again, for the call of the running tide
is a wild call and a clear call that may not be denied 
and all i ask is a windy day with the white clouds flying,
and the flung spray and the blown spume, and the sea-gulls crying.
 
i must go down to the seas again, to the vagrant gypsy life,
to the gull's way and the whale's way where the wind's like a whetted knife
and all i ask is a merry yarn from a laughing fellow-rover,
and quiet sleep and a sweet dream when the long trick's over.


the sorrow of true love is a great sorrow
and true love parting blackens a bright morrow
yet almost they equal joys, since their despair
is but hope blinded by its tears, and clear
above the storm the heavens wait to be seen.
but greater sorrow from less love has been
that can mistake lack of despair for hope
and knows not tempest and the perfect scope
of summer, but a frozen drizzle perpetual
of drops that from remorse and pity fall
and cannot ever shine in the sun or thaw,
removed eternally from the sun's law.
 


silver & gossamer & porcelain & cobwebs

some people are made out of
they walk from here to there
a limited number of times only--
but the bony phone is just dumb plastic
it rings not at all
 
i don't understand my ideas are universal
but my audience is five guys at the shell
station people just don't get it
 
she longs for what makes her grin
tnjete dup ce rnjete
the sweetness of want
the repulsiveness of having
after days she was returned
by the storms of language
that had tossed her far
& she rearranged her face
for the english language--
 
what i heard i did not hear
what i saw i did not see
i trust my sense to dullness then
i kill my joy & cease to be
 


is all wrong, ed
 
what poets now live
where they say they do
where they started out
where they want to
 
half the midwesterners
did time in new york
the other half in california
 
only new yorkers write
as if they are from new york
and mostly they are not
 
the ones in california
were wounded elsewhere
when they feel better
or can't afford the rent
they'll go back where
they came from
 
this is america
you get hurt where you are born
you make poetry out of it
as far from home as you can get
you die somewhere in between
 
the only geography of poets
is greyhound
general motors rules them all
ubi patria ibi bene
or ibi bene ubi patria
bread out of nostalgia
not a lot of it either
some of us came from very far
maps don't help much
  
 


i haven't remembered anything, only the names
and that their dates have been replaced by fees
toted up out of mischief
a whopping yellow sun, finesse swallowed hard,
a scrapbook in pantyhose dawdling beside some shreveport-like expanse.
 
but now you see it, she's supposed to call.
surely neither will converse, they merely tell,
succumbing to a disorderly shelf life like tampax in june.
salute the budding terminus where the east side was.
can there be a way to redefine the tense behind its jaunts,
the pubescent imagery a hand calls forth
as, rippling, it is thrust into the brine?
 
                                      the phantom tugboat slips along
in depths past garbo's awnings and the united glaze
which wilts, harnessing dim signatories in the windows' sarong.
do things go further in need as i could? or are they immune?
how else have i been taught to guess
and then been told to know, because matter equals good?
a silken light masks the entrance to the market proofs of time.


i
 
it's odd to have a separate month. it
escapes the year, it is not only cold, it is warm
and loving like a death grip on a willing knee. the
indians have a name for it, they call it
summer the tepees shake in the blast like roosters
at dawn. everything is special to them,
the colorful ones.
 
 
ii
 
somehow the housewife does not seem gentle.
is she angry because her husband likes october?
is it snow bleeds softly from her shoes?
the nest eggs have captured her,
but april rises from her bed.
 
 
iii
 
the beggars are upon us cried chester.
 
three strangers appeared at the door, demanding ribbons.
 
the october wind . . . nests
 
 
iv
 
why do i think october is beautiful?
it is not, is not beautiful.
                                                  but then
what is there to hold one's interest
between the various drifts of a day's
work, but to search out the differences
                                          the window and grate--
but it is not, is not
beautiful.
 
 
v
 
i think your face is beautiful, the way it is
close to my face, and i think you are the real
october with your transparence and the stone
 of your words as they pass, as i do not hear them.
  
 


for vincent warren
behind the black water tower

under the grey
of the sky that feeds it
smoke speeds to where a pigeon
spreads its wings
 
this is no great feat
cold pushes out its lust
we walk we drink we cast
our giggling insults
 
                           would you please
leave the . you owe me
i would rather not talk about it
just now           money bores me i would like
to visit someone who will stay
in bed all day           a forest is rising
imperceptibly in my head
                                                  not a civilized park
 
i think it would be nice this new
moral odor no it would not mean
everything marching to its tomb
                                                            the water tower
watches over us            is there someone
you would like to invite        no one.
  
 


half-ended melodies are purer.

to no longer perform in broad daylight,
the apple's a radish for it,
the winter chill a living thing.
but take your brother into later learning
let the girls who will smell the buried cloves there.
 
so i am only beginning to learn what i from time to time forget.
but throw away these childish things
 
barney's coffin disappeared,
and luckily you said the right thing
for the sky mentioned for the last time.
the little master of small talk
is really the seducer of your every move,
taking you into his confidence the way a cat his mouse.
 
and still young lycidas cannot express himself fully.
and everyone is the same,
even down to his jockey shorts, dolce far niente, as they say.
  
 


crossed fingers gird the planet, though small optimism obtains.

 
will i read the serious doll in wraps, with its roller slur?
 
a book where everybody, reader and writer included, dies.
 
the kind of thing people said in the s hello, i'm back being me again.
 
my first and last names and the first and last names of both my parents have the same number of letters.
 
the wasp waist, the tennis dress, the shirtwaist, the dirndl mainbocher.
 
a distant yet achingly distinct whinny et voila the walking buckboard.
 
dustin hoffman's bookcase hanging by one hinge in air of eleventh street, dawn .
 
telephone solicitation for a ballet school in need of serious floors.
 
the thought of someone flat on his back on the carpet, tossing and giggling.
 
if it hurts don't do it. there are several unlesses to this caution.
 
for the second time in two millennia slept through the meteor shower, results of last night's talk.
  


fighting a losing battle

lives next door
to a vibrant woman
in her 's.
when he talks to her
sub-mediocre takes over
in a big way.
zombie-ized by the big eye
she even sleeps with it on.
just sign me concerned.
  
 


there are these trees.
and beyond these trees,
trees. and beyond that
little or nothing. little
fields and nothing but sky.


i think it is interesting
 though not exactly amusing
 how we go from day to day
 with no money. how do we
 do it, friends ask, suspecting
 we really have some stash
 stacked away somewhere.
 but we certainly do not
 and we also do not know
 how we do it either.
 you sure are lucky,
 some of our friends say. i am
 none too sure of that though,
 as i wait for the winning
 lottery numbers to be announced
 on cklw. thursday in detroit
 is the day of dreams. we have
 been dreaming of a place
 in the country lately and i'm
 none too sure that is very healthy.
 and speaking of health that's
 also been a problem that probably
 has something to do with no money,
 since we've all been sick lately,
 taking turns politely of course.
 could you bring me some more
 tea one of us will ask,
 and the other will.
 in between the coughing and
 worrying our thoughts
 have often turned to crime.
 we seriously wonder how we can
 get away with a bundle with
 as little risk as possible.
 last week we took our last
  out of the bank
 and noticed how much more
 they had there though
 we had none. of course
 we wouldn't rob that bank,
 they know us there
 as the ones who bring
 the rolls of pennies in.
 and just yesterday they
 fish-eyed us for trying
 to cash our son's xmas bond
 from his grandparents
 after only one month.
 so we wouldn't try to rob that bank,
 but i do know of one up north
 that may be possible. . .
 i know this just seems like
 romantic dreaming
 but i practically make a career
 of reading detective stories,
 and god knows, i have no other.
 anyway if the right opportunity
 comes along, we are more
 than ready to meet it.
 but this is a time of waiting,
 the i ching says, though it does
 not say how we are to eat
 while waiting. and soon
 we will have another mouth to feed--
 ann now in her seventh month,
 and that is often in our thoughts.
 besides all that we are both
 over thirty, artist and poet,
 still waiting to cross the great water.
 meanwhile, day after day,
 there is still detroit
 to be dealt with -- a small pond
 says our friend snee.
 big fish we used to answer him,
 but that was a while back.
 now we think maybe lake erie
 is the great water referred to
 in the i ching, and if we wait
 long enough we can
 walk across -- to buffalo
 or cleveland. in a healthy person,
 says the philosopher, self-pity
 can be a forerunner to action
 once the problem is seen clearly,
 a solution may be found at hand.
 and as i said, i think it is interesting
 though not exactly amusing.


can replace

poetry
in my life
and one day
surely
it will
 


the flower-fed buffaloes of the spring
in the days of long ago,
ranged where the locomotives sing
and the prairie flowers lie low--
the tossing, blooming, perfumed grass
is swept away by the wheat,
wheels and wheels and wheels spin by
in the spring that still is sweet.
but the flower-fed buffaloes of the spring
left us, long ago.
they gore no more, they bellow no more,
they trundle around the hills no more--
with the blackfeet, lying low,
with the pawnees, lying low,
lying low.
 


into the smouldering ruin now go down
and walk where once she walked and breathe the air
she breathed that final day on the burning stair
and follow her, beyond the fleeing crowds,
into the fire, and through the climbing clouds.

into the smouldering ruin now go down
and find, in ashes bright as hammered tin,
a buried bone-white naked mannikin
that flung from some shop window serves to bind
her body, and its beauty, to your mind.


.

it unfolds and ripples like a banner, downward.  all the stories 
come folding out.  the smells and flowers begin to come back, as
the tapestry is brightly colored and brocaded.  rabbits and violets.

who asked you to come over?  she got her foot in the door and
would not remove it, elbowing and talking swiftly.  gas leak?
that sounds like a very existential position perhaps you had
better check with the landlord.

                                                            this was no better than the
predicament i had just read about.  now it was actually changing
before my eyes.  sometimes it will come to a standstill though,
and finally the reflection can begin.

selfless--that was the proposition.  smiling and moving instantly
there was no other purpose than that which brought them there,
to be in a particular place.


.

this time the mule gave its face away.  take your cadillac
where you want to go in the morning, convertible as it might be,
and enjoy a good bottle of rum.

running on this way she used various modes of expression that
were current.  nothing seemed to bring the woods any closer.
what woods, she was questioned, realizing that as far as the 
woods went, they were largely inhabitable through the facility
of her mind.  at the philadelphia flower show, an ideal situation
was built up.  here through various regulated artificial conditions,
spring grass, waterfalls, the newly-sprouted bulbs completed
her ideal concept of nature.  the smell was overpowering.

all right then.  she had a thing about nature, from flower
show glamor and enormous greenhouses the rich cultivated.

a beauty of cultivation--in living?  hastiness did not prevent
her from rising quick and ready to misnomers and other odd
conclusions, throwing the telephone book to the floor, oh oh
the life i am entangled in.  four sides of it.

                                                                                        above was a paradisical
level, incompleted.  with working possibilities.

below, endless preoccupations and variations were possible.
currently in vogue were shelves, the vacuum cleaner, a new
bedspread and color scheme for pillows.

                                                                               taste treats were
unresponsive.  glamor do's were out.  conversation was nil.
languid

she could not even find a place to languish upon that was
fulfilling in its own way.

                            so out of the lifelessness that was around her,
the grape leaves drying out, and even though the avocado was
sprouting,

she thought, why not fantasy?  tugging at this character and
that, trying to push a little life in a prince or a charmer, a half-
blind bat, dryad, the works of the story teller.  here the four
walls of the room and ceiling became apparent again.  i ought
to tighten down and make sure i say exactly what i mean.

and her face took on a tight pinched expression, and thrifty scotch
economy gave her shrewd eyes in the prescribed way.  use every
tidbit, usefully.  once upon a time there was a princess who
had a long white fur coat with a high fluffy collar, and inside the
coat were stitched beautiful butterflies in many bright colors.
the princess languished.  she was not sure where to sit to her best
advantage to enjoy herself the most.  she could not go in her mind 
or out.  she looked at her long white hand, i am the queen of the
high mountain hag, she murmured to herself, still knowing she was
a princess.  she lay down upon the floor as if it were the garden of
eden, the coat spread around her.

                                                                no, that poor little house she
had built was a bore.  it's better that it go up in flames, as it did.

she went down to grand central station and gave away flowers.
some people took them and some people didn't.


.

i'm glad to get back.  i had to repeat a rough discontinuous journey.
questioning myself all along the way.  was i jumping on her because
her time had come to an end.  indeed i pounded on his arm all night,
over his concern for this soft-spoken individual, i can see nothing
but their softness.  me me, and the time we might spend together,
reading and talking, to tear away that putrid husk.

my flippancy is gone.  now i have started my secret life again,
in transition, reminding.  as the moth reminds, its feeble antenna
groping, taken like a stalk of fern, coins of money.

all over i was shaking as the fear and tension made itself apparent.
it was a cold night out.  it was colder still between the airy gaps,
between blankets.

                                     you can see she is thoughtful
as she draws the string to the bow.  where to go indeed.  the
point is brought forward and discussed very cleverly.

a sleeping angel or a sleeping troll?  i was rather proud of being
used, pushing the clothing hampers up and down the downtown
street.  here, pleasant mentors conveyed their anxious solicitations,
drawing from their bags, long lists of memorandum due, what i owed.
it was a lot, if i hesitated.  i choose to go on, saying this is the
way i go, owing nothing, being that kind of person.  hung up?

that thought intrudes as the clearly marked vista is not so clearly
marked.  certainly one supposes in all honesty, that an essential
core of feeling blooms in each encounter.  lost under the weight
of the garbage of who are you that you are not making apparent.
thus unhappy, i don't want it to be this way, and so forth.
not costumes, or paraphernalia, the immediate reactions.


.

we of course are in a family situation.  anything i wish might
happen, but the larger situations are not real, not to be
considered possible, discussable as to what sense of reality
they possessed.

in the snow, the wood piled up underneath.  oh those drifting
sensibilities.  at this point it is scarcely believable that people
gather and like each other.  eating chocolate pudding, getting
in touch with some other sense of alikeness.  the form is no
longer obvious to me.  whether they meander or are joined together
in their senses in the mechanics or regular grooves they run along.

                                                     i suspect that in this house, this
place that is musty and left as it was some years ago, there is
no real fear the objects are old and i am not familiar with them,
only the sense that the ghost or spirit world strikes you with
its familiarity, pleasurable fear.

                                                           here the familiar
is apt to make its presence known, at any moment the unexpected
lurk in the hall, into the room.  pieces of leather, old silken fans
laid upon the table top, rooms filled with something left unexpectedly
terror is the wrong combination of ignorance.  it contains its own
self with dusty fragments of velvet and fringe.   pieces of voice
with no name, called it myself, as they spoke all day, sucking the
soft slush, admitting their real deficiencies as--
i am never sure oh it's that power

and disease of believing in the stale that doesn't demand a real 
climate, takes its capacity when the demons come down.


.

the night passes in night time.  the head moving to the shoulder,
the head rising with a frown.

in a firm voice, it doesn't matter if the hair is flying from undue
spring breezes, the self has been raptured on the wine that produces
appropriate madness, and sad she says, my dear the bacchanal is a
lovely way to be rid of waste.

however, in seeing the house more manageable, one cannot even have
fear larger than the unknown portions of the continent which
refuses to sink. 

                                                                                  there once was a woman
who grew older, not that she minded, but the passage of time was
always constant.  why does one have to contend with that she said, 
puzzled, as she got carried along, and constantly had to think up
new coping modes of behavior.  if he behaved to me thus when he was
, now that i am , i can hardly behave like that to those that are
, and so forth.  there wasn't any model except the one she built,
and one could scarcely believe there was no established pattern.  this
offered wonderful possibilities, but also indecision and gutlessness.


.

you can't see them, all bundled up, all those that choose
to move other than where the distance seems appealing.  knowledge
has no depth.  there isn't any message to be spoken.

wrangling, she speaks ill-advised my dear, as the cat has no
point in laying its head down.  she ought to watch carefully.

                                                                             the claws.  it could be
the bent hands, as they grow, that as the fur impeaches the
rose, doesn't make the thing she hangs her body on any realer.
what could it be all about?  the necessity to follow, balancing,
contemplating words, as the basis of why we move at all.

just a little touch.  the leader cautioned further progression.
i could hardly listen to the music for long.  now there
seemed to be interruptions, pleasurable interludes, nothing
definite, of a fragmented nature.

                                                               certainly i wished the best
for all.  the sadder soldiers stumbled idly, as i also in the
profound reaches of my slumber noted the elegant turns, the
twisting statements grooving into the language building something
to listen to.  the dress made from silk.  trusting was awkward
and not of a nature to ease any further building.  whosoever
you revere will come back tenfold upon you and lighten the
burden carried as those who desire the warmth and necessity of
communication.


.

i am sure my dreams must have been of the wrong sort.  however, as
dreams are reflections of inner dilemmas, how did those arise, from
a day of relaxation and summer enjoyment of the fund.

knowledge comes from what purported strike?  from that which cleanses,
and let us knot say heart but tissue.  hopefully and helpfully i have
built up a language in which to talk myself to sleep.  not for purposes
of letting in the cold.

                                         however, i have found that not all blockaded
against is the cold, the dreary reign of the dead, etc., and tasteless
realm of the mushroom.  as much can be denied as the bilious sun
strives to cause an enlargement of singing in the back of the neck and
the head.  that is uncorraled ecstasy.  i call it enthusiasm, free energy.
but it has no place to land, it is bursting and unfocused it is a real force
and the counterpart of the gloomy depths.

                                                                              as the pieces of the house
ooze sap, blossoms and green twigs burst from the cracks.  whether or
not to join in what i was half committed to see and do.


.

at this point, when jack picked up the pussy willow branches, i said
they can't possibly be ours for the taking, and smiled with dedication
to an older con edison man.  the buildings were like the unexplored
garbage in my mind, fascinating and dirty, pulling pieces of cloth
from boxes left overnight.  energy as limitless possibility, in
the attempt to transmit non-energy situations.

for example, if once i stop to realize what little gets through, i am
much more interested in the cover than the contents it is difficult
to find any interest in anything.  good energy displaces bad karma.
and other non entities like that sort, producing flow that in its own
place has a good bed, stocked well with what can be called fleet-footed
fishes, and approaching places of investigation, such as relations
between.

                    as i saw the blood flow to the surface of his skin, i 
forgot to watch for the telltale visions that again might come from
something i have never seen more possibly the components of what
every man views.  if this was a possibility, the rays from every person
converging pass through the state of shock to numbness to unity without
any mind at all, for this horror fits the cat on the stairs, between
the fifth and sixth rung.  this is the way people glow and pulse similar
to an inlet of jellyfish blocking the way, full of human life until
i who will name myself a swimmer come along and refuse to be
blocked on the way, although i turn back gladly, and will again swim
through for it is possible they do not kill, the sting's compounded measure
is fear, and thus one not need join the broad expanse of human mouths
calling people to join their ranks to comfort their newfound recognition
or orifices, stomachs and legs.

i reminded myself twice there were several stories that kept continuing
themselves.  she ignored her face, blotched and red upon times, but
fuller.  did you forget to wax and wane?  her head was full of energy
brought forward and positively that what was said would turn the obvious
into color, but no sense.  sense was for the thinkers.  here the thinkers
forgot their word orders or sense it was better to give them coffee,
and those off worse could smoke.

                                                                                          i had felt very
foolish when i leaned forward and grasped his hand, with effort, and
his cloak slipped down over one shoulder as he shouted, which is the
way.  and i followed for certainly no one would follow me.  as the day
is cold and colder, and what comes out of the head is of its own sort and
nature.  these words, like nature, and head, thinking and words,
repeat themselves, as the lines of landscape, attics and other closed-off
sections have reprimanded themselves by repetition.  light

was such an enormous possibility.  taking sight into a frenzy, it was
possible that just to look was full of excitement and wonder, for 
ages at a time, things appeared as beautiful, the sky, the street
where cars had gone by.

                                                  i worried about certain characters ones
that never seemed to be other than puzzles to me but i was drawn to
them with certainty only because there seemed to be no understanding?
as when the mysteries were performed, the house then itself became
distilled with reason as the pots and pans were used apparently filled
with the stuff of continuity.  the sorrow that each day sinks into the
infertile other side of day, where voice comes out of the dark, and
does its rituals.  memory has its own screen across the room to view
itself, and the continuous dwelling of conjecture takes permanent form
in stiff-legged walks to remind, thus on and on the breathing goes.

                                                                  new york. january  march, 



    in tamalpais is a big crystal. an acquaintance told
me the story. a miwok was giving his grandfather's medicine
bag to the kroeber museum in berkeley. he said this man 
took him over the mountain tamalpais, at a certain time
in the year. i believe it was about the time of the
winter solstice, because then the tides are really low.
they stopped and gathered a certain plant on the way over
the mountain. on their way to the bolinas beach clam patch,
where there is a big rock way out there.

                                                                            go out to
the rock. take out of the medicine bag the crystal
that matches the crystal in tamalpais. and
                                              if your heart is not true
                                              if your heart is not true
when you tap the rock in the clam patch
                                                            a little piece of it will fly off
                                                   and strike you in the heart
                          and strike you dead.

and that's the first story i ever heard about bolinas.



              the grasses are light brown
              and the ocean comes in
              long shimmering lines
              under the fleet from last night
              which dozes now in the early morning

here and there horses graze
              on somebody's acreage

                               strangely, it was not my desire

that bade me speak in church to be released
         but memory of the way it used to be in
careless and exotic play 

               when characters were promises
      then recognitions.  the world of transformation
is real and not real but trusting.

                            enough of these lessons?  i mean
didactic phrases to take you in and out of
love's mysterious bonds?

                      well i myself am not myself

           and which power of survival i speak
for is not made of houses.

          it is inner luxury, of golden figures
 that breathe like mountains do
            and whose skin is made dusky by stars.


when i used to focus on the worries, everybody
                      was ahead of me, i was the bottom
                of the totem pole,
              a largely spread squat animal.

how about a quick massage now, he said to me.
i don't think it's cool, i replied.
oh, said he, after a pause, i should have waited
                     for you to ask me. 

the waves came in closer and closer.

when i fall into the gap of suspicion i am no longer here.

in this world that has got closed over by houses
                       and networks, i fly out
from under the belly.     life's dizzy crown
of whirling lights, circles this head.    pure
with wonder, hot
with wonder.    the streets become golden.     all
size increases, the colors glow, we are in myth.

we are in easy understanding.
scarcely talking, thoughts pass between us.
                                    it is memory.    as i search to find
this day's sweet drifting.    the fog out to sea, the wind.



                       he is pruning the privet

                of sickly sorrow   desolation
           in loose pieces of air he goes clip clip clip
       the green blooming branches fall--they're getting out
             of hand'    delirious and adorable    what a switch
                               we perceive        multiple
identities     when you sing     so beautifully     the shifting
       clouds  you are not alone is this world
               not a lone  a parallel world of reflection 
       in a window keeps the fire burning
                    in the framed mandala,  the red shafted flicker
               sits on the back of the garden chair in the rain
the red robed monks downtown in the rain  a rainbow arises

                   simple country      practices thunder
      lightning,  hail and rain    eight douglas iris
            ribbon layers of attention

              so   constant creation of self' is a tricky
       mess    he is pruning the loquat,   the olive
     which looks real enough in the damp late morning air


                                                                                          may , 


ihow can we accommodate these reforms? the nights of bell-flowers are as finished as the hell of water that has unrolled and become news. pull at the ox's ring and the wall of the sinuses falls down. pull at the hoop in the eyelid, dormitories are felled. a marriage of fists and kites, the smile is hammered so painstakingly into the gut it forms a ring.iii am staring up at a boxing match in which white everlasts and red everlasts take on the breakneck speed of cupids. art deco faades hem in the open-air courtyard a black belt of skyline circles off their incandescent white waists. the sunrise pulls level with the sea. the boxers' shadows furl and unfurl, drawing into cups.iiiyou open your heart's wings like a bread riot, split the uncooked potatoes on the table with a glance, and eat. you make the hours work like fragile perceptions for the food they get, the warmth they get, for the variable, contradictory spontaneities imposed on their bodies as love or triumph in mistaken assertions.
				

 

sets the folds in alignment 
this a shallow, a constitution of drops 
that moves to displace itself 
and unconsciously reverts 
to image. 

in such a state, 
the wave has become a setting-- 
a table across which cups 
with propositions rolled inside them 
are passed. 

the passage of cups does not limit 
the range of potential outcomes, 
and yet at no point does the wave 
dissolve into abstraction. 

the shades 
are drawn and we are 
overwhelmed by flags 
crossing the black divan. 

an axis of rotation, 
gliding a fraction of an inch 
and yet unveiling its total mass. 

advancing, the disc of its body 
shimmers. alighting on the sand, 
it reveals itself in a cluster of pulses. 

dilated, it lifts from the sea floor 
fine spokes radiating on a wheel. 
it passes between bands of bright 
water, a kiss or a plow.


at once this dragnet of cousins
whips its way into your presence saying
none of them among us. they are
oracles on the court of midnight,
the tight filigree of a mind or your
splashing around in, your pandemonium
of copper graffiti inexpertly put up.
they make weapons of furled hands.
we will walk, but our bones will carry
ribbons of lead, or we will, like
acrobats mill-headed in s  blades,
 hips,  tongues, answer to what comes
before, what comes before? eleousa,
master of dark eyelids, eye opening
like a fennel seed, you are generous
or are you not, do you shore up and
wink at the soul? what does the soul say
other than my divorce from . . ., tan
holiday . . ., smoking crystal in teak rooms . . .
but should have asked, what do you
see? the sun a sequence of fans, a bridge,
only so exquisitely cabled as to make us
still--shall we fall
or travel between bridges
among the robust, sane clouds,
a face cut from smoke, heat, and light?
the sun, dancing in a vial, the initial
memory of what it was to be born--
doberman of a sheer-white universe--
to school out--the audacity of rising
without name or color to new rooms,
new youth, fruitful, born singularly
to precise moments not in epiphany
but duration--as under new weather
we become--in action, receive--our
bodies uncasked like umbrellas under
the flamingo-red light of the racing day.


somebody who would never refuse money told me this--
about the syncretic effect when each person plugs
their attention into a field to read ad copy, let's just say
they become opened up and other beings can see into
their minds. this was considered a science fiction idea
to many people, but not to me.
in my negative space construction is always occurring.

the liftoff from awful to tolerable
to positive and then finally to bright new beautiful
has been my most difficult task to swing.
but swing i will there's nothing else to do.
i live here and being here and hearing myself
or my mind's divide through others convinces me
that i must do everything i can to save us from the pit.

that is, until the pit splits and the fruit tree finally grows.
you may have a tree of your own--you may have a home
in your own tree. congratulations. if you write an instructive
pamphlet you can bet i will read it.
i do not want to go out in darkness.
i am doing everything i know to prevent this,
and thank you, by the way, if you've written a pamphlet.

the shared information system
and each being at the end of its screen
emits an led light emitting diode on an often
green screen--you say i should give my
father up to the authorities. you blame your
circumstances on my choice--but it's the authorities who
did this to him. how do you think a person loses his mind?
he let someone take it.

he is sort of my mind and you are too,
god help me.
the green screen is an ingenious discovery.
you can record events in a studio before the screen
and then key in whatever environment you like.
it's a special color chroma green,
but it can be blue too.

the experience of things is determined by our
feelings about them. information is colored
by us. you may see remotely, in a photograph
for instance, the image of an ambush victim.
maybe it is a war andor she is caught naked.
if she is unhappy--indicated by face and body
arrangement--you may feel that.

some people will hate the state of things that made her
so alone and vulnerable but few will do anything about it.
how do you find her? what guns surround her country?
and after all, maybe she would hate it.
to have to feel grateful to someone moved by her humiliation.
she may only be thinking about humiliation.

that is a tough feeling to shake.
then, and i need not go too far into this,
then there are those who see the pain of someone
and they just love it. this may have something
to do with a revenge sentiment over their own unclosed wound.
the wound, they think, is everyone else's fault
and they cannot forgive. this is only information,
in the form of speculation.

some feelings you get when you consider
what if this happened to me? and you will want to remedy
the situation to secure yourself from the negative condition of it.
together, humans create one body--the planet earth
and its projections. the things in the stomach
affect what goes on in the head. on the web
many people make money with miracle potions.

some curb the human appetite.
some say you can lose while consuming whatever you want.
i heard the other girl refer to me as a skull.
she was very angry and did not look or say hello.
there is a prevalent competitive notion
that each only has one place. that her face is only
hers and that i don't have a face or to her it is death.

this she reads as me--the death of her.
obviously i am not. i write and read and
then roll on. i wear an ordinary human face,
some could compare me to a bird of prey
because my nose is hooked and my fingers are long
and i like to ride my bicycle with the wind at my back.
i am not here to attack.

you are also a mutant.
do you think you can keep the heavy metals outside of you?
do you think you can go to sleep here
and wake up the same?
the screen is framed by plastic,
beneath that you use words to issue commandments
or call-outs.

most people use the web to send messages
to people who are already their friends.
they make arrangements for later and
detail what happened in the past.
this information may be not true.
the web cannot know intention.
it records and is open to influence.

people make money through advertisements,
or so they think--well, selling ads, that's quantifiable--
if ads make money, that is more difficult
to know unless there are special offers.
the web is full of special offers and -day
trials. if you fall for those, or i should say,
if you respond to the offer

what often happens is that your information
is shared with other companies who will fill your inbox
with offers that which is known as spam.
because you are someone who wants to look great
and there are other companies with products compatible
with your stated desire. ways for you to achieve
the prevailing notion of beauty.

it is my job to tell you the models
are selected because they are physically improbable.
they are elevated to be made desirable.
their desirability is physical because they are models.
if it were easy to be like that, they would not
be sought-after by manufacturers.
generally, working people need to be sturdy.

advertisers want to make money.
they go with psychology and so create a sort of
self-rejection by advocating forms not reflected in most people.
they know that people will pay in to be of an elevated form
no matter what station they are from.
everyone wants to be beautiful.
everyone wants to be the agreed-upon beautiful thing.

probably everyone is beautiful somewhere inside
if not outside. you can create an excellent argument
for your being and improve upon ability. that is my opinion.
if you live alone, you may know how great the web can be.
on it there is information and pornography.
information includes
the prospects.

pornography is the biggest industry in america.
it is designed to bring about a certain state
of arousal, generally, couched in anger
that will allow the person to fuck exactly how they want to
without worrying about the one fucked.
pornography is addictive for many.
of course, sometimes people want to touch, to hear a voice

to imagine a partner and what they can do together.
the web has many dating services. my ex-psychiatrist
advised me against trying them.
she had transferred the daughter role onto me.
i do appreciate the dangers of strangers.
i am prepared with the information that pictures
are not people in both obvious and non-obvious ways.

i know at least three people who have been in love
with people they met online.
each one is intelligent and down-to-earth.
i've gleaned from their descriptions of online courting
that the early questions are essential.
that and no expectation and somehow you have
to withhold your own personal information.

that is, until you meet up in a non-threatening place.
you will have to have someone know where you are,
a point person. and you will need a defense mace, for instance
or a rape whistle or a dog leashed nearby
or in the car.
it will be important for him or her to know you have a dog.
they should meet each other as soon as possible.

this is the magic of the machine.
the meeting and love trial and,
if it works, the love made.
well, that really is amazing.
objectively amazing.
and good for the machine.
good for the machine.

the electric web courses heavily through me.
this may be how we make history
we can put up our movies, our words, or costume dramas.
we say we are so and so
and people follow the saga.
do you ever get the problem which is opposite
to the problem of the watcher?

have you ever only seen yourself through other people?
or thought that's what it was but it was really your
thought processes transferred through them?
i should look up the word rubric again.
that and lacuna and devi.
in the thrift store nobody looked at me.
but the woman said, devi hee, hee devi.

a celestial being what we all are.
true she might have meant devil.
i am not a devil.
i love my friends most of the time.
i love animals--i don't think devils do that.
my friend sends me pictures
of jackrabbits and frogs.

yesterday, he said he saw buttercups, a type of flower.
you go over the tracks first, on the other side of the river

and there they are.


the word penis is probably the most misattributed word in
english, i think. because almost nobody has a real one.
the standards are made in japanese or german factories.

wombvagina sets are unusual too if genuine.
standards are from china they are recycled sheepskin wallets.
i was shocked too when i heard this.

i do not have an actual either but they called
me a genius when i figured it out about the fetal
lambsheep skin. what else to do with all the wallets

now that there's no money? only barter.
i do not know what the inside of this thing looks like
but i think it looks like a brain made of mozzarella cheese.

standard penises are made of a certain kind of plant.
an ocean weed and how it's fitted is by body weight
at birth which is why you shouldn't smoke

if you are pregnant, you will be blamed
even though it's complicated to know exact reasons
as we all in the new world know better each day.

they've made new lingo to go with the genuine penis.
they say unicorn, i say wasabi.
apparently, almost everyone gets green horseradish with sushi.

wasabi takes several million years to grow,
its taste is delicate. when i mentioned japan
earlier, i meant the motor city.

when i say wasabi near japan it's island
of slow unit dance or remarkable mask.
when i say new world, it's where the newly suited go.

t-cell robots, we of lambs and plants and jellyfish that are
in our eyes which are colored by their place in the ocean.
really, if you broke us down, you'd have quite a collection

resins from pine, precious stones,
silver dust, and sea grass filaments,
stalks, pig livers, skin, a milk protein.

this is the equipment for the dominant standard penis holders
of the unreal, and i would love to be one with a genuine
but i have not the stomach to pull off the cunning necessary

for the genuine pursepenis license.
you barter for it you lie.
don't get me wrong, it must be nice

to have options. but to get them dishonestly?
it's bothering. i know, i know
i have got to say goodbye to the babyhood phase.

learn to thrive nobody has a father or a mother.
i know this means to thrive
to be one's own lover.

my sheepskin wallet is . . . 
what could a person say? stuck in the past,
tripped up by the concept of wallet?

it's not like anything gets taken out
unless it's rotten which it probably isn't
because i feel okay and you look alright.

it's that it wants to be ultimate although
a new and genuine vaginawomb set from a biped
has not been recorded in over  years

which means billions of herenow moments.
which means forgotten a trillion times
and remembered exactly one plus that.

there's not as much empty space as we thought
in the old blueprints that made donuts
in space--the halo, the homeric lure.

the one electron penis and the drone.
i've been sick and found all this out because i couldn't
get out of bed and there was a diamond near my head.

i was reading about moray eels,
their hydraulics. how they practically
fly-fish with agility.

it's the forward going.
i'd like to go boldly.
i've kept a card of energy.

wilderness saved from childhood.
of this secret, one must be silent
so the sun can trust us.

kids need each other.
better they never get 
separated entirely.

contra this, i do want to fly fish.
to cast off and plant it then go with
the nylon line. where to take off

the old wallet and give it back
to a lamb. i'll be the promo homo
making arrangements to go to the show

where we trade our new pieces congenially
and find others, depleted by scavengers,
and get them up-and-running to better suns,

not the promised land, exactly
the opposite. exactly the opposite
of anything promised.


--for my students

breakfast, and i'm eating plain yogurt, figs from my garden, and honey.
             i'm sitting in a lawn chair on the backyard patio--

life is good, and the sunlight warming my lap and the pages 
             of a book remind me of tucson 

and the subterranean apartment i rented alone and far from home.
             there was a sofa in front of my one window 

where at noon the sun burned briefly on the cushions as starlings 
             stirred in the trees with their admonishments.

stepping back there now, i remember feeling hopeless after reading 
             lorca's lament for ignacio snchez mejas.

i recall how i put the book on the coffee table and closed my eyes 
             and saw blood glowing in my arteries.

in the leaves, the starlings went on with their disconnected chatter,
             and i said to myself, i'll never write anything like

and the bull alone with a high heart at five o'clock in the afternoon.'
             for three months, i didn't write one word

but instead passed the days swimming in the public pool where, 
             from my half-closed eyes, i watched light ride

the splashing water or resting on the surface when i floated, face down, 
             sinking with fear what do i do now? i asked.

some nights, i filled my red truck with gas and drove west on the  
             until my headlights flooded the desert, and when 

the city was less than pinpoints of glitter, and when all i could hear 
             was the whine of silence in my ears, 

i parked alongside the highway, leaned against my pickup, and stared
             at stars so sure of themselves as they shone

that i believed they couldn't help but give me something that would
             make me sit at my desk and write. 

i felt directionless and wanted to walk out into the landscape, 
             but i feared snakes and scorpions 

hiding in the buckhorn and staghorn as i recalled my father's words, 
             you'll be lost forever on the far side of the moon--

words that haunted me as i imagined slipping into lunar shadows 
             that no human telescope would spot 

as i wandered lost and ripped with nostalgia for the nights i read
             in used bookstores on campbell--a time when 

the future seemed so clear i smelled it in dirt that somebody 
             rinsed from the sidewalk as i walked home. 

then, one night while sipping black coffee along the side of the , 
             i remembered lying on the living room floor

as my father and i listened to brahms's lullaby, which inspired me
             to practice away in a manger on my trumpet 

it's a lullaby. play it like that, my father said as my sixth grade lips 
             struggled to phrase notes that would 

please a child under the beating stars, and remembering this, 
             i looked up to the oblivious heavens 

and tied words to images--cassiopeia, perseus, cygnus, pegasus--
             and let them sing clearly through my mind.


yesterday afternoon, i hung a framed print in the living room--
a task that took two head-throbbing hours.
it's a wedding portrait that we love frida and diego rivera.
i wonder how two people could consistently hurt each other,
but still feel love so deeply as their bones turned into dust?
before frida died, she painted a watermelon still life
before his death, diego did too.
i want to believe that those paintings were composed
during parallel moments because of their undying devotion.
if i close my eyes, i can see melon wedges left like
centerpieces except for the slice
diego put on the table's corner--
one piece of fruit pecked at by a dove
that passed through a window.
i know that i won't be building a bookshelf anytime soon
and that the chances of me constructing a roll-top desk
are as slim as me building an adirondack chair that sits plumb,
but i'm good with the spackle and putty knives in my tool belt.
the knots in my back might not be there
if i had listened to her suggestions,
and i could well have done without two hours of silence
over a few holes in the wall.
but somehow, life has its ways of working things out.
this afternoon, i shut the blinds,
turned off the tv, lights, and phone,
and massaged my wife's feet to fight off a migraine--
her second one this week despite
the prophylactics and pain killers that we store in the breadbox.
for once, i'd like to experience what she feels
nausea, blindness, and pain that strike
when the cranial vessels dilate,
fill with blood, leak, and make the brain swell.
earlier, an mri triggered the reaction as it mapped her head 
with electrical current, gradient magnets, and radio waves
hammering her floundering eyes.
for now, we have our room, the bed frame, and the mattress
where she lies as i knead her toes.
come nightfall, i hope that we'll sit in the patio and watch
the breeze stirring the lemon, lime, and orange trees
that i planted along the back fence.
on certain nights, the moon turns our lawn
into green acrylic where we sip syrah and mint tea
until all we know is the sound
of our breathing among the whispering leaves.


it is farming in an inclement sun system
like a powerless nether beast
fallen amidst random stellar debris

fruit changes form
light then quavers across distorted mural relics

the farmer then living as a clarified adder
his land forms compressed
his wheat suspended & flaring
his unstable forms
carving his soil with volcanic blue seeds


					
					for me, biography is a lantern, burning in the midst of parenthetical opaqueness. in a sense, it is a ruse, a phantasmic meandering, brighter or dimmer, according to the ecletic happenstance of terror. me, i've been sired in anomaly, in an imagery of brewing grenadine riddles, a parallel poesis spawned from curious seismographic molten. i say curious, because the original stalking arc has disappeared into the wilderness of an a priori blizzard, which gives birth to a level, like a portal of fire conjoined with the lightning field of mystery. i call it the poetic guardian dove, the hieratic alien wing. it is the non-local field, the non-particle acid, flowing into my cognitive iodine rays, into the vicious fires of my tarantella marshes. so i dance with vibration, with the solar arc spinning backward around the miraculous force of a double green horizon. simultaneously, i escape the territorial, while remaining within the burning loops of my own momentary seizures, guarded by ferns, legs plowing land, the face and the mind guided by stars. so, i am a martyr of drills, of spates of specific lingual flooding, casting at times, a mist or a mirage, like a caravan of yaks, transporting tungsten and water. conversely, to give a graph of dates, to single out a bevy of personal social lesions, would invert me, would turn me around a diurnal bundle of glass, staggered, with a less than fiery temperature, partially nulling my sensitivity to falling phonemic peppers, to the inclination towards victory which burns in the dawn above heaven. for me, this is the green locale, the pleroma of eternal solar essence, glinting, full of fabulous maelstrom diamonds, an empowered hegira of drift, of claustrophobic rainbow spectrums which empty themselves, and return to themselves, like having an image go out and return to itself, so that its power transmutes by the very energy of its looping and i think of myself, the poet sending signals into mystery, and having them return to me with oneiric wings and spirals, so much so, that i forget my prosaic locale with its stultifying anchors, with its familial dotage and image reports, with its dates inscribed in trapezoidal feces. i am only concerned with simultaneity and height, with rays of monomial kindling, guiding the neo-cortex through ravens, into the ecstasy of x-rays and blackness.
				

 

it is the way i breathe
through chronic terrifying ferns
through a black ungracious stoma

it is this uranium rejoinder
this impact pointing backwards

& when witnessed
causes observers to panic
to blur
& forget
& to flee

they can't see my approach
my wayward dorsal looming
my lettering in black drizzle

it is my approach
my weaving
my sigil as curved embankment

therefore
i can never name myself
or plot myself
according to the sparks or the splinters from the work bench

dazed
ruthless with salivation
with my awkward insular roaming
i am like a few darkened eaglets riveted against the moon

then i am brought to a table by deafness
feasting with herons
which spins me by embranglement
by in-circular abatement
always seeking to have me neutered beneath my derma
so as to talk to myself
so as to cancel my structureless scrutiny

they speak of me as lawless
as despicable
as a typhoon in a sea well
as to morals
as to fixed & accelerated combination

they fix me
as deserted
bereft
as a fragment from a starving lion's compendium

i am considered
as pointless positron without image
as hieroglyph
as sundial
as martyr

being leakage from a barbarous index province


i see into them
as they see out of me
& dissolve the wattage
to avoid future legends
young pharaohs on fillmore cracking dutches 
it is a lonely frontier by contrast
forgotten game skulking around
big hearts, small temper
thine absence overflows 
thine presence undoes
do not attempt to circle the inferno
a tremor in the throne
is a tremor in the throne


					
					besides sundays there were wednesday evenings and the occasional tuesday. they called tuesdays visitation and we would meet in the parking lot and load into a van. there were little cards with peoples' names and addresses on them and we'd drive around until contact was made. i always managed to hide a few cards and claimed carsickness but it was too humid to stay in the van. oftentimes i'd recognize someone from school and felt like apologizing but couldn't. on wednesdays, it was a bit easier because we arrived early so my mom could volunteer. i skated the parking curbs on the side of the building and could hear the choir practice. other times i'd wait on the stairs at the cosmetology school next door. there was this kid who dropped out of eighth grade, and i was his lookout while he smoked. he preferred to be called fluid and got kicked out of youth group more than once. the youth minister was large and pale and wore tight shirts that made sweat stains around his belly. one day we went on a retreat that turned out to be a rented trailer in the country. in the afternoon we watched films inside and at night played games in the dark. i wound up sleeping under a table listening to sanitarium from master of puppets on repeat. the following morning my headphones were taken away so i could be open to the message. other retreats included all night bowling and friday night lock-up. arrival was at ten and they would keep us awake with caffeine, sweets, and more games. i frequently got nervous being separated into groups and remember once winning a race in the foyer wearing high-heels. later i escaped to the pews of the sanctuary. it was pitch black and i found myself standing in a drained baptismal with white robes hanging over the windows. it was strange to see where all those people went after the altar calls. those were on sunday mornings and the services were very long and formal. it was important to sit behind the older ladies so you could sleep behind their hair. after the closing song i'd wait in the car seemingly for hours, listening to mix tapes, mostly suicidal tendencies or maiden. then we'd drive to a chinese restaurant or go to this pizza place that had a buffet. i'd watch the others play video games but most of the time i'd just go outside. the clouds were always cumulus and some afternoons you could hear the wind and think about what it'd be like to be somewhere else. it really didn't matter though, maybe i could get dropped off at a friend's, watch kung-fu theater, or skate the mini-ramp in the backyard. he had twin sisters and we could do whatever we wanted.
				

 

too many are leaving
     usually they greet in sleep before dashing
as in today with this gentleman
     awkward not to type his name
when yesterday in the shower
     i remembered his face in aardvark
something about nwa but not about them
     just a played reference
there were newspaper clips
     all police brutality, all framed with snow
& i vaguely recalled something 
     about uma thurman & the menils 
when the guard ushered me out 
     for touching the african sculptures
i waited in the lobby for hours
     like this morning reading 
that he overdosed. it was a hotel 
     & i didn't even know him
i don't even know his work


i refuse to settle 
out of the true 
choose to communicate 
through pay phones and paper
out here in the country of mcallister & steiner
we are the only victorians left
& i wish i wouldn't have said 
that one something that one time
when what i really wanted
was to finish cutting the okra for the gumbo
& read baudelaire again
his l'invitation au voyage 
backwards reveals all of the magic 
in writing that one can endure
each line out loud resounds perfect
all week i've been thinking about printing
a pirated book of such, nothing grand
typed on the remington, x, no address
no copyright and fifty limited
for whomever i run into


sweetheart
when you break thru
you'll find
a poet here
not quite what one would choose.

i won't promise
you'll never go hungry
or that you won't be sad
on this gutted
breaking 
globe

but i can show you
baby
enough to love
to break your heart
forever


you are my bread
and the hairline 
noise
of my bones
you are almost 
the sea

you are not stone
or molten sound
i think
you have no hands

this kind of bird flies backward
and this love
breaks on a windowpane
where no light talks

this is not time
for crossing tongues
the sand here
never shifts

i think 
tomorrow
turned you with his toe
and you will
shine
and shine
unspent and underground


for alan
this, then, is the gift the world has given me
you have given me
softly the snow
cupped in hollows
lying on the surface of the pond
matching my long white candles 
which stand at the window
which will burn at dusk while the snow
fills up our valley
this hollow
no friend will wander down
no one arriving brown from mexico
from the sunfields of california, bearing pot
they are scattered now, dead or silent
or blasted to madness
by the howling brightness of our once common vision
and this gift of yours--
white silence filling the contours of my life.


i saw you in green velvet, wide full sleeves
seated in front of a fireplace, our house
made somehow more gracious, and you said
there are stars in your hair-- it was truth i
brought down with me

to this sullen and dingy place that we must make golden
make precious and mythical somehow, it is our nature,
and it is truth, that we came here, i told you,
from other planets
where we were lords, we were sent here,
for some purpose

the golden mask i had seen before, that fitted
so beautifully over your face, did not return
nor did that face of a bull you had acquired
amid northern peoples, nomads, the gobi desert

i did not see those tents again, nor the wagons
infinitely slow on the infinitely windy plains,
so cold, every star in the sky was a different color
the sky itself a tangled tapestry, glowing
but almost, i could see the planet from which we had come

i could not remember then what our purpose was
but remembered the name mahakala, in the dawn

in the dawn confronted shiva, the cold light
revealed the mindborn worlds, as simply that,
i watched them propagated, flowing out,
or, more simply, one mirror reflecting another.
then broke the mirrors, you were no longer in sight
nor any purpose, stared at this new blackness
the mindborn worlds fled, and the mind turned off

a madness, or a beginning?


for jackson allen
my friend wears my scarf at his waist
i give him moonstones
he gives me shell & seaweeds
he comes from a distant city & i meet him
we will plant eggplants & celery together
he weaves me cloth

                   many have brought the gifts
                   i use for his pleasure
                   silk, & green hills
                   & heron the color of dawn

my friend walks soft as a weaving on the wind
he backlights my dreams
he has built altars beside my bed
i awake in the smell of his hair & cannot remember
his name, or my own.

for nathan gebert
                                                    i
the chair from goodwill smelled of mildew.
i sat with sister ann, a franciscan. 
in her small office, at the cenacle retreat house, 
right off dixie highway in lantana, florida,
i began my story--
it was an interview, much of life is an interview.
she said i did not need to pay her, but donations,
yes, donations were appreciated
they could be left anonymously in a plain white envelope
that she could take back to the cloister.
she was dressed in a turtleneck and a denim jumper.
she could have been mistaken in a grocery store for an aging housewife.
my meetings with her went on for a few years.

i had come to speak about durell.
i did not know how to end sentences about durell.
he had taught me--what? to live? not to wince in the mirror? 
what? there were so many ways to end my sentence.
he was an unlikely candidate for so many things.
outside, it was always some subtle variation of summer.
i paused, then spoke urgently, not wanting to forget some fact, 
but much i knew i would forget or remember in a way my own,
which would not exactly be correct, no, not exactly.
durell was dead, i said, and i needed to make sense of things.

sister ann's face was open, fragile--
parts were chipped like on a recovered fresco.
above her gray head, 
a garish postcard of the emmaus scene,
the colors off, as if painted by numbers, with no concern for shading-- 
the style of it had an unoriginal catholic institutional uniformity.
there it hung, askew in its golden drugstore frame.
it was the scene from the end of luke, the two disciples,
one named cleopas, the other anonymous, 
forever mumbling christ's name, and with them, 
the resurrected christ masquerading as a stranger. 
they were on their way to that town, emmaus,
seven miles out from jerusalem,
gossiping about the impress of christ's vanishing--
they argued about whether to believe what they had seen
they were restless, back and forth the debate went--
when there is estrangement there is little peace.


                                                    ii
 
every time we met, sister ann prayed first.
at times, my recollections blurred or a presumption would reverse.
sister ann told me durell was with me still,
in a more intimate way than when he lived.
she frequently lost her equilibrium, as older people sometimes do,
before settling into her worn-out chair 
where she listened to me, week after week. 

the day i met durell, i said, the morning light was clear,
startling the town with ornament.
the steeple of christ church held the horizon in place,
or so i imagined, as if it had been painted first
with confident amounts of titanium white
before the rest was added. trees clattered.
the reiterating brick puzzle of cambridge brightened--
mass avenue, mount auburn, dunster, holyoke--
proclaimed a new september, and new students trudged the streets.
every blood-warm structure was defined in relief.

hours before, while the moon's neck wobbled on the charles 
like a giraffe's, or the ghost of a giraffe's neck, 
i imagined durell labored, having slept only a few hours,
caged in his worries of doctor bills, no money,
and running out of people to ask for it
mulling over mistakes, broken love affairs--
a hospital orderly, a man upstairs,
he probably mumbled unkind epithets about blacks and jews,
even though the men he loved were blacks and jews.
some of his blasphemies, if you want to call them that,
embarrassed me in front of sister ann,
but she seemed unflappably tolerant.

at sixty, he was unemployable.
he had taught school and guarded buildings,
each job ending worse than the last.
his refrain was always it is not easy being an impoverished aristocrat.
he spoke with the old harvard accent, 
i can still hear it, i will probably always hear it,
with new york city, the north shore and the army mixed in,
the a's broadened, the r's were flat, the t's snapped--
so a sentence would calibrate to a confident close,
like my dee-ah boy, that is that.
he lived on  garden street in a rent-controlled studio
on the second floor, number  he said the  reminded him of christmas.

at eleven o'clock, 
he probably pulled on his support hose,
increasing the circulation in his legs, blotched green and black.
next, he would have locked the door with his gold key
and moved deliberately, his smile beleaguered.
bowing to miss littlefield in the landlord's office
at the building's dark cubbyhole of an entrance
they probably spoke of queen elizabeth ii, 
her disappointments, for miss littlefield and he were royalists both.
then durell began to move towards me, entering the square.
breathing heavily, he might have passed the brattle 
advertising judgment at nuremberg--
inside the shut black theatrical box where the world repeated the past,
maximilian schell interrogated judy garland and montgomery clift
marlene dietrich let the phone ring and ring.
maybe he passed the store  sign, bright orange,
passed nini's corner where sex magazines were stacked like a cliff.
maybe, maybe. but, maybe not. 
maybe he went another way.

then i recalled how the t shook that place, 
the subway grates pushing up the scent of rat-life and all things fallen,
mixing with leavitt & peirce exuding its masculine snuff.
down plympton street he might have gone, past the grolier, 
which i always remembered, for some reason, as closed,
gilded with spines of poetry books for its reredos.
yes, he probably, most likely, certainly, did that.
sister ann wondered if i thought he paused. 
i thought not--
poetry offered him no solutions.

at twelve o'clock, 
the chairperson called our aa meeting to order.
we called ourselves the loony nooners, 
and met in a lutheran church basement.
we ate salads out of tupperware,
shaking the contents like dice to mix the dressing.
some knitted. schizophrenics lit multiple cigarettes.
acne-pocked kate wanted to be a model,
electroshock mike read paperbacks,
and an irish professor named tom,
welcomed tellus, who could not get over nam.
darkened figures in the poor light, we looked like the burghers of calais,
and smelled of brewed coffee, smoke, perfume, urine, human brine. 
we were aristocrats of time
i have twenty-one years, i have one week, i have one day.
i have often thought we were like first-century christians--
a strident, hidden throng, electrified by a message.
or, another way of thinking of us, 
is that we were inconvenient obstacles 
momentarily removed, much to the city's relief.
from each window well, high heels and business shoes hurried.
durell h., as he was known to us, took his place,
his thick hair fixed as the waves of an s nautical painting
perhaps he kept it set with hair spray?,
his tiffany ring polished to a brilliance,
he set himself apart in his metal folding chair.
he had the clotted girth of hermann gring.
what was he thinking about?
was he thinking about blood clots and possible aneurysms?
imperious, behind prism-like trifocals,
quietly he said to me, i've grown as fat as elizabeth taylor.


                                                    iii
 
the meeting ended and durell folded his metal chair.
he hated his christian name--
durell, he said, who names their child durell?
moving among the crowd, listening to success and failure,
he passed out meeting lists, literature, leaflets.
durell sponsored men, he referred to them as pigeons.
i met him that day. i was his last.

after that, every day we spoke on rotary phones.
i was young and spoke as if my story was the only one.
i told him i had underlined key passages in plato's symposium,
told him i had been graded unfairly on dante's inferno and purgatorio,
told him my schedule might not allow for the paradiso.
he matched my telling with listening, advising, 
and more listening, mostly over the phone, 
and the more he listened the more he was alone. 
why was that? sister ann asked.
it was some sort of offering, perhaps. 
at times it seemed he needed to guarantee a pardon,
that old catholic idea of indulgences 
lurked somewhere there unspoken,
as if he believed a larger offering might guarantee a larger pardon. 
such a task demanded his increased singleness. 
yes, that was true. or was it?
i had trouble settling on the right words with sister ann.
many of my words were not exactly right, the syntax awkward.
i kept having trouble translating durell, so much i guessed. 
how to know?
why hadn't i asked him more questions?
he wasn't the sort that invited questions, i do remember that.
another way of saying it was that when he was with me, 
on the phone, then and only then, did he seem to move in truth 
and in his truths, reprimanding and hard, 
he was made more singular. maybe that was it.
whatever the case, he listened, he listened to me.
i missed his listening.
listening, sister ann said, is a memorable form of love.

after the meeting, he gave me his calling card.
the cards were placed inside his compulsively polished silver card case,
the black capitals raised on their ecru background,
containing his name, bracketed by a mr. and a jr.--
the mr. denoting lost civility,
the jr. tallying a lineage that did not bridge.
as we walked down church street, the bells of st. john the evangelist rang.
the road was bright, the road full.
behind the brown gate with the thick black rusted latch,
the monks sang, it is well, it is well, with my soul, with my soul.
we peered in at bookshop clerks locating titles,
watch repairmen bent over lit ocular devices, fixing movements,
florists, hands wet, arranging stems and branches broken.
we saw ourselves reflected.
i laughed with deference, the way a student laughs before a teacher.
his skin was flecked with milk-blues, lead-whites, earthen reds.
in dress and demeanor he was as rigid as a toy soldier,
for he was a part of a republic with standards, atrophied, devoted to order.

everyone found him impossible,
including, at times, me.
of queers, his word for what he was but could not admit to,
he said, you know in the army they could never be trusted.
i mentioned romantic love.
in profile, a silhouette, he paused.
he said, it has been very vexing, indeed.
by his tone, i knew never to ask again.
a decorum of opprobrium kept him whole,
and so he guarded himself with intensity. 
maybe, sister ann suggested, he was guarding me.

durell said, i've whittled my world down to no one,
spencer, with the possible exception of you.


                                                    iv
 
what happened then? sister ann asked.
he excused himself with a handshake, his palms soft as bread dough
from all the jergens he had slathered on,
and then he probably returned to his ambry of a studio, 
a place where i would be one of his only visitors.
although he handed out his number, he did not always answer.
i remember...
what do i remember?... 
i was free to turn away but the moment i looked back,
durell would come back to me, 
waiting for me. it seems to me now, after all this time, 
few things have as much fidelity as the past.

i remember he had nailed memorabilia above his head
as one would place stones to fortify a castle
a photograph of him in the army, liberating people, undoing russian codes
a framed marriage license from england
although the marriage failed, he often mumbled her name
his framed diploma, harvard, and over the corner hung
his graduation cap's faded black tassel.
next to his pill bottles, an edward viii coronation mug he doted on,
commemorating an event that never took place.
maybe he made a bread and baloney sandwich.
maybe he stepped over the rolled-up tag-sale carpet and drew the shades.
by late evening, he might have jotted down notes about god,
obedient as he was to the twelve steps of aa.
he might have written in his tightly-looped feminine penmanship,
informed by the palmer method,
and later repeated a phrase or two to me over the phone.
or maybe he read from his twenty-four hours a day book
to find a rule maybe, or to search for a sanctuary.
or maybe he listened to the reverend peter gomes on the radio,
the plummer professor of christian morals at harvard,
for he often mentioned how he loved the preacher's parallel constructions,
yes, maybe he did that, maybe, possibly, he did that.

and then, perhaps, he slept a bit
before the whole routine began once more 
with the support hose, the hair spray, miss littlefield, the sex magazines, 
the grolier, the folding chair, the meeting, the calling card.
how crazy america was, he said, how he wanted to leave,
but he never left town, except jolting trips to the hospital
in an ambulance down all those brick roads.


                                                    v
 
i lived in cambridge two years. 
after that, wherever i moved, we spoke, daily, over the phone, on landlines --
talking and listening, listening and talking, for fifteen years
you alright? yes. you?
in all that time, i saw him only once more, and by then he was nearly blind.
in all that time, we barely touched one another.
why our relationship required its rood screen, 
i could not fully explain to sister ann,
indeed, i can never seem to properly explain it to anyone.
but i have tried, and i will probably always keep trying.
but if i get nothing right,
i must try to get a nuance of our friendship
and his sponsorship right-- 
we were bound, bound by a vow, a vow of attention
there are many causes for attention, among them redemption.
our attention concerned the spirit,
although that sounds pious and we were not so pious,
we were more selfish, more human than pious.
what else can i say?
i needed a liberator
and liberators can come in some unexpected guises.
i may never wholly explain the two of us.
perhaps the spirit defies the human mind, 
even after all my time with sister ann.

finally, from a hospital, came the report of durell's last day.
a charge nurse said i touched the gangrene leg, pink flesh was coming back.
his compliments had increased the more his life failed.
in the final week, he quoted cole porter songs to me--
you're a bendel bonnet, a shakespeare sonnet, you're mickey mouse...
i did not repeat the rhymes to sister ann.
who durell was and why he did what he did and why he hid
what he hid i kept asking her. 
sister ann quoted from deuteronomy
i set before you life and death...choose life.

old pigeon flying back,
when i arrived at the hospital his body was gone.
the formalities were few,
for he had become a ward of the state.
the staff gave me a brown grocery bag of his things
a roll of dimes, a pair of shoes, a belt buckle, an einstein quote,
something about mediocre minds.
afterwards, i went through cambridge and found the meeting gone.
night was coming. 
blindness worked on the people, shops, churches, streets.
no one knew me.
people said where will we go? and what will we eat?
i thought i recognized this or that face, but no, no, too much time had passed.
on church street, restaurants had replaced bookstores.
windows on mass avenue shone with chandeliers.
someone backed up photographing with a flash.
hold still, they said, hold still.
a new set of homeless people pleaded,
coins rattled inside the used coffee cups they shook.
everyone moved with packages, briefcases, textbooks, flash cards, cell phones, flowers.
the charles advanced, determined as a hearse,
its dark waters gathering up every unattached thing.
an umber, granular dusk-light fell on the elms over harvard yard
as they swayed dark and slow
like the chords in the waltz from copeland's rodeo.
there i stood, unsure of which way to go.
the light had more ghosts in it as it must have had that day in emmaus.


                                                    vi
 
suddenly, sister ann announced our last meeting.
down the linoleum hallway,
sister katherine and sister ruth moved and prayed.
their numbers had dropped from seven to six,
and the nuns decided the retreat house would close.
soon, the chapel and offices would be leveled and replaced with condominiums.
in the halls, the swoosh-snap of duct tape yanked, pulled and cut,
straps tightened, vans bleating, and backing up into the back,
weather reports exchanged with the movers.
sister ann told me about herself that final time
parents dead, alcoholic brother dead,
the brother embarrassed she had been a nun.
she opened her bible on the shipping box between us,
leaned in, her hearing aids on, her silver crucifix knocking on her chest.
above her head, a nail where the emmaus scene had hung.

i asked what caused him to remain? 
why did he want freedom for me?
sister ann spoke then of the gospel of john
and the samaritan woman at the well, 
the one married nearly as many times as elizabeth taylor, 
and how when christ listened to her she became the first evangelist. 
it was christ's longest conversation with anyone sister ann said.
the samaritan woman's life changed because christ listened to her.

john k., from the meetings, dead now too, once said
oh, i knew durell. he was odd. but we're all odd you know.
all i know now
is the more he loved me the more i loved the world.


                                                    vii
 
i lost track of sister ann. 
i have often thought about her and all the time she spent with me.
i have wanted to tell her now for some time
that not long after the cloister closed, durell's sister located me,
leaving a message on my answering machine,
it was still the time of answering machines,
inviting me to her winter house in boynton beach.

durell's sister gave me directions. 
she was quite close to me, as it turned out.
she had some of durell's belongings that she wanted me to have.
there isn't much, she said. 
but still, i think you should have what's here.
durell spoke of his sister often, 
but i did not know his family.
however, when we met, we recognized each other
as one sometimes recognizes what one has never seen before.

i said to her he knew me better than anyone.
the sentence surprised us.
we sat by the pool in her gated country club.
the florida evening was a watercolor in the making,
colors bleeding into striking mistakes.
after all the members withdrew, 
she said, there are many things you do not know about my brother.
a worker folded terry cloth towels under a bamboo hut.
her voice halted as voices halt 
when words have been withheld. 
they called him names, she said, a nancy boy, a priss, a sissy, a fairy...
the pool's tempos ceased 
until the silence about us was the silence in a palace.

light disappeared everywhere. 
the sun fell. she looked away,
said that he'd been to the army language school,
learned german and russian, played the organ in his spare time,
mentioned he'd taken music with copland at harvard
he had received a gentleman's c'-- 
the c stood for copland she said he always said--
which made us laugh and seemed to beckon him to us.
he had hoped for an army career, she went on,
and then she mumbled something about a little german town, 
i think she said it was in schleswig-holstein, near lbeck,
where he was stationed while borders were being redrawn,
the letters stopping, the army, the men, something, the drink...
and then her words fell and sank 
into subtle variations of all that goes unsaid.

we heard the distant sound of a train on its track,
crossing the florida map going brown then black.
he became difficult, isolated--
she spoke softly then like the penitent.
he was always asking for money.
as his requests persisted she began to screen her calls. 
it became easier to tell him i had not been home, she said.
his behavior was affecting her marriage.
she chose never to introduce her children to durell.
perhaps he had a mental illness, perhaps he invented-- 
perhaps, perhaps, perhaps--
but no, she pressed on, perhaps it was his sexuality, he was too sensitive...
people can be cruel, she said.
she felt he had never adjusted to cruelty
as if cruelty was something that one needed to adjust to.
later, he was picked up for charges of soliciting sex.
and the more she told me, the less i knew.
all about us, a stillness began to displace the light
and durell was there, and no longer there, staining that stillness.
after an estrangement ends there comes a great stillness, 
the greater the estrangement the greater the stillness.
across the parking lot, a gate rattled.

i told her he often said his life had been a failure,
i tried to convince him otherwise, but he never believed me.
half a century ago, she broke off contact.
her protracted estrangement made her look ill.
please, please, she said.  
her voice trailed off,
although what she was pleading for was not clear.
no, no, she did not want her grandchildren to know.
subtle variations of florida evening light withdrew with finality.
the pool brightened with moonlight, the color of snow.
the pool was still.
there we were,
a man and a woman sitting in cushioned lounge chairs, 
as if the world would always be an endless pair of separated things.
we did not touch each other.
we were still a long time.


the field blank in snow. but i mean this page.
now print mars the surface to make surface
seen. sheen only error brings. perfect rage
so the sun rises. rage is your slow practice
that makes of every day another day
in whose gathering promise the shy sparrows
shiver instead of sing. i want to go away.
see these footsteps? these black shapes in the snow?
if there is a word for them, it's no word 
i know. pursuit?, no. proof?, no. don't call it fear.
could i cross this white sheet if i were coward,
edge to edge, margin to margin, never
referring to anything outside itself?--
stop that. stop pointing to the photo on the shelf.


to make beauty out of pain, it damns the eyes--
no, dams the eyes. see how they overflow?
no damns them, damns them, and so they cry.
what shape can i swallow to make me whole?
baby's bird-shaped block, blue-painted wood
that fits in the bird-hole of the painted wood box?
the skeleton leaf? the skeleton key? loud
knock when the shape won't unlock any locks.
i hear it through the static in the baby's room
when the monitor clicks on and off, sound
of sea-ice cracking against the jagged sea-rocks,
laughing gull in the gale. what is it dives down
past sight, down there dark with the other blocks?
it can't be seen, only heard. a kind of curse,
this kind curse. forgive me. blessing that hurts.


the holes have
almost left the 
sky and the blanks
the paths--the
patches next to
natural, corroborated
by the incidental
sounds of practical
activities and crows,
themselves exhibiting
many of the earmarks
of the actual. this
must have happened
many times before,
we must suppose.
almost a pulse
if we could speed
it up the repeated
seeking of our several
senses toward each
other, fibers trying to
reach across the gap
as fast as possible,
following a blast.


we say 
pinhole. 
a pin hole 
of light. we
can't imagine 
how bright 
more of it 
could be, 
the way
this much
defeats night.
it almost
isn't fair,
whoever 
poked this, 
with such 
a small act 
to vanquish
blackness.




lynette, the stars are kerned so far apart--
through a herniated zodiac i almost see your waled skylanes, your shocked capricorn and cancer.
in the hundred and two years since you were born, and the sixteen since your heart failed, and the nearly sixty since you gave up poetry, it seems we can't navigate by the same star chart.
i'd like to think we were fated to work the same coracle you steering with one hand, grasping your corner of the seine while i grasp mine together sweeping the weirs.

lynette saw the sky made wide-waled corduroy by the flight paths of fighter jets.
corde du roi--cloth of the king.
a baseless assertion, states the oed.
a fireman from the midlands nfs said the raids on swansea were worse than on birmingham, where a ten-year-old roy fisher gaped at the garden where his cousins were slaughtered, and later wrote, it was like a burst pod filled with clay.

last night, lynette, my son thought he saw his father in the jumbo jet roaring over cherryhurst the weather softer, flight paths altered.
three weeks now his father gone.

                                                                             

insofar as moses came to in a coracle, it wasn't a welsh one-off it wasn't a hapax of vessels.
insofar as it's kind of a kiddie boat, not a kayak, not the royal barge the makah sent william blake, aka johnny depp, with into the northern pacific not even the viking ship, its carved prow like an uncial insofar as it is calico wrapped up in tar, insofar as it is swaddled willow whippets.

                                                                             

pastoral ding-dong is out, lynette wrote, and no wonder-- bombs hidden on the glossy knolls. 
in the sorrel. 
in the tormentil.
i thought she was perhaps the closest i could get to my grandmother.
while lynette was writing displaced persons--

                   neither from the frosted leaf nor from
                   the grey hard ground could they find
                   relief

--lydia was migrating, on foot, a thousand miles from minsk to hanover through the german lines in a different tongue.
i only have this tongue, so i adopt lynette's epic as a stand-in.
she slipped back to childhood in buenos aires, garrulous in her dying, her children spiriting a spanish dictionary into the facil with them on visits.
i would see again so paolo, she wrote my mother would be reared there the coffee-colored house with its tarmac roof.
i can imagine myself down the same funnel reverting to portuguese and the small pure word-hoard shared between child and grandparent suja, limpo, bom, mau, com fome, cansado.
porcaria.
disgraada
let my children bring the dictionary too.

lynette was ardent for penillions, and experimented with a poem on rain by using all words which had long thin letters....
maybe you thrill to such things when english isn't fully naturalized.
hers was a poetry full of metals and alloys air raids they were, ear raids...

                                                                             

i'm not so much crusted with parasangs, or dipped in leagues, as fried in miles of a journey resembling the arc between cleo and asp.
the jacuzzi, on a timer, sank a quarter-hour in froth on a fifty-degree afternoon. 
there were sight lines to windy breakers, heaving palms we floated like epiphytes grown from pond scum, flowers of the abyss.

the meliorative, moist air was soft around a gigantic neon cross.
and it's true i found it hard to think of you with the hardness i thought of myself.
since it took hundreds and hundreds of dollars of posters to adorn the walls of that apartment
pillsbury dough kitsch an art deco cigar teetering on a stiletto a wall plaque of a trilobite fossil photo of the sydney opera house at night a three-foot geode with its own spotlight on the end of what looked like a colonoscope--
since it took all that to match the bric-a-brac on the beach, the beach that stretched to fill the picture window, 
i thought it took many waves to round the facts an asp to soften geometric cleopatra and that giant cross was earth's axis extracted--
tendering foliage over all of florida.

                                                                             

i'm in the backyard weeding cotyledons.
croton.
it's spring. 
there's larvae noodling in the soil.
i was rendering a whipping' stitch, lynette wrote, on a silk-and-georgette petticoat, the utility of which would be tested in dover, where keidrych had been called up to man the anti-aircraft guns.
had his conscientious objector status been approved on appeal, no end to their arcadia.
dylan read rabelais, drank with keidrych lynette visited with caitlin.
household talk. 
debts. 
children. 
insofar as croton is rank with cotyledons, insofar as weeding is gleeful, insofar as the seed case still caps their tips, i am revising the look of spring on the face of the village.
insofar as moses slips through the reeds in his coracle.
with new beaks scissoring the air.

                                                                             

lynette's village, llanybri, is pronounced clan-ubree.
even the l's turn into c's where modern warfare enters the poem as discord clinic air. 
st. cadoc and curlews versus confervoid cranch-crake versus ceraunic clouds into euclidian cubes grid air is planed.
where did she get the nerve?

i pencil in her age where various dates are given  when she began gods with stainless ears  when she had her first child,  when she had the second  or  when she divorced.
the nervous breakdown came at .
jehovah's witness thereafter.
lynette, if you were here, i'd ask you the one salient question for a woman at the midpoint of life
how not to harden?

                                                                             

in little sparta, ian hamilton finlay made an image of an oerlikon gun and inscribed

                                                                     to apollo 
                                 his music                his missiles                his muses

like lynette he observed the swarm-like behavior of fighter jets.
he saw flame-bearing honey in the gasoline leaked by immolated warships.
he commemorated the flower class corvette, each a small naval vessel named for a blossom. 
alyssum.
loosestrife.
the fragility of men in battle.
the loosestrife had eight mounts for each two-pound pom-pom anti-aircraft gun.
this was no arcadian ding-dong either, as the corduroy bridge finlay built on a stream had a line from heraclitus on each plank
that which joins and that which divides is one and the same.
lynette says he, of bethlehem treading a campaign....

                                                                             

it's the nickel in my cheap wedding ring that brings on this rash that starts at the corners of my lips.
the ring bought at age twenty-one, paid for with the tips from buddy's crabs and ribs.
which i now paint religiously with clear nail polish on the inner band, across the names, the ampersand, where the graving bit exposed the nickel.

                out of this hard. out of this sheet of zinc.
                . . .
                we, he and i ran
                on to a steel escalator, the white
                electric sun drilling down on the cubed ice
                our cyanite flesh chilled on aluminum

                rail.

the tin madonnas of warplanes, writ small and annular in marriages, hammered out in lynette's ear raids.

                                                                             

my library is wreathed in double staircases climbing to a glass dome.
i imagine birds trapped at the top, a cucucurrucued curricula, forming and dissolving figures ad hoc.
insofar that these are books that were ernes, atom-wise, in former eons.

the abbess of streoneshall, caedmon's abbess, hilda, was announced to her mother in a pregnancy dream a most valuable jewel delivered from under her garments.
she wrote one of the books in this aerie, this library, wreathed in double staircases lodged also in subdural interfaces.
insofar as we're just pre-ceviche, pre-cadavers-reinterpreting-flan, lynette, let's research articles, with babies at our feet on welsh architecture, the potato tax, coracles...
i see you floating out to sea in your coracle, the spirit of the makah accompanying you as far as the azores halfway from a kitchen garden in llanybri, halfway to a quinta in buenos aires.




he was cleaning leaves for one at a time
was what he needed and a minute before the two
brown poodles walked by he looked at the stripped-down trees
from one more point of view and thought they were
part of a system in which the dappled was foreign
for he had arrived at his own conclusion and that was
for him a relief even if he was separated,
even if  his hands were frozen,
even if the wind knocked him down,
even if his cat went into her helpless mode
inside the green and sheltering japanese yew tree.


having outlived allen i am the one who 
has to suffer new york all by myself and 
eat my soup alone in poland although
sometimes i sit with linda he met in berkeley
or san francisco when he met jack, the bread
just coarse enough, the noodles soft but not
thin and wasted, and not too salty the way the
chinese further down sometimes make them, the
name still on my mind whatever the reason for
mystery, or avoidance, though rat netanyahu
and pig that swings from a needle or lives in some
huge incubator, they do darkness where there
was light, the name hates them, the name
in hiding, the name with a beard, and linda she
loves the name though she invokes her christ
as jack her lover and tormentor did and
taught her to do though it is too easy, that,
it troubles me but what can i say, what should i
say while we walk north on the right hand side,
past the pork store and the hardware store, me lecturing
on logos my god and what not hebrews and greeks
where allen and i once kissed, jack in the sun now.


where we could be boys together. this region of want
the campestrial flat. the adolescents roving across the plat.
come hither. he-of-the-hard would call me hither.

sheer abdomen, sheer slickensides, the feldspar buttes
that mammillate the valley right where it needs to bust. 

and i could kiss his tits and he could destroy me 
on the inflorescent slopes in his darkest dingles
upon the grassland's raffish plaits. and he could roll me
in coyote brush i who was banished to the barren
could come back into his fold, and i
would let him lay me down on the cold, cold ground.

clouds, above, lenticular, the spreading fundament, 
a glorious breech among the thunderheads
and in their midst, a great white heron magnifies 
the day. we'd keep together, he and i,
and we'd gain meaning from our boyage we'd pursue
each other through the crush of darkling rifts.
climb into each other's precipitous coombes.

where would it end, this brush and bush, this brome
and blazing star? there is always some new way
to flex a limb and find its secret drupe.

not only the hope of nature the nature of hope

so long as culverts carry us, so long as we stay ripe
to one another's lips, and welcoming to hands,
as long as we extend our spans, to tangle them, 
as spinning insects do their glistered floss.

this is not a time to think the trumpet vine is sullen.
rather the trumpet's bell is but a prelude.
it says we all are beautiful at least once.
and, if you'd watch over me, we can be beautiful again.  




the mask? because we were never ugly
enough. because our ugliness was epic.
because we were given to it, because 
we were so misgiven. you wear one. i
wear one. yes. kings, pharaohs had them
fabricated, poured out in gold and beaten.
most wore them to the grave. in mexico
the living wear them, not to scare the dead
away, but as invitation. they leave candy
on the mounds of those they mourn. new
orleans? women wear them in order
to bare everything else. men wear them
in order to watch. i can remember, back
before it all grows grim, making one
out of the news, trying to paste it together. 
i remember my mother helping me. i don't 
really remember my father. something
like a face, like the man in the moon.
i understand we're hardwired this way,
to make faces before anything else.
it's why we see the madonna in mold,
alien architecture in martian crater creep.
we keep looking for those first faces, first
familia. every culture, every eon. witness 
the oldest we know, his cave, his wall, one
hundred seventy centuries gone. they call 
him sorcerer. they call me knight.
we have always lived in the dark.


suffer as in allow.

list as in want.

listless as in transcending
desire, or not rising
to greet it.

to list
is to lean,
dangerously,
to one side.

have you forgotten?

spent
as in exhausted.



                

what do we like best
about ourselves?

our inability
to be content.

we might see this
restlessness

as a chip
not yet cashed in.

                

you appear 
because you're lonely

maybe. 
you would not say that.

you come to tell me
you're saving money
by cooking for yourself.

you've figured out
what units you'll need

to exchange for units
if you intend

i know i mustn't
interrupt

                

hectic and flexible,

flames

are ideal

new bodies for us



					
					no longer if we'll get cancer but when, the doctor said. now questions accrete around the irritant like pearl not when but how? not how but whom? and then why. and then why not. i take a can of ashes to the beach and empty them into the wind. outside the trash man collects bottles like a miser rattling his jewels, tossing them onto the growing heap.
				

 

					
					the pond is sheathed in ice, a duck troubles the reeds, the air around us still enough to hear the baby stir, but we don't know where it is yet. by the force of our longing it is getting made for us, as thrilled people, palms full of seed, long for the chickadees to light, and they do. light.
				

 

					
					i came upon the gnawed torso of a seal, silver fur agleam against the sand like a coin thrown down in a losing bet. what left this bounty of meat on the beach to rot? i watched the neighbor's small boys skirt the dead seal the way sandpipers tease themselves in the surf, dodging up and back along the body's shore. it's dead, i told their father as he ambled behind them up the beach. he called to the little boys, his voice borne toward them on the mild breeze. boys, come back, he said, and they did not.
				

 

					
					i used to love the run-up to a storm, watching from the porch as the grown-ups hurried to bring things in, my mother rummaging through drawers for a flashlight, cursing nothing was where it was supposed to be in our house. it can't be so, but the only people i ever remember huddled in the basement were my mother and me, suspended in that eerie half-light like bats. we've just spent a week like this, my mother perched in a chair above the water keeping watch for the next bad thing. we were happy so sometimes she'd let the vigil rest, the sentry of her shoulders easing to a more receptive pose, a quarter moon, until something called her back to the watch, mother first no longer but this white, foremost light. you can read by it. you can see.
				

 

it seems like you could, but
you can't go back and pull
the roots and runners and replant.
it's all too deep for that.
you've overprized intention,
have mistaken any bent you're given
for control. you thought you chose
the bean and chose the soil.
you even thought you abandoned
one or two gardens. but those things
keep growing where we put them--
if we put them at all.
a certain kind of eden holds us thrall.
even the one vine that tendrils out alone
in time turns on its own impulse,
twisting back down its upward course
a strong and then a stronger rope,
the greenest saddest strongest
kind of hope.


one cuts blocks
from the abundant river,
hauls them house to house.
 
one falls, unseen,
the heart
inoculated cold
 
against a sky still moving.
moving even now
above the river,
the canal.
willows shimmering
 
across the water,
muskrats diving out of reach.
the river whispers
till it freezes--
 
a body
twirling sluggishly
beneath the surface as again
 
one stack, then
spreads the straw.
 
another falters,
slips, or
puts a sliver on your tongue
to feel it melting there--
the ice-lit
 
underworld
of someone else.


imagine cities you've
inhabited, streets
paved in lava stone.
you never intended to pray
 
in the temples, had
nothing to sell.
now imagine yourself
 
returning to those same cities.
hunt for people you knew,
knock on their doors.
ask yourself
 
where are the vases, animals
etched in gold?
where are the wines
 
from distant places,
banquets ferreted
from the bowels of the earth?
while you were missing
 
other people wore
your garments,
slept in your bed.
 
how frightening
the man who said
in his affliction
 
wood has hope.
cut down
it will flourish.
 
if the root grows old
and the trunk withers
in dust, at the scent of water
it will germinate.


accompanied
to the campi flegrei
by a shadow,
 
she listened to voices rise
from the darkness,
then recede.
 
instruments

when one had finished
 
others played.

sung boldly.

i left here at eight
and returned at .
in between
 
i largely wasted america.
i married, had children,
distinguished myself in a profession
 
full of fools, becoming one myself,
as is the way
of this or, i suppose, of any other world.
 
i missed
the nobel but i did bring down
the pulitzer. the weather,
 
the politics, the stars,
and my own small contribution
all lined up, and i got one.
 
so pulitzer became my middle name
before i came here, where no one cares
a whit about such things.
 
i failed at love.
that's where i truly fucked up.
i couldn't.
 
the women in this town
are mostly severe, resentful
--the men bitter, disappointed
 
a perfect place for my purposes.
i stay in a room
in the house of an old woman
 
who doesn't want to have sex any more
and neither do i
so we do not
 
trouble each other on that front,
which is good.
i do like to drink.
 
i used to love to eat
but then i don't much
give a shit
 
about any of that now.
the old woman sometimes says wistfully
god will soon be calling both of us
 
back home, but as an agnostic
i don't believe that.
as an american,
 
i don't buy that.
i came here to retire from love,
to face my failure to love
 
as i attempted to face everything
else before, and that
is exactly what i am doing and doing
 
with the exactness i used to put into
my work, for which i received the pulitzer.
i hate a coward.
 
my son
came here the other day and asked
exactly when i might
 
be coming back
and i sent him off without an answer.
the answer
 
seems to be staying here,
staying honestly here and coming to terms
with my greatest single failure.
 
my wife is dead. to me,
it seems i am left over
to eat a shit sandwich.
 
eat me, the world says,
now that i have lost my appetite.
we used to say, eat me
to each other in high school,
another thing from which no one
ever recovers. america likes to think
 
every one can recover from every thing,
but about this,
especially, america is wrong.


home from school at six years old, first grade,
and uncle there to tell me mommy
gone, mommy not be coming back any
 
time soon, liam, mommy had to go to
mental hospital. nervous breakdown.
years later mommy, when she gets out
 
of mental, often says, if you're
a bad boy for me liam you're
going to send me back, back
 
into mental hospital, like you did
first time. at 
i find out mom had been doing years
 
in a federal prison all that time,
for stealing, so no mental hospital for
mommy. breakdown ours alone.
 
i was on my one.


soon the summer
now the pleasant purgatory
of spring is over,
 
soon the choking
humidity
in the city
 
on the fire escapes
in a sleeveless t-shirt
smoking a cigar
 
in tune with the tremor
of the mindless yellow
commercial traffic
 
moving in the city,
where no one really
buys a car,
 
american
or otherwise,
where we will,
 
as rilke said we would
where we will
wake, read, write
 
long letters
and in the avenues
wander restlessly
 
to and fro
on foot in
the humidity,
 
where soon i'll shower, dress,
take the dog out for a piss,
and mail this.


sam paused on the stairs. he had forgotten a thing.
in leland's room a copy of thomas merton lay on the floor.
the air was full of gnats of possibility. what was the story?
sam looked at the clock twice. the day was dropping
softly away while sam's sneakers made the wood stairs creak.
the wood was sure it was wood. alice got home from the store.
the bags had to be unloaded as the day went and went.
then the sundown kitchen grew quiet.
sam crossed his legs one way, then the other way. he had chosen
purple corduroys. they were pants of the day one possibility.
on the tilted table sat the damaged typewriter.
what about thomas merton? did he know the central story?
someone was quietly reading by the fireplace but not sam.
next day there was badminton with the troubled carpenter
and the story of an awful egg salad, causing laughter
but sam had forgotten some thing. then alice brought in
the brownies and minor pleasure colored the house
 
and there went the evening. j.j. came downstairs
all gleamy from her bath. she had three reasons to get downtown fast.
sam picked up a novel by sukenick. the clue must be nearby.
between sam and the page swarmed the gnats of possibility.
leland stowed his bicycle in the basement and came upstairs
with a point about capitalism. look at the time said someone.
where was j.j. now? where was the story? under the red chair
lay the newspaper whose relevance was all mystery or
not mystery enough. then alice went out to see a movie.
some man meets some woman with big eyes on a jet
and changes his whole life for her, disastrously but thrillingly.
alice told about it briefly, and went to make tea. sam paused
on the hard wooden stairs. j.j. was gone. she was gone.
leland was eating yogurt at midnight. the whole brown house
was floating, gliding very smoothly for some reason
with sam not clear whether the gliding was a story
and if so was it central and was it his?


for example, i wrote my first poem in  about being in the vermont house
after my mother's death she died the year before
she loved that house. my father said he kept having moments
of thinking she must have just stepped outside for a minute
to weed the garden or to walk just a little way
along prospect street, for a few minutes only and now
almost now she'd be coming back, we'd hear the screen door,
bev would be back and saying something casual about--
 
about the cats, daphne and chloe, or about mrs. yamokofsky next door
or about the pear tree, or a colored stone she found.
that was the phrase that ended my poem in 
or a colored stone she found. the phrase rang slightly false
but i wanted it--the ound and one sounds sounded profound
and in  stone was still a word guaranteed poetic.
but did my mother ever pick up colorful stones?
wasn't that more something i did fifteen years earlier?
in the poem i was trying to turn my ironic mother into
an ideal figure certified sweet like a child.
 
but what could i make her say? something very sly and wry?
the poetry would be in her voice, the way of her voice being
hers--voice of my mother--whether the words were about
the cats or mrs. yamokofsky or potatoes to peel for mashing.
not your mother. my mother. poetry of her
saying in her bev way those potatoes or mrs. yamokovsky
or daphne's gone down by the black river
but if we feed chloe i'm sure she'll be back.
and my father and kimbo and me just going yeah or in a minute
because this was all just life.


the connection between divorced fathers and pizza crusts
is understandable. the divorced father does not cook
confidently. he wants his kid to enjoy dinner.
the entire weekend is supposed to be fun. kids love
pizza. for some reason involving soft warmth and malleability
 
kids approve of melted cheese on pizza
years before they will tolerate cheese in other situations.
so the divorced father takes the kid and the kid's friend
out for pizza. the kids eat much faster than the dad.
before the dad has finished his second slice,
 
the kids are playing a video game or being ace ventura
or blowing spitballs through straws, making this hail
that can't quite be cleaned up. there are four slices left
and the divorced father doesn't want them wasted,
there has been enough waste already he sits there
 
in his windbreaker finishing the pizza. it's good
except the crust is actually not so great--
after the second slice the crust is basically a chore--
so you leave it. you move on to the next loaded slice.
finally there you are amid rims of crust.
 
all this is understandable. there's no dark conspiracy.
meanwhile the kids are having a pretty good time
which is the whole point. so the entire evening makes
clear sense. now the divorced father gathers
the sauce-stained napkins for the trash and dumps them
 
and dumps the rims of crust which are not
corpses on a battlefield. understandability
fills the pizza shop so thoroughly there's no room
for anything else. now he's at the door summoning the kids
and they follow, of course they do, he's a dad.


it would have been dark but not lugubrious. it would have been
fairly short but not slight. it would have contained a child
saying something inadvertently funny that was not said by my daughter,
something strangely like what your daughter or sister said once
if you could remember. the child's voice flies across
a small parking lot where, in one of the cars,
a man and a woman sit listening to the silence between them.
the child's voice probably hurts them momentarily
with a sense of beauty apparently very possible
yet somehow out of reach. in the missing poem this is
implied, conveyed, transmitted without being flatly said.
and it does a dissolve into the look of a soccer field
after a game--the last three or four players walk
slowly away, their shin-guards muddy, their cleats caked,
one player dragging a net bag full of soccer balls--
the players seem to have known what it was all for
yet now they look somehow depleted and aimless there
at the field's far end and a block away on a wood-grainy porch
the eyes of a thin woman sixty-three years old search the shadows
in each passing car, as the poem recalls what she wants to recall.
hours later the field is dark
 
and the hills are dark and later even firehouse pizza has closed.
in the missing poem all this pools into a sense of how much
we must cherish life the world will not do it for us.
this idea, though, in the missing poem is not smarmy.
remember when you got the news of the accident--
or the illness--in the life of someone
more laced into your life than you might have thought
the cool flash of what serious is. well,
the missing poem brings that. meanwhile not seeming like
an imitation of mark strand or mark doty or mark jarman
yet not like just another halliday thing either.
instead it would feel like a new dimension of the world,
the real world we imagine. with lightness
with weight and lightness and, on the hypothetical radio,
that certain song you almost forgot to love.


five more books in a box to be carried out to the car
your office door closes behind you and at that moment
you turn invisible--not even a ghost in that hall
from the hall's point of view.
if the halls don't know you, the halls and the rooms
of the buildings where you worked for seven years--
if the halls don't know you,
                                                               and they don't--
some new woman or two new men come clattering
down these halls in the month after your departure, indeed
just two days after you left forever
they come clattering with ideas about
the relation between mind and body or will and fate
filled with hormones of being the chosen workers here
and they feel as if the halls and rooms begin to recognize them,
accept them, as if there is a belonging in the world--
 
but these new workers are wrong, the halls don't know
who is working under the unobtrusive fluorescent panels
 
this is appalling and for a minute you are appalled
though your being so now is not an event
in the life of your new rented house or even
your new condominium . . .
so if they don't, if they don't know you,
the halls, the walls, the fixtures,
then what? then there is for you
no home in that rock, no home in the mere rock of
where you work, where you briskly walk, not even
in the bed where your body sleeps alone or not--
 
so if there is to be a place for you, for you
it must not be located in plaster and tile and space,
it will have to be in that other house,
the one whose door you felt opening just last night
when you dialed from memory and your friend picked up the phone.


i find i am descending in a propeller plane upon pasco
in the state of washington. i accept this
i have reasons for participating in the experiential sequence
that has brought me here. down below the land is printed
with huge circles, doubtless an irrigation system,
doubtless it makes sense. there are people who understand it
living with dignity in square houses
and the result possibly is one billion radishes.
now some so-called time has passed. this nation
is a huge nation in which the infinity of for example
washington state
is just one segment of an even less thinkable hugeness
and yet zim zim zim zim united airlines has me
here in my eastern metropolis
with its ten thousand makers of third-rate pizza
uncannily far from the possible radishes of washington state.
the taxi driver experiments with narrow streets
to shorten our detour caused by sports fans and he says
the eagles will out-tough the steelers.
i defer to his judgment, i am conserving my powers.
after a while i have this unsettlingly smooth tuna salad
with a pale pickle
in a drugstore designed by dwight d. eisenhower,
reading a few poems by david rivard. i have thoughts.
i have my uncle ralph's jacket soft and droopy giving me
a sense of the past. the rain out there
on the roofs of retail outlets is saying no guarantee
and in a way i am nowhere, in another way maybe
definitely not. in a wide wet parking lot
i turn back toward the store to explain to the cashier
that she charged me for six cans of seltzer when in fact
i only had one from a six-pack
but the idea of justice seems so fatiguing
i would rather read a surprisingly serious detective novel
so i vibrate with indecision in the parking lot
till all the car windows rattle imperceptibly. then
an alleged interval ostensibly intervenes, at the mall
a woman at a piano has played  songs from memory
according to the radio personality who stands with a mike
explaining her bid for the guinness book of records.
i am walking away at an unplanned angle singing tiny montgomery
which i bet she wouldn't have been ready to play.
i have this inner life, i think of my father
lonely in vermont, i think of myself lonely in syracuse
and my old poem about a detective who can't solve his biggest case
and as a result i have feelings--but my teacher said
the future of american poetry can't be merely
the notation of sensibility. when he said that i felt
a chilly fear at the edge of consc-consc-consc-consciousness
like an ice cube in the corner of my stomach.
that's how i felt. so then, so then consequently
i thought i must gather up some serious ideas but then
ashberry phoned and left a message after the beep.
don't be a sucker, ideas are where it isn't.
this made my throat get sort of dry so i drank a classic coke
and then another classic coke two hours later
as time so-to-say passed. what was always there?
texture, that's what, how it wasis, the how of how
when i pick up my color prints at the camera shop
the disappointment i always feel is actually a blessing
is it not? i can say i'll go along with this charade
until i can think my way out even though i'll never
think my way out. i've come this far
that day in  i hitchhiked all the way to montpelier
didn't i? and here i am.
suddenly i have a son
who focuses with tremendous insistence upon
dogs, balloons, air conditioners, hats, clocks, and noses.
to him i convey that the world is okay
life is good we accept it. your dad is a little mixed up
but your shoes got tied, right?
as barbara cohen in high school said about politics
it's interesting, giving the word four earnest syllables,
in-ter-est-ing.


the guys who drank quarts of busch last night
here by the backstop of this baseball diamond
had names given them by their mothers and fathers--
jack and kenny let us say.
 
jack might be
a skinny guy in a black fake-leather jacket,
he's twenty-five, his gray pants are too loose on his hips,
his jaws always have these little black extra hairs,
his mother won't talk to him on the phone,
she lives on french fries and ketchup,
he hasn't been able to send her any cash
in the last two years, ever since he lost
his job unloading produce trucks at pathmark
jack's father disappeared when he was ten.
no big deal, jack says, he was a bastard anyway,
he used to flatten beer cans on the top of my head.
kenny offers a laugh-noise. he's heard all that before.
kenny is forty-eight, a flabby man with reddened skin,
he is employed at the italian market selling fish
just four hours a day but his shirts hold the smell
his female companion deena left him a note last month
you owe me  chocolate  wine  cable tv plus
donuts--i have had it--taking lamp and mirror
they are mine. kenny hasn't seen her since.
he hangs with jack because jack talks loud
as if the world of cops and people with full-time jobs
could be kept at bay by talking, talking loud . . .
 
i'm talking gently and imaginatively here
as if the world of bums and jerks could be kept far off--
 
jack and kenny. or two other guys dark to me with wounds
oozing in philadelphia ways less ready to narrate.
last night at midnight they got cheesesteaks at casseloni's
and bought four quarts at the fireside tavern
and wandered into this park. after one quart of busch
jack said he was lenny dykstra
and found a stick for his bat. pitch to me asshole he said
so kenny went to the mound and pitched his bottle
for want of anything better and jack swung in the dark and missed
kenny's bottle smashed on home plate and jack heard in the sound
the absurdity of all his desiring since seventh grade,
absurdity of a skinny guy who blew everything since seventh
when he hit home runs and chased joan rundle around the gym
so jack took his own empty bottle and smashed it down
amid the brown shards of kenny's bottle.
then they leaned on the backstop to drink the other two quarts
and they both grew glum and silent
and when they smashed these bottles it was like
what else would they do? next morning
 
nick and i come to the park with a rubber ball
and a miniature bat. nick is not quite three
but he knows the names of all the phillies starters
and he knows the area around home plate is not supposed to be
covered with jagged pieces of brown glass. like a good dad
i warn him not to touch it and we decide to establish
a new home plate closer to the mound there's no trash can
handy. who put that glass there? nick wants to know
and to make a long story short i say bad people.
nick says bad? how come?


en cuba tuve--
 
i'm tired of hearing your complaints.
all that whining about el exilio, the tragedy of loss,
 
in cuba i had--
 
the catalogue of things, the status, the riches,
the opulence of it all.
 
i had a mate. we were a pair. our mistress was young. we
were young. we would dangle on her ear
 
concentrate on what you have.
forget the past.
 
and go out on the town. mojitos at la floridita,
dancing at the tropicana and later
 
no, don't tell me about later.
 
in the jewel case, an aqua tiffany box
with white satin interior, we
 
tiffany's? from new york? i didn't know you--
 
would lie together in the pillowy luxury,
my ruby top layer and his aligned, our bases
 
please you needn't--
 
touching, my diamond waist and his forming a continuous
line. sometimes we would switch backs, i'd push
 
i understand that in communities of exile
the population
 
my piercing needle through his back, his
through mine. that's
 
tends to lose ground politically as
assimilation takes place, that
 
how i liked it best, a little harsh, but sweet.
tu y yo, you and i, is what she called us because our very
 
longing is a constitutive ingredient
of not only the condition of exile but--
 
body parts were paired, he and i, forming a single unit, an i and a
thou. apart
 
surely you have adjusted. look, you're mounted on a ring, you
are independent, and prized. very attractive for your age, i might add.
 
we are nothing. longing doesn't quite--
 
one adapts?
 
as to an amputation.
 
and la revolucin?
 
don't make me vomit.


it was a beach
like all beaches, only perhaps more beautiful.
and the sand was pink not red.
 
we would arrive in caravans,
hampers overflowing with food and drink
like aziz and his party on the way to malabar.
 
the colonials and their servants away on an outing.
we would stop under thatch umbrellas,
towels and tablecloths spread out against the sea.
 
my mother in her skirted swim suit
surrounded by fathers of other children,
her olive skin lit through her straw hat.
 
they would laugh and drink beer
and leer
while the children did the usual beach things,
 
boring futile tunnels to china, running
at waves and then away,
daring each other to be swallowed.
 
i would go out by the forbidden rocks and pick off oysters,
then give them to the men to pry open,
cover with lime juice and suck dry.
 
once, i saw my mother sucking
an oyster out of another daddy's hand.
her dappled face bobbed and smiled and her tongue
 
searched the shell for pearls.


at supper he whispers something in your ear,
the judas boy, who wants you.
 
we go to the garden where it's cool
and wait.
 
from my place against the tree
i see you through the window,
 
watch as you walk from door to desk,
reach into your pocket,
 
pull out your wallet, empty it and leave it by the lamp,
pick up a pen, lean over to write, then don't,
 
take something heavy from the drawer, put it back
then sweep the money into a paper bag.
 
you walk from desk to door and out, your hand
reaching back to put out the light.
 
on the security film you leave the building
alone, holding the heavy bag.
 
off camera you walk towards the charles, leave
your saddle shoes under the pedestrian bridge.
 
we wait in the garden.
and wait.
 
we don't know yet whom you meet or why.
 we don't know yet that the river has claimed you.


to celebrate his final pride, in june,
my friend, lymphatic, thin, and in distress,
managed to dress in drag. he shot the moon
outstretched, he'd used his dying to think--obsess--
 
about the prada pumps, their skin a snake
the heavy pantyhose, two pair the moot
but lacy underthings the makeup, cake,
to overlay his pain. i called him beaut-
 
i-ful he said he felt like greta garbo
in queen christina our campy interplay
i countered that he looked more like a hobo-
sexual in heels. we howled. that day,
 
we never left his castro flat. his rhinestone
glittered, and everywhere, the smell of cologne.


this is what he dreams of
a map of burned land,
a mound of dirt
in the early century's winter.
 
a map of burned land?
a country is razed
in the early century's winter.
and god descends.
 
a country is raised
because of industry.
and god descends,
messengers rush inside
 
because of industry,
in spite of diplomats.
messengers rush inside
to haunt the darkened aisles.
 
in spite of diplomats,
the witnesses know well
to haunt the darkened aisles,
experimentally--
 
the witnesses know well
that ushers dressed in black
experimentally
lurk by the cushioned seats.
 
that ushers dress in black
should tell you something
lurking by the cushioned seats,
the saved and the terrible.
 
i should tell you something
this is what he dreams of,
the saved and the terrible--
a mound of dirt.


this may sound queer,
but in  i held the delicate hands
of dan white
i prepared him for burial by then, harvey milk
was made monument--no, myth--by the years
since he was shot.
 
i remember when harvey was shot
twenty, and i knew i was queer.
those were the years,
levi's and leather jackets holding hands
on castro street, cheering for harvey milk--
elected on the same day as dan white.
 
i often wonder about supervisor white,
who fatally shot
mayor moscone and supervisor milk,
who was one of us, a castro queer.
may ,  a jury hands
down the sentence, seven years--
 
in truth, five years--
for ex-cop, ex-fireman dan white,
for the blood on his hands
when he confessed that he had shot
the mayor and the queer,
a few men in blue cheered. and harvey milk?
 
why cry over spilled milk,
some wondered, semi-privately, for years--
it meant one less queer.
the jurors turned to white.
if just the mayor had been shot,
dan might have had trouble on his hands--
 
but the twelve who held his life in their hands
maybe didn't mind the death of harvey milk
maybe, the second murder offered him a shot
at serving only a few years.
in the end, he committed suicide, this dan white.
and he was made presentable by a queer.


there's a certain sadness to this body of water
adjacent to the runway, its reeds and weeds,
handful of ducks, the water color
 
manmade. a still life. and still
life's a cold exercise in looking back,
back to florida, craning my neck
 
like a sandhill crane in alachua basin.
as for the scrub oaks,
the hot wind in the leaves was language,
 
spanish moss--dusky, parasitic--
an obsession i wanted to live in it.
one professor in exile did,
 
covered himself in the stuff as a joke--
then spent a week removing mites. that's
enough. the fields of rushes lay filled
 
with water, and i said farewell,
my high ship an old, red volvo dl,
gone to another coast, another peninsula,
 
one without sleep or amphibious music.
tonight, in flight from san francisco--
because everything is truer at a remove--
 
i watch the man i love watch
the turn of the sacramento river, then sacramento,
lit city of legislation and flat land.
 
i think of florida, how flat.
i think of forgetting florida.
and then the landscape grows black.


in memory, -
we choose a cheap hotel
because they're serving drinks.
we drink. i hear him tell
a tale or two he thinks
 
that so-and-so's a sleaze
and then there was the time
that milosz phoned, oh please.
another gin with lime?
 
i want to say that once,
i saw him dressed in leather,
leaning on a fence
inside a bar. rather,
 
walking to the n,
i gush about his books
he gives his change to men
who've lost their homes and looks
 
how like him, i've been told.
our day together done,
i hug him in the cold.
and then the train is gone.


it was the summer of  when i saw the moon fall down.
 
it broke like a hen's egg on the sidewalk.
 
the garden roiled with weeds, hummed with gnats who settled clouds on my
 
oblivious siblings.
 
a great hunger insatiate to find  a dulcet ill, an evil sweetness blind.
 
a gush of yolk and then darker.
 
somewhere a streetlamp disclosed the insides of a chevy impala--vinyl seats, the rear- view,
 
headrests and you, your hand through your hair.
 
an indistinguishable burning, failing bliss.
 
because the earth's core was cooling, all animals felt the urge to wander.
 
wash down this whisper of you, the terrible must.
 
maybe the core wasn't cooling, but i felt a coolness in my mother.
 
that girl was shining me on.
 
in blue crayon, the bug-bitten siblings printed lyrics on the walls of my room.
 
i wrote the word lava on my jeans.
 
it must be the night fever, i sang with the -track.
 
but the moon had not broken on the sidewalk, the moon
 
was hot, bright as a teakettle whistling outside my door,
 
tied up in sorrow, lost in my song, if you don't come back . . .
 
and that serious night cooled, settling like sugar on our lawn.
 
i wrote the word sugar on my palms.
 
i shall say what inordinate love is.
 
the moon rose itself up on its elbows and shook out its long hair.


the plane is packed and over sweaty heads,
                         rumpled hair, the movie glows in the transatlantic nighttime
            murmur of priests and nuns and riverdancers returning
 
home--a baby is cooed by an older mother, a boy feels
                          for his seat in the dark. i've read my books
            already,  days traveling, the difficulties
 
technical. i hate that money, says the priest beside me,
                           and he orders another scotch, his third.
            the feast of the epiphany tomorrow, he studies religious 
 
journals for a message, writes in a notebook
                            impossibly small. we are having problems
            with sound, the flight attendant announces,
 
it is not your headset, and so the oceans swell in silence,
                            bright blue tumbles across the screen mutely, foam
            collapsing over a tiny nimble figure
 
but she darts through to a green glow,
                            sunshine through a veil of wave, her surfboard tense between
            her feet and the world's largest ocean. her ride
 
is long, impossibly long--her hips stay low, a friend
                              drops onto her wave and, together, they glide towards the shore.
             no music. just water and that blue. i check the skymall catalogue
 
for something i might need and didn't know. there are
                              reasons i am flying over the ocean, reasons i
              i wish i were sure of. someday i might say, yes, i chose
 
him, and it wasn't wise. or maybe we'll be old and
                          surrounded by our own. the screen flashes
              the surf is wild, but the bright sky makes me whisper,
 
hawaii, where nothing could be that beautiful
                          but is. the waves are bigger and she sets out, flowered
               bikini, hair pulled back in a serious bun.
 
but too soon she's underwater, arms above her head,
                           spinning down into a champagne sea.
              the priest asks would i like some english chocolate. i say no
 
at first then say yes. i say,
                             how many euros for the scotch? the baby jesus
               is about to be adored by black men, foreign kings, in
 
fact, tomorrow. they're stumbling, the magi,
                          days across an ocean and through the desert.
                it's hot so they must travel at night--
 
who wouldn't? and there was that star, sudden and perhaps a sign.
                          we've already tried to get there once,
                i want to say to the kings. it's cool in this ,
 
which later the pilot will land with only one engine.
                          a problem with
                compressors. but what a sweet,
 
sweet ocean, and those few younger girls
                         who try to ride it. and what a night,
                warmed by the sun-shocked smell
 
of saddle and sweat, the strong breath of camels.
                          what carved, fragrant trunkfuls
                born across deserts and ready to be opened before an infant god.


your soul is like a landscape fantasy,
where masks and bergamasks, in charming wise,
strum lutes and dance, just a bit sad to be
hidden beneath their fanciful disguise.
 
singing in minor mode of life's largesse
and all-victorious love, they yet seem quite
reluctant to believe their happiness,
and their song mingles with the pale moonlight,
 
the calm, pale moonlight, whose sad beauty, beaming,
sets the birds softly dreaming in the trees,
and makes the marbled fountains, gushing, streaming--
slender jet-fountains--sob their ecstasies.


their long skirts and high heels battled away
depending on the ground's and breezes' whim,
at times some stocking shone, low on the limb--
too soon concealed--tickling our navet.
 
at times, as well, an envious bug would bite
our lovelies' necks beneath the boughs, and we
would glimpse a flash--white flash, ah ecstasy--
and glut our mad young eyes on sheer delight.
 
evening would fall, the autumn day would draw
to its uncertain close our belles would cling
dreamingly to us, cooing, whispering
lies that still set our souls trembling with awe.


gently, let us steep our love
in the silence deep, as thus,
branches arching high above
twine their shadows over us.
 
let us blend our souls as one,
hearts' and senses' ecstasies,
evergreen, in unison
with the pines' vague lethargies.
 
dim your eyes and, heart at rest,
freed from all futile endeavor,
arms crossed on your slumbering breast,
banish vain desire forever.
 
let us yield then, you and i,
to the waftings, calm and sweet,
as their breeze-blown lullaby
sways the gold grass at your feet.
 
and, when night begins to fall
from the black oaks, darkening,
in the nightingale's soft call
our despair will, solemn, sing.


for charles morice
music first and foremost in your verse,
choose those meters odd of syllable,
supple in the air, vague, flexible,
free of pounding beat, heavy or terse.
 
choose the words you use--now right, now wrong--
with abandon when the poet's vision
couples the precise with imprecision,
best the giddy shadows of his song
 
eyes veiled, hidden, dark with mystery,
sunshine trembling in the noonday glare,
starlight, in the tepid autumn air,
shimmering in night-blue filigree
 
for nuance, not color absolute,
is your goal subtle and shaded hue
nuance it alone is what lets you
marry dream to dream, and horn to flute
 
shun all cruel and ruthless railleries
hurtful quip, lewd laughter, that appall
heaven, azure-eyed, to tears and all
garlic-stench scullery recipes
 
take vain eloquence and wring its neck
best you keep your rhyme sober and sound,
lest it wander, reinless and unbound--
how far? who can say?--if not in check
 
rhyme who will its infamies revile?
what deaf child, what black of little wit
forged with worthless bauble, fashioned it
false and hollow-sounding to the file?
 
music first and foremost, and forever
let your verse be what goes soaring, sighing,
set free, fleeing from the soul gone flying
off to other skies and loves, wherever.
 
let your verse be aimless chance, delighting
in good-omened fortune, sprinkled over
dawn's wind, bristling scents of mint, thyme, clover . . .
all the rest is nothing more than writing.


beside a humble stone, a tree
floats in the cemetery's air,
not planted in memoriam there,
but growing wild, uncultured, free.
 
a bird comes perching there to sing,
winter and summer, proffering
its faithful song--sad, bittersweet.
that tree, that bird are you and i
 
you, memory absence, me, that tide
and time record. ah, by your side
to live again, undying aye,
 
to live again but ma petite,
now nothingness, cold, owns my flesh. . .
will your love keep my memory fresh?


as i was going down impassive rivers,
i no longer felt myself guided by haulers
yelping redskins had taken them as targets
and had nailed them naked to colored stakes.
 
i was indifferent to all crews,
the bearer of flemish wheat or english cottons
when with my haulers this uproar stopped
the rivers let me go where i wanted.
 
into the furious lashing of the tides
more heedless than children's brains the other winter
i ran and loosened peninsulas
have not undergone a more triumphant hubbub
 
the storm blessed my sea vigils
lighter than a cork i danced on the waves
that are called eternal rollers of victims,
ten nights, without missing the stupid eye of the lighthouses
 
sweeter than the flesh of hard apples is to children
the green water penetrated my hull of fir
and washed me of spots of blue wine
and vomit, scattering rudder and grappling-hook
 
and from then on i bathed in the poem
of the sea, infused with stars and lactescent,
devouring the azure verses where, like a pale elated
piece of flotsam, a pensive drowned figure sometimes sinks
 
where, suddenly dyeing the blueness, delirium
and slow rhythms under the streaking of daylight,
stronger than alcohol, vaster than our lyres,
the bitter redness of love ferments
 
i know the skies bursting with lightning, and the waterspouts
and the surf and the currents i know the evening,
and dawn as exalted as a flock of doves
and at times i have seen what man thought he saw
 
i have seen the low sun spotted with mystic horrors,
lighting up, with long violet clots,
resembling actors of very ancient dramas,
the waves rolling far off their quivering of shutters
 
i have dreamed of the green night with dazzled snows
a kiss slowly rising to the eyes of the sea,
the circulation of unknown saps,
and the yellow and blue awakening of singing phosphorous
 
i followed during pregnant months the swell,
like hysterical cows, in its assault on the reefs,
without dreaming that the luminous feet of the marys
could constrain the snout of the wheezing oceans
 
i struck against, you know, unbelievable floridas
mingling with flowers panthers' eyes and human
skin rainbows stretched like bridal reins
under the horizon of the seas to greenish herds
 
i have seen enormous swamps ferment, fish-traps
where a whole leviathan rots in the rushes
avalanches of water in the midst of a calm,
and the distances cataracting toward the abyss
 
glaciers, suns of silver, nacreous waves, skies of embers
hideous strands at the end of brown gulfs
where giant serpents devoured by bedbugs
fall down from gnarled trees with black scent
 
i should have liked to show children those sunfish
of the blue wave, the fish of gold, the singing fish.
--foam of flowers rocked my drifting
and ineffable winds winged me at times.
 
at times a martyr weary of poles and zones,
the sea, whose sob created my gentle roll,
brought up to me her dark flowers with yellow suckers
and i remained, like a woman on her knees...
 
resembling an island tossing on my sides the quarrels
and droppings of noisy birds with yellow eyes
and i sailed on, when through my fragile ropes
drowned men sank backward to sleep
 
now i, a boat lost in the foliage of caves,
thrown by the storm into the birdless air
i whose water-drunk carcass would not have been rescued
by the monitors and the hanseatic sailboats
 
free, smoking, topped with violet fog,
i who pierced the reddening sky like a wall,
bearing, delicious jam for good poets
lichens of sunlight and mucus of azure,
 
who ran, spotted with small electric moons,
a wild plank, escorted by black seahorses,
when julys beat down with blows of cudgels
the ultramarine skies with burning funnels
 
i, who trembled, hearing at fifty leagues off
the moaning of the behemoths in heat and the thick maelstroms,
eternal spinner of the blue immobility
i miss europe with its ancient parapets
 
i have seen sidereal archipelagos and islands
whose delirious skies are open to the sea-wanderer
--is it in these bottomless nights that you sleep and exile yourself,
million golden birds, o future vigor? 
 
but, in truth, i have wept too much dawns are heartbreaking.
every moon is atrocious and every sun bitter.
acrid love has swollen me with intoxicating torpor
o let my keel burst o let me go into the sea
 
if i want a water of europe, it is the black
cold puddle where in the sweet-smelling twilight
a squatting child full of sadness releases
a boat as fragile as a may butterfly.
 
no longer can i, bathed in your languor, o waves,
follow in the wake of the cotton boats,
nor cross through the pride of flags and flames,
nor swim under the terrible eyes of prison ships.


i
      oh the huge avenues of the holy land, the terraces of the temple what has happened to the brahmin who taught me the proverbs? from then and from there i can still see even the old women i remember silvery hours and sun near rivers, the hand of the country on my shoulder, and our caresses as we stood in the fiery fields. --a flight of red pigeons thunders around my thoughts--in exile here i had a stage on which to perform the dramatic masterpieces of all literatures. i might tell you about unheard-of wealth. i follow the story of the treasures you found. i see the next chapter my wisdom is as neglected as chaos is. what is my void, compared with the stupefaction awaiting you?
 
ii
      i am a far more deserving inventor than all those who went before me a musician, in fact, who found something resembling the key of love. at present, a noble from a meager countryside with a dark sky i try to feel emotion over the memory of mendicant childhood, over my apprenticeship  when i arrived wearing wooden shoes, polemics, five or six widowings, and a few wild escapades when my strong head kept me from rising to the same pitch as my comrades. i don't miss what i once possessed of divine happiness the calm of this despondent countryside gives a new vigor to my terrible scepticism. but since this scepticism can no longer be put into effect, and since i am now given over to a new worry--i expect to become a very wicked fool.
 
iii
      in an attic where at the age of twelve i was locked up, i knew the world and illustrated the human comedy. in a wine cellar i learned history. at some night celebration, in a northern city, i met all the wives of former painters. in an old back street in paris i was taught the classical sciences. in a magnificent palace, surrounded by all the orient, i finished my long work and spent my celebrated retirement. i have invigorated my blood. i am released from my duty. i must not even think of that any longer. i am really from beyond the tomb, and without work.


					
					when the world is reduced to a single dark wood for our two pairs of dazzled eyes--to a beach for two faithful children--to a musical house for our clear understanding--then i shall find you.
      when there is only one old man on earth, lonely, peaceful, handsome, living in unsurpassed luxury, then i am at your feet.
      when i have realized all your memories, --when i am the girl who can tie your hands,--then i will stifle you.
 

 
      when we are very strong, who draws back? or very happy, who collapses from ridicule? when we are very bad, what can they do to us.
      dress up, dance, laugh. i will never be able to throw love out of the window.
 

 
      --comrade of mine, beggar girl, monstrous child how little you care about the wretched women, and the machinations and my embarrassment. join us with your impossible voice, oh your voice the one flatterer of this base despair.
 
           
 
      a dark morning in july. the taste of ashes in the air, the smell of wood sweating in the hearth, steeped flowers, the devastation of paths, drizzle over the canals in the fields, why not already playthings and incense?
 
        
 
       i stretched out ropes from spire to spire garlands from window to window golden chains from star to star, and i dance.
 
        
 
     the high pond is constantly streaming. what witch will rise up against the white sunset? what purple flowers are going to descend?        
 
        
 
while public funds disappear in brotherly celebrations, a bell of pink are rings in the clouds.
        
 
     arousing a pleasant taste of chinese ink, a black powder gently rains on my night, --i lower the jets of the chandelier, throw myself on the bed, and turning toward thedark, i see you, o my daughters and queens
 
        


not long ago, or maybe i dreamt it
or made it up, or have suddenly lost
track of its train in the hocus pocus
of the dissolving days no, if i bend
the turn around the corner, come at it
from all three sides at once, or bounce the ball
against all manner of bleary-eyed fortune
tellers--well, you can see for yourselves there's
nothing up my sleeves, or notice even
rocks occasionally break if enough
pressure is applied. as far as you go
in one direction, all the further you'll
have to go on before the way back has
become totally indivisible.


but to whatever animal we ascribe these remains, it is certain such a one has existed in america, and that it has been the largest of all terrestrial beings. it should have sufficed to have rescued the earth it inhabited, and the atmosphere it breathed, from the imputation of impotence. . . .

i called for armour, rose, and did not reel.

my wound open wide.

his spit and sperm are tallied his temperature,

for r.g.
as if sliding down the green, scuffed face
      of the wave, a seaplane falls
and turns together, keeping the waters of
 
the ear flat a dead calm. but when the window's
      frowning strip of shoreline,
the battalions of tropical-drinks umbrellas
 
guarding the sandcastles and saltboxes
      of the rich,
when these flip upside down, and the pale
 
clouded sky floats below the ocean,
      then we jolt awake--
but this is not her dream, not water or land.
 
      tell me again, what illness do i think i have?
 
the ropes of blood coil through her neck,
      they twist as it twists,
as the head looks for parents and young men,
 
for nurses, strangers, year upon year attending
      until the pulpy blood
knots up at last, and the warrens of
 
the brain dry and crackle, a town of names
      she saunters one long night
streets without signs lead to a girlhood park,
 
to songs under stars, and lipstick,
      old houses forever
unbuilding themselves--but within the blue
 
jungle scaffolding, a gallery of faces
      stares back at her,
portraits she can't place . . . and then the town
 
flattens and crumbles behind her, it grows
      to dry scrabbled pasture
under a dishplate moon, hanging there
 
in the tints of the sky, yet like a stopped
      clock, right twice a day
 
      now ma'am, can you remember the name of
      the president who was shot in the s?
 
      --lincoln?
 
and if the names had sunk beneath the sea,
      rolling hump and hollow,
leopard spotted foam--surgeons would haul up
 
the big sharks and club them silly, knife off a fin,
      then drop them
bleeding onto the docks of alcatraz,
 
warning the inmates see that?
      no inside fin,
they'll  swim round this rock forever. . . .
 
the convicts build the prison, then move inside,
      their block minds
ignite a thousand homes by dawn,
 
then melt in the butter sun of
      breakfast porridge. . . .
but this is not the philosopher's circle prison,
 
no lidless eye radiates from the center,
      beneficent
and watchful the neutered grounds
 
here at the residence for life
      are groomed
like the campus of depression state u
 
past the dwarfish berms and drumlins
      a mazy cobalt
walkway slithers to the storage lake,
 
with its hooded fount of aqua vitae sudsing
      the green larvae,
its dry gazebo isle no one shuffles to . . .
 
one night, the distraught residence cook
      shoots himself dead
everyone mourns, but only the young staff
 
seek counseling, their threshold of death
      not yet raised
to that of teetering mr. on-his-toes,
 
of ms. wheelchair-with-political-bumper-stickers,
      or elegant
mrs. whisper, polite confused survivors of
 
wiped-out families, trolley cars, jobs learned
      and lost, a cosmos
squeezed beneath the blood boulder--
 
      why can't i remember my problem?
 
they do not scream. they who once
      made things happen
now watch things happen to them
 
they hand their middle chapters to
      their children,
and quietly appraise the spindle of
 
a leafless sapling outside, staked
      to three larger
poles of wood all of them under arrest.
 
and you must calm yourself. in the acrid hold
      of their boat,
whose strangely knotted sail whips the wind
 
round on each side, anchorless boat
      that hugs the dock,
and keeps the dock from drifting to sea,
 
you can hear the first, reeling chapters,
      of pierside painters
crowding a rustic barrel-and-shanty scene
 
so clichd the locals called it port motif
      number one--
the washy dab and smear of the medical test,
      
      can you tell me what day this is?
      

      --you mean now?
 
the brush like an oar rinses off its paints
      a filmy rainbow
upon the waters, coils and ribbons
 
you trace in your own sweet time.


to take,
              like water,
whatever shape you flow through, fill, or rest in.
 
and to choose that shape.

six feet from my face.
voice no longer a caress
but a sharpened projection,
belly a ram in a buttoned vest.
 
the whole body shows                                                                                                         
                                       the thing done
goat-song in the rites of a god,
transforming, starting to speak now
through him
                     as he walks on stage.
 
           
 
remember when you turned
into moonlight, the bark of an oak,
an orange going to shreds
in your own cold palm?
 
everything you saw
                                 you were,
and you saw everything.
 
no choice.
that face light gnarled around a tree
was your face.
 
           
 
flesh is approximate.
we clothe it in dreams,
wrestling with our eyes closed
down through layers
                                   thug, wraith,
chieftain, devouring angel held
by my shoulders i
am trying to make you

                          overlapped.
 
           
 
curious,
               cautious enough
to disguise himself as a woman,
the voyeur peeks at the rite.
 
women, leaping, mothers and daughters--
their rapt beauty draws him out.
 
the god
              has tricked him
they will tear him apart.
 
           
 
as a virus.
                   never alive,
but a frantic mimicry of life
to pierce the cell, make over
its orders, move, repeat itself, mutate
in sped-up mini-evolution--
now it swims the blood, unravels
in light, never alive, now
                                         it floats on air.
 
lost in the host a thousand years,
inert chemical mechanism
asleep in a rain-forest cave.
 
           
 
to mime--
                     not a statue
or a gray accountant picked from the crowd,
but a robot.
 
steel jumpsuit and boots,
greasepaint turning the eyelids
aluminum.

silver mister silver--tape
loop syncopating
over the drum machine.
 
           
 
as a child's toy,
its intricate language of joints and swivels,
creature within creature
the robot
                a wolf on silver feet,
in his boxy jaw
the tiny half-robotic
head of a man
                        who will drive the car.
 
           
 
who will drive the car
                                     to the hospital

he grips the mower like a sad hawk.
grandfather, father, son--flesh

dream he is a sea god,
                                       and he is.
dream he is a stone, a bull, no,
a tree
          rippling over
the waves' quick light, he is
shape always becoming, he is a flame
and the stream that drowns it.


air as lost time
voice of a cloud, of a ghost crowned with nimbus
smack-thin, it lingers forty years
i thought it came from the jeweled world we'd seen
everything stuffed, urgent, glittering alive
but it was just pleasure, blank and sure
now what is there to sing
from speakers, the tune folds and fades in waves
earphones drive it through your head


a charm,
               a dream of protection.
gurgles hold the night light's glow.
 
a stream of clouds
                                misting the branching tubes.
 
water, in fog, a tub, plug to
wire in the wall saying
 
okay, it's okay all night.
 
           
 
school, a door closing
he opens
                haze of playground french,
the five names for different kinds of marbles,
games, bullies he wandered among
while i was staring at the sea.
 
shut off,
not my past,
                     nothing i could do--
 
i keep making up
all the world he lived.
 
his new name, intricate drawings of aliens,
long tunnel of lunch
mais il ne mange rien monsieur--
school hours shadows
                                  that smother my days.
 
           
 
burnt-out hills
char and velvety ash
                                  along the dropped limbs,
magpies, new gullies.
 
a dry time clears the ground.
 
he was standing where the road split,
arms spread, a small x
straddling the crack.
that bird call a slash, then,
on the edge of things.
 
he was standing,
                             behind him
the green blue of ocean, the white blue of sky.
 
           
 
the house of childhood sold,
or razed--
 
not lost but
                   softened, distended
diaphanous linked chambers springing from
a lightshaft or a varnish smell,
the way a floorboard aches,
a scrap of wallpaper
                                  tunnels the heart.
 
             
 
a film of
                events--
tiny collisions, tracks of light
in the bubble chamber--you'd scan
for hours smell of formica, rock headsets,
eyes going furry near four am.
 
this celluloid memory now
your memory, coursing
chemical fissures in the brain.
 
matter split like time,
                                     thinner and thinner parings--
anything that happens is too fast to see
 
           
 
there the sky kept reeling as she ran--
wisps, then puffy clumps,
then rain--
                   the park spread low
beneath the blanketing.
 
who could have worn
that purple coat
cartwheeling in the grass?
 
it grows
                as i look at it,
puts on pillowy layers.
 
now the coat wears memory,
warms a ghost.
 
           
 
wind off the world's top,
whipped clouds over hedgerows
girton, that one year
twenty years away.
 
he learned to walk, she started school,
read, slowly,
                      the first book red.
 
moss edging the garden wall,
little flags on the clothesline.


give it back--i made it all up
that alcove where surplus glowed under dust
unfinished, an attic space with nails poking down
khaki of sheet metal, orange flickering in tubes
ephemeral as the smells, which were plywood, solder, and kents
color words, smell words--i put them in a book
everything there is still missing
two lies of remembrance it was always winter
things could speak


avoid adjectives of scale.
dandelion broth instead of duck soup.
don't even think you've seen a meadow, ever.
the minor adjustments in our equations
still indicate the universe is insane,
when it laughs a silk dress comes out its mouth
but we never put it on. put it on.
cry often and while asleep.
if it's raw, forge it in fire.
that's not a mountain, that's crumble.
if it's fire, swallow.
the heart of a scarecrow isn't geometrical.
that's not a diamond, it's salt.
that's not the sky but it's not your fault.
my dragon may be your neurotoxin.
your electrocardiogram may be my fortune cookie.
once an angel has made an annunciation,
it's impossible to tell him he has the wrong address.
moonlight has its own befuddlements.
the rest of us can wear the wolf mask if we want
or look like reflections wandered off.
eventually armor, eventually sunk.
you wanted love and expected what?
a parachute? morphine? a gold sticker star?
the moment you were born--
you have to trust others because you weren't there.
ditto death.
the strongest gift i was ever given
was made of twigs.
it didn't matter which way it broke.


the mountain thinks it's the same
without you but it's wrong. maybe
the same stars whisking themselves
further off, the darker the brighter,
same chamomile crushed underfoot
but the little, wiry dog we loved
has preceded us into paradise, not
that i expect to join her even though
my own crappy heart's worse, running's
out but i may be finally learning how
to sit in a chair. i still don't know
what to call the good morning bird
although whatever word'd be no truer
than manzanita. i think namelessness
has a crush on me, on how clean
i keep my room, the usual stunned
ruckus of wake up. but it's a different
moon, different woman on the hotel balcony
yet the same kinda scary, vacant stare,
caryatid foreseeing what? before
turning back to the customary, immaculate
vacation squalor inside. the cash machine
still says enter to exit but there's
more water in the creek than i've ever seen,
the brighter the darker, in that first dream
there was none.


because we are so stupid,
the prizes in cracker jacks are now paper
so they can be swallowed, ladders
spackled with warnings. no getting
within a hundred feet of stonehenge because
everyone wants to hack off a souvenir
and the way home is clogged to one lane
so whoever wants to can stare into a pothole
until coming up with a grievance. i'd vote
the greatest accomplishment of mankind
is the pickle spear. god created paradise
to tell us get out which is why we probably
created god who doesn't much like being created
by ilk like us. no wonder it's pediatrics
every morning and toxicology by happy hour.
is it all in the mind, the dirty, dirty mind?
maybe god tried to turn you into a garbage can
so you could be lifted by the truck's hydraulic
arms and banged empty. maybe a snow cone
so you could be sticky-sweet and dropped.
maybe a genital-faced bivalve to be dashed
with tabasco and eaten whole or, to his glory,
produce a pearl.


bustle and caw. recall the green heat 
rising from the new minted earth, granite

and basalt, proto-continents shuffling
and stacking the deck, first shadows flung 

from the ultraviolet haze. a fern 
uncurls from the swamp, the microscopic furnace

of replication warms the world, one 
becoming two, two four exponential blossom. 

lush with collision, the teacup balance 
of x and y, cells like balloons

escaping into the sky--then the dumbstruck
hour, unmoored by a river,

a first fish creeps to the land to marvel
at the monstrous buds of its toes. and stars

grow feet and walk across the years, into these dozing,
ordinary days, climbing the spine's winding

stair, where crickets yawn and history spins.


a momentary rupture to the vision 
the wavering limbs of a birch fashion

the fluttering hem of the deity's garment, 
the cooling cup of coffee the ocean the deity

waltzes across. this is enough--but sometimes
the deity's heady ta-da coaxes the cherries 

in our mental slot machine to line up, and
our brains summon flickering silver like 

salmon spawning a river the jury decides
in our favor, and we're free to see, for now. 

a flaw swells from the facets of a day, increasing
the day's value a freakish postage stamp mails

our envelope outside time hairy, claw-like
magnolia buds bloom from bare branches 

and the deity pops up again like a girl from 
a giant cake. o deity you transfixing transgressor,

translating back and forth on the border
without a passport. fleeing revolutions 

of same-old simultaneous boredom and 
boredom, we hoard epiphanies under the bed, 

stuff them in jars and bury them in the backyard 
we cram our closet with sunrise prop up our feet 

and drink gallons of wow we visit the doctor 
because all this is raising the blood's levels of 

chohchohchnhch, the heart caught 
in the deity's hem and haw, the oh unfurling 

from our chest like a bee from our cup of coffee, 
an autochthonous greeting there. who saw it?


--not pen. it's got

that same silken 
dust about it, doesn't it, 

that same sense of 
having been roughed 

onto paper even  
as it was planned. 

it had to be a labor
of love. it must've

taken its author some
time, some shove. 

i'll bet it felt good
in the hand--the o

of the ocean, and
the and and the and 

of the land.


each living thing is like a kingdom
that rises not quite out of nothing april stirrings
of some boy and the may beauty
of a generous princess. then came children--
who could calculate their splendor?
and there were factories in valleys, mile after mile,
dragons of purple smoke, blue flames at night,
castles hidden in forests equally hidden
where a shining company rode through flowers
to pacify the dangerous land. triangular sails,
violet, saffron, and rose, glowed beyond coves
under cliffs dangling silver torques of waterfall.
later the parents aged and grew more grateful,
more full of a certainty that could not be glimpsed
or dismayed, and then the children
were gone to some other land
as if to heaven, yet the mourning
was not for death. now by a quiet wall
buckled cement gives a bright home
to milkweeds like strange skeletons,
pale green, intact and upright, and tall white grasses
that never wave. the sole survivor--
a duty was laid on him
to tell the tale among new minds, other ways,
and how do we imagine him,
wherever he's gone--all that remains,
scholar of an unread book,
beggar of an unfilled cup,
an unknown variation,
the thought of the kingdom in a lost man?


for john hollander
although it's likely you're on your own
at this moment in this city of three million
reading the poems of traherne,
and there was no one till you lit your lamp,
the kingdom of childhood keeps being founded
in his voice and his seeing,
which are a sort of birth. a birth goes on
in the dark of a poor family, or a mother alone.
then comes the small bright circle of the faces
lover pores over sleeping loved one, parent over child
in their enclosure we name home,
a hut in the plain so bare there's not a tongue
of grass to make the wind hiss. unknown
to the world a world exists
trees and streams, birds all the colors of the flowers.
so traherne pours over you
his wild remembrance of the world to come. and would
even in the silence of his book
if it were lost and lay unopened
two hundred years. even if he had died
before he sang the eden in his look.


how do you explain why elephants
appear to move their unwieldy hulks
with greater dignity than most humans do
in their finest moments,
as if they had evolved beyond wanting
anything but what they have?
why does the field begin to ripple
before the wind arrives in whispers,
as if there were a communication,
as if the landscape were poorly dubbed,
and we weren't expected to notice?
what butterfly does not dart away from us
as if it could sense our latent cruelties,
and yet return to check and double-check? 
has the night not gotten recently darker,
as if to insinuate that we have squandered 
the light that was there?
have we made too much of our own?
and did you notice afterward the dawn 
opening up with a tentative eagerness
as if there were something crucial to illumine,
as if we would wake up early just to see it?
i imagine you reading this now 
with an expression of quiet trouble
itself troubled by currents of hope, 
as if you imagined me here with you, 
as if i might be able to see your expression,
and at least answer it with mine.


we all got tickets to the truth
finally we thought finally 
when the curtain fell away
our indrawn breaths could be heard
even in the next theater 
even the gasp of the mime 
who had slipped in among us
a loud whushing like reams of litter
whirling upward in a gale
hands shot to mouths and mouths 
fell open i couldn't say within
how many seconds 
all our minds shut some 
slamming others just a click 
like  parallel
rows of tipped dominoes  
a racket of almost unison

believe me we wouldn't 
have resisted anything 
but the truth
so instantly and universally
yet we sat there and waited 
for something else
which you could say we also got 
if you count the mime's
unpleasant remark
so she wasn't even a real mime
probably part of what was 
clearly just a performance


you don't need a machine to do that.
a plastic bag will do. but he built it,
his tools cast about in the unit
while he got up his nerve to use it.

nothing more was stored there.
a poured cement floor, a triple-locked door
after door after door down a corridor 
reeking with the odor of everything over.

in heretofore phrases, he left a note
outlining his help in argot
so wrought it was hopeless to ferret out
his intent, meant or not.

a ball-peen hammer was all she had.
the shards cut her. what else had he hid?
at least, she cried, he'd thought ahead.
he drove home instead.


a stick, pared clean--no, a silver-topped
bamboo-with-dagger, class doubling as club,
the advantage of gravity lifted high 
overcoming the disadvantage of poking ahead.

he demurs. weakness either way.
a man should crush opponents with a word.
naive, i muse, at your age. a cane
replaces the sole's sensors, bolsters them. 

balance is a matter for the unbalanced, 
he says, all nuance, accusing me, lear-lover,
of too much. the earth is now close, i tell him.
a sharp look. i'll walk, he says, without.


how glorious
is this strange muscle in my mouth.
child's tease, lips' balm, baton of speech
unless it's tied.

what's forgotten is on the tip.
sides slip out the truth. the root
is how far a kiss can go.

one can lose it when guilty.
be lashed by another's.
feel it twisting over rooky woods and wordless
hear it swinging in a bell, sliding through a groove

or placed firmly in a cheek. beware it
should be held most often for most often
a forked one has no friend.


all this havoc
just means i'm a poor wizard.

once, i lit three twigs and fanned the smoke,
from miles away,
into the girl who jumbled scales through my spine.

as she vanished i clapped a delighted tune.
but not without aches of my own.

did the sack of no echoes fail me?

now, on such a mild curse--
boils, sewn eyes, a shrew
in the loin my ankle reddens up and eyes me
with disdain. toenails fall off.

how far will this go?

poor wizard. poorly done in.
these pangs are power are power as both
knees lock up
ashamed to move under me.


whatever the cost i pay up at the minnow pools.
i don't know anything of the misery of these trapped fish,
or the failure of the marsh i'm so hidden.

up above is the island with its few houses facing
the ocean god walks with anyone there. i often
slosh through the low tide to a sister
unattached to causeways.

it's where deer mate then lead their young
by my house to fields, again up above me.

pray for me. like myself be lost.
an amulet under your chest, a green sign of the first
rose you ever saw, the first shore.

then i wash my horse, dogs, me behind the barn.
only the narrow way leads home.


					
					all day i have been thinking about the color of his cauterized skin,the burned young man lying flat on his back on the rehab slab in wiesbaden,and think, finally, that it is the color of rhubarb, that drab maroon and green,but seared on, blasted into a mottled, speckled, crystallized sheen.rhubarb, meaning a fight or disagreement, the ump getting into it with a player,their faces turning red, sputtering, blustering, kicking dirt on each other,until finally someone gets vulgar, says something about the other one's mother.rhubarb, from the ancient word for the volga river, its watery line of demarcation,and the barbarians who lived beyond it, the real ones, vandals, visigoths, huns,not the ones we see now as buffoons in commercials, battle-axing, caterwaulingthe civilized world for the right credit card, for capital one, asking us what's inour wallets. cnn says the rehab here is good, so the film crew has come in.they thank him for his service. they tell him he's a credit to his country, to all of us,all our brave young women and men. they ask if he has any hobbies, if he can tell uswhat he'd most want to do that he used to enjoy doing. he says he'd like to walk again.i hate everyone, all of us who have sent him into flames. i hate the film crew, hate cnn, the rehab facility, every tube that goes in and out of him, every monitor that beeps, even the morphine feed that drips and seeps. they ask him if it is frustrating and he weeps.
				

 

					
					the philosopher david lewis spun a fantasy of two omniscient gods who know about one world, which might as well be ours. each knows precisely all there is to know, the grand totality of facts, not things. each knows the pattern of the light on each neglected leaf millennia ago. each knows the number of the stars, their ages, all the distances between them, all the things too tiny to be remembered in recorded history--the backfiring of a busin a paris street in , as well as all the things that history distorts or just can't see, like the thought that must have flashed across patroklos's mind if he'd existed and had had a mind--the middle knowledge of the schoolmen when hektor split his stomach with a spear if he'd existed too. each one looks on, as though through ordinary eyes, as mme swann's enormous coachman, supervised by a groom no bigger than his fist and as infantile as st george in the picture, endeavored to curb the ardour of the quivering steel-tipped pinions with which they thundered over the ground, and sees the gray toppers' of old the gentlemen strolling with her wore, the little woolen cap from which stuck out two blade-like partridge feathers that she wore or would have worn if they and she'd been real. each monitors the photons through the slits, the slow decay of radium, and knows the ratio of vermouth to gin in someone's first martini at larre's. each knows what darragh, geoff and willy knew before the bullet or the pavement killed their worlds, and where the shots came from in dallas. each knows precisely what the other knows, in all the senses of those words, and if a question has a factual answer, each can answer it. yet there's a question neither can resolve which god am i?the question posits both a world and a unique perspective on that world, which neither has. and if gods one and two could reify themselves by wondering who or what they were, they'd have to know the answer--and, because they don't, they can't. could gods like those be real, in something like the sense that you and i are real? but then, what sense is that? gods one and two are you and i writ large i wander out into the day and feel the sunlight on my face. i see the sunlight on the first spring leaves like green foam on the trees, and so do you. the world we have in common, that the gods can comprehend in its entirety, remains beyond my grasp, and yours. the world i know belongs entirely to me, as yours belongs entirely to you. i know my world completely, as the gods know ours, because it's nothing but my take on things, and starts and ends with me. i'm both the author and the captive of my world, because my take on things is all there is to me. when mary, in frank jackson's philosophical diversion, wanders from her room of black and white and shades of gray and finally sees a rose, and then goes on in sunlight, into the hofgarten, and drinks coffee, and talks for hours, it's hard to see how all of this as she might say could be an artifact of her perspective. but it is.so what? philosophers tell stories, but they make them up, and what are they to me? sometimes i think i'm humoring myself a good thing i suppose with an extended exercise in nonsense. have breakfast, have a cup of strong black common sense, get over it, i tell myself, refuting berkeley with my foot. instead of this entanglement of self with self, why can't i just relax into my place inside the natural order, be a thing within the solid scheme of things, a dane in denmark? how can fantasies, unreal by definition, show me what i am, and know? how can the poetry of possibilities dissolve the prose of facts? my little life sustains me while it can, and that's enough. it may be all contingent, but it's real, and when catastrophes occur, as they inevitably do, i'd rather they occur to me, instead of writing them away, or redefining happiness or sorrow or tranquility as alterations of some abstract point of view that points at nothing. inescapable illusions must be real, or might as well be real, no matter where reflection on them leads and if accepting them means taking things on faith, that's fine. who wants to be a posit, or a site of possibilities? who wants to walk out and evaporate into this green spring day? who wants to have sex with a wraith?no matter where reflection on them leads. it leads, of course, to me. a cri de coeur is not an argument, but where the real argument begins. hopkins searching nature i taste self at one tankard, that of my own being. kant the feeling of an existence without the least concept, meaning that despite the certainty i have, i've no idea what i really am, or where, and as for searching nature, i have no idea even where to start. these matters mean the world to me, and yet no matter how i try to come to grips with them, they slip away. i and here and now are ever present, yet they vanish in the act of apprehension, as a poem turns into language as you write it down. dimensionless, atemporal, imprisoned in the present--even as i say them to myself the words fall short of what i thought i started out to say, like the conclusion of an argument too close to me to share, or like an empty thought balloon that hangs above me in the air. it's not the question of what makes me who i am through time--of how a figure in a photograph from , a couple sitting in the garden of the small htel des marronniers just off the rue jacob, could be the person who remembers her and thinks of him today--but of what constitutes me now, and of what made me then. if giving it a name won't help, then neither will pretending it's divine. if i should be supplanted by a bright recording angel knowing everything about me in the way the gods know all about their world, i wouldn't have survived. she takes the whole thing in--the house on maxim street, the bike rides down the hill on wabash street, my high school friends, their friends, the friends of friends of friends--with eyes that monitor my back, my face, the traces in my brain projected on a screen, the n degrees of separation linking me to nearly everyone who's ever lived, a thing within a wilderness of things, with each one locked inside a universe with no outside, of which there's nothing she can see. how could it be an afterlife? it's just a different life, another life, complete or incomplete as anyone's, consumed by questions that elude it, not because she can't remember, but because the words that make them up are undefined which one of them was i? which world was mine?
				

 

at the oriental institute, chicago
they redid king tut splendid, 
once stone-huge as this 
yet his wife's feet 
tiny, the only thing of her now
low, next to him. a few toes, some of the rest, 
a bit of ankle, that's it
in the shade of her husband's looming, massive 
looking straight ahead into the future 
where we live and can't
eye-to-eye, where to stare at him
is to suffer warbler neck, head back and up
 la the high just-leafing-out trees as bright bits
wing their blink
and hide. little wife, 
such small feet, the thought 
dwarfs the king 
as ache, as what is 
ever left of us 
and oh, i like her better.


when the moon's worn scutcheon 
touches the flint-gray flood,
i will lave him in foxglove 
and vetch until the blood
of his wretched heart heals.

without a scar, he stood--

as the men make their way 
into the quaking wood.


for julie
if i could tie a river around my love's waist like ribbon, 
              make sails out of her blood
and pin down death like a squirming bug.

if i could lift and rock each coffin in my arms
              i would start with hers.


floodlights have flared on behind and above
              where i sit in my public chair.
the lawn that had gradually darkened has brightened.
              the library windows stare.

i'm alone in a crowd--e pluribus plures.
              far from a family i miss.
i'd almost say i'm lonely, but lonely
              is worse, i recall, than this.

loneliness is a genuine poverty.
              i'm like a man who is flush
but forgot his wallet on the nightstand 
              when he left for work in a rush,

and now must go without food and coffee
              for a few hours more than he'd wish. 
that's all. he still has a wallet. it's bulging.
              it floats through his brain like a fish...

money for love a terrible simile,
              but maybe it's fitting here,
a couple of blocks from madison avenue
              where commodities are dear,

where all around me, rich skyscrapers 
              woo the impoverished sky,
having sent on their way the spent commuters 
              who stream, uncertain, by--

and as for this whole splurge of a city, 
              isn't money at its heart?
but i'm blathering now. forgetting my subject.
              what i meant to say at the start

is that i noticed a woman reading
              in a chair not far from mine.
silver-haired, calm, she stirred a hunger 
              hard for me to define,

perhaps because she doesn't seem lonely.
              and what i loved was this
the way, when dusk had darkened her pages, 
              as if expecting a kiss,

she closed her eyes and threw her head back,
              book open on her lap.
perhaps she was thinking about her story,
              or the fall air, or a nap.

i thought she'd leave me then for pastimes
              more suited to the dark.
but she is on intimate terms, it seems,
              with the rhythms of bryant park,

for that's when the floodlights came on, slowly,
              somewhere far above my need, 
and the grass grew green again, and the woman
              reopened her eyes to read.



brutal to give
the prisoner a window--
a blue sky glimpse--

as if an afterlife
existed. brutal
for you to parade 

in a body
in the same 
room where i dream you.


now that obituaries come online
with coroner reports and full disclosure, 
imagine the ways to betray a man 
come out of hiding to die. ask the bloggers
who weigh in on my friend's bad habit,
who make of it their own drug strung out
across a mirror, so when they pay tribute
to their power, how they had their doubts
about his talent, his flu, i think how lucky
i was to receive the kindness of the weak.
my death space, as they call it, as if it's me
who died. a life, we know, is complex.
but death is simple. a place to talk shit,
to license grief, or barring that, to kill it.




past the fountain out of repair
and the boarded diner

a small studio
you'd never told anyone about

where old clothes have remained
right where you've dumped them

side by side
with random notes and sketches

when someone close to you
has a different idea of what you represent

he insisted
you'll write a check for the loan

there were other misjudgments
as well. exits were being blocked

down every hall i walked

until a sort of muscle memory--
well, i knew it all along, of course,

but thought it was in the future,
it rested like a memory--

this desire 
for a place respecting anonymity

oiling your . special,
like a criminal readying for benefits

a bottle of jack daniels--

this and more

shaded by echoing buildings
with a glance toward the harbor

the water rough with small debris
today


when ronnie's husband stepped out of the shower
she spotted bite marks on his buttocks

i was so listless
i wished the dog could talk

the room was frowsty. then men
were discussing the legacy of wendell willkie

those little cupids of nostalgia
fading into doubt...

all that fussing
followed by a creamy silence--

oh mother, my daughter said, you're so 's

to winkle out meaning, i've given up,
i'm simply nosing through the thistle.

prudish light of a candle
as night closes with a tail over water

a rufous backdrop of brush.
a clot of gardening tools

when mrs. mast took a photo in september
of a cougar lounging beneath her clothesline
everyone stopping strolling our lazy road.
even jack felt uncomfortable
smoking a cigarette on the patio
before retiring


little enoch learned his colors from lettered blocks

for a is the color of fleet,
b is the color of war and demolition,
c is the color of echo and blur,
&c. and built
a bricolage

so cab was a whirring warbler.
bach was the spanish armada crashing
                                      and crashing.
and enoch he couldn't describe.

and when it reached the height of enoch,
standing, he tore whole tongues
down to their colors.


there was a young woman 
who lived in her shoes.

bare-backed, she sat 
with elders and sheened 
her nails with sloe. 

felt purse, trunk, 
berries in bottled gin.

smoke rose 
from the purples of the ground. 

moscow maybe next, or 
poland, where the numbers burned.

purples of the mosses turned.
some million shades.
six million more.

purples of the mosses,
and all the millions, blue.

she had so many lives,
she didn't know what to do.


women asleep. carlight,
east red and west white.

women, and men made of them,
and lambs in their droves, and power lines east

to the women-made men and women of men,
when a man is a sum
of what women he knows, and i 

blurred my vision till i
saw a woman and lambs in the streets,
west red and white east,

and i wanted to eat. women and men,
don't fear me, i am 
a hand come to wake her. red 

in the west says
woman is man is woman is man.


a field of thistles, dscharging 
                  concentric waves of negative 
                                       theology, on a mountainside, 
                  , may rd is whitsuntide,
would certainly
suffice as a source of the ever-obtainable not 
enough sought 
state of subtle shock 
if he'd close 
this computer 
                  and walk up the summit road 
                  until the sea's in view. and maybe in 
                  the southeast wind, 
                  in broadcast waveform data therein,
                  microsystems stocks he has been
checking, clicking all day like an addict gambler, will 
                                                                                      float up until 
red numbers cross the black horizon 
into green--two redtail hawks                                float up 
                                                                                      on a thermal--
maybe even make some money while you're up here--
ask why is each second so
                             charged with a feeling of living in freak
gtterdmmerung days
of live free radical notion or die into negative white on white sun pride
burning away, but equally
                             charged with utopian headlong longevity crowing--
why can't i be steady? 
why is my only 
balance built 
of collisions and 
cancelings-out of such sharp spike-of-chaos moods?

field of thistles, 
red and green. 

fields of dollars, thistles, 
solidi and yen 
and rand and rupees blowing off the curve of land. 



raking lace
at the fringe of the tide,
raking with fingers
the english and cutwork
and french of the froth,
with the negative black
dwarf sun in her eye echo
eye mirror eye, she, 
taking his fingers, 
english and hebrew bones, 
bobbin bones, 
to lace with her own,
said love, if you like,
but abyss of light.


on a brain-gray day,
                                      he lay on the hill-slanted solar
array with a southern exposure,
toes in the clover
                                mixed in with what are these
pentagrammatic sprays
of pinnate leaves.
                                no clover
here has four leaves
to each one he says
i have seen you before
                                          in the nuclear hazard 
symbol and then again as 
again slants backward 
before that, as nothing but clover
                                                             when childhood was not yet over
and everything was symbol therefore 
nothing was.




but you made every
delicate, elegant wrist
& glistening ankle.
but you made them
beautiful
in braided rope
& dime store gold. 
but you made every
necklace clasp.
but you made them
caress the nape
like an errant wind
after a shower. 
but you made every
eyelash erotic. every
single strand of hair
soft.
but you made them
from dust & bone.
made every glorious 
singing thigh. every
button nose.
but you made them
with holes--
wide open
to the faintest hints
of salt
in a sea breeze, salt
in the sweaty mouth
of a navel, salt
in the blood, sweet
in every wrong way.


cul-de-sac pastoral
the sill plays a cruel joke--thrones me. frames me
lording over lawn mower stripes--myself

in a shallow trench. in grass blades. myself
persisting, despite a dickhead sun--me

in chlorophyll. early, i find myself
swaying--me in the black chokeberry, me

in the rabbit's throat. me, the rabbit. me  
dancing out pellets. out-dancing myself--

my father's pellet gun, the hawk. the joke
is a bright belly full of dark hopping

along my father's garden & the joke
small, between wrapped talons, is the hawking

too, is the axe sun, swift, rising, this joy.
this joy, it swallows itself far too soon


consider the toucan's festive gold breast.
its multicolored pecker, oddly cutesy  
& perhaps, a cartoon-comfort 
to the gym-roped westerners
reclining on a beach in costa rica. 
it's the same old song good-natured
smile, hard work, a hat's off kind
of attitude & before you can say
post-racial, you're a resort toucan.
the benefits are room & board
but the cost is blood. most times
it's the closest ones--birds
of the same rainforest, same
quadrant, same tree--who give up 
your whereabouts to the jaguar. 
quick as you got the gig, the boss 
is tossing you out on your ass 
all over some flipped umbrellas   
& a tourist's scarfed thumb. so now
you're roofless, alone, vulnerable
& the beast is licking his chops
in your mirrored aviators. stifling 
too is the midwestern subdivision
in its treatment of the black squirrel.    
science tells us black squirrels
have driven out native grey squirrels 
in numerous areas, but no bullshit 
in my development, black squirrels 
are relegated to lots with a view
of the highway. mornings
they work shade for acorns
between homes narrow as lincoln logs.
history tells us black squirrels
can't afford robust landscaping
but will pay their mortgage--
chair the neighborhood watch
if you like. slenderizing, their night
of hair. they're sun's prey. 
they avoid overexposure, make tanning
trend. black squirrels
they fit in, get along. know no one.
they see other black squirrels & run.


then there was the time i looked directly into the face 
of the life i thought i was missing, 

of love. i used to think to be not alone meant 
never having to walk through the high wheat 

or struggle in the water. not having to decide not
to fling from some height.

once, the two of us rode one bicycle.
i wore a straw hat and perched on the handlebars 

and beside us the sea oats swayed like skirts 
and i heard a trilling in the crabgrass. 

the sidewalks were bleached as grecian stone
as we rode past the fish shop smelling of morning--
salt, bread, limes, men.

riding in front, it was such that 
i could not be heard always, at least not the first time

for you pedaled into the wind 
and my hair was a ribbon in your eyes.

i said i thought bougainvillea was a stoic plant 
and then had to say twice, no, stoic and then 
no, the bougainvillea and then you said easily 

it was nothing like that at all. 

but our future was clear enough when i asked if you saw 
the clean aprons of those men 

how much longer you think until they clean the fish? 
did you see how white those aprons were? did you see?
 
to which you said 
how much is it, then, you think you need?


since i was the one who had been ill, it was me she came to see.
everyone wanted a glimpse of her.
the people emerged from their houses toward mine 
and with such caution. 
they made a visor of their hands.
it was as if they were to be accounted for,
wading the long uphill, little moving triangles 
all i could distinguish at first.
but the queen came to see only me and i saw her. 
and my life for a while was dismissed
and so repaired.


in the road, a dog. days dead, 
that dog. liliana was walking beside me awhile 
i am sure and i was almost not crying but then found 

what i was looking for. 
she heaved it for me--all of it, the stench, the weight--
in her thin arms until it was too much. 

tired, she dragged the thing by its wasted paws 
all the way home. her dress was stained. this is how 

i learned about love. she did not mind at all 
the silent, steady distance i placed between us.


this was more like the atmosphere
had been pinched, whose chirp was an unexpected gust 
in a harmonium enough 
to break all that high horse talk
that curdles the atmosphere. while centaurs

ate grass and hurdled epitaphs, that chirp 
in the midst did change one of us. 
'twas clawed out in a feeling's flock
'twas 'couraged by the tall grass
did you not catch it? 

it is enough to gather at your age
it is enough to note just what 
was said that provoked the alps to rage. 
and the eye sews along. but can it cup 
a crazing off the tops of trees?

just one eye as yours could be enough--
one for six moons that surround 
the mind's water birth, while a lily on its cot
bloated, lapses. sparrow, here again countless
consuls tower and luff but the world sizes
down to a restless heart

to the one note that repeats itself and is all. 
to the note one repeats to one's self and all. 
to the one line spitting the heart into flight. 

metaphor is elsewhere, a jewel resulting 
in the snout of a pig. sparrow, here--nearly unresting thing
which always seems suddenly to never have left 
my mind. because you will so easily disappear, 
i think of you as infinitely near. 




whose table is that, left on three legs?
if there's been a mistake, it may be 
in assuming less vulnerability 
as one fills the vase--

whose buoyant comfort exaggerates 
at the sight of his own proffered, 
sympathetic hand, striking him so clean
in comparison

gloved white, magician--for a sec 
he even sees the calla lily's furl
in the gesture of voil


tennessee we are here, between trees, 
with the tempo of a rosary being strung
in a queue of escalating beads--

carolina it's not quite the count in
the countinghouse of my chest
but the heart does make an awful attempt

t and a circle wherever it may be 
there was music coming on

c which though machinery-like 
moves not in cogs, and never
springs, but waves through

t like wired applause for antic backstage
buds on the pre-comeuppance buzz but it 
fades

c but only after the chorus has pulsed

t it drops off with sudden decision, like fountain
water gone dross

c or it reaches the furthest point
the branch turns from us, and is for some arc 
fully quiet...

t until the roulette snaps its jaw and the choir's
circuit opens to one

c like a pigeon unhinged, its wings
in sudden white-rumped ascent

t unopposed by iridescence

c unopposed by iridescence

					assume you have discovered an entropy of spirit, immeasurable of course, but it pulls graveward all those whose element is breath, not as the in and out again of water and the sun, but oblivion's ass-first downhill twenty-four-hour drag. knowledge is an after-the-fact affair, fair game for a hunger striker's skeptic gopher tooth. remember your agenbite of inwit, but don't, please don't, go knocking on doors declaring you've gone hollow with all the others, no one will believe you so long as your bag of flesh is fair. fall down the stairs to another street. have you noticed nature does not care for you, no matter the pathos of your fallacies, your antiperspirant, or you arms folded over the stretch marks of your hardest years? that's you, cell mate, roping a platonic calf. rare air, this is all you'll catch and never can. live on that for a week and leave a message on your machine, nourished by words alone. those fireworks you inherited, where are they now? will you set them off to end the show? you have a story that simply cannot be sold, and no rewrite can change country or cast, so here you are in never-never land again. that figure off there in the mist is nietzsche, stay clear, they say his breath is vile, he needs his space or so the professors say. were you handed this out of an old script or are you improvising this to-do? whatever you are, an actor or a human merely with all the other actors, or can you tell the difference without a script in hand, you talk about a text that is not there. each morning your own short-form obituary appears on every page. an open mike will follow. but this is only in the babblesphere, don't inhale those dialogues that bubble up. weariness grows in direct proportion to answers that recede nightly as you snore. did you audition for this part or did you win it in an all-night poker game? the difference is the same, none, today. don't give your chips to another to bet, that's stacking the odds in your favor, sharing the blame. avoid places where the lights are always on. try finding a sunset through a simple gift of looking west. there can be too much light for your own good. pace pascal. let someone close your eyes. necessary, or so i'm told. that hand in front of your face, try it now.

 stood still in october
 in the failing light and sought,
 each in the other, ease
  
 and release from silence,
 from the slow damnation
 of speech that is weak
 and falls from silence.
  
 in the october sun
 by the green river we spoke,
 late in october, the leaves 
 of the water maples had fallen.
  
 but whatever we said
 in the bright leaves was lost,
 quick as the leaf-fall,
 brittle and blood red.            


                 for kenneth rexroth, 


listen. put on morning.
 waken into falling light.
 a man's imagining
 suddenly may inherit
 the handclapping centuries
 of his one minute on earth. 
 and hear the virgin juries
 talk with his own breath
 to the corner boys of his street.
 and hear the black maria
 searching the town at night.
 and hear the playropes caa
 the sister mary in.
 and hear willie and davie
 among bracken of narnain
 sing in a mist heavy
 with myrtle and listeners.
 and hear the higher town
 weep a petition of fears
 at the poorhouse close upon
 the public heartbeat.
 and hear the children tig
 and run with my own feet
 into the netting drag
 of a suiciding principle.
 listen. put on lightbreak.
 waken into miracle.
 the audience lies awake
 under the tenements
 under the sugar docks
 under the printed moments.
 the centuries turn their locks
 and open under the hill
 their inherited books and doors
 all gathered to distil
 like happy berry pickers
 one voice to talk to us. 
 yes listen. it carries away
 the second and the years
 till the heart's in a jacket of snow
 and the head's in a helmet white
 and the song sleeps to be wakened
 by the morning ear bright.
 listen. put on morning.
 waken into falling light.



  
 what does it matter if the words
 i choose, in the order i choose them in,
 go out into a silence i know
 nothing about, there to be let
 in and entertained and charmed
 out of their master's orders? and yet
 i would like to see where they go
 and how without me they behave.
  

 
  
 speaking is difficult and one tries
 to be exact and yet not to
 exact the prime intention to death.
 on the other hand the appearance of things
 must not be made to mean another
 thing. it is a kind of triumph
 to see them and to put them down
 as what they are. the inadequacy
 of the living, animal language drives
 us all to metaphor and an attempt
 to organize the spaces we think
 we have made occur between the words.
  

 
  
 the bad word and the bad word and
 the word which glamours me with some
 quick face it pulls to make me let
 it leave me to go across
 in roughly your direction, hates
 to go out maybe so completely
 on another silence not its own.
  

 
  
 before i know it they are out
 afloat in the head which freezes them.
 then i suppose i take the best
 away and leave the others arranged
 like floating bergs to sink a convoy.
  

 
  
 one word says to its mate o
 i do not think we go together
 are we doing any good here
 why do we find ourselves put down?
 the mate pleased to be spoken to
 looks up from the line below
 and says well that doubtful god
 who has us here is far from sure
 how we on our own tickle the chin
 of the prince or the dame that lets us in.
  

 
  
 the dark companion is a star
 very present like a dark poem
 far and unreadable just out
 at the edge of this poem floating.
 it is not more or less a dark 
 companion poem to the poem.
  

 
  
 language is expensive if
 we want to strut, busked out
 showing our best on silence.
 good morning. that is a bonny doing
 of verbs you wear with the celandine
 catching the same sun as mine.
 you wear your dress like a prince but
 a country's prince beyond my ken.
 through the chinks in your lyric coat
 my ear catches a royal glimpse
 of fuzzed flesh, unworded body.
 was there something you wanted to say?
 i myself dress up in what i can
 afford on the broadway. underneath
 my overcoat of the time's slang
 i am fashionable enough wearing
 the grave-clothes of my generous masters.
  

 
  
 and what are you supposed to say
 i asked a new word but it kept mum.
 i had secretly admired always
 what i thought it was here for.
 but i was wrong when i looked it up
 between the painted boards. it said
 something it was never very likely
 i could fit in to a poem in my life.
  

 
  
 the good word said i am not pressed
 for time. i have all the foxglove day
 and all my user's days to give
 you my attention. shines the red
 fox in the digitalis grove.
 choose me choose me. guess which
 word i am here calling myself 
 the best. if you can't fit me in
 to lying down here among the fox
 glove towers of the moment, say
 i am yours the more you use me. tomorrow
 same place same time give me a ring.
  

 
  
 backwards the poem's just as good.
 we human angels as we read
 read back as we gobble the words up.
 allowing the poem to represent
 a recognizable landscape
 sprouting green up or letting green
 with all its weight of love hang
 to gravity's sweet affection,
 arse-versa it is the same object,
 even although the last word seems
 to have sung first, or the breakfast lark
 sings up from the bottom of the sea.

 
 
  
 the poem is not a string of knots
 tied for a meaning of another time
 and county, unreadable, found
 by chance. the poem is not a henge
 or easter island emerged longnose
 or a tally used by early unknown
 peoples. the words we breathe and puff
 are our utensils down the dream
 into the manhole. replace the cover.

 
 
  
 the words are mine. the thoughts are all
 yours as they occur behind
 the bat of your vast unseen eyes.
 these words are as you see them put
 down on the dead-still page. they have
 no ability above their station.
 their station on silence is exact.
 what you do with them is nobody's business.

 
 
  

running across the language lightly
this morning in the hangingover
whistling light from the window, i
was tripped and caught into the whole
formal scheme which art is.
i had only meant to enjoy
dallying between the imaginary
and imaginary's opposite
with a thought or two up my sleeve.
 
 

 
is the word? yes yes. but i hear
a sound without words from another
person i can't see at my elbow.
a sigh to be proud of. you? me?
 
 

 
having to construct the silence first
to speak out on i realize
the silence even itself floats
at my ear-side with a character
i have not met before. hello
hello i shout but that silence
floats steady, will not be marked
by an off-hand shout. for some reason
it refuses to be broken now
by what i thought was worth saying.
if i wait a while, if i look out
at the heavy greedy rooks on the wall
it will disperse. now i construct
a new silence i hope to break.


unmet at euston in a dream
 of london under turner's steam
 misting the iron gantries, i
 found myself running away
 from scotland into the golden city.
  
 i ran down gray's inn road and ran
 till i was under a black bridge.
 this was me at nineteen
 late at night arriving between
 the buildings of the city of london.
  
 and the i o i have fallen down
 fell in my dream beside the bank
 of england's wall to be, me
 with my money belt of northern ice.
 i found eliot and he said yes
  
 and sprang into a holmes cab.
 boswell passed me in the fog
 going to visit whistler who
 was with john donne who had just seen
 paul potts shouting on soho green.
  
 midnight. i hear the moon
 light chiming on st paul's.
  
 the city is empty. night
 watchmen are drinking their tea,
  
 the fire had burnt out.
 the plague's pits had closed
 and gone into literature.
  
 between the big buildings 
 i sat like a flea crouched
 in the stopped works of a watch.


                                                    when i'm
braced for a mugging is stranger than the
eritrean boy asking the question
outside clifton hill station. the skinnier
for baggies he's hop & a skip
across three lanes following my hand.
no way to countermand him.
no way he'd stay for the whole
story. the ghosts of spray-can gangs
who tagged the length & breadth of the subway
are benign i'd tell him. there'll be
the odd gutter-crawler in front of the house
of love. keep walking. the garage'll be closed
but in summertime a gaggle
of mechanics will punt a football
in the road there. one missing his mark
is bound to call an eritrean
to kick it back. ignore them.
continue to a far flung franchise
of the american dream. once it was
the dull red brick of the united kingdom
pub where the last of the blessed
aged quicker than most
on victoria bitter.
now it's the mcdonalds
of this convergence of worlds
in whose vicinity i'm more
or less lost.

titian's young englishman with a glove, circa 
it happened in physics,
reading a library art book under the desk,
the lesson was archimedes in the bath
i turned a page and fell
for an older man, and anonymous at that,
hardly ideal 
he was four hundred and forty-five,
i was fourteen.
eureka' streaked each thought
i prayed no-one would hear
and paradise all term
was page 
i prayed no-one would guess.
of course
my fingers, sticky with toffee and bliss,
failed to entice him from his century
his cool grey stare
fastened me firmly in mine.
i got six overdues,
suspension of borrowing rights
and a d in physics.
but had by heart what archimedes proves.
ten years later i married
a european with cool grey eyes,
a moustache,
pigskin gloves.


thirty years ago. and only yesterday,'
says balzs, slapping at a fly.
we sit beside a bottle underneath his vines
and watch the football arc between his sons.
 
check through the corner one,' the sergeant says,
and make it short and sweet. take a couple of men.'
seventeen-year-olds still nervous with a gun.
it's an office block like most
down the derelict street
he keeps a good five metres ahead,
tries the rooms along each corridor
and beckons the two boys on.
they reach the third floor,
breathing easier now.
the council chamber's here,
empty but for a tangle of chairs
at the northern window end
unseemly three-day corpses,
wooden legs in the air
dried into the floor  blood-stains
and seeping through the shattered panes
the distant dialogue of cross-fire.
directly opposite him  another door.
he notes the fact an instant before
it opens sharply and his counterpart 
the hated avo uniform of green 
levels his gun and time is not.
they freeze. somewhere beyond,
the seconds slide away
between their eyes the slender lifeline holds
across the mirror of air.
dntetlen bartom azt hiszem'
stalemate i think, my friend.
each slightly lowers his gun
and slowly, eyes still locked, takes one step back.
the two doors close together, softly as hands on a prayer.
senki sincs ott,' each says to his men
nobody there.
 
in hungary we used to say
nha a msodik alkalom jn elszr 
sometimes the second chance comes first.'
he's silent, years away.
the day is insubstantial, seems to float
in the dry gum-scented heat.
only the football's thud,
steady as the beat of some huge heart,
holds us in time and space.
he rouses himself to swear
az anyd, off the kohlrabi, rossz gyerekek,'
then pours us another beer.
the head on each glass whispers small talk
we blow the froth into the air.


mondays began
with one plait loose, a pip in your teeth
and late for geography, lined and blank,
facts to the right, tall stories left.
to sail the heat in a weatherboard classroom boat
with banana and vegemite colouring the air
sargasso green. to ship ten thousand things
on cursive seas to the edge of the known page
--coffee, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves.
to import small desires and grown-up needs
in little packets of time for show and tell.
to carve your name on the prow.
to wait for the bell.
 
 
 
in the parlour
only the french clock answered back.
they sat cross-legged on the persian carpet
destinations flashed by
the smell of marveer, lavender, dusty velvet.
they opened their eyes in the olden times
to fossick under the coffin flaps
of the jarrah window seat
for proper advice from disheveled magazines
nose straighteners, recipes, posture improvers,
the runt who smoked and the chap who rowed.
they didn't see foresight's guarded smile,
they didn't hear hindsight howl like a dog
the riddles were wordy, the clues were dumb
lopped head of a doll, silk wedding sleeve,
gilt volumes, silverfish,
and in the glass case,
untouchable figurines locked away
as grown-ups always seemed to be
shepherd and shepherdess on their marks,
wedgwood, royal doulton, limoges?
the real thing?
 
 
almond trees
cover willunga plains like the misty breath
of winter children, the blossom hovers. dearth,
says the black bark, splits to let scent through
with open questions where when why what who?
as for that earliest aroma fear,
she'd  smell it, taste it, anywhere,
one part in a million, pungent as coffee or smoke,
already there in her mother's milk.
against its grey unbeing she caught
at talismans  black stones on a white plate,
concrete nouns clattering out of thought.
marking time down the dead-end street
to morning. why was it always dark
in the quiet hall? through a memory crack
of light an edge squeezed round the door
regret to inform stop missing in stop the air
elliptic with tracer fire, familiar eyes
glancing away, prismatic as flies'.
voices crept and huddled, where's daddy's girl?
he did come back, but who? they could not tell.
collections began. the tang of foreign coins
lent her a lingo and currency for the unknown
brother stuck down squares of expedited
love with serrated edges. and they were invited
to a fancy-dress ball with games of us and them.
father could not come for he was lame
and mother had to watch and wait not play
so they learned dolls and trains and night and day
and snakes and ladders and hide and seek.
knight's gambit. castle your king. check.
and when the black door opened and they knew
threshold was famished, brother stepped through.
now fear had her id and her address.
best send an invitation. tell her guest
the lightest thing she served would ward off harm 
a stick, a stone, a cloud of white perfume,
thought itself, needing a go-between
to say this fragrance is like newborn skin,
these quickening trees, like mary's aging cousin
conceiving all baptism out of season'.
 
 
 
she collected dictionaries
as other women take up men
and shelve them
manuals, grammars, teach yourself
german, malay, italian, swahili, welsh,
like a passion for clothes that would hang
unworn in the dark,
for peridots, garnets, amethysts, pearls
in a shut case, nouns declined.
each unknown word shone with delicious fire
and the alien phrases silked her skin
with their genders and connotations.
 
she might have been the end house
on the waterfront of macau
welcoming every sailor in.
but the longing for many tongues
to part her lips  si, igen, ja,
ah oui, yes, yes 
was departure's smile,
a leaning to the wind
that sweeps a glitter of light
across the sea and sets a silvery chill
at the neck. quick, to those books
guarding the mantelpiece,
isbns snug as a span of days
to bread and fruit and sparkling wine.
 
she had been given a cyclamen with scent,
some new trick that married violet and rose,
as if a flower should yearn to sing
and the pink timbre tremble
into quietest words.
she touched her flesh and knew
that it would fade as speech did
and did not.
and yet it was not language that she sought,
nor the music of any meaning.
an old allegiance drew her on
beyond the first ground of thought
and the idea even of silence
to the fifth season which must at last return
with its weather of recognition
and its lost ends.



the first ten steps from the house to the shed, i break
two or three promises the night has strung
                                                                             like spiders' webs across my path.
the morning is sprung with secrets
the night's been spinning all night and now they're trapping daylight
between the oak and the mendicant poplars and snapping
 
 

before me on the broken trail to my desk. in the cowshed
the spider hangs on the cross of herself
                                                                             above the first stall door,
where, these seven days, she's been dying,
and i bank a fire and shoo the children when they follow me in
and i sit to work. winter's come, and down on the river the kangaroos
 
 

know it. i winter here all day, the poplars, wasted saints, laying on their hands,
and nine hours on there's a shoal of cloud in a cold sky
                                                              and a blue moon loose in it like a man overboard.
why is it so hard to keep a fire burning
all day? you turn your back and it's gone out
somewhere, and yet you sit here still, every thought broken,
                                                                                                            your feet cold in your boots
 
 

two nights later the moon rises nicotine-stained and peaceable
into the fingers of the silver trees,
                                                             and the floodplain is a smokefilled basement.
out of the blue sprawling mist the plover's mad call
why will a river not stay in the ground?
out on the deck, i draw down deep on the evening and turn and walk
 
 

its balm inside and search again briefly for the frequency of family life
and i find it in the bath, my girl
                                               and our three children, sleek as seals,
and in that moment a truck passes on the road
and snaps the powerline from the eaves. the house shudders and we fall
back in time to candles and stories by heart and reading news from memory.
 
 

the earth, it seems, has caught a fever, and where will she lie
to rest? when the men come
                                               and plug us back in, i believe i hear her
groan. how will she begin
to forgive us, or is that what she's been doing all along?
in the night the mist rolls away, and at dawn there's a frost over everything.
 
 

you'd call it a blessing if you hadn't been woken four times
by minor deities, pyjamaed like children
                                                                             and frantic in the dark with oracles.
why do our children not know how to sleep?
do they fear we've left our waking late? at first light they dawn
and have you rise and lead them out into the story
 
 

the river has told the grass again, a parable the day has forgotten by nine.
and by ten, at your desk, you've forgotten it, too.
                                                                              a man so easily distracted
by himself. but what are you here for
and what do they love, if not the way you leave each day to change the world's mind
and return with the night, your fire spent, your face lined with secrets?
 
 

one night, you arrive home late and tongue-tied and the child wakes choking.
for three hours you wait in emergency
                                                              and the boy sleeps himself well against you,
while an old man and then a woman come with broken-down hearts
and don't leave. you drive home at three and you stand with the boy
in the cold outside and you look up and show him the perfect celestial circle
 
 

ringing the imperfect moon, and you wish you could tell him what it means.
this is what silence looks like, you think later,
                                                                            and a possum lands like ordnance
on the roof, and down in the paddock
a dozen souls are reborn in the bawling cattle and the fox plays the geese
like oboes with broken reeds. night is the world in its other life.
 
 

one's own life is an absurd miracle, waning as long as it lasts,
in beauty or poverty, it makes no difference
                                                                              in the end. one is nothing anymore.
our works are our children. they carry us on.
they tell us, as though we meant something more than our mere being
here. landscape is another way, a practice longer than love and death.
 
 

for instance, the brown horse alone in the paddock all day,
the canting of the black cockatoos,
                                                              the grass parrots parsing the morning,
the grass trembling with afternoon, the paratactic catechism
of sulphur-crested cockatoos in the orange trees, the patience of the river.
go the way the place goes die beautifully to yourself.
 
 

adopt the lively practice of the bluewrens in the hedge and the yoga of the hens.
learn the rules,
                             and forget the rules,
like basho in the naked birches on the river,
flaring now under blue cloud in the late light of winter. a small death. a second
coming. drink tea and watch the landscape forget itself. think of your life
 
 

in place, not time. another time, you're walking home beside the same river.
evening is crimson
                               along the horizon.
look, you say to the child, pointing west.
it's over there, too, he says, pointing east. the place has you almost surrounded.
and there's a dragon, he says. there's always a dragon. wingecarribee zen.
 
 

but it's no good pretending we are creation's anchorites.
the places don't sing,
                                gs said to me once in particular they don't sing you--
george, a father to me, who died in his garden last week,
a man with a river in him when we met, until we fished it out, and i'm still in it.
they don't sing, gs they just are. that's how they sing, and that's what they teach
 
 

and what you taught me. time, that bad idea, is passing anyway, like water.
if you've been sleeping, you once said,
                                                               you've been missing nearly everything.
meaning, the world wakes up at night but what if it doesn't wake again?
another time you said, you're either writing, or you're not so why aren't you
writing? well, i'm writing now. it's either raining, or it's not, and it's raining now
 
 

like a life sentence on the roof and the paddocks and horses and the roos,
and deep down below
                             the syntax of the river and up a bit
my friend wakes from the anaesthetic
dark into the clinical noon of an american summer and wonders how the sun
got inside her and cast these shadows, and how much afternoon she'll get to keep.
 
 

over east, beyond the ridge i can see from the desk and under the basalt hills
and the feet of the holsteins
                                              and the potato fields and brown-barrel gums
an aquifer runs where it always ran
but they're mining it now, and if they draw it all down, it'll keep the city in water
a week. and how much rain and time will it take to make it rise again?
 
 

but seven days is all eternity for a people with no memory
the future is someone else's
                                              country to care for.
landscape, though, has all the time in the world
it's we who are running out. cars careen like idiots through the dusk, and in the roof
the possum calls it a day, and the rain keeps on. it won't be enough, but it'll do.
 
 

my friend in virginia who's singing her cancer down looks on cows with love,
and i think of her and it pleases me
                                             to work where cows came and stood each day and let men
drain them dry. this is still their concrete floor.
this is still their draught, coming off the edge of night and under the barn door.
poems come like that, she told me once, on the wind to where we labour in wait.
 
 

but, listen no one reads poems to learn how to vote. verse can't change
the future's mind. you write it like rain
                                                                              you enter it like nightfall.
it isn't for anything a poem is country,
and it needs you to keep walking it, and i walk out into it now, carrying my friend
and smelling the paddocky wind and feeling the rain cold on my face.



adrift in the middle of my years, i sit in a corner and drink. i eavesdrop
a tableful of girls romancing their cell phones, workshopping
love's abstract particulars,
                                               while football plays on the big screen
i listen like a thief in case the women know the score.
but i never could tell. at fulltime i walk home like a motherless child.
 

witness is a solitary game. there isn't a thing i have left to say
but back in my room i ring like a singing bowl,
empty and unable to stop.
                                               you're in nine kinds of pain, my friend you know
the twenty-seven strains of despair. and your lovely hair has fallen.
the moon at my window is a rusted shot, caught in its corrupt trajectory down.
 

the world was always someone else's oyster, a metaphor
i never could prise open. 
all i'm good for tonight
                                             is to let the night pass,
while beyond me the world peters and my friend fights beautifully
like a trout on god's line. the usual idiots are still in power. but they'll keep.

every year the moon inches away from us. in time she'll swim too far out
to anchor us at our habitual angle to the sun, and that will be the end
of the well-tempered and recursive wildness
                                                             that conceived and suffered us,
and that will be the end of us. we have just two
billion years to thank her for our time here. eternity has a use-by date
 
ii
but it'll be up long before that, and in the meantime,
i sit on the cold step of the cowshed and watch the world throw its shadow
on the moon like a horseblanket
                                                             in the meantime the moon reddens
in the refraction of all our dawns and sunsets, in a kind of transfigured cosmic
smog. an apocalypse that lasts three hours until it's time to go to bed.
 
iii
and in the meantime on the floor of my shed, blue planets sing in the hands
of children as they once sang in war. two small worlds forged to cry terribly down
like creation unravelling upon one's foes now
                                                               make a peaceful clangour on my secular desk.
one spins from its orbit and quakes and chips its cerulean shell on the floor
of heaven. the tectonics of play. we are loved like this, and this is how it ends.

i'm arguing a lot with death these days. and last night i found myself
in court poised to clinch the case against the absurdity of life.
certainly, this was sleeping and certainly
                                                            i was dreaming and i'd been losing the thread,
but all at once i saw where my argument must run, and i was running it there
when my small boy cried and woke me and i went to him and now i'll never know.

spring now, and the river has drawn back her bow. the lark ascends
from the cd-player, and black ducks sip brown ditchwater in the yard.
everything's in bud or leaf, last of all
                                                              the silver poplars and the osage orange,
trees flaring even now in the backyard of the childhood of my friend, the poet,
the poet's son. the world happens twice. draw the linen string taut and shoot.
 
vi
one lives in paradox. debussy plays trucks flounder past like gods
who've lost control of their machines. in between one makes one's life up.
the sound is the price you pay for the sight
                                                             that meets you every morning and half
of what you paid for the house. the shed puts the perfect sky in her pocket,
and possums rut in the roof. eternity is in rehearsal, and this is its soundtrack.
 
vii
brad mows an acre an hour. a general at ease on his machine, a banker
in overalls, he's rationalised our small republic on one tank of gas. and this now--
cutgrass at four o'clock--is how
                                                              hope smells. some days i can see no way out
the body of the world in entropy. but today i sit among the ruins
of the afternoon, and i cannot see how it can't all go on forever.
 
viii
meantime the moon has made herself new again, and there has been rain.
the marulan hills, which had almost forgotten the taste of the word,
are spelling green again this afternoon,
                                                             and there's water in a lake that's been a paddock
for a decade. three black cockatoos, and then three more, fly over as i take
the southwest road. and into all this panoply of hope, the new moon falls.


they listen to the myna birds dicker in the grass.
   the child's blue shoes are caked with
garden dirt. when he runs, she sees the antics
   of a pair of wrens. she works the garden,
 
a pot of rusting gardenias has given off its ales
   and infused the danker germinations of her
grief. she watches her son chase pigeons,
   kick at the leaves piled high. now, a magpie
 
adds to his cascades of laughter as he runs with
   the hose, pours a fine spray, happy to be giving
to the grass this silver courtship. she sighs,
   watches the drops settle in. today, who
 
can explain the sadness she feels. surely this
   day is to be treasured the sun out, the breeze
like a cat's tongue licking a moon of milk
   her son expending himself in small, public
 
bursts, happy among clover where bees hover,
   and unfold centrefolds of nectar. today,
who can explain the heaviness in her head, as if
   all her worries were tomes toward a larger work,
 
one she knows she will never finish, but to which
   she must keep adding, thought by thought.
she sweeps the petals, smells their russet imprint.
   soon dusk will come with an envoy of smoke
 
and her son outlast her patience by a rose.
   already he is tiring, puling at the flowers.
it won't be long before they'll go in, listen
   to the jug purr comfort. he'll sleep and she'll
 
lie back, or get up to unhook the cry of her cat
   from the wire door. now, a few cicadas are idling,
giving each other the gun and a cockatoo calls,
   a haughty felon. she sighs, knowing she won't
 
escape her mood today, the turned earth
   or its rank persuasions her child's petulance
flaring like an orchid, or a cockatoo's unruly crest.
   today, she knows she will need to consider
 
her unhappiness, of what she is a prisoner  if not
   the loss of hope's particulars. her son soaks
the path, rinses the sky of its featureless blue.
   he is giving that water, now, to everything.


today i watched a boy fly his kite.
it didn't crackle in the wind  but
gave out a barely perceptible hum.
 
at a certain height, i'd swear i heard
it sing. he could make it climb in
any wind could crank those angles up,
 
make it veer with the precision of
an insect targeting a sting then he'd
let it roil in rapturous finesse, a tiny
 
bird in mid-air courtship. when
lightning cracked across the cliff 
like quick pale flicks of yak-hair
 
fly-whisks  he stayed steady. for
so long he kept his arms up, as if
he knew he'd hoist that kite enough.
 
i asked if it was made of special silk,
if he used some particular string 
and what he'd heard while holding it.
 
he looked at me from a distance,
then asked about my alms bowl,
my robes, and about that for which
 
a monk lives. it was then i saw
i could tell him nothing in the cohort
wind, that didn't sound illusory.


begin in a cave.
listen to the floor boil with rodents, insects.
weep for the pups that have fallen. later,
you'll fly the narrow passages of those bones,
                                                       but for now --
 
open your mouth, out will fly names
like pipistrelle, desmodus, tadarida. then,
listen for a frequency
lower than the seep of water, higher
than an ice planet hibernating
beyond a glacier of time.
 
visit op shops. hide in their closets.
breathe in the scales and dust
of clothes left hanging. to the underwear
and to the crumbled black silks -- well,
give them your imagination
and plenty of line, also a night of gentle wind.
 
by now your fingers should have
touched petals open. you should have been dreaming
each night of anthers and of giving
to their furred beauty
your nectar-loving tongue. but also,
your tongue should have been practising the cold
of a slippery, frog-filled pond.
 
go down on your elbows and knees.
you'll need a spieliologist's desire for rebirth
and a miner's paranoia of gases --
but try to find within yourself
the scent of a bat-loving flower.
 
read books on pogroms. never trust an owl.
its face is the biography of propaganda.
never trust a hawk. see its solutions
in the fur and bones of regurgitated pellets.
 
and have you considered the smoke
yet from a moving train? you can start
half an hour before sunset,
but make sure the journey is long, uninterrupted
and that you never discover
the faces of those trans-siberian exiles.
 
spend time in the folds of curtains.
seek out boarding-school cloakrooms.
practise the gymnastics of web umbrellas.
 
                                             are you
floating yet, thought-light,
without a keel on your breastbone?
then, meditate on your bones as piccolos,
on mastering the thermals
beyond the tremolo reverberations
beyond the lexical.
 
                                           become adept
at describing the spectacles of the echo --
but don't watch dark clouds
passing across the moon. this may lead you
to fetishes and cults that worship false gods
by lapping up bowls of blood from a tomb.
 
practise echo-locating aerodromes,
stamens. send out rippling octaves
into the fossils of dank caves --
then edit these soundtracks
with a metronome of dripping rocks, heartbeats
and with a continuous, high-scaled wondering
about the evolution of your own mind.
 
but look, i must tell you -- these instructions
are no manual. months of practice
may still only win you appreciation
of the acoustical moth,
hatred of the hawk and owl. you may need
 
to observe further the floating black host
through the hills.


laid out flat
in the back of the station wagon my father borrowed
i look up
the leaves are immense,
green and golden with clear summer light
breaking through 
though i turn only my neck
i can see all of them
along this avenue that has no limits.
 
what does it matter
that i am only eyes
if i am to be carried
so lightly
under the trees of the world?
from beyond the numbness of my strange body
the wealth of the leaves
falls forever
into my small still watching.


like buying a ticket inland
                           to barely understandable provinces
with no language at all i bargain and pay
                                                      for this warm planet
tipping the scales of wrist and elbow
spreading my fingers with its weight to read
                                           my life-line my heart-line
my seams and mounds of fortune.
i stare
into the sun on smoggy evenings
                                     the throat of an old street oven
that seems to expand as i anticipate
                            its glow engulfing my solar system.
i open my mouth
                   and china fills it sliding into tartness
                                                               forcing my lips
to begin its name
over and over then finger-painting my chin
                                                with the gel of ripeness.
i swallow the pabulum of infancy
                                          the sweet mucilage of age.
it makes me eat like a person alone
                                          who hasn't loved for years.
there seems to be no core
                            the few black seeds hardly noticed
in its one undifferentiated cell
other tongue
               that makes mine lazy    the flavour . . .
                                                             the flavour is . . .
my hand moves like an incantation
through an alley of blunt flames
                                   that can be eaten with a spoon.
i gorge
on a people's staple
                            fat buddha   squat amida
                                                            repeat three times
persimmon persimmon persimmon
and go to heaven.


someone said
                 that working through difficult equations
was like walking
in a pure and beautiful landscape 
                                              the numbers glowing
                                                           like works of art.
and in the same crowded room
a woman i thought i didn't like
                                               was singing to herself 
talking and listening
                                          but singing to herself too
and instantly
                        with the logic of numbers
                                                                       i liked her
as if she had balanced something
i couldn't.
the corridors are long and pristine
                                                          but i'm not lost 
just working
         towards some minute
                                                 or overwhelming
                                                                        equipoise.


it's something they carry with them
                       explorers  night shifts  seamen 
like a good pair of binoculars
or a camera case
                perfectly and deeply compartmented.
it has a quiet patina
that both absorbs and reflects
                           like a valuable instrument
                                                you have to sign for
  contract with alone 
                     and at the end of the voyage
                                                          you get to keep.
sometimes it's very far away.
sometimes so close
               at first you think the person next to you
is picking up  putting down
                                 a personal cup
                                    a book in another language
before you realise what
 when talk has moved off
                               leaning its arms
                                       on someone else's table 
is being
handed to you.


dead to the world i have failed you
forgive me, traveller.
 
thirsty, i was no fountain
hungry, i was not bread
tired, i was no pillow
 
forgive my unwritten poems
the many i have frozen with irony
the many i have trampled with anger
the many i have rejected in self-defence
the many i have ignored in fear
 
unaware, blind or fearful
i ignored them.
they clamoured everywhere
those unwritten poems.
they sought me out day and night
and i turned them away.
 
forgive me the colours
they might have worn
forgive me their eclipsed faces
they dared not venture from
the unwritten lines.
 
under each inert hour of my silence
died a poem, unheeded


tell the truth of experience
they say they also
say you must let
go learn to let go
let your children
go
 
and they go
and you stay
letting them go
because you are obedient and
respect everyone's freedom
to go and you stay
 
and you want to tell the truth
because you are yours truly
its obedient servant
but you can't because
you're feeling what you're not
supposed to feel you have
let them go and go and
 
you can't say what you feel
because they might read
this poem and feel guilty
and some post-modern hack
will back them up
and make you feel guilty
and stop feeling which is
post-modern and what
you're meant to feel
 
so you don't write a poem
you line up words in prose
inside a journal trapped
like a scorpion in a locked
drawer to be opened by
your children let go
after lived life and all the time
a great wave bursting
howls and rears and
 
you have to let go
or you're gone you're
gone gasping you
let go
till the next wave
towers crumbles
shreds you to lace--
 
when you wake
your spine is twisted
like a sea-bird
inspecting the sky,
stripped by lightning.


feed fred and sit with him
and mind he doesn't walk about.
he falls. tell him his ute is safe
back home. thinks someone's pinched it,
peers around the carpark all the time.
his family brought him in it and
he thinks it's gone.
he was a farmer once . . .
 
i take the tray. the ice-cream's almost
melted round the crumbled orange jelly
and the soup's too hot. i know
i'll have to blow on it.
 
hunched, trapped behind a tray,
he glances sideways, face as brown
and caverned as the land itself,
long thin lips droop ironic
at the corners, gaunt nose.
the blue and white pajamas cage
the restless rangy legs.
in and out they go, the feet
in cotton socks feeling for the ground.
 
are you a foreigner?
not exactly. just a little sunburnt,
and i put the jelly down. i musn't feel
a thing my smile has come unstuck.
i place a paper napkin on his lap. he winces.
you're a foreigner all right, he says.
ok, i say. what's one displacement more or less,
wishing i were a hearty flat-faced fenian
with a perm and nothing doing in the belfry.
someone like his mother. or a wife who
spared him the sorrow of himself.
now he grabs the spoon. i'll do it.
right, i say, you go ahead. just ask me
if you want some help. the tone's not right.
i watch the trembling progress of the spoon
for what seems years, paralysed with pity
for his pride.
 
how does a dark-faced woman give a man called fred
who cropped a farm and drove a battered ute
a meal of soup and jelly?
 
outside the window, clouds are swelling
into growing darkness and there's a man
hard on his knees planting something in the rain.


she slumps in the disabled bay
clutching a waffle-cotton gown
around a spreading paunch,
shambling breasts.
why not say i'?
for that's who sits at  a.m.
waiting for the health club
pool to open in the rain.
a grown woman, after all,
supposed to know her whereabouts.
 
today's my mother's birthday,
a  aquarian of the self-
denying kind, never say i' her motto.
she had me nailed for years. her voice
drowns out the radio's chattering static.
now i'm the same age she was, dying,
observing noble savagery
 
a gathering knot of skinny women,
tight black butts in leotards,
regulation sneakers, brazil-waxed calves,
gripping i-pods, mobiles, water bottles.
the men stand back, silent, sullen,
balding, bored and out of it. health stalkers,
renouncers of smoke and flame,
deniers of brimstone.
one hell of a century
between the holocaust and the atom bomb
who are these people?
 
between the deep and shallow end,
never say thank you or good morning.
avoid eye contact.
signals may be misinterpreted.
slow lane, fast lane, walking lane
only's where i'm at.
the moving parts count laps
twenty five's a half-hour's worth.
i sing myself a rumba to keep rhythm
the speedo wall clock ticks a strict 
defeats my ruse while dove's feet skitter
arrow-wise across the perspex roof.
no diving running eating smiling
share if lanes are busy.
perhaps, perhaps, perhaps.
 
the waiting crowd are all, like me,
up early talking or silent,
more vivacious than galahs,
more foolish than parrots.
 
we stand and wait, walk up and down
in the rain talking or not, holding
in sagging muscle, spreading paunch,
talking about things that must matter.
so much seems to hang on
getting in that door.


someone will push the house over one day,
some spacedozer give it a shove,
but the cobbles we laid down here in the yard,
these are a labour of love.
 
all winter we set these cobbles in place,
or was it the summer as well?
sorting through lumpy bluestone pitchers
for ones that looked suitable.
 
the old house decayed  along with us 
will a strange new resident
admire the patio made in joy
wondering what we meant?
 
things fall apart, the poet wrote,
certainties crumble and move
but the cobbles oddly plotted together,
these are our labour of love.


this synod is convinced that the forces  of the allies are being used of god to  vindicate the rights of the weak and to  maintain the moral order of the world.                                                          anglican synod, melbourne, .
 
bit weird at first,
that starey look in the eyes,
the hair down past his shoulders,
but after a go with the ship's barber,
a sea-water shower and the old slouch hat
across his ears, he started to look the part.
took him a while to get the way
a bayonet fits the old lee-enfield,
but going in on the boats
he looked calmer than any of us,
just gazing in over the swell
where the cliffs looked black against the sky.
when we hit he fairly raced in through the waves,
then up the beach, swerving like a full-back at the end
when the turks'd really got on to us.
time we all caught up,
he was off like a flash, up the cliffs,
after his first machine gun.
he'd done for three turks when we got there,
the fourth was a gibbering mess.
seeing him wave that blood-red bayonet,
i reckoned we were glad
to have him on the side.


my mother's god
has written the best
of the protestant proverbs
 
you make the bed
you lie in it
god helps him
 
who helps himself.
he tends to shy away from churches,
is more to be found in
 
phone calls to daughters
or rain clouds over rusty grass.
the catholics
 
have got him wrong entirely
too much waving the arms about,
the incense and caftan, that rainbow light.
 
he's leaner than that,
lean as a pair of
grocer's scales,
 
hard as a hammer at cattle sales
the third and final
time of asking.
 
his face is most clear
in a scrubbed wooden table
or deep in the shine of a
 
laminex bench.
he's also observed at weddings and funerals
by strict invitation, not knowing quite
 
which side to sit on.
his second book, my mother says,
is often now too well received
 
the first is where the centre is,
tooth for claw and eye for tooth
whoever tried the other cheek?
 
well, christ maybe,
but that's another story.
god, like her, by dint of coursework
 
has a further degree in predestination.
immortal, omniscient, no doubt of that,
he nevertheless keeps regular hours
 
and wipes his feet clean on the mat,
is not to be seen at three in the morning.
his portrait done in a vigorous charcoal
 
is fixed on the inner
curve of her forehead.
omnipotent there
 
in broad black strokes
he does not move.
it is not easy, she'd confess,
 
to be my mother's god.


the story keeps on coming back,
a man my father knew,
that grazier across the river
up north a mile or two,
 
a story that my father spun
to last me all my life
of how a man should not behave
when burying a wife.
 
all through the funeral he'd wept . . .
the priest there going on
about st peter and the gates
through which his wife had gone.
 
his sobbing at the grave, dad found,
was harder still to bear.
then men in suits, the women in
the best they had to wear
 
knew deeper down it couldn't pass,
no matter who had died.
extravagance like this was always
better kept inside.
 
at last the man who sent his beasts
to die on tuesday gave
one final, high unseemly cry
and leapt into the grave.
 
mate,' he yelled. don't go. don't go'
and scrabbled at the wood.
a friend reached in to fish him out
as any christian would.
 
the women in their hats stood back.
two men jumped in the trench
and skidding on the polished lid
contrived at last to wrench
 
him out and lead him to his car.
the clergyman intoned
ashes to ashes, dust to dust.'
they heard the broken moans
 
coming from a side window.
he hammered at the wheel.
mate,' he yelled. don't leave me mate.'
not knowing what to feel,
 
the mourners now were drifting off
towards their dusty cars.
my father always finished here
as if he'd gone too far.
 
but i could hear the slamming doors,
the hearse without much chrome
and duel decisions made to miss
the wake and head straight home.
 
mate, oh mate' the man had cried,
releasing all their fears.
the sound of boots on coffin wood
survives them down the years.


seven o'clock, the time set in his mind
like herbs displayed in aspic, as the chimes
were striking. then the squeaking of his shoes'
 
black leather tread, pacing those measures down
the first-floor hall, where sunset's apricot
was oozing nectar through the open doors.
 
her voice, conspiratorial and astonished,
called him across the bedroom's drowning cube
towards the window. how well miss waterson
 
remembers it please come and look at this,
mr devine the clock on the mantelpiece
rehearsing for the hour of seven. she pointed
 
down. there, a moving picture on the lawn,
his father, like a patient whose long months
of immobility meant learning afresh
 
the art of walking, climbing the light's green slope
towards the summer house, looking intently
as though for a cuff link or a signature.
 
that evening he still thinks of, lying now,
no longer needing lessons for his legs,
how he cast back his glance and saw the windows
 
blazing like cats' eyes on his uselessness,
and in that golden mirror, two gold figures
recording him, two shadows of dark gold--
 
miss waterson was it? and another one--
and then took out his watch on which the hands
were so meticulously assembling seven.
 
young emily, appointed just the week
before, came rushing to the stairs--she'd seen
him stumble--to advise mr devine
 
about his father's fall. and so, almost
immobilized herself in that clinging syrup,
she observed the hall clock's quaint rendition of
 
seven, the time set clearly in his mind
like summer herbs in aspic, as the chimes
were striking. then the squeaking of his shoes'
 
black leather tread, pacing those measures down
the corridor, where sunset's apricot
was oozing nectar through the open doors.
 
her voice, companionable but astonished,
floated across the bedroom's drowning cube
as he descended. how well miss waterson
 
remembers it please come and look at this
and emily, who had just been taken on
that week, came rushing to the window. she pointed
 
down, smartly on the stroke of seven. there,
a moving picture on the lawn, was old
mr devine, like a patient whose long months
 
of immobility meant learning afresh
the art of walking, climbing the light's green slope
abstractedly towards the rose garden.
 
that evening he still thinks of, lying now,
no longer needing lessons for his legs,
how he cast back his glance and saw the windows
 
glaring like cats' eyes on his helplessness,
and in that golden mirror, two gold figures
gesticulating, two shadows of dark gold--
 
the new girl was it? and another one--
and then took out his watch on which the hands
were so laboriously assembling seven.
 
miss waterson, with emily behind her
in a panic, dashed to the stairs to find
mr devine, anxious to let him know
 
about his father's fall. and there they saw him,
almost immobile in that clinging syrup,
and heard the hall clock's muffled tolling of
 
seven, the time set firmly in his mind . . .


what images could yet suggest their range
of tender colours, thick as old brocade,
or shot silk or flowers on a dress
where black and rose and lime seem to caress
the red that starts to shimmer as they fade?
 
like something half-remembered from a dream
they come from places we have never seen.
 
they chatter and they squawk and sometimes scream.
 
here the macaw clings at the rings to show
the young galahs talking as they feed
with feathers soft and pink as dawn on snow
that it too has a dry and dusky tongue.
their murmuring embraces every need
from languid vanity to wildest greed.
 
in the far corner sit two smoky crones
their heads together in a kind of love.
one cleans the other's feathers while it moans.
the others seem to whisper behind fans
while noble dandies gamble in a room
asserting values everyone rejects.
 
a lidded eye observes, and it reflects.
 
the peacocks still pretend they own the yard.
 
for all the softness, how the beaks are hard.


disturbed at  a.m. i hear a claw
scratching the window, tapping at the pane,
and then i realise, a broken branch,
and yet i can't turn back to sleep again.
 
slowly, not to wake you, i get up,
thinking of food, perhaps a quiet read.
a cockroach runs across the kitchen floor,
its lacquered shell as quick and dry as seed.
 
outside the chalice lily lifts its cup
in adoration to the mirrored moon,
full of purpose as it trembles there,
collecting drops of moisture on its spoon.
 
noises of the night, it's all alive,
birds shifting in the steady trees,
slugs and snails eating fallen flowers,
a moth freighted with fragilities.
 
nocturnal life, the other side of things,
proceeding whether we observe or not,
like rows and rows of brown coastal ants
transporting food from here to another spot.


can we learn wisdom watching insects now,
or just the art of quiet observation?
creatures from the world of leaf and flower
marking weather's variation.
 
the huge dry summer of the ladybirds
we thought we'd never feel such heat again
started with white cabbage butterflies
sipping at thin trickles in the drain.
 
then one by one the ladybirds appeared
obeying some far purpose or design.
we marvelled at their numbers in the garden,
grouped together, shuffling in a line.
 
each day a few strays turned up at the table,
the children laughed to see them near the jam
exploring round the edges of a spoon.
one tried to drink the moisture on my arm.
 
how random and how frail seemed their lives,
and yet how they persisted, refugees,
saving energy by keeping still
and hiding in the grass and in the trees.
 
and then one day they vanished overnight.
clouds gathered, storm exploded, weather cleared.
and all the wishes that we might have had
in such abundance simply disappeared.


the sun met the moon at the corner
           noon in thin air
 
commotion you later
           choose to notice
 
love shapes the heart
           that once was pieces
 
you take in hand
           the heart in mind
 
your fate's consistent
           alongside mine
 
unless a mess
           your best guess
 
that is right, thanks, the intimate
           fact that you elect it
 
at corners, dressed or naked, with lips taste         
           full body, time thick or thin, fixated
 
love, take heart
           as heart takes shape
 
and recognition
           ceases to be obscure
 
one line down the center
           another flying outward enters


the professor and ginger are standing in the space in front 
of the skipper's cabin. the professor is wearing deck shoes,
brushed denim jeans, and a white shirt open at the throat.
ginger is wearing spike heels, false eyelashes, and a white
satin kimono. the professor looks at her with veiled lust
in his eyes. he raises an articulate eyebrow and addresses
her as cio-cio-san. ginger blanches and falls on her knife.
 
  
 
meanwhile it is raining in northern california. in a tiny
village on the coast, rod taylor and tippi hedren are totally
concerned. they realize that something terrible is happening.
each has been savagely attacked by a wild songbird within
the last twenty-four hours. outside their window thousands
of birds have gathered in anticipation of the famous school-
yard scene. tippi hedren is wearing a colorful lipstick.
 
  
 
ginger stares back at the professor. his sullen good looks
are the perfect foil for her radiant smile. the skipper and
gilligan come into sight. the skipper has been chasing
gilligan around the lagoon for a long time now. gilligan
holds onto his hat in the stupid way he has of doing things
like that. the professor's lips part in a sneer of perfect
contempt. ginger bares her teeth, as if in appreciation.
 
  
 
jackie kennedy bares her teeth. behind and above her, the
muzzle of a high-powered rifle protrudes from a window. a little
man is aiming at jackie kennedy's husband. the man is wearing
bluejeans and a white t-shirt. there isn't a bird to be seen.
as he squeezes the trigger, the little man mutters between
clenched teeth, certs is a candy mint. the hands of jackie
kennedy's husband jerk automatically toward his head.
 
  
 
the professor is noticing ginger's breasts. he thinks of
the wife he left at home, who probably thinks he's dead.
he thinks of his mother, and all of the women he has ever
known. mr. and mrs. howell are asleep in their hut, secure
in their little lives as character actors. ginger shifts her
weight to the other foot. the intensity of the moment reminds
the professor of a japanese city before the end of the war.
 
  
 
in his mind he goes down each aisle in his government class,
focusing on each face, each body. he is lying on his bed
with his white shirt off and his trousers open. dorothy
kirsten's voice fills the room. he settles on a boy who sits
two desks behind him. he begins to masturbate, his body moving
in time with the sad music. at moments like these he feels
farthest away. as he shoots, his lips part and he bares his teeth.
 
  
 
the professor and ginger are watching each other across the
narrow space. the skipper and gilligan have disappeared down
the beach. the howells are quietly snoring. the professor
and ginger are alone. from the woods comes the sound of
strange birds. from the water comes a thick and eerie
tropical silence. the famous conversation scene is about
to start. clouds appear in the sky, and it begins to snow.

talking to my friend emily, whose drinking
patterns and extravagance of personal
feeling are a lot like mine, i'm pretty
convinced when she explains the things we do
while drinking a cocktail to celebrate the new
account turns into a party that lasts till 
a.m. and a terrific hangover indicate
a problem of a sort i'd not considered.
i've been worried about how i metabolize
the sauce for four years, since my second bout
of hepatitis, when i kissed all the girls
at christmas dinner and turned bright yellow
christmas night, but never about whether
i could handle it. it's been more of a given,
the stage set for my life as an artistic queer,
as much of a tradition in these new york circles
as incense for catholics or german
shepherds for the blind. we re-enact
the rituals, and our faces, like smoky icons
in a certain light, seem to learn nothing
but understand all. it comforts me
yet isn't all that pleasant, like drinking
ripple to remember high school. a friend
of mine has been drinking in the same bar for decades,
talking to the same types, but progressively
fewer blonds. joe lesueur says he's glad
to have been a young man in the fifties with his
tab hunter good looks, because that was the image
men desired now it's the puerto rican
angel with great eyes and a fierce fidelity
that springs out of machismo, rather than a moral
choice. his argument is pretty convincing, too,
except lots of the pretty blonds i've known
default by dying young, leaving the field
to the swarthy. cameron burke, the dancer
and waiter at magoo's, killed on his way home from
the pines when a car hit his bike on the sunrise highway.
henry post dead of aids, a man i thought would be around
forever, surprising me by his mortality the way
i was surprised when i heard he was not
the grandson of emily post at all, just pretending,
like the friend he wrote about in playgirl, blair meehan,
was faking when he crashed every a list party for a year
by pretending to be kay meehan's son, a masquerade
that ended when a hostess told him your mother's here
and led him by the hand to the dowager--woman, behold
thy son--underneath a darkening conviction that all,
if not wrong, was not right. by now henry may have faced
the same embarrassment at some cocktail party in the sky.
stay as outrageously nasty as you were. and patrick
mack, locked into memory as he held court in the anvil
by the downstairs pinball machine, and writhing
as he danced in lita hornick's parlor when the stimulators
played her party, dead last week of causes i don't know,
as if the cause and not the effect were the problem.
my blond friend chuck shaw refers to the bone-
crusher in the sky, and i'm starting to
imagine a road to his castle lit by radiant
heads of blonds on poles as streetlamps for the gods,
flickering on at twilight as i used to do
in the years when i crashed more parties and acted
more outrageously and met more beauties and made
more enemies than ever before or ever again, i pray.
it's spring and there's another crop of kids
with haircuts from my childhood and inflated self-esteem
from my arrival in new york, who plug into the history
of prettiness, convincing to themselves and the devout.
we who are about to catch the eye of someone
new salute as the cotillion passes, led by blonds
and followed by the rest of us, a formal march
to the dark edge of the ballroom where we step out
onto the terrace and the buds of the forsythia
that hides the trash sprout magically
at our approach. i toast it
as memorial to dreams as fragile and persistent
as a blond in love. my clothes smell like the smoky
bar, but the sweetness of the april air's
delicious when i step outside and fill
my lungs, leaning my head back
in a first-class seat on the shuttle
between the rowdy celebration of the great deeds
to come and an enormous irish wake in which
the corpses change but the party goes on forever.


which are the magic
moments in ordinary
time? all of them,
for those who can see.
that is what redemption
means, i decide
at the meeting. then
walk with david wearing
his new yale t-shirt
and new long hair to .
leonard and eileen come, too.
leonard wears a shark's tooth
on a chain around his neck
and long blond hair.
these days he's the manager
of boots and saddles bras
and girdles, my beloved
bobby used to say and
costumer for the gay cable
network's dating game.
one week the announcer is
a rhinestone cowboy, sequin
shirt and black fur chaps,
the next a leatherman, etc.
eileen's crewcut makes
her face light up.
underneath our hairstyles,
 years of sobriety, all told--
the age of a girl who's not
so young but not so very old,
wrote berryman, who flew
from his recovery with the force
of a poet hitting bottom.
it's not the way i choose
to go out of this restaurant
or day today, and i
have a choice. wanda
the comedian comes over
to our table. call me
wicked wanda, she smirks
when we're introduced.
why is new york city
awash in stand-up comics
at the least funny point
in its history? still,
some things stay the same.
people wonder what the people
in their buildings would think
if the ones who were wondering
became incredibly famous,
as famous as madonna.
debby harry lived in eileen's
building in the village
in the early seventies, and she
was just the shy girl
in the band upstairs.
poets read the writing
of their friends, and
are happy when they like it
thoroughly, when the work's
that good and the crippling
sense of competition stays away.
trips get planned david
home to california, eileen
to new mexico, chris and i
to france and spain, on vectors
which will spread out
from a single point, like ribs
of an umbrella. then
after the comfort of a wedge
of blueberry peach pie and cup
of decaf, sober friends
thread separate ways home
through the maze of blankets
on the sidewalk covered with
the scraps of someone else's life.
mine consists of understanding
that the magic isn't something
that i make, but something
that shines through the things
i make and do and say
the way a brooch or scrap of fabric
shines from the detritus
to catch leonard's eye
and be of use for costumes,
when i am fearless and thorough
enough to give it room,
all the room there is in ordinary
time, which embraces all
the people and events and hopes
that choke the street tonight
and still leaves room for everyone
and everything and every
other place, the undescribed
and indescribable, more various
and cacophonous than voice
can tell or mind conceive,
and for the sky's vast depths
from which they're all
a speck of light.


i'm at a double wake
in springfield, for a childhood
friend and his father
who died years ago. i join
my aunt in the queue of mourners
and walk into a brown study,
a sepia room with books
and magazines. the father's
in a coffin he looks exhumed,
the worse for wear. but where
my friend's remains should be
there's just the empty base
of an urn. where are his ashes?
his mother hands me
a paper cup with pills
leucovorin, zovirax,
and azt.  henry
wanted you to have these,
she sneers. take all
you want, for all the good
they'll do.  dlugos.
meester dlugos.  a lamp
snaps on. raquel,
not welch, the chubby
nurse, is standing by my bed.
it's  a.m., time to flush
the heplock and hook up
the i.v. line. false dawn
is changing into day, infusing
the sky above the hudson
with a flush of light.
my roommate stirs
beyond the pinstriped curtain.
my first time here on g-,
the aids ward, the cheery
d & d building intentionality
of the decor made me feel
like jumping out a window.
i'd been lying on a gurney
in an e.r. corridor
for nineteen hours, next to
a psychotic druggie
with a voice like abbie
hoffman's. he was tied
up, or down, with strips
of cloth he'd tried to slug
a nurse and sent up
a grating adenoidal whine
all night. nurse . . . nurse . . .
untie me, please . . . these
rags have strange powers.
by the time they found
a bed for me, i was in
no mood to appreciate the clever
curtains in my room,
the same fabric exactly
as the drapes and sheets
of a p-town guest house
in which i once--partied? stayed?
all i can remember is
the pattern. nor did it
help to have the biggest queen
on the nursing staff
clap his hands delightedly
and welcome me to aids-land.
i wanted to drop
dead immediately. that
was the low point. today
these people are my friends,
in the process of restoring
me to life a second time.
i can walk and talk
and breathe simultaneously
now. i draw a breath
and sing happy birthday
to my roommate joe.
he's  today. i didn't think
he'd make it. three weeks
ago they told him that he had
aplastic anemia, and nothing
could be done. joe had been
a rotten patient, moaning
operatically, throwing chairs
at nurses. when he got
the bad news, there was
a big change. he called
the relatives with whom
he had been disaffected,
was anointed and communicated
for the first time since the age
of eight when he was raped
by a priest, and made a will.
as death drew nearer, joe
grew nicer, almost serene.
then the anemia
began to disappear, not
because of medicines, but
on its own. ready to die,
it looks like joe has more
of life to go. he'll go
home soon. when will you
get out of here? he asks me.
i don't know when the x-ray
shows no more pneumonia.
i've been here three weeks
this time. what have i
accomplished? read some
balzac, spent quality
time with friends, come back
from death's door, and
prayed, prayed a lot.
barry bragg, a former
lover of a former
lover and a new
episcopalian, has aids too,
and gave me a leatherbound
and gold-trimmed copy of the office,
the one with all the antiphons.
my list of daily intercessions
is as long as a russian
novel. i pray about aids
last. last week i made a list
of all my friends who've died
or who are living and infected.
every day since, i've remembered
someone i forgot to list.
this morning it was chasen
gaver, the performance poet
from dc. i don't know
if he's still around. i liked
him and could never stand
his poetry, which made it
difficult to be a friend,
although i wanted to defend
him one excruciating night
at a folio reading, where
chasen snapped his fingers
and danced around spouting
frothy nonsense about andy
warhol to the rolling eyes
of self-important language-
centered poets, whose dismissive
attitude and ugly manners
were worse by far than anything
that chasen ever wrote.
charles was his real name
a classmate at antioch
dubbed him chasen, after
the restaurant, i guess.
once i start remembering,
so much comes back.
there are forty-nine names
on my list of the dead,
thirty-two names of the sick.
cookie mueller changed
lists saturday. they all
will, i guess, the living,
i mean, unless i go
before them, in which case
i may be on somebody's
list myself. it's hard
to imagine so many people
i love dying, but no harder
than to comprehend so many
already gone. my beloved
bobby, maniac and boyfriend.
barry reminded me that he
had sex with bobby
on the coat pile at this christmas
party, two years in a row.
that's the way our life
together used to be, a lot
of great adventures. who'll
remember bobby's stories
about driving in his debutante
date's father's white mercedes
from hole to hole of the golf course
at the poshest country club
in birmingham at  a.m.,
or taking off his clothes
in the redneck bar on a dare,
or working on stay hungry
as the dresser of a then-
unknown named schwarzenegger.
who will be around to anthologize
his purple cracker similes
sweatin' like a nigger
on election day, hotter
than a half-fucked fox
in a forest fire. the ones
that i remember have to do
with heat, bobby shirtless,
sweating on the dance floor
of the tiny bar in what is now
a shelter for the indigent
with aids on the dockstrip,
stripping shirts off chuck shaw,
barry bragg and me, rolling
up the tom rags, using them
as pom-poms, then bolting
off down west street, gracefully
despite the overwhelming
weight of his inebriation
vaulting over trash cans
as he sang, i like to be
in america in a puerto rican
accent. when i pass,
who'll remember, who will care
about these joys and wonders?
i'm haunted by that more
than by the faces
of the dead and dying.
a speaker crackles near
my bed and nurses
streak down the corridor.
the black guy on the respirator
next door bought the farm,
maria tells me later, but
only when i ask. she has tears
in her eyes. she'd known him
since his first day on g-
a long time ago. will i also
become a fond, fondly regarded
regular, back for stays
the way retired retiring
widowers return to the hotel
in nova scotia or provence
where they vacationed with
their wives? i expect so, although
that's down the road today's
enough to fill my plate. a bell
rings, like the gong that marks
the start of a fight. it's 
and derek's here to make
the bed, derek who at 
saw bob marley's funeral
in the football stadium
in kingston, hot tears
pouring down his face.
he sings as he folds
linens, you can fool
some of the people some
of the time, dancing
a little softshoe as he works.
there's a reason he came in
just now divorce court
drones on joe's tv, and
derek is hooked. i can't
believe the script is plausible
to him, jamaican hipster
that he is, but he stands
transfixed by the parade
of faithless wives and screwed-up
husbands. the judge is testy
so am i, unwilling
auditor of drivel. phone
my friends to block it out
david, jane and eileen. i missed
the bash for david's magazine
on monday and eileen's reading
last night. jane says that
marie-christine flew off
to marseilles where her mother
has cancer of the brain,
reminding me that aids
is just a tiny fragment
of life's pain. eileen has
been thinking about bobby, too,
the dinner that we threw
when he returned to new york
after getting sick. pencil-thin,
disfigured by ks, he held forth
with as much kinetic charm
as ever. what we have
to cherish is not only
what we can recall of how
things were before the plague,
but how we each responded
once it started. people
have been great to me.
an avalanche of love
has come my way
since i got sick, and not
just moral support.
jaime's on the board
of pen's new fund
for aids he's helping out.
don windham slipped a check
inside a note, and brad
gooch got me something
from the howard brookner fund.
who'd have thought when we
dressed up in ladies'
clothes for a night for a hoot
in brad june buntt and
howard lili la lean's suite
at the chelsea that things
would have turned out this way
howard is dead at , chris cox
kay sera sera's friend bill
gone too, bernadette of lourdes
guess who with aids,
god knows how many positive.
those th street wigs and enormous
stingers and martinis don't
provoke nostalgia for a time
when love and death were less
inextricably linked, but
for the stories we would tell
the morning after, best
when they involved our friends,
second-best, our heroes.
j.j. mitchell was master
of the genre. when he learned
he had aids, i told him
he should write them down.
his mind went first. i'll tell you
one of his best. j.j. was
jerome robbins' houseguest
at bridgehampton. every morning
they would have a contest
to see who could finish
the times crossword first.
robbins always won, until
a day when he was clearly
baffled. grumbling, scratching
over letters, he finally
threw his pen down. j.j.,
tell me what i'm doing wrong.
one clue was great th-c.
choreographer. the solution
was massine, but robbins
had placed his own name
in the space. every word
around it had been changed
to try to make the puzzle
work, except that answer.
at this point there'd be
a horsey laugh from j.j.
--isn't that great?
he'd say through clenched
teeth locust valley lockjaw.
it was, and there were lots
more where that one came from,
only you can't get there anymore.
he's dropped into the maw
waiting for the g-
denizens and for all flesh,
as silent as the hearts
that beat upon the beds
up here the heart of the drop-
dead beautiful east village
kid who came in yesterday,
charles frost's heart nine inches
from the spleen they're taking
out tomorrow, the heart of
the demented girl whose screams
roll down the hallways
late at night, hearts that long
for lovers, for reprieve,
for old lives, for another chance.
my heart, so calm most days,
sinks like a brick
to think of all that heartache.
i've been staying sane with
program tools, turning everything
over to god as i understand
him.  i don't understand him.
thank god i read so much
calvin last spring the absolute
necessity of blind obedience
to a sometimes comforting,
sometimes repellent, always
incomprehensible source
of light and life stayed
with me. god can seem
so foreign, a parent
from another country,
like my dad and his own
father speaking polish
in the kitchen. i wouldn't
trust a father or a god
too much like me, though.
that is why i pack up all
my cares and woes, and load them
on the conveyor belt, the speed
of which i can't control, like
chaplin on the assembly line
in modern times or lucy on tv.
i don't need to run
machines today. i'm standing
on a moving sidewalk
headed for the dark
or light, whatever's there.
duncan hannah visits, and
we talk of out-of-body
experiences. his was
amazing. bingeing on vodka
in his dorm at bard, he woke
to see a naked boy
in fetal posture on the floor.
was it a corpse, a classmate,
a pickup from the blackout
of the previous night? duncan
didn't know. he struggled
out of bed, walked over
to the youth, and touched
his shoulder. the boy turned
it was duncan himself.
my own experience was
milder, don't make me flee
screaming from the room
as duncan did. it happened
on a tibetan meditation
weekend at the cowley fathers'
house in cambridge.
michael koonsman led it,
healer whose enormous paws
directed energy. he touched
my spine to straighten up
my posture, and i gasped
at the rush. we were chanting
to tara, goddess of compassion
and peace, in the basement chapel
late at night. i felt myself
drawn upward, not levitating
physically, but still somehow
above my body. a sense
of bliss surrounded me.
it lasted ten or fifteen
minutes. when i came down,
my forehead hurt. the spot
where the third eye appears
in buddhist art felt
as though someone had pushed
a pencil through it.
the soreness lasted for a week.
michael wasn't surprised.
he did a lot of work
with people with aids
in the epidemic's early days
but when he started losing
weight and having trouble
with a cough, he was filled
with denial. by the time
he checked into st. luke's,
he was in dreadful shape.
the respirator down his throat
squelched the contagious
enthusiasm of his voice,
but he could still spell out
what he wanted to say
on a plastic ouija board
beside his bed. when
the doctor who came in
to tell him the results
of his bronchoscopy said,
father, i'm afraid i have
bad news, michael grabbed
the board and spelled,
the truth is always
good news. after he died,
i had a dream in which
i was a student in a class
that he was posthumously
teaching. with mock annoyance
he exclaimed, oh, tim
i can't believe you really think
that aids is a disease
there's evidence in that
direction, i'll tell him
if the dream recurs the shiny
hamburger-in-lucite look
of the big lesion on my face
the smaller ones i daub
with makeup the loss
of forty pounds in a year
the fatigue that comes on
at the least convenient times.
the symptoms float like algae
on the surface of the grace
that buoys me up today.
arthur comes in with
the sacrament, and we have
to leave the room joe's
italian family has arrived
for birthday cheer to find
some quiet. walk out
to the breezeway, where
it might as well be
august for the stifling
heat. on amsterdam,
pedestrians and drivers are
oblivious to our small aerie,
as we peer through the grille
like cloistered nuns. since
leaving g- the first time,
i always slow my car down
on this block, and stare up
at this window, to the unit
where my life was saved.
it's strange how quickly
hospitals feel foreign
when you leave, and how normal
their conventions seem as soon
as you check in. from below,
it's like checking out the windows
of the west street jail hard
to imagine what goes on there,
even if you know firsthand.
the sun is going down as i
receive communion. i wish
the rite's familiar magic
didn't dull my gratitude
for this enormous gift.
i wish i had a closer personal
relationship with christ,
which i know sounds corny
and alarming. janet campbell
gave me a remarkable ikon
the last time i was here
christ is in a chair, a throne,
and st. john the divine,
an androgyne who looks a bit
like janet, rests his head
upon the savior's shoulder.
james madden, priest of cowley,
dead of cancer earlier
this year at , gave her
the image, telling her not to
be afraid to imitate st. john.
there may come a time when
i'm unable to respond with words,
or works, or gratitude to aids
a time when my attitude
caves in, when i'm as weak
as the men who lie across
the dayroom couches hour
after hour, watching sitcoms,
drawing blanks. maybe
my head will be shaved
and scarred from surgery
maybe i'll be pencil-
thin and paler than
a ghost, pale as the vesper
light outside my window now.
it would be good to know
that i could close my eyes
and lean my head back
on his shoulder then,
as natural and trusting
as i'd be with a cherished
love. at this moment,
chris walks in, christopher
earl wiss of kansas city
and new york, my lover,
my last lover, my first
healthy and enduring relationship
in sobriety, the man
with whom i choose
to share what i have
left of life and time.
this is the hardest
and happiest moment
of the day. g-
is no place to affirm
a relationship. two hours
in a chair beside my bed
after eight hours of work
night after night for weeks
 it's been a long haul,
and chris gets tired.
last week he exploded,
i hate this, i hate your
being sick and having aids
and lying in a hospital
where i can only see you
with a visitor's pass. i hate
that this is going to
get worse. i hate it,
too. we kiss, embrace,
and chris climbs into bed
beside me, to air-mattress
squeaks. hold on. we hold on
to each other, to a hope
of how we'll be when i get out.
let him hold on, please
don't let him lose his
willingness to stick with me,
to make love and to make
love work, to extend
the happiness we've shared.
please don't let aids
make me a monster
or a burden is my prayer.
too soon, chris has to leave.
i walk him to the elevator
bank, then totter back
so raquel can open my i.v.
again. it's not even
mid-evening, but i'm nodding
off. my life's so full, even
especially? when i'm here
on g-. when it's time
to move on to the next step,
that will be a great adventure,
too. helena hughes, tibetan
buddhist, tells me that
there are three stages in death.
the first is white, like passing
through a thick but porous wall.
the second stage is red
the third is black and then
you're finished, ready
for the next event. i'm glad
she has a road map, but i don't
feel the need for one myself.
i've trust enough in all
that's happened in my life,
the unexpected love
and gentleness that rushes in
to fill the arid spaces
in my heart, the way the city
glow fills up the sky
above the river, making it
seem less than night. when
joe o'hare flew in last week,
he asked what were the best
times of my new york years
i said today, and meant it.
i hope that death will lift me
by the hair like an angel
in a hebrew myth, snatch me with
the strength of sleep's embrace,
and gently set me down
where i'm supposed to be,
in just the right place.


the city and the continent
trail off into cold black
water the same way at
the western edge, a flat
stretch with precipitous
planes set perpendicular
and back from the beach
or beach-equivalent, a blacktop
margin where the drugged
and dying trudge, queue up
for hades. bolinas
had its junkie lady with gray
skin, gray sweater, stumbling
through the sand with the short-
burst intensity and long-run aimlessness
of crackhead hustlers on the west street piers.
dreams of bolinas haunted me for years
before i saw it. i'd huddle
at the foot of the cliff in a cold
wind late at night, wrapped
in indian blankets, waiting
with strangers as the tidal wave
or temblor hit. tonight i walk
with old friends in a new dream
past a vest-pocket park of great
formality and charm in the far
west village. my disaffected
former confidant has grown
a pony tail and cruises up
the street on a hog, a chopper,
which seems a perfect locomotive choice.
i walk out to the quay where gondola
after enormous gondola departs
for the other side, not new jersey
anymore, anymore than something
prosaic as another mass of land
past the bright horizon
could function as a mirror
of the chopped-away bolinas hill.
o western edge, where points
of interest on maps of individual
hearts and bodies disappear
in waters of a depth unfathomable
even in a dream, i had thought
that sleep was meant to blunt
your sharpness, not to hone
and polish with the lapping
of the hungry waves of lethe.


the bergman image of a game
of chess with death,
though not in a dreamscape
black-and-white as melancholy
films clanking with symbols,
but in a garden in provence
with goldfish in the fountain
and enormous palms whose topmost
fronds cut into the eternal
blue of sky above the roman
ruins and the dusty streets
where any door may lead to life's
most perfect meal that is what
i think of when i remember
i have aids. but when
i think of how aids kills
my friends, especially
the ones whose paths
through life have least
prepared them to resist
the monster, i think of
an insatiable and prowling beast
with razor teeth and a persistent
stink that sticks to every
living branch of flower
its rank fur brushes
as it stalks its prey.
i think of that disgusting
animal eating my beautiful friends,
innocent as baby deer. dwight
so delicate and vain, his spindly
arms and legs pinned down with needles,
pain of tubes and needles, his narrow
chest inflated by machine, his mind
lost in the seven-minute gap
between the respirator's failure
and the time the nurses noticed
something wrong. i wrapped
my limbs around that fragile body
for the first time seven years
ago, in a cheap hotel by the piers,
where every bit of his extravagant
wardrobe--snakeskin boots, skin-tight
pedal pushers in a leopard print,
aviator's scarves, and an electric-
green capacious leather jacket--
lay wrapped in a corner of
his room in a yellow parachute.
it's hard enough to find a parachute
in new york city, i remember thinking,
but finding one the right shade
of canary is the accomplishment
of the sort of citizen with whom
i wish to populate my life.
dwight the dancer, dwight the fashion
illustrator and the fashion plate,
dwight the child, the borderline
transvestite, dwight the frightened,
infuriating me because an anti-azt
diatribe by some eccentric
in a rag convinced him not to take
the pills with which he might
still be alive, dwight
on the runway, dwight on the phone
suggesting we could still have sex
if we wore raincoats, dwight
screwing a girl from massapequa
in the ladies' room at danceteria
he wore more makeup and had better
jewelry than she did, dwight planning
the trip to london or berlin where he
would be discovered and his life
transformed. dwight erased,
evicted from his own young body.
dwight dead. at bellevue, i wrapped
my arms around his second skin
of gauze and scars and tubing,
brushed my hand against
his plats, and said goodbye.
i hope i'm not the one
who loosed the devouring animal
that massacred you, gentle boy.
you didn't have a clue
to how you might stave off
the beast. i feel so confident
most days that i can stay
alive, survive and thrive
with aids. but when i see
dwight smile and hear his fey
delighted voice inside my head,
i know aids is no chess game
but a hunt, and there is no
way of escaping the bloody
horror of the kill, no way
to bail out, no bright
parachute beside my bed.


you knew who i was
when i walked in the door.
you thought that i was dead.
well, i am dead. a man
can walk and talk and even
breathe and still be dead.
edmond o'brien is perspiring
and chewing up the scenery
in my favorite film noir,
d.o.a. i can't stop watching,
can't stop relating. when i walked down
columbus to endicott last night
to pick up tor's new novel,
i felt the eyes of every
puerto rican teen, crackhead,
yuppie couple focus on my cane
and makeup. you're dead,
they seemed to say in chorus.
somewhere in a dark bar
years ago, i picked up luminous
poisoning. my eyes glowed
as i sipped my drink. after that,
there was no cure, no turning back.
i had to find out what was gnawing
at my gut. the hardest part's
not even the physical effects
stumbling like a drunk edmond
o'brien was one of hollywood's
most active lushes through
forties sets, alternating sweats
and fevers, reptilian spots
on face and scalp. it's having
to say goodbye like the scene
where soundtrack violins go crazy
as o'brien gives his last embrace
to his girlfriend-cum-girl
friday, paula, played by pamela
britton. they're filmdom's least
likely lovers--the squat and jowly
alkie and the homely fundamentally
talentless actress who would hit
the height of her fame as the pillhead-
acting landlady on my favorite martian
fifteen years in the future. i don't have
fifteen years, and neither does edmond
o'brien. he has just enough time to tell
paula how much he loves her, then
to drive off in a convertible
for the showdown with his killer.
i'd like to have a showdown too, if i
could figure out which pistol-packing
brilliantined and ruthless villain
in a hound's-tooth overcoat took
my life. lust, addiction, being
in the wrong place at the wrong
time? that's not the whole
story. absolute fidelity
to the truth of what i felt, open
to the moment, and in every case
a kind of love all of the above
brought me to this tottering
self-conscious state--pneumonia,
emaciation, grisly cancer,
no future, heart of gold,
passionate engagement with a great
b film, a glorious summer
afternoon in which to pick up
the ripest plum tomatoes of the year
and prosciutto for the feast i'll cook
tonight for the man i love,
phone calls from my friends
and a walk to the park, ignoring
stares, to clear my head. a day
like any, like no other. not so bad
for the dead.


it's possible i misconstrued you,
  
 laid too much emphasis on the uniqueness of a birth, 
 failed to acknowledge circumstance could corrupt, sustain
 i indulged myself in accusations against an absolute.
  
 i don't believe what i then believed. you are not responsible
  
 for leibniz or the lisbon quake, for the twenty-six-eyed
 and sixty-arsed box jellyfish, that the cosmos
 is shaped like a soccer ball or for the dosido
 of right and wrong around the garden bed.
  
 you are not the monster i thought you were,
  
 not by definition or necessity the one immutable.
 you are a creator caught in a creator's net, in fact
 a creature. every horror has its own pathology, 
  
 the disease infects the flock. prey present as predators,  
 the malefactors replicate even as the angels 
 experiment with cures. each encounter pulls against reductive story,
 says i will not, i am just an instant, an instance,
  
 and reference skews on maps not drawn to scale.
  
 i know saintliness exists. it's all around me.
 my next door neighbours in their simple modesty,
 the lady down the street who is always
 helping someone older than herself. even the slow
 judicial process conceives it natural to be better 
 than we are. i'm trying to shoo the gloomy birds away 
  
 but crows repeat about me on the lawn and the vulture
 and the kite, the cuckoo and the owl should i have given up the ghost 
 when i was drawn from the womb?


i can't get my head around it. how did we devise
  
 a concept like just war the slain of the lord
 are dung upon the ground. i know there are distinctions
 it is important to make and i don't expect perfection
 but the chicanery of subtle thought . . . if i pick it all apart
 will anything be left to sew back into sense?
  
 cleverer minds are reconciled. cultured, poised,
 the government official should i give him spectacles?
 should they reflect the light? pauses and replies
 the president regrets . . . but consider the alternative 
  
 would you offer succour and i can almost understand.
  
 i sleep with reason as my lover, wake beside a monster
 in my bed. i fumble beneath the mask, shape my lips
 to the prospect of a kill, feel your thigh
 against my rump, your fingers at my throat.
  
 oh, rakosi, i'm still strumming on my lyre. is there really
 so much wrong with that? i'm embarrassed
  
 by the flimsiness of my resolve, the silliness of saints and monsters,
 conversations with a being who can't plausibly exist,
 this mockery of flagellation this is my defective heart, 
 this my amputated foot, this the bandage from around my head.
 a monster dies in the middle of his trial, another
 denies the power of the court, two more evade arrest
 in politic's parlour game, each day annuls the last.
  
 , i say, and afghanistan, bali and iraq, 
 but i can't fix a year to each event, what is, 
 what well might be, are steam against a bathroom mirror 
 i see bits, an eye but not its double, the other ear,
  
 a chin that lacks a jawbone for support.


how do we know eve and adam were happy,
deprived, as they were, of a childhood?
 
eve never knew, unlike adam, a world
that was free of the chatter of others.'
 
how did she cope? and how could she choose,
if she'd wanted, to live by herself?
 
what did the man eat that made him hear voices,
while eve was inventing frustration?
 
where could she go for a break from the sound
of himself, in his skin suit, like tarzan,
 
assuring the bush that he'd just given birth to a woman?
did she smile at the fool, or remind him that he was
 
asleep when she turned up and found him?
where could she go to be shot of his need for a mother?
 
a pity she woke him.
life for them both was a training film shown in real time,
 
on the zen of zoo-keeping.
when the encyclopedia seller arrived, who could blame her for buying?
 
no exit pollster asked how she felt
when she left at the end of the movie.


					
					a man began to eat his order of fish, and the ghost of the fish arose and spoke. forgive me, it said, please hear me. i died in despair, which is, as you know, the worst of the deadly sins. as i slowly suffocated in the alien air, i gave up hope of salvation, and so died without the consolation of religion. in your compassion and mercy, have a mass said for me, and pray for my soul. with that, the ghost of the fish vanished, and the man, congratulating himself on possessing the carcass of such a remorseful creature, tucked in.
				

 

in the real world
lovers part at morning with a kiss
and look back longingly
before they pass from sight.
 
they go insouciant to work
and smile at times
their life's vivaldi.
 
others bring what poetry they can into a life
by counting days
until employment comes again.
they look at cherries in the fruit store and imagine
biting in. they look so good.
 
children break from singing in the drill hall,
burst outside to toss their frisbees in the park.
a boy plays satie on the piano
two americans embrace
as traffic whispers up the drive.
they are embarking for the real world's farthest shore.
 
in the real world
someone signs petitions
every moment, tidies other people's trash
and greets another who is loved by someone else.
this is how the real world copes with being economics,
mathematics and ecology and botany
and waiting for the bus.
 
costumed people earn their living slipping
from the real world to persuade us to buy moon-cakes,
supple skin and perfect hair.
we smile to see them aping us.
 
gymnorhina tibicen swoops low and boasts her turf
the children run and shout out, magpie'
while the bird recalls the day in mimic song
order then restored, she dines alfresco on their scraps.
 
and while we watch magritte's sky turn el greco,
roofs de chirico beneath the plastic clouds,
a plane is pasted on a sudden patch of blue.


un seul verre d'eau claire le monde cocteau
behind the wedding couple, a mirror harbours
their reception.
outside, from the verandah, the harbour mirrors
the exception
of city from sky, hills snug with houses
and a glass of water standing on the railing,
half empty or half full. in the failing
afternoon light
brightening buildings counterpoint the darkness,
glinting upside-
down inside the glass, and the newly-weds,
seen from outside
joining hand to hand for the wedding reel,
 glide under its meniscus, head over heels.


for ben fenton-smith
none are more familiar with dew
         than professional footballers. from early
grades they are used to running through
         practice drills and hurling their burly
frames through rucks while the moist chaff
         of wet grass under the winter lights
softens their fall, accustoms the half-
         back to the slippery ball and writes
green cuneiform on wet sandshoes.
         and they fear it in the morning,
kicking off the dew in the twos'
         because they ignored a coach's warning.
half their lives are spent in clouds
         of condensation or the cold heat
of a winter sun where even the crowds
         seem like droplets on the concrete
rose of the stadium. in the final days
         of their season , sweat-spangled on the eve
of their triumph, the ball on a string and their plays
         honed, even the doubters believe.
and the last day is, once again,
         already an aftermath the ground's been shaved
and sucked dry by the noon sun
         and the paddock has become a paved
and bristled hell for those who will
         collide with it and pinion flesh on
earth, earth on flesh and spill
         blood for the sake of the game. possession
is the law all are possessed.
         and when the crowd melts into the dry
darkness, after that great red football's
         booted between the uprights of the sky-
scrapers and gone, the sky bawls
         cheerless little drops for the victors
and decks the oval with the losers' jewels.


the jungle, from the floor to the canopy,
 clogs and entwines
 its every rung and level with rank growth.
 the python dines
 among an epiphytic gaudery
 and hungry vines.
 on the mizzled hair of the two-toed sloth
 moss has designs.
 yet all that climbing tonnage is content-free.
 the top limbs sway as though to write in air,
 but can't remember what they scribble there.
 through the savanna's heat-glaze the herds pause,
 ripple and shiver,
 or graze hypnotically, or drop their young,
 which may deliver
 their wet thin steps into the lion's jaws.
 by pool or river
 they stoop at evening side by side among
 the surface quiver
 of their reflexions as the light withdraws
 a fable set down in invisible ink
 they print their shadows on the pool they drink.
 even the perfect pictures in the shale's
 slow-motion traps,
 the filamentous feathers, which one or two
 sharp hammer taps
 release, the fish in their meticulous scales,
 the precise maps
 of leaves, did not direct this rendezvous.
 they're simply gaps
 in time, and have no part in these details.
 the weird wiwaxias, worms and arthropods
 were empty of intention as stone gods.
 once, though, a figure had the thought to crawl
 out of the day
 into a cave's dark reach, its first invoker,
 and there to splay
 his hand against the tallow-glimmered wall,
 and pause to spray
 his mouth's cargo of spittle and red ochre
 on the array
 of his five fingers, clear, indelible
 author and content of the space displayed,
 the maker's hand becoming what it made.


be precise
 authority is magic.
 when you think you've got it straight
 wax wane declination
 feel the movement under your hand
 one summer morning
 as you observe it set
 then rise that night.
 always use a well-sharpened pencil
 followed by a good eraser.
 watch the white emerge.


i think there are poems greater and stranger than any i have known.
 i would like to find them.
 they are not on the greying paper of old books
 or chanted on obscure lips.
 they are not in the language of mermaids
 or the sharp-tongued adjectives of vanishing.
 they run like torn threads along paving stones.
 they are cracked as the skull of an old man.
 they stir in the mirror
 at fifty,
 at eighty.
 my ear keeps trying to hear them
 but the seafront is cold.
 the tide moves in.
 they migrate like crows at a cricket ground.
 they knock at the door when i am out.
  
 i have done with craft.
 how can i front ghosts with cleverness,
 the slick glide of paradox and rhyme
 that transforms prejudice
 to brittle gems of seeming wisdom?
  
 though i bury all i own or hold close
 though my skin outlives the trees
 though the lines fall shattering the stone
 i cannot catch them.
 they have the lilting accent
 of a house i saw but never entered.
 they are the sounds a child hears 
 the water, the afternoon, the sky.
 i watch them now
 trickling through the open mirror.
 sometimes, but almost never
 we touch what we desire.


seven years old,
 on loan to an uncle
 and a bundle of cash went missing.
 for three days locked in a room, beaten.
 the golden orbs of pennies roasted in an oven
 removed by tongs
 glisten on a child's skin
 as she screams and screams.
 these round white scars 
 that remain even today
 without pigment
 without the shadow of colour
 with only the ash's afterglow.

 after telling that story
 you burnt your hand on the iron,
 burnt it yourself,
 your punishment for breaking silence.

 you rushed to the balcony but they pulled you back inside.
 you wanted to spit, to scream insults at the soldiers
 to stop them beating up the old man in the street.
 listen, she said as she held you back, your mother.
 listen, you have to learn to say nothing.
 learn to be nobody.
 learn to be the white wall
 that has no face and no tongue.

god made everything out of nothing but the nothing shows through --paul valry
lost from all angles but the sun's,
this woken morning,
it clicks its brilliance into place at once,
if you follow the fall of light--
a spider web, head-high, adorning
the woodshed's entrance like a sheet
of gold-shot fabric, metal-tight,
that, even so, one handswipe could delete,
collapsing all
that spacious architecture to a tacky ball.
 
it brings to mind the mathematician's
monstrous idea,
the menger sponge, where infinite excisions
out of a solid cube delete
its substance while its form stays clear
the central ninth is cut from a square
eight smaller squares remain repeat
for each and so on with this lattice of air
a formula
for zero volume, infinite surface area.
 
enough. the estuary's slung
like gold-shot cloth
over a gulf of shifting airs. among
cloud-drifts of beaten eggwhite floats,
as though confected of such froth,
the mountain. like a chinese screen,
the fabric of the view devotes
almost all blankness to this hanging scene,
this one handsweep
of water, creased like the cheek of someone roused from sleep.


i seem to wake

                        and sleep ambiguously,
 to see and misconceive,
                         to feel on the brink of something
                                                 that doesn't end, beauty
                                                 that is more than beautiful,
                                                 meaning that is more.
  
  
 the present is all around me, dreams,
                         a panoply of crimes, smudges of erasure,
                         memory made of clouds, camels,
                                                 weasels and the unlikelihood
                         of somewhere within and beyond this world.
  
  
 here's light,
                         angular, ubiquitous
                                                 with the milky pigments of belief.
 here's plodding time, breathing hard.
                                                 birds fly up, perch on branches,
                         peck seed from the grass, tug worms from the soil.
i am not what i imagined, 
                                                 here i am the illusionist
                                                 and dupe of my illusions,
                         making the angels disappear, wishing them back again.
  
  
 stories that shifted in the telling
                                                 once were true
                                                 a virgin birth, a resurrection,
a tiger who regained his human form, a crocodile
                         who didn't. i'm pitching words against the sea,
                                                 it drags them out,
                                                 flings them back again
                         still freighted with my weight. the waves are red with blood,
  
  
 brown with shit, yellow with the sickly light, anything
                                                 but blue and green.
                         i am an insistent fizz and drone,
                                                 deft, adroit, as elastic
                                                 as necessity and chance,
  
 
one more clay figurine with beseeching hollows
                                                 where the eyes should be,
                                                 as different from the others
 as i am the same, no more evolved
                                                 than a roach,
                                                 no better than a rat,
                                                 happy as a labrador in the sun.
                         this is grace, the rest is commentary
                         and i would let it go in millennia
  
  
 i'll chatter metaphysics with a chimpanzee, now
                         my thoughts are the antlers of the irish elk,
                                                 the wings of flightless birds, peptides
                                                 spelling out the phrase
                                                 very like a whale. most organisms
  
  
 produce more offspring than can possibly survive.
                         nothing can follow that.
                         something will. blunt heads of rain,
                                                 faithless wind,
                                                 the stricken sun at dusk,
  
  
 knock-kneed girls somersaulting on the beach,
                                                 the commonplace surprise
                                                 of making love face to face,
the heart breaking apart, an instrumental eye
                                                 and instrumental mind rejoicing,
                                                                         a last cacophony of birds.


suppose i were to eat you
i should probably begin
with the fingers, the cheeks and the breasts
yet all of you would tempt me,
so powerfully spicy
as to discompose my choice.
 
while i gobbled you up
delicacy by tidbit
i should lay the little bones
ever so gently round my plate
and caress the bigger bones
like ivory talismans.
 
when i had quite devoured the edible you
your tongue informing my voice-box
i would wake in the groin of night
to feel, ever so slowly,
your plangent, ravishing ghost
munching my fingers and toes.
 
here, with an awkward, delicate gesture
someone slides out his heart
and offers it on a spoon,
garnished with adjectives.


i like to lie with you wordless
 on black cloud rooft beach
 in late june  o'clock tempest
 on clump weed bed with sand
 fitting your contours like tailor made
  
 and i like to wash my summer brown face
 in north cold hudson rapids
 with octagon soap
   knees niched in steamy rocks
   where last night's frog stared
   at our buddhist sleep
  
 but most of all i like to see
 the morning happen . . .
  
 i like to go down vertical mountains
 where lanny goshkitch
 meditated
   crashing poplars
   sap sticky arms flailing
   as thermosed green tea
   anoints sneakers
   and blood soakt brow i taste and love
   myself a split second
  
 and i like to feel my own full scrotum
 as i horizon the whole crisp linen earth
 in my beatitude waiting miguel-like
 in maskt fantasy for christ-like
 you--
 whoever you are
  
 but most of all i like to see
 the morning happen . . .
  
 i like to look at books howl
 haikus of the seasons
 of the mind
 that i might know the knowing
 and the simplest to think of all of us
 taking turns at catching each other
 in the rye
  
 and i like to taste cold absinthe
 on hot hung sunday mornings
 discussing orgies symposiums
 and sounds with hoary headed poets
 in upstairs jazz club
 in japan
  
 but most of all i like to see
 the morning happen when k and ike still sleep
 and only the denver night riders hum contrasts
 to orient jazzy feather beasts
 in the dewy garden of real earth
 where i can sink my naked feet
 cool


immersed
 we don't
 ask
 who entered
 whose stream.
  
 take
 my hand there
 is no
 line no
 bridge only
 fond
 foolishness--
  
 the bread
 crumbs i
 bring you
 in
 morning--
  
 they float
 on the
 surface
 water with
 two
 violins
  
 un-
 strung like
 the silent
 song
 on your
 lips soft
  
 as the
 same
 hands i
 crushed to
 keep
 you from
 death.



i  
hung up on body parts in the particulate daylight, you step out of a beckett play to find yourself in a memory resisting itself, as meat hits the fan so to speak against the white blanket of the grainy void. you never know where it's going, the body, the boy swathed in bullets with those black eyes pissing a letter-opener in the desert mud near a disabled mercedes. when things enter the room you think bazooka and check your hat. a puddle of warm ice-cream in anticipation. here's where coney island drops like a discarded napkin and you can't go home again. mucous brimming the banks, a cake of dust in the shape of a rocking chair ticking away. but soon it will snow as exquisite dogs languish from inside a sandwich tied to a parachute. no time for ballads, the table is set.  
ii  
light solidifies in cells, the keeper of lost keys. they don't belong to anyone, the keys. playing the game backwards reveals nothing a blind child could not guess by the hairs on his arm. the lips on old men are lockboxes in the terminal of no-knowing without gratitude for the despair of angels. you have to suffer, you have to fill up in order to implode, to be recognized for the necessities of commerce. they unhinge, finally, the doors you walk through into phantom stairwells in telephonic hum smelling of wet coal and doll's hair. precipitous adjectives gush from a cracked faucet in the chancellery restroom. someone is stifling laughter from underneath a card table where an electric utility had fallen from his sleeve. they say that trussed birds derive no pleasure from the music of mangled wagons and that gas seeps like a well-kept secret imperiling dust mites in the spleens of hooded maidens locked away from the light. everything is descending, even the scholarship of the ancient adverbs. mouths twist into almonds and you wonder how the noise can drown itself out with nothing but nouns and dinner plates and gallows, with history a hiccup waiting to happen.  
iii  
the music is an absence of colliding masses. you can cut your feet on the proverbial and be too close to hear it, the other music, the suffocation of things that can't fly. a beautiful cacophony flutters in the brightness of dead calm as true objects lost in the politeness of daylight fill the grail of a new primitive. you choke on little candles and all through the night your legs cramp in the sweat of the moonlight. for no good reason a tenderness of geese is billowing in the curtains, as holes in the face open and close and paper scorches sky with futile encryption. those armchairs foundering in the scum of the surf. deafness craving disaster green in the spine, knowing the cocktail party's over. now it's all red and your lips are trembling in believability, but it's only a flickering image in the dark quadrant of your eye bending the light as they mow the daisies under the stars, for no good reason.



  
 gently disintegrate me
 said nothing at all.
  
 is there still time to say
 said i myself lying
 in a bower of bramble
 into which i have fallen.
  
 look through my eyes up
 at blue with not anything
 we could have ever arranged
 slowly taking place.
  
 above the spires of the fox
 gloves and above the bracken
 tops with their young heads
 recognising the wind,
 the armies of the empty
 blue press me further
 into zennor hill.
  
 if i half-close my eyes
 the spiked light leaps in
 and i am here as near
 happy as i will get
 in the sailing afternoon.
  
  
    
  
 enter a cloud. between
 the head of zennor and 
 gurnard's head the long
 marine horizon makes 
 a blue wall or is it
 a distant table-top
 of the far-off simple sea.
  
 enter a cloud. o cloud,
 i see you entering from 
 your west gathering yourself
 together into a white
 headlong. and now you move
 and stream out of the gurnard,
 the west corner of my eye.
  
 enter a cloud. the cloud's 
 changing shape is crossing
 slowly only an inch
 above the line of the sea.
 now nearly equidistant
 between zennor and gurnard's
 head, an elongated
 white anvil is sailing
 not wanting to be a symbol.
  
  
    
  
 said nothing at all.
  
 and proceeds with no idea
 of destination along
 the sea bearing changing
 messages. jean in london,
 lifting a cup, looking
 abstractedly out through
 her hampstead glass will never
 be caught by your new shape
 above the chimneys. jean,
 jean, do you not see
 this cloud has been thought of
 and written on zennor hill. 


    

the cloud is going beyond
what i can see or make.
over up-country maybe
albert strick stops and waves
caught in the middle of teeling
broccoli for the winter.
the cloud is not there yet.

from gurnard's head to zennor
head the level line
crosses my eyes lying
on buzzing zennor hill.

the cloud is only a wisp
and gone behind the head.
it is funny i got the sea's
horizontal slightly surrealist.
now when i raise myself
out of the bracken i see
the long empty blue
between the fishing gurnard
and zennor. it was a cloud
the language at my time's
disposal made use of.


    

thank you. and for your applause.
it has been a pleasure. i
have never enjoyed speaking more.
may i also thank the real ones
who have made this possible.
first, the cloud itself. and now
gurnard's head and zennor
head. also recognise
how i have been helped
by jean and madron's albert
strick he is a real man.
and good words like brambles,
bower, spiked, fox, anvil, teeling.

the bees you heard are from
a hive owned by my friend
garfield down there below
in the house by zennor church.

the good blue sun is pressing
me into zennor hill.

gently disintegrate me
said nothing at all.


at steak n shake i learned that if you add 
bless their hearts after their names, you can say 
whatever you want about them and it's ok. 
my son, bless his heart, is an idiot, 
she said. he rents storage space for his kids' 
toys--they're only one and three years old 
i said, my father, bless his heart, has turned 
into a sentimental old fool. he gets 
weepy when he hears my daughter's greeting 
on our voice mail. before our steakburgers came 
someone else blessed her office mate's heart, 
then, as an afterthought, the jealous hearts 
of the entire anthropology department. 
we bestowed blessings on many a heart 
that day. i even blessed my ex-wife's heart. 
our waiter, bless his heart, would not be getting 
much tip, for which, no doubt, he'd bless our hearts. 
in a week it would be thanksgiving, 
and we would each sit with our respective 
families, counting our blessings and blessing 
the hearts of family members as only family 
does best. oh, bless us all, yes, bless us, please
 bless us and bless our crummy little hearts.


they travel in threes, usually in station waggons or utes,
 often have dogs, and eat out of cans in country motels, 
 always the one on the edge of town 
 near the truckstop with good hamburgers 
 i remember the isis motel in guyra
  
 they drive old cars, or horses made of wind, 
 whose manes are streamers of wind. they tend 
 to wear black. i have met them as young as fourteen  
 beck's friend kristin had written her autobiography
 already, it was called these days' but it was stuck
  
 in her computer somewhere, in the shed 
 at her mother's. her mother and the girlfriend, 
 they were also storm spirits. 
 they taught swimming
 and they were kind at first, often charming
  
 after watching the birds' mating rituals
 on the forest floor at the bottom of the steep train, 
 under the speckled trees, we decide to go north. 
 we borrow beck's sister jade's car,
 and alecto gets her licence first go.
  
 we hear the sibyl is staying at the isis motel. 
 this time there's no bush festival, no whip-plaiter, 
 the pumpkins from the scarecrow bellies 
 have all been eaten in baked dinners cooked for the 
 lamb and potato festival. that will be fifty-three dollars.
  
 the others shower and go to bed, i'm as usual awake. 
 at night across the road, five types of frogs set up 
 their orchestra, and the mother of ducks lagoon throbs 
 around the gazebo  tree frogs like the ones at home
 chaka-chaka, chaka-chaka
  
 i go out and unroll my sleeping bag on the picnic table
 suspended over the lagoon, and watch
 the sun come up over the railway line. 
 in the distance across a golf course, i see smoke
 and walking i come to a woman in black near a tent.
  
 the cumaean sibyl, i presume? i say.
 she laughs in her mantle, invites me in.
  so you've left the infernal regions too, i say
 and she laughs again, going out and poking kindling
 under the damp logs. i notice a laptop on her sleeping-bag.
  
 she's written a book about birds in new england
 which she shows me. no one reads it, she says,
 except ornithologists. she's now writing a manual 
 for editors. when she goes out to the fire 
 i look at her hand-written page
  
 parts of a publication sections and paras,
 signposts and transitions, running heads and feet.'
 any news from home? i ask.
 the singer is failing to get his wife back, she says.
 the ferry man batted him back with an oar.
  
 i prophecy he'll be torn to pieces, she says,
 and offers to cook me some kidney.
 where are your sisters? she asks.
 i say they're at the motel.
 well, they won't be getting kidney, she says.
  
 our new england holiday over, and no other prophecies
 from the sibyl, we're drive south through the moonbi hills 
 and down past the emirates' horse stud at murrurrundi
 through bull-dozed mountains the sibyl says you once went round,
 past the cones of a giant power station and the sign
  
 muswellbrook  city of power. and on to the newcastle freeway.
 back in sydney at the hostel, the girl at the front desk leans forward 
 have we heard? about beck? she's sorry, beck has been killed 
 in a car accident near bulahdelah. 
 automatically i touch my dreads and groan.


a drunk cadet had hit them on a bad bend near the river,
 two broken necks. on the notice-board there's an a page 
 with a blurred digital photo of beck laughing, leaning 
 into her friends in a nightclub and below that, writing 
 we love you beck  from kristin, colette and mandy.
  
 i sit like an automaton in the big lounge room
 my back teeth snapping against each other,
 rocks in my gut. that night we watch on an imac 
 a video of beck, an eight minute film colette 
 had taken on her phone. 
  
 two of the men are crying. kristin and mandy are numb. 
 i move to the noticeboard, reading anything
 live-in nanny required balmain  min from city'
 experience life on an outback station help mustering
 mobs of  animals on horseback or quadbike'.
  
 near me two women are whispering. talking 
 about their first-ever girlfriend. one says,
 other people are always either versions or not-versions 
 of her. fourteen, it's an age to break your heart. you know 
 nothing. on the edge of knowing too much.
  
 i lean forward, my head on the foyer koala.
 voices travel to me from distant realms
 i hear again the singer's plea for his wife.
 blurred from too much experience
 i prowl around the leaflet racks, groaning.
  
 late that night on the vinyl lounges the people remaining 
 are kristin and me, alone. my eyes are swollen, 
 my ears still buzzing from the headphones at work. 
 we talk over beck till no more can be said.
 now kristin begins to tell her own story 
  
 how her uncle had his boat down the back 
 of their block, and one day  
 he said he wanted to show her something,
 took her down the lantana path to the boat, 
 something she might like, he said 
  
 kristin was raped at times twice a day 
 or sometimes not for a week 
 and sometimes after it he gave her pocket
 money once a twenty dollar bill which down
 the gully later she tore into thin red strips and buried.
  
 back at the house her mother 
 bashed her for lying about the uncle,
 who was her brother, and who had loaned them 
 the deposit on the house where kristin and odette
 her sister were fortunate enough to live.
  
 when kristin grew up, her mother apologised to her.
 the uncle was still alive. he had sent her a 
 christmas card this year. she sat on the lounge, 
 looking down at her runners, her mouth closed.
 behind her the stereogram and elvis, a silent witness.
  
 the uncle had said she was a rude girl, she should 
 keep quiet about their secret otherwise 
 he'd give her little sister a taste of the same.
 kristin was quiet from then on. the reason she was 
 telling me now, her hand on my arm
  
 was that last week she'd had a call from odette 
 who was living in london.
 the uncle during those primary 
 school years had done the same to her, tricked her
 the same way, used the same words.
  
 i feel the weight of my empty useless arms.
 but later i hold her  hug her goodnight.
 she touches my shoulder. i was convinced, she says, 
 i was saving my sister. 
 my head clatters virgin, may i help you?
  
 back in the furies' bunk-room it's beauty night, 
 they're whisking egg whites for a face mask 
 after they've done each other they sit me on the bed 
 and paint my face with their fingers
 the egg white sets quickly and they tell me not to smile.
  
 i dream of alecto's iron tower and bloody clothes 
 then i'm on tv being interviewed so, the oldest fury 
 and who is your god? i am asked  i once served artemis, i say. 
 and before that?  athena, i say  anath, isis. 
 i do not mention dionysis or the thracian women.


i pinch myself hard on the inner arm,
 inwardly smiling yet frightened too  what if 
 i get caught in this far realm, on the underside of the world,
 in these pixelated centuries where humans are exactly
 the same, both kind and radically unkind  
  
 so anyway, i say, her husband has his ships ready
 to go to war, and he's waiting for the wind. 
 he decides to order the sacrifice of their daughter  the wind 
 comes, and they sail off to defend a trading route at troy.
 jade says, and this trading route is called helen?
  
 very good. ok, skip ten years.
 when the husband comes back, his wife unrolls a purple carpet
 and his cousin prepares a banquet. his wife says, darling,
 the slave-girls have run you a bath. he bathes. 
 his wife finds out there's someone at the front door 
  
 from troy, a woman called cassandra, holding twins 
 she bore to the husband. cassandra would like to come in. 
 maybe this piece of information was the trigger to the murder  
 at any rate, as her husband steps from the tub, she wraps a net 
 around him as if it were a bathrobe, a net she'd made herself 
  
 wait, are you hungry? jade says. come into the kitchen.
 amid the chicken bones and a potato salad
 she says, all right, go on. 
 you have a very nice mouth, i say.
 go on, she says, the net, wraps it round him.
  
 ok. so the cousin comes in and takes two swipes 
 with his sword, his two-edged sword,
 then the wife beheads the husband with her double-headed axe
 aha jade says. yes, i say. 
 then, splashed with his blood and bearing his head,
  
 she runs to the banqueting room where his followers
 are being slaughtered among the mixing-bowls. 
 she has defended herself and her daughter 
 everything else is gloss at that point. revenge, 
 though sticky-fingered, is sweet.
  
 more chicken?
 thanks. her kids, a son and daughter, were sent away 
 in case they grew up wanting to avenge their father.
 which of course they do, jade says.
 yes.
  
 the surviving girl sends messages to her brother, who's 
 in another country don't forget come home 
 when you can, and avenge our father 
 years pass. grown up now, the boy goes to apollo's shrine
 for advice, and the oracle tells him to do just that.
  
 in the end, the boy does come back from exile, and kills 
 his mother. a court case develops about the matricide,
 and this is where we come into it. see, up till now, 
 the punishment for matricide has always been death.
 lineage has been through the mother.
  
 but this play was written at a particular point in history.
 or pre-history, jade says.
 right. so the court is held at the shrine of apollo, 
 and apollo himself is counsel for the defence. 
 alecto is given the job of public prosecutor 
  
 your sister? jade says.
 yes. so the magistrate calls up some citizens, and 
 we hear the case. what were the mitigating factors?
 the son was told to do it.' his father's ghost
 and the oracle of apollo himself' told him to kill his mother.
  
 they made the rest of their case, 
 mostly spurious, one of apollo's arguments being
 that it's less bad to kill a woman than a man. 
 we made some good arguments, but
 the vote for the boy to die was fifty-fifty.

 at the deadlock, athena turned up, athena
 her garment having been kissed by many men or what, 
 we don't know, and she in her deciding vote acquitted
 him. for us to lose, in effect, a case of matricide
 meant the balance of power was shifting.
  
 i pour another vodka. what i didn't say to jade was, 
 it meant we'd be lying low for some time,
 centuries perhaps. i remember the fires of earlier camps. 
 in the distance, border furies, heat furies, storm furies. 
 the sound of the barking owl.
  
 and this owl, a real owl, sounds like a woman being murdered 
 athena, your bird is telling you something
 but athena, last we heard, was with her cousin kate kyriakou
 on their way back to greece for the olympics.
 at the last minute they got a virgin flight.
  
 it's an irony of fate, i said, that it was a foremost goddess 
 who helped tilt that power. 
 or not, jade said, maybe it was simply a pivot-point in storytelling 
 where men must be shown to be in control, and the best 
 way to do that is to get a woman to do the job.
  
 yes, i said. let's present it to athena this way she's being chosen 
 to give an award in a public ceremony and get her picture 
 in the morning paper, her big chance, as a goddess, 
 to be kind and compassionate. 
 to downplay the warlike.
  
 mesmerise her with theology  jade said,
 and perhaps flirt with her at the same time. 
 for whatever reason, i said, athena  without consenting 
 to matricide  did not give it a high level of punishment. 
 certainly she didn't exact a death. 
  
 in that sense you have to admit she is a civilising factor, i said.
 flick your dreads as you may, jade said. 
 we hounded the son, though, i said. one time we said 
 we'd leave him alone for a while if he promised to do 
 penance at the temple of artemis.


in the yellow time of pollen, in the blue time of lilacs,
in the green that would balance on the wide green world,
air filled with flux, world-in-a-belly
in the blue lilac weather, she had written a letter
you came into my life really fast and i liked it.
 
when we let go the basket of the good-luck birds
the sky erupted open in the hail of its libation
there was a gap and we entered it gladly. indeed the birds
may have broken the sky and we, soaked, squelched
in the mud of our joy, braided with wet-thighed surrender.
 
in the yellow time of pollen near the blue time of lilacs
there was a gap in things. and here we are.
the sparrows flew away so fast a camera could not catch them.
the monkey swung between our arms and said i am, hooray,
the monkey of all events, the great gibbon of convergences.
 
we were falling towards each other already
and the utter abandon to orbits was delicious.
the falcon rested on the little man's arm and falconry
was the high path of the world. whole minutes passed.
we were falling and the jungle fell with us.
 
she said i came, i came to my senses really fast
and you liked it. i was surrounded by the fluttering
of wings, nothing but a whirring in my ears,
and the whole earth tilted and i lost my reason.
for a time falconry was the high path of the world.
 
at night the sky was filled with animals.
ganesh loomed large among those points of light.
he said change and we said lord we are ready
to bend. thou art the high exalted most flexible.
he said then i will enter into your very dreams.
 
and the yellow-tailed black cockatoo, ablaze
in his own musculature, soared all night above the sunlit
fields of whisky grass that stretched inside me
to a river's edge. the great bird cawed its majesty,
a sonic boom and even i was barely welcome there.
 
there was a gap in things and all the lilacs bloomed.
words split in our grasp. we were licking the cream
from the universal ice. words foundered and cracked.
how the bonnet was warm on your bottom and the metal
continued tick-ticking though the engine was off.
 
and the evening shuddered, since everything is connected.
i was licking the cream from the universal saucer.
i was all of cheshire and points between.
you saw the great sky turn blacker, you saw the spray of stars
and your hair got tangled in the windscreen wiper.
 
at the hot ponds we stripped as night closed in.
i secretly admired your underwear, your long
elusive legs. in the spring where we lay side by side
we held hands. up above the steam the sky. i said
that one is called sirius or dog star, but only here on earth.
 
and when since the stories foretold it we parted,
those birds were all released again. such buoyancy.
they go on forever like that. how else to say thank you
in a foreign place? we are ever in the arms of our exile,
forever going one way and the other
 
though sometimes of course on a sphere that is not so bad.
i will meet you on the nape of your neck one day,
on the surface of intention, word becoming act.
we will breathe into each other the high mountain tales,
where the snows come from, where the waters begin.
 
in the yellow time of pollen when the fields were ablaze
we were very near bewildered by beauty.
the sky was a god-bee that hummed. all the air boomed
with that thunder. it was both for the prick
and the nectar we drank that we gave ourselves over.


and if every step taken is a step well-lived but a foot
towards death, every pilgrimage a circle, every flight-path
the tracing of a sphere i will give myself over and over.
i have migrated through carpathians of sorrow
to myself heaped happy in the corner there.
 
nothing seemed strange in the world, you'll understand--
nothing ever more would. monkey boy came to me saying
look--the moon of the moon. the little one circled the big one.
he crouched in the palm of my hand, tiny, sincere,
pointing at the sky. there was something sad about him.
 
the python was nothing, nothing at all, nothing
but strength shed to suppleness, nothing but will
encased in itself. the python was a muscle of thought.
coiled and mute, in a place where nothing but rain fell,
the python thought this is the beginning or end of the world.
 
the python was everywhere, everywhere at once, aware
only too much of that ageless agony its existence.
i am tired, it said and the stream burbled by.
i am waiting for the recoil, the uncoil, coil of night,
coil of stars, coil of the coldness of the water.
 
the python said who are these people?
the whole city sweated, moved like a limb. the air
fitted like a glove two sizes too small and too many
singers sang the banal. the bars roared all night.
the kite hawks grew ashamed. all nature squirmed.
 
in the yellow time of pollen there's a certain slant of light
that devours the afternoon, and you would wait forever
at the gare de l'est, if time stood still, if she would come.
she is the leopard then, its silvery speed where will you
wrestle her, and in what shadows, and on what crumpled sheets?
 
and all those sheets were pampas and savannas, the soft expanses
of all that would be absent forever, all that was
past, and future, and not here. and in a white rose
there were not to be found any secrets, since in its unfolding
there was no centre, nor in its decay. only the random petals fallen.
 
in the yellow time of poppies when the fields were ablaze
those invisible pollens rained around us.
the days held us lightlocked in golden surrender
and all night long the night shot stars.
when my chest unconstricted at last, did yours?
 
the real issue, of course, was this atomically, energetically,
everything was wave function. and a wave continues forever into space,
the wavelength never alters, only the intensity lessens, so
in the worst cosmic way everything is connected by vibrations.
and this, as even a dog would know, is no consolation.
 
ah but the dogs will save us all in the end & even the planet.
not the superdogs but the household friendlies, always
eager to please, hysterically fond, incessant, carrying in the very
wagging of their tales an unbounded love not even
therapists could imagine their forgiveness unhinges us.
 
we were reduced to this this day and night,
primary gold and indigo, the binary profusion
of distances guessed at, heat and cold, colours
logged in the retina and lodged in the spine
we were dogs who knew the infinite is now,
 
that celandine was buttercup, that buttercup was marigold.
the dog star marked the dog days and the wild rose
was dog rose. the crow's-foot was wild hyacinth.
by day the correspondences were clear.
i walked across the whin land. speedwell bluer than sky.
 
a practised ear could hear, between two breaths,
deep space wherein the mind collects itself.
words foundered and cracked. nearly
never bulled the cow. a shining isomorphousness
rang out. the roussignol sang all night.
 
all colours were shuffled endlessly but never lost.
a practised ear could hear, between two breaths,
the secret blackness of the snow
come flooding in. on summer's lawns
the ice-melt sprayed its figure-eights from sprinklers.
 
and everything stopped working, second time around,
as if it had never happened before. fans
moved the corpses of fireflies through the rooms,
supplicant, pathetic, pleading in brittle postures.
everything was magnified by their bug-eyed deaths.
 
we became solemn in that profusion
of dying. cane toads fattened the asphalt
in the mist and the rain our headlights caught them
tensed as if listening they were waiting,
mute, for the imbecility of eternity.
 
the clocks merely pulsed, or rather the days.
like shotgun spray on the weatherboard, sleep
scattered itself through the blurred heat
and secreted itself in the nooks of delirium.
sometimes the magpies would wake us, or the phone,
 
mid-afternoon. and we needed nothing, not even hope,
being no different from the dragonflies,
or the cows in their despair. it appeared we lived
on sunlight and chocolate bars. you blossomed
so from not ever reading the newspapers.
 
things came and went--the years and all the airports.
i was a shade scattering my shade seed
liberally to the winds and weathervanes.
there was not enough absence to go round.
i heard voices, stabat mater, in the whine of jets
 
and in air vents and headphones a stream
trilling over rocks. on tarmacs and in transit
i saw your lips, your nakedness, the trees,
that dappled light. i dreamt of orchards.
the preciseness of the world came flooding in.


abandoned in a field near yass a cobwebbed car once kept us warm
and when it rained, though we shivered with sickness,
there came a moment of perfect happiness, faces nestled
in the vinyl, sleep coming on, surrounded by metal
that in upcoming decades would oxidise to flakes.
 
asleep at last, last of the valium, we came to know
a car too is a flower and pollen its decay.
in the dry air at dawn the cicadas kept still. the space
that mass sat in decided how mass was to move.
we dreamed of valleys of olive trees, silver side out.
 
the lions preened. we shivered with need.
a mechanic showed me once how the spark-paths from spark-plugs
looked, if you looked close enough, like mountain ravines
from the air. the deeper the groove the faster
the current. we shivered, this our habit, this flowing.
 
it takes the breath away. there are gum trees crackling from it
two decades later. i slept so still beneath that mass of dreams
like sediment compressed beneath a lake. i woke and the
tributes and glory were gone and the crops all withered
and money was merely the index of anxiety.
 
when we realised this our hearts swelled in exultation.
even time would forget there was reason for fear that decay
seemed to will itself upon us. i was off the air, delirious
with substance. the kite hawks grew ashamed.
all nature squirmed. i was off the air, light-headed with voracity.
 
the theme just kept repeating itself, year in year out,
same demon different bodies. a nurse said when you stay,
when you leave those wet imprints in our airspace,
these sheets smell like formaldehyde, like death. we had merely
reached early, down the end of the river, the leprosarium
 
of feeling, and all things stood for every other thing,
creepers, vines, tendrils, anacondas, inert surrender,
such listlessness, and yes the very rage with which
we chased the very forms of it, the lineaments
of nothingness, the powders of the comatose, the bliss.
 
this was the state of the world. heading backwards we learned
the flea-fish was the smallest animal before the insect kingdom
began. forwards, there were only the sudden deaths
of galaxies. and yet when we practised love there seemed
on certain days an awful lot of space and so much sky.
 
never had i lain then at kangaroo valley so comfortable
in my own body. a virtual flatness and that centrifuge
in the stomach stilled and my spine a spirit-level. the smell
of coffee drifting in brought back to me that lily-white girl and that
sad hour of need. how brittle every bone was then. how
 
could one not be completely bedraggled by time or compulsion or
duplicity? i was all those things and am. i was so tired
with the not-being-here inside of it all that fatigue
was like oxygen, given of all the givens, sensurround
of the gods. but i was gulping and heaving by then.
 
and that is all so long ago. though when you forget
the last time most likely it is not the last time.
and when dreams don't come, when mastodons and minotaurs
curdle in the night-reaches and the bulls lie fallow
in dawn-sweats sleep some more. wait. sleep on. and swim.


nothing is plumb, level, or square
      the studs are bowed, the joists
 are shaky by nature, no piece fits
      any other piece without a gap
 or pinch, and bent nails
      dance all over the surfacing
 like maggots. by christ
      i am no carpenter. i built
 the roof for myself, the walls
      for myself, the floors
 for myself, and got 
      hung up in it myself. i
 danced with a purple thumb
      at this house-warming, drunk
 with my prime whiskey rage.
      oh i spat rage's nails
 into the frame-up of my work
      it held. it settled plumb,
 level, solid, square and true
      for that great moment. then
 it screamed and went on through,
      skewing as wrong the other way.
 god damned it. this is hell,
      but i planned it. i sawed it,
 i nailed it, and i
      will live in it until it kills me.
 i can nail my left palm
      to the left-hand crosspiece but
 i can't do everything myself.
      i need a hand to nail the right,
 a help, a love, a you, a wife.


for old billy dugan, shot in the ass in the civil war, my father said.
the old wound in my ass
 has opened up again, but i 
 am past the prodigies
 of youth's campaigns, and weep
 where i used to laugh
 in war's red humors, half
 in love with silly-assed pains
 and half not feeling them.
 i have to sit up with
 an indoor unsittable itch
 before i go down late
 and weeping to the storm-
 cellar on a dirty night
 and go to bed with the worms.
 so pull dirt up over me
 and make a family joke
 for old billy blue balls,
 the oldest private in the world
 with two ass-holes and no
 place more to go to for a laugh
 except the last one. say
 the north won the civil war
 without much help from me
 although i wear a proof
 of the war's obscenity.


the river brought down
 dead horses, dead men
 and military debris,
 indicative of war
 or official acts upstream,
 but it went by, it all 
 goes by, that is the thing
 about the river. then 
 a soldier on a log
 went by. he seemed drunk
 and we asked him why
 had he and this junk
 come down to us so
 from the past upstream.
 friends, he said, the great
 battle of granicus
 has just been won
 by all of the greeks except
 the lacedaemonians and
 myself this is a joke
 between me and a man
 named alexander, whom
 all of you ba bas
 will hear of as a god.


if you work a body of water and a body of woman
 you can take fish out of one and children out of the other
 for the two kinds of survival. the fishing is good,
 both kinds are adequate in pleasures and yield,
 but the hard work and the miseries are killing
 it is a good life if life is good. if not, not.
 you are out in the world and in in the world,
 having it both ways it is sportive and prevenient living
 combined, although you have to think about the weathers
 and the hard work and the miseries are what i said.
 it runs on like water, quickly, under the boat,
 then slowly like the sand dunes under the house.
 you survive by yourself by the one fish for a while
 and then by the other afterward when you run out.
 you run out a hooky life baited with good times,
 and whether the catch is caught or not is a question
 for those who go fishing for men or among them for things.


now his nose's bridge is broken, one eye
 will not focus and the other is a stray
 trainers whisper in his mouth while one ear
 listens to itself, clenched like a fist
 generally shadowboxing in a smoky room,
 his mind hides like the aching boys
 who lost a contest in the panhellenic games
 and had to take the back roads home,
 but someone else, his perfect youth,
 laureled in newsprint and dollar bills,
 triumphs forever on the great white way
 to the statistical sparta of the champs.


in order to perfect all readers
 the statements should be carved 
 on rock walls, on cave walls,
 and on the side of pillars so
 the charm of their instruction can
 affect the mountain climbers near
 the cliffs, the plainsmen near
 the pillars, and the city people near
 the caves they go to on vacations.
  
 the statements should, and in a fair
 script, spell out the right text and gloss
 of the philosopher's jocular remark. text
 honesty is the best policy. gloss
 he means not best' but policy,'
 this is the joke of it whereas in fact
           honesty is honesty, best
           is best, and policy is policy,
           the three terms being not
           related, but here loosely allied.
 what is more important is that is'
 is, but the rocklike truth of the text
 resides in the the'. the the' is the.
           by this means the amusing sage
           has raised or caused to be raised
           the triple standard in stone
 the single is too simple for life,
 the double is mere degrading hypocrisy,
 but the third combines the first two
 in a possible way, and contributes
 something unsayable of its own
 this is the pit, nut, seed, or stone
 of the fruit when the fruit has been 
 digested
           it is good to do good for the wrong
           reason, better to do good for the good
           reason, and best of all to do good
           good i.e. when the doer and doee 
           and whatever passes between them
           are beyond all words like grace'
           or anagogic insight,' or definitions like
           particular instance of a hoped-at-law,'
 and which the rocks alone can convey.
 this is the real reason for the rock walls,
 the cave walls and pillars, and not the base
 desires for permanence and display
 that the teacher's conceit suggests.
  
           that is the end of the statements, but,
           in order to go on a way after the end
           so as to make up for having begun 
           after the beginning, and thus to come around
           to it in order to include the whole thing,
 add in some places the poignant slogan,
 morality is a bad joke like everything else,'
 may be written or not, granted that space
 exists for the vulgar remarks, the dates,
 initials and hearts of lovers, and all
 other graffiti of the prisoners of this world.


ch'i shan wu chin
clearing the mind and sliding in
           to that created space,
 a web of waters steaming over rocks,
 air misty but not raining,

           or a broad slow river,
           coasting by.

 reappears in a pine grove,
  
 no farms around, just tidy cottages and shelters,
 gateways, rest stops, roofed but unwalled work space,

 at the end of the painting the scroll continues on with seals and
 poems. it tells the a further tale
  
 --wang wen-wei saw this at the mayor's house in ho-tung
 town, year . wrote at the end of it,
  
                     the fashioner of things
                              has no original intentions
                      mountains and rivers
                              are spirit, condensed.'
  
                     . . . who has come up with
                              these miraculous forests and springs?
                     pale ink
                              on fine white silk.'
  
 later that month someone named li hui added,
  
                     . . . most people can get along with the noise of dogs
                            and chickens
                        everybody cheerful in these peaceful times.
                        but i--why are my tastes so odd?
                        i love the company of streams and boulders.'
  
 t'ien hsieh of wei-lo, no date, next wrote,
  
                     . . . the water holds up the mountains,
                                the mountains go down in the water . . .'
  
 in  chih-shun adds,
  
                     . . . this is truly a painting worth careful keeping.
                     and it has poem-colophons from the sung and the
                     chin dynasties. that it survived dangers of fire and
                     war makes it even rarer.'
                       
 in the mid-seventeenth century one wang to had a look at it
  
           my brother's relative by marriage, wn-sun, is learned and
           has good taste. he writes good prose and poetry. my broth-
           er brought over this painting of his to show me . . .'
  
 the great ch'ing dynasty collector liang ch'ing-piao owned it,
 but didn't write on it or cover it with seals. from him it went into
 the imperial collection down to the early twentieth century. chang
 ta-ch'ien sold it in . now it's at the cleveland art museum,
 which sits on a rise that looks out toward the waters of lake erie.
  
                     
  
                     step back and gaze again at the land
                                               it rises and subsides--
  
                     ravines and cliffs like waves of blowing leaves--
                               stamp the foot, walk with it, clap turn,

                               strained through boulders,
                               mountains walking on the water,
                               water ripples every hill.

                              stand by the wall and tell their tale,
                      walk the path, sit the rains,
                      grind the ink, wet the brushes, unroll the

 note a hand scroll by this name showed up in shansi province, central china, in 
 the thirteenth century. even then the painter was unknown, a person of the sung
 dynasty. now it's on turtle island. unroll the scroll to the left, a section at a time, as
 you let the right side roll back in. place by place unfurls.


out there walking round, looking out for food,
 a rootstock, a birdcall, a seed that you can crack
 plucking, digging, snaring, snagging,
          barely getting by,
  
 no food out there on dusty slopes of scree--
 carry some--look for some,
 go for a hungry dream.
 deer bone, dall sheep,
          bones hunger home.
  
 out there somewhere
 a shrine for the old ones,
 the dust of the old bones,
          old songs and tales.
  
 what we ate--who ate what--

                swirl of light strokes writhing
                knot-tying light paths,

 los angeles basin and hill slopes

                   in the night city belly.
                   the passage of light end to end and rebound,
                   --ride drivers all heading somewhere--
                   etch in their traces to night's eye-mind
  
                   calligraphy of cars.
  
 vole paths. mouse trails worn in
 on meadow grass
 winding pocket-gopher tunnels,
 marmot lookout rocks.

                   where the river debouches
                   the place of the moment
                   of trembling and gathering and giving
                   so that lizards clap hands there
                   --just lizards
                   come pray, saying
                   please give us health and long life.

                   gold bellies roil
                   mouth-bubbles, frenzy of feeding,

                   godlings ride by in rolls royce
                   wide-eyed in brokers' halls
                   lifted in hotels
                   being presented to, platters
                   of tidbit and wine,
                   snatch of fame,
  
                            churn and roil,

 the calligraphy of lights on the night

against its will, energy is doing something productive, like the devil in medieval history. the principle is that nature does something against its own will and, by self-entanglement, produces beauty.                                                                                                             otto rssler

 gave birth to rocks, trees, rivers, mountains, grass
 and last, a blazing child
           so burned she died.
  
           in the land of darkness
           a mass of pollution.
  
           ah wash her clear stream
  
           --skinny  little  girl   with   big ears
           we have passed through
                     passed through,     flesh out of flesh.
  
           
  
 shining heavens, goddess of the sun,
          her brother flung
                    mud and shit and a half-skinned pony through
                    the palace,
 so she entered a cave--shut it up with a rock--
          made the world dark.
  
         
  
 ame-no-uzume, outrageous heavenly woman, wrapped
 the numinous club-moss of mr. kagu round her hips, made
 a headband from the leaves of nishikigi, bound bamboo
 grass for her wristlets, and put a sounding-board down
 before the cave where the sun goddess stayed.
      she danced and she stamped til it echoed around, she
 danced like a goddess possessed, pulled out her nipples,
 pushed her sash down til she showed herself down below,
 and the plain of high heaven shook with the laughs and
 the cheers and the whistles of thousands of gods who were
 gathered to watch.
                                                                             jean herbert
  
          

         the whole river. clear back to each creeklet
          rock-rimmed,
                   all one basin drawing in the threads
          pacing down dry riverbeds the dance,
                mai, stomping, stepping on the gravelly bar
          step, stop, stamp of the foot. glide and turn,
  
                   headwaters, mountains,
                            breathing icy bliss
  
          diamond-glittered bitty snowcreek
          eating the inorganic granite down.
  
          trees once cooled the air, and clouds, ah, ghost of
                    water
                    springs gone dry. hills of yugoslavia clearcut
                              for the roman fleet
                    --don't think all that topsoil's gone
                            it only waits.
          
          --slept on river sidebars

                   grains cooked in rock-flour glacier water,

                   for a sandy heap of years,
  
          and creeks meander                    just because they swing.

          a cord of heavenly hi-kage vine, tied around her head a
          head-band of the heavenly ma-saki vine, bound to-
          gether bundles of sasa leaves to hold in her hands, and
          overturning a bucket before the heavenly rock-cave
          door, stamped resoundingly upon it. then she became
          divinely possessed, exposed her breasts, and pushed
          her skirt-band down to her genitals.
                                                                              allan grapard

          what did she wear?
                   what leaves in her hair?
  
  
          how far did she push her skirt down?


i first saw it in the sixties,
 driving a volkswagen camper
 with a fierce gay poet and a
 lovely but dangerous girl with a husky voice,
  
 we came down from canada
 on the dry east side of the ranges. grand coulee, blue
 mountains, lava flow caves,
 the alvord desert--pronghorn ranges--
 and the glittering obsidian-paved
 dirt track toward vya,
 seldom-seen roads late september and
 thick frost at dawn then
 follow a canyon and suddenly open to
           silvery flats that curved over the edge
  
           o, ah the
           awareness of emptiness
           brings forth a heart of compassion
  
 we followed the rim of the playa
 to a bar where the roads end
 and over a pass into pyramid lake
 from the smoke creek side,
 by the ranches of wizards
 who follow the tipi path.
 the next day we reached san francisco
 in a time when it seemed
 the world might head a new way.
  
 and again, in the seventies, back from
 montana, i recklessly pulled off the highway
 took a dirt track onto the flats,
 got stuck--scared the kids--slept the night,
 and the next day sucked free and went on.
  
 fifteen years passed. in the eighties
 with my lover i went where the roads end.
 walked the hills for a day,
 looked out where it all drops away,
 discovered a path
 of carved stone inscriptions tucked into the sagebrush
  
           stomp out greed
           the best things in life are not things
  
 words placed by an old desert sage.
  
 faint shorelines seen high on these slopes,
 long gone lake lahontan,
 cutthroat trout spirit in silt--
 columbian mammoth bones
 four hundred feet up on the wave-etched
           beach ledge curly-horned
                     desert sheep outlines pecked into the rock,
  
 and turned the truck onto the playa
 heading for know-not,
 bone-gray dust boiling and billowing,
 mile after mile, trackless and featureless,
 let the car coast to a halt
 on the crazed cracked
 flat hard face where
 winter snow spirals, and
 summer sun bakes like a kiln.
 off nowhere, to be or not be,
  
           all equal, far reaches, no bounds.
           sound swallowed away         
           no waters, no mountains, no
           bush no grass and
                     because no grass
           no shade but your shadow.
           no flatness because no not-flatness.
           no loss, no gain. so--
           nothing in the way
           --the ground is the sky
           the sky is the ground,
           no place between, just
  
           wind-whip breeze,
           tent-mouth leeward,
           time being here.
           we meet heart to heart,
           leg hard-twined to leg,
                     with a kiss that goes to the bone.
           dawn sun comes straight in the eye. the tooth
           of a far peak called king lear.
  
 now in the nineties desert night
           --my lover's my wife--
 old friends, old trucks, drawn around
 great arcs of kids on bikes out there in darkness
           no lights--just planet venus glinting
 by the calyx crescent moon,
 and tasting grasshoppers roasted in a pan.
  
           they all somehow swarm down here--
           sons and daughters in the circle
           eating grasshoppers grimacing,
  
 singing stras for the insects in the wilderness,
  
 --the wideness, the
 foolish loving spaces
  
 full of heart.
  
           walking on walking,
                     under foot   earth turns
  
           streams and mountains never stay the same.
  
  
  
  
                               the space goes on.
                               but the wet black brush
                               tip drawn to a point,
                                        lifts away.
  
  
  
  

we had two gardens. 

a real flower garden 
overhanging the road 
our miniature babylon. 
paths which i helped 
to lay with aunt winifred, 
riprapped with pebbles 
shards of painted delph 
an old potato boiler 
a blackened metal pot, 
now bright with petals. 

hedges of laurel, palm. 
a hovering scent of boxwood. 
crouched in the flowering 
lilac, i could oversee 
the main road, old lynch 
march to the wellspring 
with his bucket, whistling, 
his carrotty sons herding 
in and out their milch cows 
a growing whine of cars. 

then, the vegetable garden 
behind, rows of broad beans 
plumping their cushions, 
the furled freshness of 
tight little lettuce heads, 
slim green pea pods above 
early flowering potatoes, 
gross clumps of carrots, 
parsnips, a frailty of parsley, 
a cool fragrance of mint. 

sealed off by sweetpea 
clambering up its wired fence, 
the tarred goats' shack 
which stank in summer, 
in its fallow, stone-heaped corner. 

with, on the grassy margin, 
a well-wired chicken run, 
cheeping balls of fluff 
brought one by one into the sun 
from their metallic mother 
--the oil-fed incubator-- 
always in danger from 
the marauding cat, or 
the stealthy, hungry vixen 
i, their small guardian. 

two gardens, the front 
for beauty, the back 
for use. sleepless now, 
i wander through both 
and it is summer again, 
the long summers of youth 
as i trace small paths 
in a trance of growth 
flowers pluck at my coat 
as i bend down to help, 
or speak to my aunt, 
whose calloused hands 
caressing the plants 
are tender as a girl's.


mendota, illinois
it's easy to believe you can go back
whenever you desire, jump in the car
and drive, arrive at dusk--the hour

you recall most vividly--and walk
among the buildings spread across the farm,
out toward the pastures, woods, and fields.

there is music in the leaves, in the dense
columns of green corn. the wind lays down
the tune. you can play it, too, simply

by walking with eyes closed, arms
stretched out, lightly striking the stalks.
who wouldn't desire, like the children

lost in so many similar fields,
to sit down on the turned earth and drift
away on the rhythms of his own

first possible death? rescuing
voices come closer, veer off. flashlight beams
strobe over your head. you do not care.

each building you remember--hen house,
sheep shed, corn crib, barn--caved in upon itself,
the walls and roofs collapsing with a final

percussive clap, since you last walked those fields.
no one you will ever know works that land now.
it is as green as eden. life rises in the roots, in the leaves.


talking, we begin to find the way into 
our hearts, we who knew no words, 
words being a rare commodity 
in those countries we left behind. 

both refugees and similarly deprived, 
we marvel at the many things there 
are to say so many variations 
and colors of the same thought, so 

many different lengths in the words 
that line up together on our tongues. 
no scarcity, no rationing, no 
waiting in line in order to buy 

the same answer we heard each time 
we asked, that one word, owned by 
the state, manufactured by the state, 
serving all purposes equally alike 
no, no, no, and sometimes never.


the socks
   red with a white star in a crescent moon
   the shoes black red gold
   are to many
   like a warm foot
   in cold shoe leather
   to others
   a double knot
   in
   a life only as long as a shoelace
   but for all that
   on hot coals

 translated by oliver pauley

for nelly sachs
it wasn't the earth that swallowed them. was it the air? 
numerous as the sand, they did not become 
sand, but came to naught instead. they've been forgotten 
in droves. often, and hand in hand, 
       
like minutes. more than us, 
but without memorials. not registered, 
not cipherable from dust, but vanished-- 
their names, spoons, and footsoles. 
       
they don't make us sorry. nobody 
can remember them were they born, 
did they flee, have they died? they were 
not missed. the world is airtight 
yet held together 
by what it does not house, 
by the vanished. they are everywhere. 
       
without the absent ones, there would be nothing. 
without the fugitives, nothing is firm. 
without the forgotten, nothing for certain. 
       
the vanished are just. 
that's how we'll fade, too. 


   


fr nelly sachs 

nicht die erde hat sie verschluckt. war es die luft? 
wie der sand sind sie zahireich, doch nicht zu sand 
sind sie geworden, sondern zu nichte. in scharen 
sind sie vergessen. hufig und hand in hand, 
       
wie die minuten. mehr als wir, 
doch ohne andenken. nicht verzeichnet, 
nicht abzulesen im staub, sondern verschwunden 
sind ihre namen, lffel und sohlen. 
       
sie reuen uns nicht. es kann sich niemand 
auf sie besinnen sind sie geboren, 
geflohen, gestorben? vermit 
sind sie nicht worden. lckenlos 
ist die welt, doch zusammengehalten 
von dem was sie nicht behaust, 
von den verschwundenen. sie sind berall. 
       
ohne die abwesenden wre nichts da. 
ohne die flchtigen wre nichts fest. 
ohne die vergessenen nichts gewi. 
       
die verschwundenen sind gerecht. 
so verschallen wir auch.


right up to my final hour 
i'll be obliging and polite. 
should i hear death firmly knocking, 
i'll blithely shout come in all right 
       
what's on the schedule? dying, is it? 
well, that's something rather new. 
but i'm sure that we can swing it, 
showing them a thing or two. 
       
what is this? your hourglass? 
interesting and good to grasp. 
and the scythe is for grim reaping, 
did you say? i thought i'd ask. 
       
which way should i turn from here? 
to the left? from where you stand? 
well, all right then. to the graveyard? 
where i take my final hand? 
       
yes, the glass is out of sand now. 
oh, i see, you want it back. 
may i ask you where you got it? 
so unusual, all in black. 
       
is it antique? oh well, whatever. 
i only meant to ask, old chap-- 
what? no questions? no more talking? 
that's fine by me. i'll shut my-- 
       
   

ach, noch in der letzten stunde 
werde ich verbindlich sein. 
klopft der tod an meine tre 
rufe ich geschwind herein 
       
woran soll es gehn? ans sterben? 
hab ich zwar noch nie gemacht, 
doch wir werd'n das kind schon schaukeln-- 
na, das wre ja gelacht 
       
interessant so eine sanduhr 
ja, die halt ich gern mal fest. 
ach--und das ist ihre sense? 
und die gibt mir dann den rest? 
       
wohin soll ich mich jetzt wenden? 
links? von ihnen aus gesehn? 
ach, von mir aus bis zur grube? 
und wie soll es weitergehn? 
       
ja, die uhr ist abgelaufen. 
wollen sie die jetzt zurck? 
gibt's die irgendwo zu kaufen? 
ein so ausgefall'nes stck 
       
findet man nicht alle tage, 
womit ich nur sagen will 
--ach ich soll hier nichts mehr sagen?

that never 
would he write 
his autobiography 

because his life 
seemed to him 
just so much filth 

that only a few 
points, bloody ones 
he still remembers 

but that he would 
never hesitate 
to reach into the filth 

to pull out 
what perhaps 
could serve as stuff 

for poetry 
his disgusting 
purpose in life 

   

da niemals 
er schreiben werde 
seine autobiographie 

da ihm sein leben 
viel zu sehr 
als dreck erscheine 

da auch nur wenige 
punkte, blutige 
er noch erinnere 

da aber niemals 
er zgern werde 
in den dreck zu fassen 

um herauszuziehen 
was vielleicht 
einen stoff abgbe 

fr poesie 
seinen widerlichen 
lebenszweck 




last night i awoke knew
that i should say goodbye now
to these verses. that's how it always goes
after a few years. they have to get out
into the world. it's not possible to keep them
forever here under the roof.
poor things. they must set out for town.
a few will be allowed to return later.
but most of them are still hanging around out there.
who knows what will become of them. before they
find their peace.


one death comes
before another.
breath and smoke.
and smoke which puts out breath.
and silence.

but sometimes only a cigarette
helps you keep your grip. and keeps
its promises more quickly, too.
between yellowed fingers
it burns like love becomes ashes
like betrayal. breath and smoke.

the three fingers of oath curved
around the cigarette to
not forswear.

ein tod kommt
vor dem andern.
atem und rauch.
und rauch der atem lscht.
und schweigen.

manchmal ist aber eine zigarette
der letzte halt. und hlt
was sie verspricht auch schneller.
zwischen vergilbten fingern
brennts wie liebe wird asche
wie verrat. atem und rauch.

die schwurfinger gekrmmt
um die zigarette um
nicht abzuschwren.
giordano brennt auf dem campo de fiori.
die glocken von santa maria maggiore
gellen noch immer zum autodaf.

atem und rauch.
und rauch der atem lscht.
und mit verbrannter hand
ber das feuer schreiben.
und die grenzen der deutschen sprache
sind mit mrderischen zufllen vermint.
ein tod kommt dem andern zuvor.


yes, i've been in rome, at least two times,
though on second thought it probably was
three or maybe five. when was the last?
that's easy, for i remember it exactly--
at least what it was like when i first left.
you mean a part of you remains in rome?

not really, for when i was first in rome
i was truly there. that ended the second time,
though i only realized it when i first left.
so when you were in rome your last time was
consumed by thoughts of leaving? not exactly.
as time went on, i came around at last,

thinking obsess about leaving and nothing lasts
i'll end up never having been in rome.
yet back then did you know just what exactly
it meant to be in rome during that time
you thought about leaving, even if it was
then you saw what you'd lose if you had left?

even at the time when i first left
i'd no idea. but you're not saying the last
you saw of rome was your third visit, for wasn't
it earlier that you felt you'd never leave rome?
no, all that happened there my second time,
though to this day i feel about rome exactly

what i felt from the first. what that means exactly
is hard to say, for perhaps i never left,
since after all, my being there the first time
didn't involve my leaving. tell me then, at last,
was it once or twice? were you really in rome?
why certainly--i'm sure, i know i was,

and on top of that you might even say i was
there time and again, everything there exactly
just the same, or like my last time in rome,
me feeling as if i'd never really left.
but tell me now precisely, was the last
you saw of rome indeed that second time?

to be exact, it happened the very first time
that i saw rome, darkness falling as i left
causing me to see what simply couldn't last.


from here into the north, the ways are 
dry. yellow grass, 
thirst in the roots. in the hearts. 
it's all simple, but false. 
      
when i try to think history, 
the enormous vertebrae 
of the dinosaur behind the purple beeches 
in invalidenstrasse, 
bismarck in marble, 
and benn, a nameplate on bozener, lifeless. 
      
in the depths of the bunkers 
on potsdamer platz in berlin 
are the shoes of hitler's favorite horse. 
profile of power armor and helmet. 
in our pants pockets, we crumple 
the banners. full of satisfaction 
we hear the flags splinter 
in the fabric's darkness. 
      
don't forget the poets' loaded dice. 
when iron rules again, 
we will have to console ourselves, 
adorn stones with smaller stones, 
the heart with water. 
      

   


von hier in den norden sind die wege 
trocken. gelbes gras, 
durst in den wurzeln. im herzen. 
alles ist einfach, aber falsch. 
      
wenn ich versuche, geschichte zu denken, 
die riesigen wirbelknochen 
des sauriers hinter den blutbuchen 
in der invalidenstrae, 
bismarck in marmor, 
und benn, ein klingelschild in der bozener, leblos. 
      
in den tiefen der bunker 
des potsdamer platzes in berlin 
liegen die hufeisen von hitlers lieblingspferd. 
profile der macht harnisch und helm. 
in der hosentasche zerknicken wir 
die standarten. voll genugtuung 
hren wir die fahnen splittern 
im dunkel des stoffs. 
      
verget nicht die geflschten wrfel der dichter. 
wenn die eisernen wieder herrschen, 
werden wir uns trsten mssen, 
steine schmcken mit kleinen steinen, 
mit wasser das herz.


is doing her usual for comic relief.   
                        she doesn't 
               see why she should get on the boat, etc., 

etc., while life as we know it hangs by a thread.   
                        even god 
               has had one or two great deadpan lines 

who told you this was back at the start-- 
                        the teeth 
               of the tautology had just snapped shut who 

told you you were naked? the world   
                        was so new 
               that death hadn't been till this minute 

required. what makes you think the   
                        ground 
               withers under their feet we were told? 
 
the woman's disobedience is good for   
                        plot, 
               as also for restoring plot to human 

scale three hundred cubits by fifty   
                        by what? 
               what's that in inches exactly? whereas 

all obstinate wife is common coin.   
                        in 
               the beginning was nothing and then a flaw 

in the nothing, a sort of mistake that amplified, the   
                        nothing 
               mistranscribed it takes such discipline 

to keep the prospect clean and now the lion   
                        whelps, 
               the beetle rolls its ball of dung, and noah 

with no more than a primitive double- 
                        entry audit   
               is supposed to make it right. 

we find the creator in an awkward bind.   
                        washed back 
               to oblivion? think again. the housewife 

at her laundry tub has got a better grip.    
                        which may 
               be why we've tried to find her laughable, 

she's such an unhappy reminder of what   
                        understanding 
               costs. ask the boy who cannot, though 

god know's he's tried, he swears   
                        each bar 
               of melting soap will be his last, who cannot 

turn the water off when once he's turned it on.   
                        his hands 
               are raw. his body seems like filth to him. 

who told you the pharmacopoeia has   
                        changed, 
               the malady's still the same who told you 

you were food for worms?

monsignor, i believed jesus followed me 
with his eyes, and when i slept, 
an angel peeled an orange 
and waited for me to wake up. 
this was . i was ten, small as the flame 
of a struck match, my lungs fiery 
from hard, wintery play. when i returned home, 
legs hurting, i placed my hands on the windowsill 
and looked out--clouds dirty as towels 
and geese i have yet to see again 
darkening the western sky. 

monsignor, a machine 
had painted on the eyes of my toy soldier, 
little dots off-center, 
almost on his cheeks. such a cheap toy, 
i drowned him over and over in my bath, 
drowned him until the painted-on eyes flaked off. 
then a leg fell off--surge of dirty water 
sunk him to the bottom. 

i now at this age place hands on the windowsill, 
my eyes nearly on my cheeks, 
my belly with its rising tide. 
there is no angel with an orange at the edge 
of my bed. there is no soldier 
of god. only a pane between the inside 
and the outside, between this living 
and this dying. monsignor, 
saintly man of this child's wonderment, 
when will i see the geese again?


we are in the position of defining myth by the shape of its absence.          -sean kane, wisdom of the mythtellers
       the bluebird's cold mistimed egg
fetched up from the one-legged
       box after the pair had left for
points south & unknown never,
       as it turned out, to return i
renested in the half-geode by
       the windowsill where it gleamed
&, months becoming years, seemed
       about to last forever, grow more
consistent with itself, holding its pure
       blue firmament up over what by now
was nothing, till one january day, snow
       melting to a fast flood,
i blew it softly onto my palm so i could
       hold its cerulean up against new sky,
home against home, where it lay
       weightless & delicate as the xmas ornament
we'd just put away, but when i went
       to roll it gently back onto its bed,
& leave it there, i saw a thread,
       a crack, another, watched it sink in
slowly on itself, shard on shard collapsing
       from my touch & breath, relaxing
into the shape of its absence


stunned heat of noon. in shade, tan, silken cows 
hide in the thorned acacias. a butterfly staggers. 
      
stamping their hooves from thirst, small horses drowse 
or whinny for water. on parched, ochre headlands, daggers 

of agave bristle in primordial defense, 
like a cornered monster backed up against the sea. 

a mongoose charges dry grass and fades through a fence 
faster than an afterthought. dust rises easily. 

haze of the harmattan, sahara dust, memory's haze 
from the dried well of africa, the headland's desert 

or riders in swirling burnooses, mixed with the greys 
of hills veiled in impressionist light. we inherit 
    
two worlds of associations, or references, drought 
that we heighten into delacroix's north africa, 

veils, daggers, lances, herds the harmattan brought 
with a phantom inheritance, which the desperate seeker 

of a well-spring staggers in the heat in search of-- 
heroic ancestors the other that the dry season brings 

is the gust of a european calendar, but it is the one love 
that thirsts for confirmations in the circling rings 

of the ground dove's cooing on stones, in the acacia's 
thorns and the agave's daggers, that they are all ours, 

the white horsemen of the sahara, india's and asia's 
plumed mongoose and crested palmtree, benin and pontoise. 

we are history's afterthought, as the mongoose races 
ahead of its time in drought we discover our shadows, 

our origins that range from the most disparate places, 
from the dugouts of guinea to the nile's canted dhows. 


                                     ii 

the incredible blue with its bird-inviting cloud, 
in which there are crumbling towers, banners and domes, 

and the sliding carthage of sunsets, the marble shroud 
drawn over associations that are greece's and rome's 

and rarely of africa. they continue at sixty-seven 
to echo in the corridors of the head, perspectives 

of a corridor in the vatican that led, not to heaven, 
but to more paintings of heaven, ideas in lifted sieves 

drained by satiety because great art can exhaust us, 
and even the steadiest faith can be clogged by excess, 

the self-assured christs, the madonnas' inflexible postures 
without the mess of motherhood. with this blue i bless 

emptiness where these hills are barren of tributes 
and the repetitions of power, our sky's naive 

ceiling without domes and spires, an earth whose roots 
like the thorned acacia's deepen my belief.


you may think it strange, sam, that i'm writing 
a letter in these circumstances. i thought 
it strange too--the first time. but there's 
a misconception i was laboring under, and you 
are too, viz. that the imagination in your 
vicinity is free and powerful. after all, 
you say, you've been creating yourself all 
along imaginatively. you imagine yourself 
playing golf or hiking in the olympics or 
writing a poem and then it becomes true. 
but you still have to do it, you have to exert 
yourself, will, courage, whatever you've got, you're 
mired in the unimaginative. here i imagine a letter 
and it's written. takes about two-fifths of a 
second, your time. hell, this is heaven, man. 
i can deluge congress with letters telling 
every one of those mendacious sons of bitches 
exactly what he or she is, in maybe about 
half an hour. in spite of your buddhist 
proclivities, when you imagine bliss 
you still must struggle to get there. by the way 
the buddha has his place across town on 
elysian drive. we call him bud. he's lost weight 
and got new dentures, and he looks a hell of a 
lot better than he used to. he always carries 
a jumping jack with him everywhere just 
for contemplation, but he doesn't make it 
jump. he only looks at it. meanwhile sidney 
and dizzy, uncle ben and papa yancey, are 
over by sylvester's grot making the sweetest, 
cheerfulest blues you ever heard. the air, 
so called, is full of it. poems are fluttering 
everywhere like seed from a cottonwood tree. 
sam, the remarkable truth is i can do any 
fucking thing i want. speaking of which 
there's this dazzling young naomi who 
wiped out on i- just west of truckee 
last winter, and i think this is the moment 
for me to go and pay her my respects. 
don't go way. i'll be right back.


i knew that james whistler was part of the paris scene, 
but i was still surprised when i found the painting 
of his mother at the muse d'orsay 
among all the colored dots and mobile brushstrokes 
of the french impressionists. 

and i was surprised to notice 
after a few minutes of benign staring, 
how that woman, stark in profile 
and fixed forever in her chair, 
began to resemble my own ancient mother 
who was now fixed forever in the stars, the air, the earth. 

you can understand why he titled the painting 
arrangement in gray and black 
instead of what everyone naturally calls it, 
but afterward, as i walked along the river bank, 
i imagined how it might have broken 
the woman's heart to be demoted from mother 
to a mere composition, a study in colorlessness. 

as the summer couples leaned into each other 
along the quay and the wide, low-slung boats 
full of spectators slid up and down the seine 
between the carved stone bridges 
and their watery reflections, 
i thought how ridiculous, how off-base. 

it would be like botticelli calling the birth of venus 
composition in blue, ochre, green, and pink, 
or the other way around 
like rothko titling one of his sandwiches of color 
fishing boats leaving falmouth harbor at dawn. 

or, as i scanned the menu at the cafe 
where i now had come to rest, 
it would be like painting something laughable, 
like a chef turning on a spit 
over a blazing fire in front of an audience of ducks 
and calling it study in orange and white. 

but by that time, a waiter had appeared 
with my glass of pernod and a clear pitcher of water, 
and i sat there thinking of nothing 
but the women and men passing by-- 
mothers and sons walking their small fragile dogs-- 
and about myself, 
a kind of composition in blue and khaki, 
and, now that i had poured 
some water into the glass, milky-green.


what vegetable leviathan
extends beneath the dinner table,
an unseen, monstrous green that pulls
the chair out from under our faith
 
in appearances see a mere tuft
of leaf on the plate like a wing,
but if it flies away, it undoubtedly
will disturb the continental drift
 
asleep under the salad plate,
the hidden world we forget
as we reach for the smaller fork--
and now, mouth full, don't speak politely
 
chew your leaf of firmament
that's torn and tossed up in vinegar here as
we'll be tossed before its vast
root maybe someday or any moment.


on the radio this morning the average woman knows
 colors--and men know eight. women say coffee,
mocha, copper, cinnamon, taupe. men say brown.

women know an amazon of colors i might have said
were green, an antarctica of whites, oceans of colors
i'd stupidly call blue, fields of color, with flowers in them
i would have said were red.

from women, i've learned to love the browns,
the earths, the dusts, the clays, the soft colors, the colors
brought out from the mines, hardened ones,
hardened in fires i would call red the colors of the furies
the reconciling colors of the cooling ash.

by myself i know the evening colors when the sky goes
from blue to another blue to black--although it's a lonely,
whitish black sometimes,
                                                                        like the color of sleep--
the way dreams are lit by the light that's thrown
from nowhere on the things you find in them. last night
there was a turtle, i would say it was brown or green,
or it was a snake, mottled, a kind of grey, disguised
as a turtle, red spots as if painted on the shell,
a palish greenish underside--vulnerable, alone
swimming in water i would say was colorless.

i woke to the pale colors of the morning--no one
has a name for those the white-rose white you see
through the white of the curtains on the window,
the milks, the creams, the cream a galactic swirl
before it turns to brown when your wife stirs it in the coffee,
the faint drying oval on the silver of the spoon.


by freezing passion at its blossoming
perhaps rodin knew he challenged
sophocles who said as lover you want
ice to be ice yet not melt
in your hands. how stone,
implying permanence, might let us believe,
a moment, the seated figures are beyond the leaf
that cannot keep from letting go the branch,
beyond even stupidly purpling grapes
that do not understand the process
by which they darken darken nevertheless.


canto iii appeared in the july,  issue of poetry. originally part of what scholars call the ur-cantos, this version of canto iii was later edited by pound to become canto i of his collected cantos. the section that eventually became canto i is highlighted in blue in the poem below. 
--the editors 


iii 

another's a half-cracked fellow--john heydon, 
worker of miracles, dealer in levitation, 
in thoughts upon pure form, in alchemy, 
seer of pretty visions servant of god and secretary of nature          
full of plaintive charm, like botticelli's, 
with half-transparent forms, lacking the vigor of gods. 
thus heydon, in a trance, at bulverton, 
had such a sight 
decked all in green, with sleeves of yellow silk 
slit to the elbow, slashed with various purples. 
her eyes were green as glass, her foot was leaf-like. 
she was adorned with choicest emeralds, 
and promised him the way of holy wisdom. 
pretty green bank, began the half-lost poem. 
take the old way, say i met john heydon,          
sought out the place, 
lay on the bank, was plungd deep in swevyn 
and saw the company--layamon, chaucer-- 
pass each in his appropriate robes 
conversed with each, observed the varying fashion. 
and then comes heydon. 
                                 i have seen john heydon. 
let us hear john heydon 
                                 omniformis 
omnis intellectus est--thus he begins, by spouting half of psellus. 
then comes a note, my assiduous commentator 
not psellus de daemonibus, but porphyry's chances, 
in the thirteenth chapter, that every intellect is omni-form. 
magnifico lorenzo used the dodge, 
says that he met ficino 
in some wordsworthian, false-pastoral manner, 
and that they walked along, stopped at a well-head, 
and heard deep platitudes about contentment 
from some old codger with an endless beard. 
a daemon is not a particular intellect, 
but is a substance differed from intellect, 
breaks in ficino, 
placed in the latitude or locus of souls-- 
that's out of proclus, take your pick of them. 
valla, more earth and sounder rhetoric-- 
prefacing praise to his pope nicholas 
a man of parts, skilled in the subtlest sciences 
a patron of the arts, of poetry and of a fine discernment. 
then comes a catalogue, his jewels of conversation. 
no, you've not read your elegantiae-- 
a dull book?--shook the church. 
the prefaces, cut clear and hard 
know then the roman speech, a sacrament, 
spread for the nations, eucharist of wisdom, 
bread of the liberal arts. 
                                 ha sir blancatz, 
sordello would have your heart to give to all the princes 
valla, the heart of rome, 
sustaining speech, set out before the people. 
nec bonus christianus ac bonus 
                                 tullianus. 
marius, du bellay, wept for the buildings, 
baldassar castiglione saw raphael 
lead back the soul into its dead, waste dwelling, 
corpore laniato and lorenzo valla, 
broken in middle life? bent to submission?-- 
took a fat living from the papacy 
that's in villari, but burckhardt's statement is different-- 
more than the roman city, the roman speech 
holds fast its part among the ever-living. 
not by the eagles only was rome measured. 
wherever the roman speech was, there was rome, 
wherever the speech crept, there was mastery 
spoke with the law's voice while your greek, logicians... 
more greeks than one doughty's divine homeros 
came before sophistry. justinopolitan 
uncatalogued andreas divus, 
gave him in latin,  in my edition, the rest uncertain, 
caught up his cadence, word and syllable 
down to the ships we went, set mast and sail, 
black keel and beasts for bloody sacrifice, 
weeping we went. 
i've strained my ear for -ensa, -ombra, and -ensa 
and cracked my wit on delicate canzoni-- 
                   here's but rough meaning 

and then went down to the ship, set keel to breakers, 
forth on the godly sea 
we set up mast and sail on the swarthy ship, 
sheep bore we aboard her, and our bodies also 
heavy with weeping. and winds from sternward 
bore us out onward with bellying canvas-- 
circe's this craft, the trim-coifed goddess. 
then sat we amidships, wind jamming the tiller. 
thus with stretched sail 
                   we went over sea till day's end 
sun to his slumber, shadows o'er all the ocean. 
came we then to the bounds of deepest water, 
to the kimmerian lands and peopled cities 
covered with close-webbed mist, unpiercd ever 
with glitter of sun-rays, 
nor with stars stretched, nor looking back from heaven, 
swartest night stretched over wretched men there. 
thither we in that ship, unladed sheep there, 
the ocean flowing backward, came we through to the place 
aforesaid by circe. 
here did they rites, perimedes and eurylochus, 
and drawing sword from my hip 
i dug the ell-square pitkin, poured we libations unto each the dead,            
first mead and then sweet wine, 
water mixed with white flour. 
then prayed i many a prayer to the sickly death's-heads 
as set in ithaca, sterile bulls of the best, 
for sacrifice, heaping the pyre with goods. 
sheep, to tiresias only, 
black, and a bell sheep 
dark blood flowed in the fosse. 
souls out of erebus, cadaverous dead 
of brides, of youths, and of many passing old, 
virgins tender, souls stained with recent tears, 
many men mauled with bronze lance-heads, 
battle spoil, bearing yet dreary arms 
these many crowded about me, 
with shouting, pallor upon me, cried to my men for more beasts 
slaughtered the herds--sheep slain of bronze, 
poured ointment, cried to the gods, 
to pluto the strong, and praised proserpine. 
unsheathed the narrow steel, 
i sat to keep off the impetuous, impotent dead 
till i should hear tiresias. 
but first elpenor came, our friend elpenor, 
unburied, cast on the wide earth-- 
limbs that we left in the house of circe, 
unwept, unwrapped in sepulchre, since toils urged other, 
pitiful spirit--and i cried in hurried speech 
'elpenor, how art thou come to this dark coast? 
cam'st thou afoot, outstripping seamen?' and he in heavy speech 
'ill fate and abundant wine i slept in circe's ingle, 
going down the long ladder unguarded, i fell against the buttress, 
shattered the nape-nerve, the soul sought avernus. 
but thou, o king, i bid remember me, unwept, unburied 
heap up mine arms, be tomb by the sea-board, and inscribed, 
a man of no fortune and with a name to come 
and set my oar up, that i swung 'mid fellows.' 
came then another ghost, whom i beat off, anticlea, 
and then tiresias, theban, 
holding his golden wand, knew me and spoke first 
'man of ill hour, why come a second time, 
leaving the sunlight, facing the sunless dead and this joyless region? 
stand from the fosse, move back, leave me my bloody bever, 
and i will speak you true speeches.' 
                                                       and i stepped back, 
sheathing the yellow sword. dark blood he drank then 
and spoke 'lustrous odysseus, shalt 
return through spiteful neptune, over dark seas, 
lose all companions.' foretold me the ways and the signs. 
came then anticlea, to whom i answered 
'fate drives me on through these deeps i sought tiresias.' 
i told her news of troy, and thrice her shadow 
faded in my embrace. 
then had i news of many faded women-- 
tyro, alcmena, chloris-- 
heard out their tales by that dark fosse, and sailed 
by sirens and thence outward and away,

lie quiet, divus. 
                                 in officina wechli, paris, 
m. d. three x's, eight, with aldus on the frogs, 
and a certain cretan's          
                                 hymni deorum 
the thin clear tuscan stuff 
                      gives way before the florid mellow phrase. 
take we the goddess, venus 
                                                       venerandam, 
aurean coronam habentem, pulchram, 
cypri munimenta sortita est, maritime, 
light on the foam, breathed on by zephyrs, 
and air-tending hours. mirthful, orichalci, with golden 
girdles and breast bands. 
                                       thou with dark eye-lids,          
bearing the golden bough of argicida.


i tie my hat--i crease my shawl--life's little duties do--preciselyas the very leastwere infinite--to me-- --emily dickinson, 
my mother's mother, widowed very young 
of her first love, and of that love's first fruit, 
moved through her father's farm, her country tongue 
and country heart anaesthetized and mute 
with labor. so her kind was taught to do-- 
find work, she would reply to every grief-- 
and her one dictum, whether false or true, 
tolled heavy with her passionate belief. 
widowed again, with children, in her prime, 
she spoke so little it was hard to bear 
so much composure, such a truce with time 
spent in the lifelong practice of despair. 
but i recall her floors, scrubbed white as bone, 
her dishes, and how painfully they shone.


it was a green barn coat from l. l. bean   
that he had ordered, thinking of her   
walking the snowy hillside of his dream   
though she detested the style and color. 

that it arrived two days after he died   
did not dispose her to detest it less   
though she may have wished she did,   
the way she wished she'd kept house 

more neatly or baked instead of fried,   
for every coronary's a latent homicide-- 
if not what we did, what we did not do.   
if not what we said, what we did not say. 

in this, the inner jury's always out,   
no different for man or woman-- 
for everyone over forty, the human   
condition is grief complicated by guilt. 

it's unexceptional really, what's left 
after deaths. we're thrown back on our own taste.   
that coat, for instance. if that was a gift, 
she would have to hide to throw it away. 




my dog has died. 
 i buried him in the garden 
 next to a rusted old machine. 

 some day i'll join him right there, 
 but now he's gone with his shaggy coat, 
 his bad manners and his cold nose, 
 and i, the materialist, who never believed 
 in any promised heaven in the sky 
 for any human being, 
 i believe in a heaven i'll never enter. 
 yes, i believe in a heaven for all dogdom 
 where my dog waits for my arrival 
 waving his fan-like tail in friendship. 

 ai, i'll not speak of sadness here on earth, 
 of having lost a companion 
 who was never servile. 
 his friendship for me, like that of a porcupine 
 withholding its authority, 
 was the friendship of a star, aloof, 
 with no more intimacy than was called for, 
 with no exaggerations 
 he never climbed all over my clothes 
 filling me full of his hair or his mange, 
 he never rubbed up against my knee 
 like other dogs obsessed with sex. 

 no, my dog used to gaze at me, 
 paying me the attention i need, 
 the attention required 
 to make a vain person like me understand 
 that, being a dog, he was wasting time, 
 but, with those eyes so much purer than mine, 
 he'd keep on gazing at me 
 with a look that reserved for me alone 
 all his sweet and shaggy life, 
 always near me, never troubling me, 
 and asking nothing. 

 ai, how many times have i envied his tail 
 as we walked together on the shores of the sea 
 in the lonely winter of isla negra 
 where the wintering birds filled the sky 
 and my hairy dog was jumping about 
 full of the voltage of the sea's movement 
 my wandering dog, sniffing away 
 with his golden tail held high, 
 face to face with the ocean's spray. 

 joyful, joyful, joyful, 
 as only dogs know how to be happy 
 with only the autonomy 
 of their shameless spirit. 

 there are no good-byes for my dog who has died, 
 and we don't now and never did lie to each other. 

 so now he's gone and i buried him, 
 and that's all there is to it.


would it surprise you to learn 
 that years beyond your longest winter 
 you still get letters from your bank, your old 
 philanthropies, cold flakes drifting 
 through the mail-slot with your name? 
 though it's been a long time since your face 
 interrupted the light in my door-frame, 
 and the last tremblings of your voice 
 have drained from my telephone wire, 
 from the lists of the likely, your name 
 is not missing. it circles in the shadow-world 
 of the machines, a wind-blown ghost. for generosity 
 will be exalted, and good credit 
 outlasts death. caribbean cruises, recipes, 
 low-interest loans. for you who asked 
 so much of life, who lived acutely 
 even in duress, the brimming world 
 awaits your signature. cancer and heart disease 
 are still counting on you for a cure. 
 b'nai brith numbers you among the blessed. 
 they miss you. they want you back.


because it hadn't seemed enough, 
after a while, to catalogue 
more christmases, the three-layer cakes 
ablaze with birthday candles, the blizzard 
billy took a shovel to, 
phil's lawnmower tour of the yard, 
the tree forts, the shoot-'em-ups 
between the boys in new string ties 
and cowboy hats and holsters, 
or mother sticking a bow as big 
as mouseketeer ears in my hair, 

my father sometimes turned the gaze 
of his camera to subjects more 
artistic or universal 
long closeups of a rose's face 
a real-time sunset nearly an hour 
what surely were some brilliant autumn 
leaves before their colors faded 
to dry beige on the aging film 
a great deal of pacing, at the zoo, 
by polar bears and tigers caged, 
he seemed to say, like him. 

what happened between him and her 
is another story. and just as well 
we have no movie of it, only 
some unforgiving scowls she gave 
through terrifying, ticking silence 
when he must have asked her no 
sound track for a smile. 
still, what i keep yearning for 
isn't those generic cherry 
blossoms at their peak, or the brave 
daffodil after a snowfall, 

it's the re-run surprise 
of the unshuttered, prefab blanks 
of windows at the back of the house, 
and how the lines of aluminum 
siding are scribbled on with meaning 
only for us who lived there 
it's the pair of elephant bookends 
i'd forgotten, with the upraised trunks 
like handles, and the books they meant 
to carry in one block to a future 
that scattered all of us. 

and look it's the stoneware mixing bowl 
figured with hand-holding dancers 
handed down so many years 
ago to my own kitchen, still 
valueless, unbroken. here 
she's happy, teaching us to dye 
the easter eggs in it, a grecian 
urn of sorts near which--a foster 
child of silence and slow time 
myself--i smile because she does 
and patiently await my turn.


         come here's
a peach he said
         and held it out just far
enough to reach beyond his lap
         and off-

         ered me
a room the one
         room left he said in all
of thessaloniki that night
         packed with

         traders
the peach was lush
         i hadn't slept for days
it was like velvet lips a lamp
         he smiled

         patted
the bed for me
         i knew it was in fact
the only room the only bed
         the peach

         trembled
and he said come
         nodding to make me
agree i wanted the peach and
         the bed

         he said
to take it see
         how nice it was and i
thought how i could take it ginger-
         ly my

         finger-
tips only touch-
         ing only it not in
or out i stayed in the doorway
         watching

         a fly
he stroked the peach
         and asked where i was from
i said the states he smiled and asked
         how long

         i'd stay
the fly had found
         the peach i said i'd leave
for turkey in the morning i
         wanted

         so much
to sleep and on
         a bed i thought of all
the ways to say that word
         and that

         they must
have gradient
         meanings he asked me did
i want the peach and i said sure
         and took

         it from
his hand he asked
         then if i'd take the room
it costs too much i said and turned
         to go

         he said
to stay a while
         and we could talk the sun
was going down i said no thanks
         i'd head

         out on
the late train but
         could i still have the peach
and what else could he say to that
         but yes



a flashlight rolls over the walls of a cave,
 searching, until the transducer comes to a halt
 low on my still-flat belly.
 the doctor says, there's definitely a kid in there.

 easy for her to say--she sees this all day.
 but it took us years to get to this point.
 years in the dark. months of nothing and never.
 her expert eye interprets the grainy screen,

 which i can't stop reaching toward,
 pretending to point to features but really
 just longing to touch the image,
 as if it were somehow more there than in me,

 this tiny, blurry, leaping bison or bear,
 something from altamira or lascaux,
 from the hand of an ancestor--
 the first art we know.


                      for robert penn warren
reckless and white as a flashlight beam cast
into some dark corner, the moon
insists on the deeper blackness

surrounding it. perhaps it wishes
to be a woman or a window, 
cushioning everything, full of itself

for the moment, yet frightened, like any egotist.
but still the stars patiently insist
on their presence, pinholes to nothingness. 

when else would i walk on such a night in the world? 

half answers suggest themselves. 
the body consumes and wanes, collapses. 
we get to watch how everyone
dies who dies before us,
how birds rest. 

and yet while night solidifies, 
we can continue our discussion
in our effort to open the gift of the world, 
our hope to find years
in this box we tear apart. 

birds do not count in our calibration. 
they crack time randomly, as if it were seeds. 
with sudden unaccountability
they start up and disappear. 

and yet, in some way all of this
is beside the point, for what can we do
except continue our conversation, 
and what would we gain if we disappeared? 

they tell us that this is so. 

do you have any songs from your childhood
you still use to sing yourself to sleep? 

being, mind, ego the moon loves itself
in cloud shimmers, dancing as if it had pulled
a scant nightie off a laundry line
to clown with. 

we can only walk while there is light.


i guess you could call it
 a sort of sympathetic magic.
 how else to explain
 this obsessive reorganizing
 of my home, my books, my papers,
 my poems, this housekeeping
 of my hard drive and floppies,
 all the deleting and casting away
 of redundancy and obsolescence,
 dead files and moved-on addresses
 and the scrubbing, the constant
 scrubbing and dusting and the howl
 of the protesting vacuum
 that struggles to inhale
 at least the  of house-dust
 that is dead human skin
 some of which might be hers.


at times now from some margin of the day

 i can hear birds of another country

 not the whole song but a brief phrase of it

 out of a music that i may have heard

 once in a moment i appear to have

 forgotten for the most part that full day

 no sight of which i can remember now

 though it must have been where my eyes were then

 that knew it as the present while i thought

 of somewhere else without noticing that

 singing when it was there and still went on

 whether or not i noticed now it falls

 silent when i listen and leaves the day

 and flies before it to be heard again

 somewhere ahead when i have forgotten


where does such sadness in wood come 
 from? how could longing live in these 
 wires? the box looks like the most fragile 
 coffin tuned for sound. and laid 
 across the knees of this woman 
 it looks less like a baby nursed 
 than some symbolic piet, 
 and the stretched body on her lap 
 yields modalities of lament 
 and blood, yields sacrifice and sliding 
 chants of grief that dance and dance toward 
 a new measure, a new threshold, 
 a new instant and new year which 
 we always celebrate by 
 remembering the old and by 
 recalling the lost and honoring 
 those no longer here to strike these 
 strings like secrets of the most 
 satisfying harmonies, as 
 voices join in sadness and joy 
 and tell again what we already 
 know, have always known but forget, 
 from way back in the farthest cove, 
 from highest on the peaks of love.


my dear children, do you remember the morning
 when we climbed into the old plymouth
 and drove west straight toward the pacific?

 we were all the people there were.
 we followed dylan's songs all the way west.
 it was seventy the war was over, almost

 and we were driving to the sea.
 we had closed the farm, tucked in
 the flap, and were eating the honey

 of distance and the word there.
 oh whee, we're gonna fly 
 down into the easy chair. we sang that

 over and over. that's what the early
 seventies were like. we weren't afraid.
 and a hole had opened in the world.

 we laughed at las vegas.
 there was enough gaiety
 for all of us, and ahead of us was

 the ocean. tomorrow's 
 the day my bride's gonna come.
 and the war was over, almost.


       plum black & the blush white of an apple
shoulder, melon & cream, in tones to list
       the flesh in light, washed colors off at last
& textures sheer with damp i slowly pull
       from you with your quick help. weekend's ample
procrastinations to forget the least
       of what we want to do. april, half a blast
of cold, half new light, green & simple.
       now dusk. now fear. we pencil what we owe
on this short form, our numbers good enough.
       the goose-neck glare undoes how we spent the day.
each bite each bee-sting kiss each bitten o
       all aftertaste. later, at the drop-off,
       postmark queue, we joke now we can die


newspaper says the boy killed by someone,   
don't say who. i know the mother, waking,   
gets up as usual, washes her face 
in cold water, and starts the coffee pot. 

she stands by the window up there on floor   
sixteen wondering why the street's so calm   
with no cars going or coming, and then 
she looks at the wall clock and sees the time. 

now she's too awake to go back to bed,   
she's too awake not to remember him, 
her one son, or to forget exactly 
how long yesterday was, each moment dragged 

into the next by the force of her will   
until she thought this simply cannot be.   
she sits at the scarred, white kitchen table,   
the two black windows staring back at her, 

wondering how she'll go back to work today.   
the windows don't see anything they're black,   
eyeless, they give back only what's given   
sometimes, like now, even less than what's given, 

yet she stares into their two black faces   
moving her head from side to side, like this,   
just like i'm doing now. try it awhile,   
go ahead, it's not going to kill you. 

now say something, it doesn't matter what   
you say because all the words are useless   
i'm sorry for your loss. this too will pass. 
he was who he was. she won't hear you out 

because she can only hear the torn words   
she uses to pray to die. this afternoon   
you and i will see her just before four   
alight nimbly from the bus, her lunch box 

of one sandwich, a thermos of coffee, 
a navel orange secured under her arm, 
and we'll look away. under your breath make   
her one promise and keep it forever 

in the little store-front church down the block,   
the one with the front windows newspapered,   
you won't come on saturday or sunday   
to kneel down and pray for life eternal.


at san raffaele arcangelo
one angel got it all wrong.
 she plopped into this
 sad century feet first
 in her dark clothes.
 there wasn't much water
 that winter--just a few
 puddles really--
 to break her fall.
 mud-splattered, she rose
 and shook like a canine.
 it didn't take long
 to see her soaked wings
 as a backdrop to all
 the nonmagic to which we were
 accustomed, or to see
 what passed for history
 as a forgetting of sorts.
 was that one or two wars?
 strange how, as she limped
 down a dim vicolo,
 some willful disc hovered
 above her more florid
 than a sky--how the putrid
 puddles with their last
 reflections could neither
 correct nor register that light.


three days later, suljic was finally given a drink 
of water and marched with a dozen other men 
onto a small livery truck, one of two, fenced 
along each side by wooden planks, 

the back left open to give a clear shot 
to the automatic weapon poking out the window 
of the red sedan that followed, the squat nose 
trained on them, ridiculously, as if they'd any thought 

of hopping off a moving truck. suljic peered 
vacantly through the slats. he'd missed the yellow flowers 
of spring and by now saw a landscape taken over 
by summer, the grasses closing behind them as they veered 

from the road and lurched across cow paths. they drove 
to the center of a wide field and stopped. old sweat, 
without the breeze of movement, prickled in the heat. 
a metal smell drifted, an untended apple grove 

baked on a hill, and the weeds droned, motory with bees. 
but suljic noticed none of these, fixed instead 
on the gaps in the field where bodies, all dead, 
matted down the wild carrot and chicory, their khakis 

splotched darkly, like a fawn's dappled haunches 
obscuring them. the men clambered down into the tall grass 
and lined up at gunpoint. suljic was sure the last 
good thing he'd ever see would be the apple branches 

drooping with fruit, but the man beside him grabbed 
his hand, and looked him in the face, as if 
suljic, just a bricklayer, had any assurances to give. 
he squeezed the hand back, hard, and felt a scab 

crossing the man's knuckles. he saw, too, a thin scar 
worrying the arch of his left eyebrow, much older, 
perhaps from a fall as a child from a ladder 
picking fruit. his hand was like a clump of mortar, 

and three nights without sleep had webbed his eyes red. 
and suljic suddenly stuttered to ask his name, 
what town was he from, his job--anything--but there came 
the crackle, like sometimes thunder, undecided 

whether to begin, that starts, stalls, then trips 
over itself, the sound crinkling from one 
end of the sky to the other. the sound took possession 
of his face until it, too, crinkled, his grip 

pulsed, and he fell forward. suljic winced 
in the tackle of bodies, and splayed down in the dirt 
flattening himself like a beetle, not hurt 
in any new way, not yet convinced 

he wasn't dead and didn't feel it. he heard the click 
of fresh clips sliding into place, and shut 
his eyes lightly, sure someone had seen he wasn't shot 
and would come finish it. but no one came. another truck 

rolled up. the men climbed down, and lined up, docilely. 
he recognized, solely by rhythm, a prayer, cut off 
by the crackle, the hush of crickets, the soft 
whump of bodies folding at the knees 

and knocked by bullets shoulder first 
into the grass. no one yelled. no one tried to run. 
another truck, another group, falling like a succession 
of bricks sliding off a hod. suljic finally pissed 

where he lay, and blended in all the better 
with the others. the noise stopped, and he cracked 
his eyes enough to see, across the backs 
like bleeding hills, a man strolling along the scatter 

of bodies with a pistol, putting a slug 
into the skull of anyone that still twitched 
or mumbled. then came the snort and low-pitched 
rumble of diesel engines as two backhoes dug 

a trench along the margin of all the collapsed 
bodies. impossibly, the crackling started anew, 
and when darkness finally settled, the squads continued 
in what light the backhoes' headlights threw. perhaps 

the shooting was over long before the sound 
left him, the crackle to his eardrums 
was like the rolling of a boat to his limbs 
echoing long after he'd reached dry ground. 

the soldiers left. still he didn't move, but eased 
his eyes full open. the moon above the orchard 
was shrinking higher, its light glossing the awkward 
pale forms that stubbled the dry weeds, 

glinting off teeth and eyes. he scuttled from beneath 
the arms and legs flopped sleepingly over 
his own, as though by drunkards or lovers, 
and rose like a foal to his numb feet, 

seeing throughout the field no man not touched 
by three dead others. he stood for a moment, trying 
to guess, even roughly, their number, multiplying 
bodies per square yard, but the math was too much, 

the count too huge. he stared at the faces beside him 
in the grass, like a man leaving something he knew 
he would someday have to return to, 
looking for the landmarks that would guide him-- 

the crooked teeth, the welted cheek, the pale eyes eclipsed 
by half-shut lids, lolling upward, inward, swollen 
as though with weeping, blood from an unseen hole 
glistering down a chin line, crusting on lips. 

how could he explain his life, what could he say 
to those who weren't here to see, to the mothers and wives 
who'd swear for years their men were still alive, 
somewhere, the bodies never found, bulldozed into clay-- 

would he tell them how he tiptoed, unable to avoid 
stepping on hands and ankles, or how the tears 
like a secret he'd harbored through three years 
of siege shook loose, and how he let them, no longer afraid 

of being found out and cut down by gunfire, 
or how he ran anyway, when he reached the open, quick 
as his bum leg would let him, without a look 
back at the faces turned like gourds in the dark mire.


survival is the final offer
 that arrives at the eleventh hour
 just when pain to the tenth power
 would kill you with another ninth degree.

 by then, relief strikes you brief as an eighth note
 you wear doom proudly it's your seventh seal.
 but life whispers through your sixth sense
 of what might await you in some fifth dimension

 where miracle is saved for the fourth quarter.
 tricked, you sigh and rise on the third day.
 you know better, but with no second thought,
 risk that first step--absurd as first love at first sight--

 as if you were back at ground zero, as if it cost
 nothing, as if this were not the last laugh.


in the dark we disappear, pure being. 
 our mirror images, impure being. 

 being and becoming heidegger, being and 
 nothingness sartre--which is purer being? 

 being alone is no way to be thus 
 loneliness is the test of pure being. 

 nights in love i fell too far or not quite 
 far enough--one pure, one impure being. 

 clouds, snow, mist, the dragon's breath on water, 
 smoke from fire--a metaphor's pure being. 

 stillness and more stillness and the light locked 
 deep inside--both pure and impure being. 

 is is the verb of being, i the noun-- 
 or pronoun for the purists of being. 

 i was, i am, i looked within and saw 
 nothing very clearly purest being.


minutes before the rain begins
 i always waken, listening
 to the world hold its breath,
 as if a phone had rung once in a far
 room or a door had creaked
 in the darkness.

 perhaps the genes of some forebear
 startle in me, some tribal warrior
 keeping watch on a crag beside a loch,
 miserable in the cold,

 though i think it is a woman's waiting
 i have come to know,
 a loyalist hiding in the woods,
 muffling the coughing of her child
 against her linen skirts, her dark head
 bent over his, her fear spent
 somewhere else in time,

 leaving only this waiting,

 and i hope she escaped
 with her child, and i suppose she did.
 if not, i wouldn't be lying here awake,
 alive, listening for the rain to begin
 so that she can run, the sound
 of her footsteps lost, the sight
 of them blotted away on the path.


all day they stream past, petitioners
for understanding, accolade, critique.
i read them all, a vast anthology
of jumbled genres on a common theme
affliction. so i parse, interpret, scan.
i graph dysrhythmias, dysmetrias
i eavesdrop on caesuras for unsaid
murmurs, gallops, rubs, snaps, flutters, clicks.
the perils of misreading harrow me--
beware the treacheries of metaphor--
the elephant that squats upon a chest
is not a burning heart or waterbrash.

just take the imagists. their heads explode.
st elmo's fire flashdances on their limbs.
they float, they swim. knives twist within their flesh.
they're ball-and-chained by lead, filled with concrete.
butterflies inhabit them. their pipes
are wrong, and clogged. their systems freeze and crash.
invaded, they resist defenses fail.
what they need, they think, is you to flush
it out of them, whatever it is, doc.

the formalists present minutiae,
in alphabetical enjambed iambs--
pentameter's ten digits, five lub-dubs--
from acne, backpain, catarrh, dandruff, eye-
strain, flatfoot, gas pains, hangnail, itchiness,
the jitters, kinks, lethargies, migraines, nose-
bleeds, obstipation, panics, queasy retch-
ings, styes and tremors, ulcers, vertigo,
to wandering womb, xerosis, yaws and zits.

free versers, on the other hand, wax walt
whitmanic their barbaric yawps celebrate and sing
incantatory songs of themselves, songs
of the breath as it wheezes and rales through them,
the short breath and long breath, the breath that is moist or dry,
songs of the blood, the thick- and thinness of it, its heat, its turbulence,
songs of the gut, its rippling coils, the dark burden of its secret indulgences,
songs of the muscled limb, inflamed with toil or the languid thrash of love.

didacticists, of course, will always add
their theories of omission or commission
slept in a draft, got their feet wet, caught a chill,
forgot their overshoes and oversoul,
ate too little roughage, too much ham,
should have pumped less iron or pumped more,
mea culpa, meus morbus they intone,
certain you'll absolve them back to health.

narrativists enshrine a fleeting pain
within an epic of chronology
i woke at six--i'm a morning person-- 
brushed my teeth, ate oatmeal with a pat 
of low-fat margarine, the kind that has 
the dancing turkey on the tub, on sale 
for . at johnnie's, by the time
you tune back in it's afternoon, the pain
has come and gone they're vacuuming the rug,
the doorbell rings, the kettle's whistling,
you try to interrupt--where did you say 
that pain was?--loquacity steamrolls on
through supper, tv, bedtime, dreams, alarm
clock going off at six. try tylenol,
you say, your fingers crossed. call if it's worse. 

then there's the avant garde. the cutting edge.
the text munchausens off the sizzling page.
hypoglossalalia muscles in,
between john cagey silences, the din
and sturm of wild unsound, unsense.
o, there are stranger dysphasias, wernicke,
than are dreamt of in your neurologies,
mutant languages that cacophone
far off the beaten geographic tongue,
where elephants explode and overshoes
fibrillate with longing--el dorado,
shangri-la, eden, heaven, hell--you name it,
it's yours. and that's, of course, the joke. you nod.
you say, i understand. you really don't.


it seems these poets have nothing

 up their ample sleeves

 they turn over so many cards so early,

 telling us before the first line

 whether it is wet or dry,

 night or day, the season the man is standing in,

 even how much he has had to drink.


 maybe it is autumn and he is looking at a sparrow.

 maybe it is snowing on a town with a beautiful name.


 viewing peonies at the temple of good fortune

 on a cloudy afternoon is one of sun tung po's.

 dipping water from the river and simmering tea

 is another one, or just

 on a boat, awake at night.


 and lu yu takes the simple rice cake with

 in a boat on a summer evening

 i heard the cry of a waterbird.

 it was very sad and seemed to be saying

 my woman is cruel--moved, i wrote this poem.


 there is no iron turnstile to push against here

 as with headings like vortex on a string,

 the horn of neurosis, or whatever.

 no confusingly inscribed welcome mat to puzzle over.


 instead, i walk out on a summer morning

 to the sound of birds and a waterfall

 is a beaded curtain brushing over my shoulders.


 and ten days of spring rain have kept me indoors

 is a servant who shows me into the room

 where a poet with a thin beard

 is sitting on a mat with a jug of wine

 whispering something about clouds and cold wind,

 about sickness and the loss of friends.


 how easy he has made it for me to enter here,

 to sit down in a corner,

 cross my legs like his, and listen.


camille corot's painting, stolen from the louvre, may 
it might have always been meant 
 that they walked completely away, 
 this man on horse, woman with basket. 
 with their backs to us and the painter, 
 they are so private. but like those stories 
 where children step right into a picture 
 and, looking over their shoulders, 
 see the consoling frame, 
 these two would know the way home 
 like the palms of their hands, the routine 
 so ordinary it most encloses, 
 no need for thought, only motion 
 and the full sensation of sun 
 on your flesh, along the usual road.


empty cattle trailers 
               rumbled dummy thunder 
down the road all day, and now tonight, 
heat lightning flashes more of the same fake rain. 
it's just as well. i couldn't get to sleep, 
and now it ricochets across the sky 
with empty loads of light. we've had a month 
of drought that tightens dirt around my pond. 
the local wells are dry. but i've retired, 
threw out my wand. i hate this time of year. 
            
               roux can burn if flour 
               sticks in skillet butter. 
i've been cooking up a storm myself, 
my daddy's fil gumbo recipe. 
he used to be a chef on oil rigs 
until the hurricane. i heard the waves 
that killed him, and i hear them every year. 
it's emptiness that fills me. that's my skill. 
i hear the vacant rain before it falls. 
it's like the murmur of a spiraled shell. 
         
               hurricane weather, stewing 
               deep for landfall, spewing 
rain-a-plenty in the gulf and here 
in tennessee they always have a lack 
of something. two men called today for wells. 
i told them both to go to hell, and now 
they think i'm sinful, not to use my skill. 
they stand to lose so much, but don't we all. 
i lost a lot in hurricane camille 
and even now can't hear the end of it. 

               more heat lightning flashes, 
               absent rain that passes 
over clouds, and i can make it out, 
each gurgling current under withered fields, 
down kitchen drains. the neighbors think i'm crazy, 
up all hours, but they'll never know 
the screaming voice inside a breaker's rage 
or how it simmers in my ear. i hate 
the sound of water. give me one good chance 
to make it silent. i'd be right as rain.


those dutiful dogtrots down airport corridors
 while gnawing at a dunkin' donuts cruller,
 those hotel rooms where the tv remote
 waits by the bed like a suicide pistol,
 those hours in the air amid white shirts
 whose wearers sleep-read through thick staid thrillers,
 those breakfast buffets in prairie marriotts--
 such venues of transit grow dearer than home.

 the tricycle in the hall, the wife's hasty kiss,
 the dripping faucet and uncut lawn--this is life?
 no, vita thrives via the road, in the laptop
 whose silky screen shimmers like a dark queen's mirror,
 in the polished shoe that signifies killer intent,
 and in the solitary mission, a bumpy glide
 down through the cloud cover to a single runway
 at whose end a man just like you guards the grail.


lately, the weather aches
 the air is short of breath,
 and morning stumbles in, stiff-jointed.

 day by day, the sun bores the sky,
 until the moon begins
 its some disappearing act,
 making the oceans yawn.

 even the seasons change
 with a throb of weariness--
 bud, bloom, leaf, fall.

 if it would help,
 i would paint my house silver
 or sell it or buy
 a red convertible.

 i would, but who am i
 to try to cheer up
 the self-indulgent universe.


it's the fourth of july, the flags 
are painting the town, 
the plastic forks and knives 
are laid out like a parade. 

and i'm grilling, i've got my apron, 
i've got potato salad, macaroni, relish, 
i've got a hat shaped   
like the state of pennsylvania. 

i ask my father what's his pleasure 
and he says, hot dog, medium rare, 
and then, hamburger, sure,   
what's the big difference,   
as if he's really asking. 

i put on hamburgers and hot dogs,   
slice up the sour pickles and bermudas, 
uncap the condiments. the paper napkins   
are fluttering away like lost messages. 

you're running around, my mother says,   
like a chicken with its head loose. 

ma, i say, you mean cut off, 
loose and cut off   being as far apart   
as, say, son and daughter. 

she gives me a quizzical look as though   
i've been caught in some impropriety. 
i love you and your sister just the same, she says, 
sure, my grandmother pipes in, 
you're both our children, so why worry? 

that's not the point i begin telling them, 
and i'm comparing words to fish now,   
like the ones in the sea at port said,   
or like birds among the date palms by the nile, 
unrepentantly elusive, wild.   

sonia, my father says to my mother, 
what the hell is he talking about? 
he's on a ball, my mother says. 
                                                       
that's roll i say, throwing up my hands, 
as in hot dog, hamburger, dinner roll.... 

and what about roll out the barrels? my mother asks, 
and my father claps his hands, why sure, he says, 
let's have some fun, and launches   
into a polka, twirling my mother   
around and around like the happiest top,   

and my uncle is shaking his head, saying 
you could grow nuts listening to us,   

and i'm thinking of pistachios in the sinai 
burgeoning without end,   
pecans in the south, the jumbled 
flavor of them suddenly in my mouth, 
wordless, confusing, 
crowding out everything else. 




leaf-keep, un-sibyl if the soul
 has the weight of a swallow, what less
 has the weight of a sip? you equal
 this riddle, unposed in your dish
 as a hand at rest in a lap. held to,
 you hold back what can't be
 prevented, what's no more palatable
 for that the unfine formerly, our future.


too sound of mind
the paper table cloth was tastefully bleak, 
 the misty morning light shone on his cheek, 
 and made him look alone and masculine. 

 he talked of seneca and bad translations, 
 of modern critics' lightweight observations 
 a bread crumb rested sweetly on his chin. 

 behind him, through the glass, the ocean's heave 
 uncurled against the sand, beside his sleeve, 
 as eros aimed his toxic javelin. 

 i ducked out of the way, to no avail 
 it glanced my flesh, injecting quite a cocktail 
 that blurred my sight and caused my head to spin-- 

 never mind the coffee we were drinking, 
 whatever i said was not what i was thinking. 
 i wanted to become his mandolin, 

 and lie across his lap, a dainty lute, 
 and sing to him and feed him ripened fruit, 
 while light upon the sea turned opaline. 

 instead, this conversation about art 
 and formal education--god, he's smart 
 such rationality should be a sin. 

 the hour was up, he had to run, of course 
 a handshake and a peck of shy remorse-- 
 outside, the sea was gray and dull as tin 
 it ruled the shore with tedious discipline.


                             i

tomorrow i will start to be happy.
the morning will light up like a celebratory cigar.
sunbeams sprawling on the lawn will set
dew sparkling like a cut-glass tumbler of champagne.
today will end the worst phase of my life.

i will put my shapeless days behind me,
fencing off the past, as a golden rind
of sand parts slipshod sea from solid land.
it is tomorrow i want to look back on, not today.
tomorrow i start to be happy today is almost yesterday.

                             ii

australia, how wise you are to get the day
over and done with first, out of the way. 
you have eaten the fruit of knowledge, while
we are dithering about which main course to choose.
how liberated you must feel, how free from doubt

the rise and fall of stocks, today's closing prices
are revealed to you before our bidding has begun.
australia, you can gather in your accident statistics
like a harvest while our roads still have hours to kill.
when we are in the dark, you have sagely seen the light.

cagily, presumptuously, i dare to write .
a date without character or tone. .
a year without interest rates or mean daily temperature.
its hit songs have yet to be written, its new-year
babies yet to be induced, its truces to be signed. 

much too far off for prophecy, though one hazards
a tentative guess--a so-so year most likely,
vague in retrospect, fizzling out with the usual
end-of-season sales everything slashed
your last chance to salvage something of its style.



you can take it away, as far as i'm concerned--i'd rather spend the afternoon with a nice dog. i'm not kidding. dogs have what a lot of poems lack excitements and responses, a sense of play the ability to impart warmth, elation . . . .                                                                                     howard moss
dogs will also lick your face if you let them.
their bodies will shiver with happiness.
a simple walk in the park is just about
the height of contentment for them, followed
by a bowl of food, a bowl of water,
a place to curl up and sleep. someone
to scratch them where they can't reach
and smooth their foreheads and talk to them.
dogs also have a natural dislike of mailmen
and other bringers of bad news and will
bite them on your behalf. dogs can smell
fear and also love with perfect accuracy.
there is no use pretending with them.
nor do they pretend. if a dog is happy
or sad or nervous or bored or ashamed
or sunk in contemplation, everybody knows it.
they make no secret of themselves.
you can even tell what they're dreaming about
by the way their legs jerk and try to run
on the slippery ground of sleep.
nor are they given to pretentious self-importance.
they don't try to impress you with how serious
or sensitive they are. they just feel everything
full blast. everything is off the charts
with them. more than once i've seen a dog
waiting for its owner outside a caf
practically implode with worry. oh, god,
what if she doesn't come back this time?
what will i do? who will take care of me?
i loved her so much and now she's gone
and i'm tied to a post surrounded by people
who don't look or smell or sound like her at all.
and when she does come, what a flurry
of commotion, what a chorus of yelping
and cooing and leaps straight up into the air
it's almost unbearable, this sudden
fullness after such total loss, to see
the world made whole again by a hand
on the shoulder and a voice like no other.


to strip away this incessant chatter,
 yes, but what lies underneath it?

 death, of course, or our fear of death.
 which is why we talk so much,

 bury our heads in books, turn forests
 into pages and pages into mirrors

 in which we see ourselves appear
 and disappear. when i look up

 from the story i've been reading
 about the jews in nazi germany

 and the silence that closed their
 mouths forever, i see a girl outside

 the cafe smiling in at her father
 who smiles back but cannot hear her.

 she makes all kinds of gestures
 with her hands, mimes herself

 inside an invisible box and breaks
 down laughing. then she gathers

 her breath and blows it against
 the window. it is not snowing

 outside, the leaves have hardly begun
 to turn, the season is merely poised

 for the long descent, but still
 the glass steams up. and in this

 little cloud of warmth that's come
 from deep inside her body, she

 writes a single joyful word, which
 vanishes almost before she finishes.


i wear my heart on my sleeve,
or rather both sleeves, since 
it's usually broken.

sometimes when i join my hands
 to pray, the jagged edges
 briefly touch,

like a plate that fell and cracked
 apart from being asked 
to hold too much.


and what about this boulder, 
knocked off the moutaintop and 
tumbled down a thousand years ago

to lodge against the streambank,
 does it waste itself with worry
 about how things are going

to turn out? does the current
 slicing around it stop itself mid-
stream because it can't get past

all it's left behind back at
the source or up in the clouds
where its waters first fell

to earth? and these trees,
 would they double over and
 clutch themselves or lash out

furiously if they were to discover
 what the other trees really
 thought of them? would the wind

reascend into the sky forever,
like an in-drawn breath,
if it knew it was fated simply

to sweep the earth of windlessness,
 to touch everything and keep
 nothing and be beheld by no one?
 


according to lin yutang,
 both po chuyi and su tungpo
 desperately admired tao yuanming,

 a poet of nature who wrote a single love poem,
 a poem thought by chinese dilettantes to be
 the one blemish in a white jade.

 can a poet be faulted for calling a woman
 carelessly perfect in beauty?
 he chose to long for her by envying

 the candle that glowed upon her
 beautiful face, the shadow
 that followed in her every move.

 yet the nature poet tao yuanming, at home
 with the sudden turning of seasons,
 now feared the shadow in darkness,

 a discarded fan that once stirred her hair,
 feared the candle at dawn. at last believed
 that for beauty he had lived in vain.


is that you can never see the one you're wearing,
 that no one believes the lies they tell,
 that they grow to be more famous than you,
 that you could die in one but you won't be buried in it.

 that we use them to create dogs
 in our own image. that the dogs
 in their mortarboards and baseball caps and veils
 crush our hubris with their unconcern.

 that norma desmond's flirty cocktail hat flung aside
 left a cowlick that doomed her. that two old ladies
 catfighting in hutzler's better dresses both wore flowered
 straw. of my grandmother the amateur hatmaker,

 this legend that the holdup man at the mercantile
 turned to say madam i love your hat before
 he shot the teller dead who'd giggled at her
 homemade velvet roses. o happy tragedy of hats

 that they make us mimic classic gestures,
 inspiring pleasure first, then pity and then fear.
 see how we tip them, hold them prettily against the wind
 or pull them off and mop our sweaty brows

 like our beloved foolish dead in photographs.
 like farmers plowing under the ancient sun.


i sometimes find him in the attic,
lying on his side, contemplating
the insulation. or just staring at

the beams, trying to get the measure
of force and distribution. he
turns up a lot in the garage.

i know he loves me. but if i look
away for an instant, he's off,
and i worry that he won't come back

or when he does he'll have no taste,
gone in for some fad i'll have to bear,
and every move he makes a test.

but usually he's charming,
following me to the cafe
and lying on the awning so carefully

as not to make it sag, only
casting a slight shadow on my table.
of course i act as though i

haven't seen a thing. he only wants,
i think, to do what can't be done.
why just yesterday, for instance,

i found him going through the public trash,
figuring how to fill a bottle
some angry drunk had smashed.


amongst dogs are listeners and singers.
 my big dog sang with me so purely,
 puckering her ruffled lips into an o,
 beginning with small, swallowing sounds
 like coltrane musing, then rising to power
 and resonance, gulping air to continue--
 her passion and sense of flawless form--
 singing not with me, but for the art of dogs.
 we joined in many fine songs--stardust,
 naima, the trout, my rosary, perdido.
 she was a great master and died young,
 leaving me with unrelieved grief,
 her talents known to only a few.

 now i have a small dog who does not sing,
 but listens with discernment, requiring
 skill and spirit in my falsetto voice.
 i sing her name and words of love
 andante, con brio, vivace, adagio. 
 sometimes she is so moved she turns
 to place a paw across her snout,
 closes her eyes, sighing like a girl
 i held and danced with years ago.

 but i am a pretender to dog music.
 the true strains rise only from
 the rich, red chambers of a canine heart,
 these melodies best when the moon is up,
 listeners and singers together or
 apart, beyond friendship and anger,
 far from any human imposter--
 ballads of long nights lifting
 to starlight, songs of bones, turds,
 conquests, hunts, smells, rankings,
 things settled long before our birth.


i passed by the school where i studied as a boy 
 and said in my heart here i learned certain things 
 and didn't learn others. all my life i have loved in vain 
 the things i didn't learn. i am filled with knowledge, 
 i know all about the flowering of the tree of knowledge, 
 the shape of its leaves, the function of its root system, its pests and parasites. 
 i'm an expert on the botany of good and evil, 
 i'm still studying it, i'll go on studying till the day i die. 
 i stood near the school building and looked in. this is the room 
 where we sat and learned. the windows of a classroom always open 
 to the future, but in our innocence we thought it was only landscape 
 we were seeing from the window. 
 the schoolyard was narrow, paved with large stones. 
 i remember the brief tumult of the two of us 
 near the rickety steps, the tumult 
 that was the beginning of a first great love. 
 now it outlives us, as if in a museum, 
 like everything else in jerusalem.


green and brown current of river
 reverberant iron bridge crossing over,
 woman and child fixed at the center,
 holding hands and both weeping

 because her child is weeping because
 his mother weeps because the river, far
 underfoot, glitters through cracks
 in the wooden flooring that widen

 perceptively as he steps.
 ahead, heightened by a hill, dwarfed
 in yellow trees, the house is made ready.
 all should have been primer-perfect,

 including the train rushing headlong
 past the station, always in arrears,
 never deigning to stop and put down
 a stepping-stool. nothing more is given

 except perhaps an assignment of cause
 a plank has fallen away to the river.
 the two figures clasp hands across the gulf,
 rocking back and forth in soundless

 oscillation there on the bridge
 where my mind proposes to leave them
 in place, my mother and me,
 on the first day of school, .


miss a, who graduated six years back,
 has air-expressed me an imposing stack
 of forms in furtherance of her heart's desire
 a ph.d. not wishing to deny her,
 i dredge around for something laudatory
 to say that won't be simply a tall story
 in fact, i search for memories of her,
 and draw a blank--or say, at best a blur.
 was hers the class in that ungodly room
 whose creaking door slammed with a sonic boom,
 whose radiators twangled for the first
 ten minutes, and then hissed, and this was worst
 subsided with a long, regretful sigh?
 yes, there, as every wednesday we would try
 to overlook cacophony and bring
 our wits to bear on some distinguished thing
 some poet sometime wrote, miss a would sit
 calm in a middle row and ponder it.
 blonde, i believe, and quiet so many are.
 a dutiful note-taker. not a star.
 roundheads and cavaliers received their due
 notice from her before the term was through.
 she wrote a paper on . . . could it have been
 milton's idea of original sin?
 or was it deathbed imagery in donne?
 whichever, it was likely not much fun
 for her. it wasn't bad, though i've seen better.
 but i can hardly say that in a letter
 like this one, now refusing to take shape
 even as wispy memories escape
 the reach of certitude. try as i may,
 i cannot render palpable miss a,
 who, with five hundred classmates, left few traces
 when she decamped. those mortarboard-crowned faces,
 multitudes, beaming, ardent to improve
 a world advancing dumbly in its groove,
 crossing the stage that day--to be consigned
 to a cold-storage portion of the mind . . .
 what could be sadder? she remembered me.
 the transcript says i gave miss a a b.

kamo-no-chomei, born at kamo , died at toyama on mount hino, th june   
swirl sleeping in the waterfall 
on motionless pools scum appearing   
                     disappearing 

eaves formal on the zenith,   
lofty city kyoto, 
wealthy, without antiquities 

housebreakers clamber about,   
builders raising floor upon floor   
at the corner sites, replacing   
gardens by bungalows.

a few faces i know remain.

on the twentyseventh may eleven hundred   
and seventyseven, eight p.m., fire broke out   
at the corner of tomi and higuchi streets.   
in a night 
palace, ministries, university, parliament   
were destroyed. as the wind veered 
flames spread out in the shape of an open fan.   
tongues torn by gusts stretched and leapt. 
in the sky clouds of cinders lit red with the blaze. 
some choked, some burned, some barely escaped.   
sixteen great officials lost houses and 
very many poor. a third of the city burned   
several thousands died and of beasts, 
limitless numbers. 

men are fools to invest in real estate. 

three years less three days later a wind 
starting near the outer boulevard 
broke a path a quarter mile across 
to sixth avenue. 
not a house stood. some were felled whole, 
some in splinters some had left 
great beams upright in the ground 
and round about 
lay rooves scattered where the wind flung them. 
flocks of furniture in the air, 
everything flat fluttered like dead leaves. 
a dust like fog or smoke, 
you could hear nothing for the roar, 
                      bufera infernal 
lamed some, wounded some.   
this cyclone turned southwest. 

massacre without cause.   

portent? 

the same year thunderbolted change of capital,   
fixed here, kyoto, for ages. 
nothing compelled the change nor was it an easy matter 
but the grumbling was disproportionate.   
we moved, those with jobs 
or wanting jobs or hangers on of the rest,   
in haste haste fretting to be the first.   
rooftrees overhanging empty rooms   
dismounted floating down the river.   
the soil returned to heath. 

i visited the new site narrow and too uneven, 
cliffs and marshes, deafening shores, perpetual strong winds 
the palace a logcabin dumped amongst the hills   
yet not altogether inelegant. 
there was no flat place for houses, many vacant lots,   
the former capital wrecked, the new a camp, 
and thoughts like clouds changing, frayed by a breath   
peasants bewailing lost land, newcomers aghast at prices.   
no one in uniform the crowds 
resembled demobilized conscripts. 

there were murmurs. time defined them.   
in the winter the decree was rescinded,   
we returned to kyoto 
but the houses were gone and none 
could afford to rebuild them. 

i have heard of a time when kings beneath bark rooves   
watched chimneys. 
when smoke was scarce, taxes were remitted. 

to appreciate present conditions   
collate them with those of antiquity. 

drought, floods, and a dearth. two fruitless autumns.   
empty markets, swarms of beggars. jewels 
sold for a handful of rice. dead stank 
on the curb, lay so thick on 
riverside drive a car couldnt pass. 
the pest bred. 
that winter my fuel was the walls of my own house.

such shocks continued three weeks then lessening,   
but still a score daily as big as an average earthquake   
then fewer, alternate days, a tertian ague of tremors.   
there is no record of any greater. 
it caused a religious revival. 
months ...   
years ...   
........... 
nobody mentions it now. 

this is the unstable world and   
we in it unstable and our houses. 

a poor man living amongst the rich 
gives no rowdy parties, doesnt sing. 
dare he keep his child at home, keep a dog?   
he dare not pity himself above a whimper. 

but he visits, he flatters, he is put in his place,   
he remembers the patch on his trousers.   
his wife and sons despise him for being poor.   
he has no peace. 

if he lives in an alley of rotting frame houses 
he dreads a fire. 
if he commutes he loses his time 
and leaves his house daily to be plundered by gunmen. 
the bureaucrats are avaricious. 
he who has no relatives in the inland revenue,   
poor devil 

whoever helps him enslaves him 
and follows him crying out gratitude   
if he wants success he is wretched.   
if he doesnt he passes for mad. 

where shall i settle, what trade choose   
that the mind may practise, the body rest? 

my grandmother left me a house 
but i was always away 
for my health and because i was alone there. 
when i was thirty i couldnt stand it any longer,   
i built a house to suit myself 
one bamboo room, you would have thought it a cartshed,   
poor shelter from snow or wind. 
it stood on the flood plain. and that quarter 
is also flooded with gangsters. 

one generation 
i saddened myself with idealistic philosophies, 
but before i was fifty 
i perceived there was no time to lose, 
left home and conversation. 
among the cloudy mountains of ohara 
spring and autumn, spring and autumn, spring and autumn,   
emptier than ever. 

the dew evaporates from my sixty years,   
i have built my last house, or hovel,   
a hunter's bivouac, an old 
silkworm's cocoon 
ten feet by ten, seven high and i, 
reckoning it a lodging not a dwelling,   
omitted the usual foundation ceremony. 

i have filled the frames with clay,   
set hinges at the corners 
easy to take it down and carry it away 
when i get bored with this place. 
two barrowloads of junk 
and the cost of a man to shove the barrow,   
no trouble at all. 

since i have trodden hino mountain 
noon has beaten through the awning 
over my bamboo balcony, evening 
shone on amida. 
i have shelved my books above the window, 
lute and mandolin near at hand, 
piled bracken and a little straw for bedding, 
a smooth desk where the light falls, stove for bramblewood.   
i have gathered stones, fitted 
stones for a cistern, laid bamboo 
pipes. no woodstack, 
wood enough in the thicket. 

toyama, snug in the creepers 
toyama, deep in the dense gully, open   
westward whence the dead ride out of eden   
squatting on blue clouds of wistaria. 
its scent drifts west to amida. 

summer? cuckoo's follow, follow--to   
harvest purgatory hill 
fall? the nightgrasshopper will 
shrill fickle life 
snow will thicken on the doorstep, 
melt like a drift of sins. 
no friend to break silence, 
no one will be shocked if i neglect the rite.   
there's a lent of commandments kept   
where there's no way to break them. 

a ripple of white water after a boat,   
shining water after the boats mansami saw   
rowing at daybreak 
at okinoya. 
between the maple leaf and the caneflower   
murmurs the afternoon--po lo-tien   
saying goodbye on the verge of jinyo river.   
i am playing scales on my mandolin. 
be limber, my fingers, i am going to play autumn wind 
to the pines, i am going to play hastening brook 
to the water. i am no player 
but there's nobody listening, 
i do it for my own amusement. 

sixteen and sixty, i and the gamekeeper's boy,   
one zest and equal, chewing tsubana buds,   
one zest and equal, persimmon, pricklypear,   
ears of sweetcorn pilfered from valley farm. 

the view from the summit sky bent over kyoto,   
picnic villages, fushimi and toba 
a very economical way of enjoying yourself.   
thought runs along the crest, climbs sumiyama   
beyond kasatori it visits the great church, 
goes on pilgrimage to ishiyama no need to foot it   
or the graves of poets, of semimaru who said 
                      somehow or other 
                      we scuttle through a lifetime.   
                      somehow or other 
                      neither palace nor straw-hut   
                      is quite satisfactory. 

not emptyhanded, with cherryblossom, with red maple   
as the season gives it to decorate my buddha   
or offer a sprig at a time to chancecomers, home 

a fine moonlit night, 
i sit at the window with a headful of old verses. 

whenever a monkey howls there are tears on my cuff. 

those are fireflies that seem   
the fishermen's lights   
off maki island. 

a shower at dawn   
sings 
like the hillbreeze in the leaves. 

at the pheasant's chirr i recall 
my father and mother uncertainly. 

i rake my ashes. 
                         chattering fire, 
soon kindled, soon burned out,   
fit wife for an old man 

neither closed in one landscape   
nor in one season 
the mind moving in illimitable   
recollection. 

i came here for a month   
five years ago. 
there's moss on the roof. 

and i hear soanso's dead   
back in kyoto. 
i have as much room as i need. 

i know myself and mankind.   
........ 
i dont want to be bothered. 

you will make me editor   
of the imperial anthology?   
i dont want to be bothered. 

you build for your wife, children,   
cousins and cousins' cousins.   
you want a house to entertain in. 

a man like me can have neither servants nor friends   
in the present state of society. 
if i did not build for myself 
for whom should i build? 

friends fancy a rich man's riches,   
friends suck up to a man in high office. 
if you keep straight you will have no friends 
but catgut and blossom in season. 

servants weigh out their devotion 
in proportion to their perquisites   
what do they care for peace and quiet?   
there are more pickings in town. 



for years i tried to conceal from the villagers that i wrote poetry   
i didn't want them to know that i was an oddball 
i didn't want the young men with beards wearing baseball caps who come to the liquor store in their pickups to buy sixpacks to know that i was some kind of sissy 
i decided it was prudent to buy the daily news instead of the times at the drugstore 
i burned my poem drafts at home before i took the trash to the dump, kids scavenge around there and the old man who does the recycling is nosy 
i took every precaution 

but our town is not an easy place to keep secrets, everybody knows everybody and they gossip when they're getting their mail at the post office 
things began to come apart 
a young man with long hair and a city accent showed up and asked in the stores where the poet laughlin lived 
then a pipe burst and the plumber told people that he saw thousands of books stacked in the cellar, some of them in foreign languages 
next day the head of the volunteer fire department came, pretending to check the wiring 
i began to get a bit paranoid the town trooper is supposed to check each rural road once a week but he came up our road past our house three days in succession 
the ax fell when somehow a reporter for the county paper heard the rumors and there was a little item local poet caught speeding twice on , motor vehicles may suspend license 
much has changed in my life now 
nobody has laughed at me in the street i'm over six feet weight  and look pretty fit for my age but they look at me in a funny way 

i don't go to apple house our grocery store anymore because a little girl with her finger in her nose pointed me out to the checkout lady and asked her something now i get my liquor and supplies in the next towns and order honeybaked hams from virginia by mail 

my life is all different now that they know i write poems. 
but if they think they can shame me out of it they're very much mistaken. i'm not breaking any law 
i'll go on with it unless they have me declared a public nuisance and have me sent to the institute 
i've heard there is a poor fellow in the institute who claims he is henry wordsworth longfellow. he'll understand and be my friend we can recite to each other if they won't let us have paper and pencils.


adrift in the liberating, late light
of august, delicate, frivolous,
they make their way to my front porch
and flutter near the glassed-in bulb,
translucent as a thought suddenly
wondered aloud, illumining the air
that's thick with honeysuckle and dusk.
you and i are doing our best
at conversation, keeping it light, steering clear
of what we'd like to say.
you leave, and the night becomes
cluttered with moths, some tattered,
their dumbly curious filaments
startling against my cheek. how quickly,
instinctively, i brush them away.
dazed, they cling to the outer darkness
like pale reminders of ourselves.
others seem to want so desperately
to get inside. months later, i'll find
the woolens, snug in their resting places,
full of missing pieces.


for laure-anne bosselaar and kurt brown
.   retreat 

the sailor dreamt of loss,
but it was i who dreamt the sailor. 
i was landlocked, sea-poor.
the sailor dreamt of a woman
who stared at the sea, then tired 
of it, advertised her freedom.
she said to her friend i want
all the fire one can have
without being consumed by it. 
clearly, i dreamt the woman too. 
i was surrounded by mountains 
suddenly green after a long winter,
a chosen uprootedness, soul shake-up, 
every day a lesson about the vastness 
between ecstasy and repose.
i drank coffee called black forest 
at the local cafe. i took long walks 
and tried to love the earth
and hate its desecrations.
all the golden retrievers wore red 
bandannas on those muttless streets. 
all the birches, i think, were aspens. 
i do not often remember my dreams, 
or dream of dreamers in them. 
to be without some of the things 
you want, a wise man said,
is an indispensable part of happiness.


.   mountain, sky 

i've been paying attention 
to the sky again.
i've seen a ravine up there, 
and a narrow, black gorge.
not to worry, i tell myself, 
about tricks the mind plays,
as long as you know they're tricks.

if the rich are casually cruel 
perhaps it's because
they can stare at the sky 
and never see an indictment 
in the shape of clouds.

the frown, for example, 
in a thunderhead. the fist.

that big mountain 
i've been looking at--
i love how it borrows purple
from the filtered light, 
sometimes red.

like any of us
it's all of its appearances.

it's good that the rich
have to die,
a peasant saying goes,
otherwise they'd live forever.

here in this rented house, 
high up, i understand. 
i'm one of the rich
for a while. the earth feels 
mine and the air i breathe 
is rarefied, if thin.

dusk now is making its last claim. 
i love the confluence
of dark mountain, dark sky.
soon i won't know the beginning 
from the end.


.   him 

those empty celebrations of the half-believer 
along for the ride.
those secret words repeated in mirrors--
someone's personal fog.
a man's heart ransomed for comfort 
or a few extra bucks, his soul in rags.

i have been him and him and him.

was it nobility or senility
when my old grandmother tried to drown 
artificial flowers in the bathtub?

can only saints carry the load 
without talking about the burden?

i want to lean into life, 
catch the faintest perfume.

in every boy child an old man is dying. 
by middle age
he begins to stink, complain.

i want to have gifts for him 
when we finally meet.
i want him to go out like an ancient 
egyptian, surrounded 
by what is his, desiring nothing.


.   delineation at dusk 

a lost hour, and that animal lassitude 
after a vanished afternoon. 
outside joggers, cyclists. 
motion, the great purifier, is theirs.
if this were europe someone in a tower 
might be ringing a bell.
people hearing it would know 
similar truths, might even know 
exactly who they are.
it's getting near drinking time. 
it's getting near getting near 
a person alone conjures rules 
or can liquefy, fall apart.
that woman with the bouffant--
chewing gum, waiting for the bus--
someone thinks she's beautiful. 
it's beautiful someone does. 
the sky's murmuring, the storm 
that calls you up,
makes promises, never comes. 
somewhere else, no doubt,
a happy man slicing a tomato, 
a woman with a measuring cup. 
somewhere else the foreclosure 
of a feeling or a promise,
followed by silence or shouts.
here, the slow dance of contingency, 
an afternoon connected to an evening 
by a slender wish. sometimes absence 
makes the heart grow sluggish
and desire only one person, or one thing. 
i am closing the curtains.
i am helping the night.


.   solitude 

a few days ago i stopped looking
at the photographs
clustered on the wall, nudes,
which had become dull to me,
like a tourist's collection of smooth rocks.

i turned away from the view
and conjured a plague of starlings.
oh how they darkened the landscape.

surely such beauty had been waiting for its elegy. 
i felt like crushing a rhododendron.

now and again i feel the astonishment 
of being alive like this, in this body,
the ventricles and the small bones
in the hand, the intricacies of digestion ....

when the radio said parents in california 
gave birth to another child
so that their older child might have 
a bone-marrow transplant and live,

i found myself weeping
for such complicated beauty. 
how wonderful the radio 
and its distant, human voices.

the rain now is quite without consequence 
coming down.

i suppose i've come to the limits
of my paltry resources, this hankering
for people and for massive disturbance, 
then high pressure,
the sequence that's been promised for days.

i will long to be alone 
when my friends arrive.


.   the body widens 

the body widens, and people are welcomed 
into it, many at a time. this must be
what happens when we learn to be generous 
when we're not in love, or otherwise charmed. 
i've been examining yesterday's ashes. i've visited 
my own candleless altar. little by little, 
the old selfish parts of me are loosening. 
i have a plan for becoming lean to use 
all my fat in service of expansion. have women 
always known this? loveliness and fear 
when they open and let in and give away? 
the mountains here pierce the sky, 
and the sky, bountiful, closes in around them.


.   a new mouth 

give me a new mouth i want to talk.
i've been watching the spider mend its web. 
i think i've learned something
about architecture from a swallow. 
excuse me while i separate the nettles 
from the flowers, while i put my nose 
to the black moist smell of earth
and come up smiling. somewhere in the world 
is the secret name
for god, many-lettered, unpronounceable. 
             there's a speakable grace
in the fields and even in the cities.
the grapes ripen, someone refuses to become 
a machine. and yet i want to talk
about the worn-out husks of men and women 
returning from the factories,
the venereal streets, the bruise history 
passes down to its forlorn children.
    i need a new mouth to acknowledge 
that piety will keep us small, imprisoned, 
that it's all right to be ridiculous
and sway first to the left, then to the right, 
in order to find our balance.
                                  i've been watching
an evening star quiver. i've been trying 
to identify the word before its utterance. 
give me a new mouth and i'll be
a guardian against forgetfulness.
i've noticed the wind doesn't discriminate 
between sycamore and cypress.
i want to find the cool, precise language 
for how passion gives rise to passion.


.   stranger 

the wind gone. i can hear my breathing. 
i can hear the lateness of the hour 
by what isn't moving.

woodrun slope. snowmass village. 
these are winter names, and it's summer. 
the water from the mountains
rushes down man-made gullies.

serious phantoms with their black tears 
are out tonight.
i'm close--my other delusion goes--
to the heart of things.

a young man with a young man's itch 
would rise and go out prowling.

tomorrow i'll choose a mountain 
that's a hill, take the slowest horse 
at the lazy-, slow and old,
sure to know its trail.

i knew a man who said he could dominate 
solitude. in other ways, too, 
he was a fool.

once i wanted to be
one of those fabulous strangers 
who appear and disappear.
now i arrive only by invitation, 
stay long enough to earn my fare.

outside my window, clouds from the west 
erasing the stars.
a coyote howling its singular news.

at whatever pace,
isn't there an imperative to live?

before a person dies he should experience 
the double fire,
of what he wants and shouldn't have.


on a road through the mountains with a friend many years ago

      i came to a curve on a slope where a clear stream 

flowed down flashing across dark rocks through its own

      echoes that could neither be caught nor forgotten 

it was the turning of autumn and already

      the mornings were cold with ragged clouds in the hollows

long after sunrise but the pasture sagging like a roof 

      the glassy water and flickering yellow leaves

in the few poplars and knotted plum trees were held up

      in a handful of sunlight that made the slates on the silent

mill by the stream glisten white above their ruin

      and a few relics of the life before had been arranged

in front of the open mill house to wait

      pale in the daylight out on the open mountain

after whatever they had been made for was over

      the dew was drying on them and there were few who took that road

who might buy one of them and take it away somewhere 

      to be unusual to be the only one

to become unknown a wooden bed stood there on rocks

      a cradle the color of dust a cracked oil jar iron pots 

wooden wheels iron wheels stone wheels the tall box of a clock

      and among them a ring of white stone the size of an 

embrace set into another of the same size

      an iron spike rising from the ring where the wooden

handle had fitted that turned it in its days as a hand mill 

      you could see if you looked closely that the top ring

that turned in the other had been carved long before in the form 

      of a fox lying nose in tail seeming to be

asleep the features worn almost away where it

      had gone around and around grinding grain and salt 

to go into the dark and to go on and remember


        


what i thought i had left i kept finding again

      but when i went looking for what i thought i remembered

as anyone could have foretold it was not there

      when i went away looking for what i had to do 

i found that i was living where i was a stranger

      but when i retraced my steps the familiar vision

turned opaque and all surface and in the wrong places

      and the places where i had been a stranger appeared to me 

to be where i had been at home called by name and answering

      getting ready to go away and going away


        


every time they assembled and he spoke to them

      about waking there was an old man who stood listening 

and left before the others until one day the old man stayed

      and who are you he asked the old man

and the old man answered i am not a man

      many lives ago i stood where you are standing

and they assembled in front of me and i spoke to them 

      about waking until one day one of them asked me

when someone has wakened to what is really there 

      is that person free of the chain of consequences

and i answered yes and with that i turned into a fox

      and i have been a fox for five hundred lives

and now i have come to ask you to say what will 

      free me from the body of a fox please tell me

when someone has wakened to what is really there 

      is that person free of the chain of consequences

and this time the answer was that person sees it as it is 

      then the old man said thank you for waking me

you have set me free of the body of the fox

      which you will find on the other side of the mountain

i ask you to bury it please as one of your own 

      that evening he announced a funeral service

for one of them but they said nobody has died

      then he led them to the other side of the mountain

and a cave where they found a fox's body

      and he told them the story and they buried the fox 

as one of them but later one of them asked

      what if he had given the right answer every time


        


once again i was there and once again i was leaving 

      and again it seemed as though nothing had changed

even while it was all changing but this time

      was a time of ending this time the long marriage was over

the orbits were flying apart it was autumn again 

      sunlight tawny in the fields where the shadows

each day grew longer and the still afternoons

      ripened the distance until the sun went down

across the valley and the full moon rose out of the trees

      it was the time of year when i was born and that evening

i went to see friends for the last time and i came back 

      after midnight along the road white with the moon

i was crossing the bars of shadow and seeing ahead of me 

      the wide silent valley full of silver light

and there just at the corner of the land that i had

      come back to so many times and now was leaving 

at the foot of the wall built of pale stone i saw the body

      stretched in the grass and it was a fox a vixen 

just dead with no sign of how it had come to happen

      no blood the long fur warm in the dewy grass 

nothing broken or lost or torn or unfinished

      i carried her home to bury her in the garden

in the morning of the clear autumn that she had left 

      and to stand afterward in the turning daylight


        


there are the yellow beads of the stonecrops and the twisted flags 

      of dried irises knuckled into the hollows

of moss and rubbly limestone on the waves of the low wall

      the ivy has climbed along them where the weasel ran 

the light has kindled to gold the late leaves of the cherry tree

      over the lane by the house chimney there is the roof 

and the window looking out over the garden

      summer and winter there is the field below the house

there is the broad valley far below them all with the curves 

      of the river a strand of sky threaded through it

and the notes of bells rising out of it faint as smoke

      and there beyond the valley above the rim of the wall

the line of mountains i recognize like a line of writing

      that has come back when i had thought it was forgotten


the lump on his neck that no collar 
could hide, and the charity of his presence   
there in the neighborhood each fall, 
door-to-door, standing in the swept porches,   
waiting for the housewives to answer. 

the ugly, pitiable treeman, reddish and leathery   
from the sun. his baseball cap pulled tight   
over his head, the visor stiff as a beaver's tail. 
year after year, the bowsaw with its wide   
teeth and the long-handled toppers were all 

that announced his trade. and standing on the porch   
he advised nothing, though he coughed and hacked, 
covering his mouth with his sap-blackened fist 
and waited for the infrequent yes that sent him 
up the trunk and into the solid lap of the branches, 

where he clipped and sawed the bony leafless rigging   
until the tree, all torso--lung and heart, ribs   
and hips and shoulders--, stood like a knotted   
goblet in the yard, a figure, as in allegory, 
of his own stunted self, rooted, alive. 

my mother tried hard to convince us we were all   
children of god and that the sick and maimed, the poor,   
were creatures born to special destinies so unique   
we could not understand. but who could understand   
pain's redemptiveness and how it rarely seemed 

to translate into grace. the poor were always poor,   
the sick, sick--just as the treeman's goiter 
did not respond to treatment, inscrutable, part 
of god's plan, part of the unlovely element of love   
the humbling, the pity, the scar of violence-- 

a craving too frightening to name, or too tender, 
the way the treeman bundled the trimmings in twine   
and hauled them to the alley. and as if he counted it 
his real work, leaned against the fence and with his fingers   
picked the dogged sap from the blade and with a file sharpened the teeth.


a gold box of latin words
rests in a dazzling, fanciful field
someone raised to life, lavishing
flowers with untraceable roots, histories
too distant to discern,
upon skin-pale, palm-sized vellum.
 
imagine the one who did this, lost
in dwindling light, a trembling flame
and painstakingly lovely colors
blood red, violet, heavy yellow
and fierce, unnatural green.
framed like a window
 
to the artist's heart, the mother
and child, uncomprehending men
offering what they can the infant
touches a tiny, gold-leaf casket.
all around him the dark, heraldic blue
of angel winds, night sky, her veil.
 
and below him, you can see
the word god printed
over infinitely
careful erasures.


occasionally he wakes, finds
the cool cube of his room
delirious with colors blaring
daffodils and rigid roses,
petals a soft, translucent red
 
like the inside of an eyelid.
by the window, a clock's
expressionless face near glossy skins
of magazines, a telephone
the color of frozen milk
 
or silence, the color of old.
he is melting, his bones
grown paper-light, they travel
over the bed's pale hills, the woman
who's come to wash him.
 
the ceiling is a landscape
bleeding white as he floats
through the muted winter sky,
a boundless symbol of nothing.
the woman draws the blind.


the yellow line could be seen for as long a time
as the highway desired
and if you fell asleep at the wheel
it fulgurated in the dozing soul
like a brutal revelation
that allows you not to feel
in the dream's snapshot
your brain getting smashed
against the milestone or the windshield   
 
it was an ideal line
crowned with horizontal blue
that unwound day after day
like a clothesline
flags and scalps and washed-out roses
our countries our combats our wars
mingling lassitude with involuntary starts
a gymnastic in disorder
that sickened our hearts


as long as you believe in miracles
you watch the sun fall into the sea
every evening
then you turn your back and sink
among the ferns sparkling from a moon or from the other
night up to your knees under the vault of cries.   
 
the pubescent monkeys, the adolescent pumas
contemplate the slender crescent
of the earth
in the eyes of a dead viper
that knots on the asphalt
the alpha of a future alphabet.   
 
it's the end of night the mosquitoes
place themselves on your forehead and die with you
in the ruins of your dreams erected
by the distant suggestions of cities
where you wish to find an empty
bed to die in.   
 
the cathedrals the cinemas the soliloquies
the beggar's ear glued to the violin
music
to be lovesick when the songs
all temple prostitutes all rotgut for two cents
are going to end up in the pink slit of a jukebox.   
 
hope is under the hand that weak flesh
groped massaged turgescent with eyes shut
comes and goes
let's keep knotted kisses to ourselves for a long time
until another day erases
the trace of each passing.


the flowers i planted along my road
have lasted long despite winds and cold
already fiery noons begin to burn
slyly the secret of the roots
and i know that of my footsteps nothing will remain
but a trace a cluster a drop
to recall along the paths i've chosen
those evening when the light sang
in eyes hands hearts and goblets.   
 
i love the sweet harshness on the tongue
filling the palate with a promised saliva
knocking the mute keyboard of the teeth
with raised draperies of which one might say
that memory retains a fleeting trail of them
half-glimpsed we won't know how or else
the loud reminder of the single moment
all gravity banished the unconscious pleasure recaptured
of being nothing but entirely animal.   
 
for our life closed on that iridescent sphere
--color taste perfume at their extreme limits--invokes   
some miracle independent of its origin
produced by distilling air and earth--
like the move toward technological planets
after a calculation made on the fingers of one hand--
time contained flowing--continual autumn
this evening this wine that enters me to make
my head light my tongue loose my cock happy.


adieu near those fields that smoke disembowels                   
                 and that your arm pushes away
for a long time until the inevitable stratum of the                   
                 adieus until the next                               
                             adieu   
 
the door in a cliff has closed. i wanted
daylight to enter here only through the arc-lamp of your eyes
that the limits of this place be defined only
by the carnal walls our bodies erected   
 
opened wider on the recaptured past than the smallest
pocket-watch and its visible trail ever were
your mouth swallowed the hour and my teeth broke on it
when i entered you with kisses   
 
under the full-blown palm of multiple hands
the rose you know, on the ground now,
perfumed the silence and killed our secrets
marking our garden with fear that was no longer fear   
 
adieu    the songs are ended    the years disemboweled
                  and may your body distance itself
for a long time until the ineluctable regret of
                  adieus until forever


the heavy bodies lunge, the broken language   
of fake and drive, glamorous jump shot   
slowed to a stutter. their gestures, in love   
again with the pure geometry of curves, 

rise toward the ball, falter, and fall away.   
on the boards their hands and fingertips   
tremble in tense little prayers of reach   
and balance. then, the grind of bone 

and socket, the caught breath, the sigh,   
the grunt of the body laboring to give   
birth to itself. in their toiling and grand   
sweeps, i wonder, do they still make love 

to their wives, kissing the undersides 
of their wrists, dancing the old soft-shoe   
of desire? and on the long walk home   
from the vfw, do they still sing 

to the drunken moon? stands full, clock   
moving, the one in army fatigues 
and houseshoes says to himself, pick and roll,   
and the phrase sounds musical as ever, 

radio crooning songs of love after the game,   
the girl leaning back in the chevy's front seat   
as her raven hair flames in the shuddering   
light of the outdoor movie, and now he drives, 

gliding toward the net. a glass wand 
of autumn light breaks over the backboard.   
boys rise up in old men, wings begin to sprout 
at their backs. the ball turns in the darkening air. 




now is the time of year when bees are wild 
and eccentric. they fly fast and in cramped 
loop-de-loops, dive-bomb clusters of conversants 
in the bright, late-september out-of-doors. 
i have found their dried husks in my clothes. 

they are dervishes because they are dying, 
one last sting, a warm place to squeeze 
a drop of venom or of honey. 
after the stroke we thought would be her last 
my grandmother came back, reared back and slapped 

a nurse across the face. then she stood up, 
walked outside, and lay down in the snow. 
two years later there is no other way 
to say, we are waiting. she is silent, light 
as an empty hive, and she is breathing.


looking at the photograph is somehow not 
unbearable my friends, two dead, one low 
on t-cells, his white t-shirt an x-ray 
screen for the virus, which i imagine 
as a single, swimming paisley, a sardine 
with serrated fins and a neon spine. 

i'm on a train, thinking about my friends 
and watching two women talk in sign language. 
i feel the energy and heft their talk 
generates, the weight of their words in the air 
the same heft as your presence in this picture, 
boys, the volume of late summer air at the beach. 

did you tea-dance that day? write poems 
in the sunlight? vamp with strangers? there is 
sun under your skin like the gold sula 
found beneath ajax's black. i calibrate 
the weight of your beautiful bones, the weight 
of your elbow, melvin, 

                                  on darrell's brown shoulder.


if i could catch the green lantern of the firefly 
i could see to write you a letter. 



brighter than fireflies upon the uji river 
are your words in the dark, beloved. 



we used to like talking about grief
our journals and letters were packed
with losses, complaints, and sorrows.
even if there was no grief
we wouldn't stop lamenting
as though longing for the charm
of a distressed face.

then we couldn't help expressing grief
so many things descended without warning
labor wasted, loves lost, houses gone,
marriages broken, friends estranged,
ambitions worn away by immediate needs.
words lined up in our throats
for a good whining.
grief seemed like an endless river--
the only immortal flow of life.

after losing a land and then giving up a tongue,
we stopped talking of grief
smiles began to brighten our faces.
we laugh a lot, at our own mess.
things become beautiful,
even hailstones in the strawberry fields.


there's just no accounting for happiness, 
or the way it turns up like a prodigal 
who comes back to the dust at your feet 
having squandered a fortune far away. 

and how can you not forgive? 
you make a feast in honor of what 
was lost, and take from its place the finest 
garment, which you saved for an occasion 
you could not imagine, and you weep night and day 
to know that you were not abandoned, 
that happiness saved its most extreme form 
for you alone. 

no, happiness is the uncle you never 
knew about, who flies a single-engine plane 
onto the grassy landing strip, hitchhikes 
into town, and inquires at every door 
until he finds you asleep midafternoon 
as you so often are during the unmerciful 
hours of your despair. 

it comes to the monk in his cell. 
it comes to the woman sweeping the street 
with a birch broom, to the child 
whose mother has passed out from drink. 
it comes to the lover, to the dog chewing 
a sock, to the pusher, to the basketmaker, 
and to the clerk stacking cans of carrots 
in the night. 
                     it even comes to the boulder 
in the perpetual shade of pine barrens, 
to rain falling on the open sea, 
to the wineglass, weary of holding wine.


 

i cradled my newborn daughter 
and felt the heartbeat   
pull me out of shock.   
she didn't know 
what her hands were 
she folded them. i asked her 
was there a place 
where there was no world. 
she didn't know 
what a voice was her lips   
were the shape of a nipple. 


in the park the child says 
watch me. it will not count 
unless you see. and she shows me 
the cartwheel, the skip, the tumble, 
the tricks performed at leisure in midair,   
each unknown until it is finished. 
at home she orders 
see me eat. i watch her 
curl on herself, sleep 
as i try to leave the dark room 
her dreaming voice commands me watch. 


always we passed the seesaw   
on the way to the swings   
but tonight i remember   
the principle of the lever,   
i sit the child at one end,   
i sit near the center, 
the fulcrum, at once she has power 
to lift me off the earth   
and keep me suspended 
by her tiny weight, she laughing, 
i stunned at the power of the formula.


the last time i saw paul castle
it was printed in gold on the wall
above the showers in the boys'
locker room, next to the school
record for the mile. i don't recall
his time, but the year was 
and i can look across the infield
of memory to see him on the track,
legs flashing, body bending slightly
beyond the pack of runners at his back.

he couldn't spare a word for me,
two years younger, junior varsity,
and hardly worth the waste of breath.
he owned the hallways, a cool blonde
at his side, and aimed his interests
further down the line than we could guess.

now, reading the name again,
i see us standing in the showers,
naked kids beneath his larger,
comprehensive force--the ones who trail
obscurely, in the wake of the swift,
like my shadow on this gleaming wall.


the tortures of lumbago consumed aunt madge, 
and leah vest, once resigned from schoolmarming, 
could not be convinced to leave the house, 
and mrs. mary hogan, after birthing her fifth son, 

lay bedfast for the last fifty-two years of her life, 
reporting shooting pains that would begin 
high in her back and shear downward to the feet, 
as though, she said, she had been glazed in lightning 

and also, men, broken on bridges and mills, 
shell-shocked veterans, religious alcoholics-- 
leldon kilpatrick, johnson suggs, whitey carlyle 
they came and sat there too, leafing through 

yellowing pageants and progressive farmers 
and, one by one, all entered in and talked 
while the good doctor gargled a dark chaff 
in his pipe and took down symptoms, 

annotating them on his hidden chart-- 
numbness, neuralgia, the knotted lymph, 
the clammy palms--and then he'd scratch 
his temple's meaningful patch of white 

and scrawl out his unfailing barbiturate prescription 
to be filled by his pharmacist brother-in-law 
until half the county had gathered as in a lap-- 
the quantum ache, the mutiny in every house. 

how much pain, how many diseases 
consigned to the mythological, the dropped 
ovaries, the torn-up nerves, what women 
said, what men wanted to believe? part of it 

laughable, i know. still i want someone 
to see, now that they lie safe in graves 
beyond the vacant stores, that someone 
listened and, hearing the wrong at the heart, 

named it something that sounded real, whatever 
they lived through and died of. i remember 
mrs. lyle who called it a thorn in the flesh, 
and mr. appleton, who had no roof in his mouth. 



for elisabeth bishop
bix to buxtehude to boulez. 
the little white dog on the victor label 
listens long and hard as he is able. 
it's all in a day's work, whatever plays. 

from judgment, it would seem, he has refrained.   
he even listens earnestly to bloch, 
then builds a church upon our acid rock. 
he's man's--no--he's the leiermann's best friend,   

or would be if hearing and listening were the same.   
does he hear? i fancy he rather smells 
those lemon-gold arpeggios in ravel's 
les jets d'eau du palais de ceux qui s'aiment. 

he ponders the schumann concerto's tall willow hit   
by lightning, and stays put. when he surmises   
through one of bach's eternal boxwood mazes   
the oboe pungent as a bitch in heat, 

or when the calypso decants its raw bay rum 
or the moon in wozzeck reddens ripe for murder,   
he doesn't sneeze or howl just listens harder.   
adamant needles bear down on him from 

whirling of outer space, too black, too near-- 
but he was taught as a puppy not to flinch,   
much less to imitate his bte noire blanche   
who barked, fat foolish creature, at king lear. 

still others fought in the road's filth over jezebel,   
slavered on hearths of horned and pelted barons.   
his forebears lacked, to say the least, forbearance.   
can nature change in him? nothing's impossible. 

the last chord fades. the night is cold and fine. 
his master's voice rasps through the grooves' bare groves.   
obediently, in silence like the grave's 
he sleeps there on the still-warm gramophone 

only to dream he is at the premire of a handel   
opera long thought lost--il cane minore. 
its allegorical subject is his story 
a little dog revolving round a spindle 

gives rise to harmonies beyond belief, 
a cast of stars . . . is there in victor's heart   
no honey for the vanquished? art is art.   
the life it asks of us is a dog's life.


why do we bother with the rest of the day, 

the swale of the afternoon, 

the sudden dip into evening,


then night with his notorious perfumes, 

his many-pointed stars?


this is the best--

throwing off the light covers,

feet on the cold floor,

and buzzing around the house on espresso--


maybe a splash of water on the face, 

a palmful of vitamins--

but mostly buzzing around the house on espresso,


dictionary and atlas open on the rug,

the typewriter waiting for the key of the head, 

a cello on the radio,


and, if necessary, the windows--

trees fifty, a hundred years old 

out there,

heavy clouds on the way

and the lawn steaming like a horse 

in the early morning.




it is easy to imagine heraclitus
walking stone streets witnessing
life in athens with no permanence,
stopping strangers to explain about the river,
being laughed at as they moved
from point a to point b fearing apollo
and hades then at dusk drinking wine, 
waiting for the happy obliteration alcohol brings,
not realizing how lucky they were
to be stupid and so deep
in their bodies even the sun
and moon trading places over and over
meant nothing.


a birdless heaven, sea-dusk and a star
sad in the west
and thou, poor heart, love's image, fond and far,
rememberest

her silent eyes and her soft foam-white brow
and fragrant hair,
falling as in the silence falleth now
dusk from the air.

ah, why wilt thou remember these, or why,
poor heart, repine,
if the sweet love she yielded with a sigh
was never thine?


it is more onerous 
than the rites of beauty 
or housework, harder than love. 
but you expect it of me casually, 
the way you expect the sun 
to come up, not in spite of rain 
or clouds but because of them. 

and so i smile, as if my own fidelity 
to sadness were a hidden vice-- 
that downward tug on my mouth, 
my old suspicion that health 
and love are brief irrelevancies, 
no more than laughter in the warm dark 
strangled at dawn. 

happiness. i try to hoist it 
on my narrow shoulders again-- 
a knapsack heavy with gold coins. 
i stumble around the house,   
bump into things. 
only midas himself 
would understand.


how long will our bewildered heirs
marooned in possessions not theirs
puzzle at disposing of these three
cunning feignings of hard candy in glass--
the striped little pillowlike mock-sweets,
the flared end-twists as of transparent paper?

no clue will be attached, no trace 
of the sunny day of their purchase, 
at a glittering shop a few doors
up from harry's bar, a disappointing place 
for all its testaments from hemingway. 
the grand canal was also aglitter 
while the lesser canals lay in the shade 
like snakes, flicking wet tongues 
and gliding to green rendezvous.

the immaculate salesgirl, in her aloof 
italian succulence, sized us up,
a middle-aged american couple,
as unserious shoppers who,
still half jet-lagged, would cling to their lire 
in the face of any enchanted vase
or ethereal wineglass that might shatter 
in the luggage going home.

yet we wanted something, something small .... 
this? no ... how much is ten thousand? dizzy, 
at last we decided. she wrapped
the three glass candies, the cheapest
items in the shop, with a showy care
worthy of crown jewels--tissue,
tape, and tissue again sprang up
beneath her blood-red fingernails,
plus a jack-in-the-box-shaped paper bag
adorned with harlequin lozenges, sad
though she surely was, on her feet waiting
all day for a wild rich arab, a compulsive japanese.
grazie, signor ... grazie, signora ... ciao. 

nor will our thing-weary heirs decipher 
the little repair, the reattached triangle
of glass from the paper-imitating end-twist, 
its mending a labor of love in the cellar, 
by winter light, by the man of the house, 
mixing transparent epoxy and rigging 
a clever small clamp as if to keep
intact the time that we, alive,
had spent in the feathery bed
at the europa e regina.


at what used to be called idlewild
the line didn't move, though there were not 
many people in it. in a half-hearted light
the lone agent dealt patiently, noiselessly, endlessly 
with a large dazed family ranging
from twin toddlers in strollers to an old lady 
in a bent wheelchair. their baggage
was all in cardboard boxes. the plane was delayed, 
the rumor went through the line. we shrugged, 
in our hopeless overcoats. aviation
had never seemed a very natural idea.

bored children floated with faces drained of blood. 
the girls in the tax-free shops stood frozen 
amid promises of a beautiful life abroad.
louis armstrong sang in some upper corner, 
a trickle of ignored joy.
outside, in an unintelligible darkness
that stretched to include the rubies of strip malls, 
winged behemoths prowled looking for the gates 
where they could bury their koala-bear noses 
and suck our dimming dynamos dry.

boys in floppy sweatshirts and backward hats 
slapped their feet ostentatiously
while security attendants giggled
and the voice of a misplaced angel melodiously 
parroted faa regulations. women in saris
and kimonos dragged, as their penance, behind them
toddlers clutching occidental teddy bears, 
and chair legs screeched in the food court 
while ill-paid wraiths mopped circles of night 
into the motionless floor.


as if because you lay 
deeply embarrassing inside 
my body, i could inconceivable 
follow your swift thoughts into their blue   
immersion even now, 
stilettoes flickering, or schools of fish 
maneuvering, first clear and then occluded, 
though now and then a piercing gleam cuts through 

as if the snow reflections that glaze   
the winter afternoon to porcelain 
could penetrate the secrets of a skull 
that happens to have lodged improbable 
inside me once. your liberation 
twelve years ago today is the occasion   
you and your friends are celebrating now   
behind a door that's firmly shut. 

the fantasy you've lately been devouring   
features an evil mage with hourglass eyes.   
last week, when you were furious at me 
i must have thrown some precious thing away,   
you swiftly slipped into your parents' room   
and turned the bedside clock an hour ahead.   
discovered as the culprit, wickedly 
you smiled. you knew time was my enemy.


those twenty-six letters filling the blackboard   
compose the dark, compose 
the illiterate summer sky & its stars as they appear   

one by one, above the schoolyard. 

if the soul had a written history, nothing would have happened   
a bird would still be riding the back of a horse,   

and the horse would go on grazing in a field, & the gleaners, 

at one with the land, the wind, the sun examining   
their faces, would go on working, 

each moment forgotten in the swipe of a scythe.   

but the walls of the labyrinth have already acquired   
their rose tint from the blood of slaves 
crushed into the stone used to build them, & the windows   

of stained glass are held in place by the shriek   

and sighing body of a falling chimneysweep through 
the baked & blackened air. this ash was once a village,   

that snowflake, time itself. 

but until the day it is permitted to curl up in a doorway,   
and try to sleep, the snow falling just beyond it,   

there's nothing for it to do 

the soul rests its head in its hands & stares out 
from its desk at the trash-littered schoolyard, 

it stays where it was left. 
when the window fills with pain, the soul bears witness,   
but it doesn't write. nor does it write home 

having no need to, having no home.   
in this way, & in no other 

was the soul gradually replaced by the tens of thousands   
of things meant to represent it-- 

all of which proclaimed, or else lamented, its absence. 

until, in the drone of auditoriums & lecture halls, it became   
no more than the scraping of a branch   
against the side of a house, no more than the wincing 

of a patient on a couch, or the pinched, nasal tenor   
of the strung-out addict's voice, 

while this sound of scratching, this tapping all night,   
enlarging the quiet instead of making a music within it, 

is just a way of joining one thing to another, 

myself to whoever it is--sitting there in the schoolroom, 

sitting there while also being led through the schoolyard   
where prisoners are exercising in the cold light-- 

a way of joining or trying to join one thing to another,   
so that the stillness of the clouds & the sky 

opening beneath the blindfold of the prisoner, & the cop   
who leads him toward it, toward the blank 

sail of the sky at the end of the world, are bewildered 

so that everything, in this moment, bewilders 

them the odd gentleness each feels in the hand 
of the other, & how they don't stop walking, not now 

not for anything. 



here, where god lives among the trees,
   where birds and monks the whole day sing
his praises in a pleasant ease,

o heart, might we not find a home
   here, after all our wandering?
these gates are closed, even on rome.

souls of the twilight wander here  
   here, in the garden of that death
which was for love's sake, need we fear

how sharp with bitter joy might be
   love's lingering, last, longed-for breath,
shut in upon eternity?


 

the brightly-painted horse 
had a boy's face, 
and four small wheels 
under his feet, 

plus a long string 
to pull him by this way and that 
across the floor, 
should you care to. 

a string in-waiting 
that slipped away 
in many wiles 
from each and every try. 


                       

knock and they'll answer, 
mother told me. 

so i climbed four flights of stairs 
and went in unannounced. 

and found a small wooden toy 
for the taking 

in the ensuing emptiness 
and the fading daylight 

that still gives me a shudder 
as if i held the key to mysteries in my hand. 


                       

where's the lost and found department, 
and the quiet entry, 
the undeveloped film 
of the few clear moments 
of our blurred lives? 

where's the drop of blood 
and the teeny nail 
that pricked my finger 
as i bent down to touch the toy 

and caught its eye? 


                       

evening light, 

make me a sunday 
go-to meeting shadow 
for my toy. 

my dearest memories are 
steep stair-wells 
in dusty buildings 
on dead-end streets, 

where i talk to the walls 
and closed doors 
as if they understood me. 


                       

the wooden toy sitting pretty. 

no, quieter than that. 

like the sound of eyebrows 
raised by a villain 
in a silent movie. 

psst, someone said behind my back.


back when the earth was new 
and heaven just a whisper, 
back when the names of things 
hadn't had time to stick 

back when the smallest breezes 
melted summer into autumn, 
when all the poplars quivered 
sweetly in rank and file . . . 

the world called, and i answered. 
each glance ignited to a gaze. 
i caught my breath and called that life, 
swooned between spoonfuls of lemon sorbet. 

i was pirouette and flourish, 
i was filigree and flame. 
how could i count my blessings 
when i didn't know their names? 

back when everything was still to come, 
luck leaked out everywhere. 
i gave my promise to the world, 
and the world followed me here.

the afterlife
 

spring, and the first full crop of dandelions gone
to smoke, the lawn lumpish with goldfinches,
hunched in their fluffs, fattened by seed,
alight in the wind-bared peduncular forest.
little bells, they loop and dive, bend
the delicate birch branches down.
i would enter the sky through the soil
myself, sing up the snail bowers
and go on the lam with the roots.
licked by filaments, i would lie,
a billion love-mouths to suckle and feed.

where the river will be next week,
a puddle two trout go savagely dying in.
notice the bland, darwinian sand bone wrack
and tree skin, the ground down moon bowls
of mussels, viral stones dividing like mold.
at twelve, i buried the frog because it was dead
and dug it up because i'd been dreaming--
a fish belly light, a lowly chirruped chorus
of amens. i thought my nights might smell of hell.

bland, hum-drum, quotidian guilt--
if i've killed one frog, i've killed two.
saint rot and the sacraments of maggots
knowing is humus and sustenance is sex.
it accrues and accrues, it stews
tumorous with delight. tomorrow's
a shovelful, the spit of the cosmos, one day
the baby's breath is no longer a rose.



 it's not that i harbor a weeping willow
shadow's worth of longing for those cloaked
 turns and straight-aways, or that swampy
south mississippi was ever half as tragic
 as i dreamed it could be, but that i still cruise
from time to time in the dope-ripe
 ford fairlane of the mind where nothing
has changed, where we remain hopelessly
 stoned devotees of the town of leakesville 
emblazoned upon the graffitied water tower's
 testimonies to love. we believed speed
would save us, would take us fast
 and far away from the junkyard wrecks
stacked in their mile-long convoy to nowhere.
 and though losing the way should
have seemed the worst of divine betrayals,
 we took it as a minor fall from grace,
tail-spun over the embankment rail, rocking
 that flung steel body down as if to play
a bar-chord on the barbed-wire fence.
 i'll never know what angelic overseer
was bored and on duty that night, but we
 rose up and climbed out of the warped last
breath of that car, no one with so much
 as a scratch on his head, not a drop
of beer spilt, and the radiator hissing
 like a teapot in hell when someone yelled
she's gonna blow and each of us standing
 there, starving for something more,
something other than the black wheel
 spinning that sudden dark, cricketed quiet.


a car is idling on the cliff. 
its top is down. its headlights throw 
a faint, bright ghost-shadow glow 
on the pale air. on the shore, so far 
below that the waves' push and drag 
is dwindled to a hush--a kind 
of oceanic idle--the sea 
among the boulders plays a blind- 
fold game of hide and seek, 
or capture the flag. the flag 
swells and sways. the car 
is empty. a friday, the first week 
of june. nineteen fifty-three. 

a car's idling on the cliff, 
but surely it won't be long before 
somebody stops to investigate 
and things begin to happen fast 
men, troops of men will come, 
arrive with blazing lights, a blast 
of sirens, followed by still more 
men. though not a soul's in sight, 
the peace of the end of the late 
afternoon--the sun down, but enough light 
even so to bathe the heavens from 
horizon to shore in a deep 
and delicate blue--will not keep. 

confronted with such an overload 
of questions most beginning, why would she... 
so gifted, bright, and only twenty-three, 
attention will come to fix upon 
this odd last thing she did leaving 
the car running, the headlights on. 
she stopped--it will transpire--to fill 
the tank a mere two miles down the road. 
just sixteen, the kid at the station will 
quote her as saying, what a pity 
you have to work today it's not right... 
what weather goodness, what a night 
it'll be he'll add she sure was pretty. 

was there a change of plan? 
why the stop for gas? possibly 
she'd not yet made up her mind? or 
had made it up but not yet settled 
on a place? or could it be she knew 
where she was headed, what she would do-- 
and wanted to make sure the car ran 
for hours afterward? might the car not be, 
then, a sort of beacon, a lighthouse- 
in-reverse, meant to direct one not 
away from but toward the shore 
and its broken boulders, there to spot 
the bobbing white flag of a blouse? 

her brief note, which will appear 
in the local leader, contains a phrase 
she chanted snatches of old lands 
that will muddle the town for three days, 
until a professor e. h. wade 
pins it to ophelia--and reprimands 
the police, who, this but goes to show, 
have not the barest knowledge of shakespeare, 
else would never have misread lauds 
as lands. a detective gregg messing 
will answer, tersely, afraid 
it's not our bailiwick. missing 
persons, yes missing poems, no. 

what's truly tragic's never allowed 
to stand alone for long, of course. 
at each moment there's a crowd 
of clowns pressing in the booming ass 
at every wake who, angling a loud 
necktie in the chip dip, 
airs his problems with intestinal gas, 
or the blow-dried bonehead out to sell 
siding to the grieving mother . . . . well, 
wade sent the leader another briefword 
decades of service to the bard now force 
me to amend the girl's little slip. 
'chaunted' not 'chanted' is the preferred . . . 

yet none of her unshakeable entourage 
--pedants, pundits, cops without a clue, 
and a yearning young grease-monkey--are 
alerted yet. still the empty car 
idles, idles on the cliff, and night 
isn't falling so much as day 
is floating out to sea . . . . soon, whether 
she's found or not, her lights will draw 
moths and tiny dark-winged things that might 
be dirt-clumps, ashes. come what may, 
the night will be lovely, as she foresaw, 
the first stars easing through the blue, 
engine and ocean breathing together. 




                 the trees are mended.
a shy man seeks perfection in his art
 across vast acres, color and shape of tidiness,
 iowa's unruly grass submits, blade by blade.
 the blue of mother's dishes tints the sky.

across vast acres, color and shape of tidiness,
 sloping rows and rectangles piece a new land.
 the blue of mother's dishes tints the sky.
 like a black quilt tied with loops of green, 

sloping rows and rectangles piece the new land.
 the reassuring fields of corn unfold
 like black quilts tied with loops of green.
 under the artist's alchemy, 

the reassuring fields of corn unfold.
 sweet clouds hover like the hands of god.
 under the artist's alchemy,
 even winter's leaden skies grow bright. 

sweet clouds hover like the hands of god
 as the thirties' skylines and bread lines disappear.
 even winter's leaden skies grow bright.
 a yellow hill rises, like the belly of a woman ripe with child, 

as the skylines and bread lines disappear.
 iowa's unruly grass submits, blade by blade,
 a yellow hill rises--
 and the shy man finds perfection in his art.


i can't keep my eyes off the poet's 
wife's legs--they're so much more 
beautiful than anything he might 
be saying, though i'm no longer 
in a position really to judge, 
having stopped listening some time ago. 
he's from the iowa writers workshop 
and can therefore get along fine 
without my attention. he started in 
reading poems about his childhood-- 
barns, cornsnakes, gradeschool, flowers, 
that sort of stuff--the loss of 
innocence he keeps talking about 
between poems, which i can relate to, 
especially under these circumstances. 
now he's on to science, a poem 
about hydrogen, i think, he's trying 
to imagine himself turning into hydrogen. 
maybe he'll succeed. i'm imagining 
myself sliding up his wife's fluid, 
rhythmic, lusciously curved, black- 
stockinged legs, imagining them arched 
around my shoulders, wrapped around my back. 
my god, why doesn't he write poems about her 
he will, no doubt, once she leaves him, 
leaves him for another poet, perhaps, 
the observant, uninnocent one, who knows 
a poem when it sits down in a room with him. 



ginsberg, ginsberg, burning bright,   
taunter of the ultra right,   
what blink of the buddha's eye   
chose the day for you to die? 

queer pied piper, howling wild, 
mantra-minded flower child,   
queen of maytime, misrule's lord   
bawling, drop out all aboard 

finger-cymbaled, chanting om, 
foe of fascist, bane of bomb, 
proper poets' thorn-in-side, 
turner of a whole time's tide, 

who can fill your sloppy shoes? 
what a catch for death. we lose 
glee and sweetness, freaky light, 
ginsberg, ginsberg, burning bright.


can you imagine the air filled with smoke?
 it was. the city was vanishing before noon
 or was it earlier than that? i can't say because
 the light came from nowhere and went nowhere. 

this was years ago, before you were born, before
 your parents met in a bus station downtown.
 she'd come on friday after work all the way
 from toledo, and he'd dressed in his only suit. 

back then we called this a date, some times
 a blind date, though they'd written back and forth
 for weeks. what actually took place is now lost.
 it's become part of the mythology of a family, 

the stories told by children around the dinner table.
 no, they aren't dead, they're just treated that way,
 as objects turned one way and then another
 to catch the light, the light overflowing with smoke. 

go back to the beginning, you insist. why
 is the air filled with smoke? simple. we had work.
 work was something that thrived on fire, that without
 fire couldn't catch its breath or hang on for life. 

we came out into the morning air, bernie, stash,
 williams, and i, it was late march, a new war
 was starting up in asia or closer to home,
 one that meant to kill us, but for a moment 

the air held still in the gray poplars and elms
 undoing their branches. i understood the moon
 for the very first time, why it came and went, why
 it wasn't there that day to greet the four of us. 

before the bus came a small black bird settled
 on the curb, fearless or hurt, and turned its beak up
 as though questioning the day. a baby crow,
 someone said. your father knelt down on the wet cement, 

his lunchbox balanced on one knee and stared quietly
 for a long time. a grackle far from home, he said.
 one of the four of us mentioned tenderness,
 a word i wasn't used to, so it wasn't me. 

the bus must have arrived. i'm not there today.
 the windows were soiled. we swayed this way and that
 over the railroad tracks, across woodward avenue,
 heading west, just like the sun, hidden in smoke.


this afternoon the park is filled with brides. 
among varieties of persuasion the big trees turn back toward the forest. 
adventurers gather in side streets. 
the police are looking hard at the sky. 
down at the bay, boys trapped in solitude fish. 
girls hike their pants and stare at the wave line, 
remembering secrets they once held dear. 
the day offers a ridiculous variation as 
an excuse for not coming in on time. 
wild imaginings take the place of religion. 
someone who can't swim offers to cook. 
we've devised a means for the obstinate children 
to be fed, she says, but no one understands this. 
we crave affection, but give only advice. 
there are walls topped with broken bicycles. 
someone makes an obscene offer and this 
is the best we get all day. oh don't give in 
so easily she says, handing over the keys. 
we climb the blue fire escape. 
we would like to keep going, 
skyline climbers, old men remembering their childhood 
who devise a few illegal experiences no one wants to try. 
it gets to be more than the officers can take. 
the park is dusty, dark, yet the children, 
ignored all day, play on, convinced their dedication 
releases a magic that changes everything.


waiting for your ride in front of the house 
where you spent the night,
where, as a third ear
during their endless intimate,
important, and kinky phone calls,
you pretended to rinse glassware
you were a dog from the pound,
grateful, sniffing the upholstery.

later, lying in the center of their 
king-sized bed, a giant wall-to-wall 
mirror, isolating you like a rabbit 
it was also their exercise
room with torture equipment
something in you twitched 
flickering a bizarre video in your head.

it's morning now. you're standing
outside, with nightgown and toothbrush 
wrapped in your purse, waiting for a bus
to take you somewhere else. you're depressed. 
they're asleep of course. their network wrapped 
around them. you keep wondering why you're 
missing something. then you look back and see 
your pricked-up ears, your waggy self, stuck 
inside their picture window, where for years
it will wave at you--naive, apologetic, embarrassed.




in  the morning probably seemed harmless enough to sign on the dotted line as the insurance man talked to my parents for over an hour around a coffee table about our future. this roof wasn't designed to withstand meteors he told my father, who back then had a brush haircut that made his ears stick out, his moods still full of passion, still willing to listen, my mother with her beehive hairdo, smiling back at him, all three of them wanting so much to make the fine print of the world work. they laughed and smoked, and after they led the man politely to the door, my parents returned to the living room and danced in the afternoon light, the phonograph playing frank sinatra, the green buick's payments up to date, five-hundred dollars safely in the bank-- later that evening, his infallible common sense ready to protect us from a burst pipe or dry rot, my father waded up to his ankles in water, a v of sweat on the back of his shirt. something loomed deeper than any basement on our block, larger than he was, a fear he could not admit was unsolvable with a monkey wrench or a handshake and a little money down.


i get into bed with it, and spring 
the scarab legs of its locks. inside, 
the stacked, shy wealth of his print-- 
he could not write in script, so the pages 
are sturdy with the beamwork of printedness, 
went to look at a car, dad 
in a good mood at dinner, went 
to try out some new tennis racquets, 
lunch with mom, life of ease-- 
except when he spun his father's desoto on the 
ice, and a young tree whirled up to the 
hood, throwing up her arms--until 
lois. played tennis, with lois, 
lunch with mom and lois, lois 
liked the car, driving with lois, 
long drive with lois. and then, 
lois i can't believe it she is so 
good, so sweet, so generous, i have 
never, what have i ever done 
to deserve such a girl? between the dark 
legs of the capitals, moonlight, soft 
tines of the printed letter gentled 
apart, nectar drawn from serif, the 
self of the grown boy pouring 
out, the heart's charge, the fresh 
man kneeling in pine-needle weave, 
worshipping her. it was my father 
good, it was my father grateful, 
it was my father dead, who had left me 
these small structures of his young brain-- 
he wanted me to know him, he wanted 
someone to know him.


the two of them stood in the middle water,
 the current slipping away, quick and cold,
 the sun slow at his zenith, sweating gold,
 once, in some sullen summer of father and daughter.
 maybe he regretted he had brought her--
 she'd rather have been elsewhere, her look told--
 perhaps a year ago, but now too old.
 still, she remembered lessons he had taught her
 to cast towards shadows, where the sunlight fails
 and fishes shelter in the undergrowth.
 and when the unseen strikes, how all else pales
 beside the bright-dark struggle, the rainbow wroth,
 life and death weighed in the shining scales,
 the invisible line pulled taut that links them both.


bing crosby died in spain
 while playing golf with franco
 but who could care less, and at this
 writing only a few of
 my dear ones are gone--ah i
 could make a sad list--the swifts,
 as if to prove a point,
 fly into the light and make
 a mockery out of our darkness.
 they scream for food but in
 the world of shadows they only
 make a quick motion i have
 studied them--the whiter
 the wall is--the barer the bulb--
 the more they scream, the more
 they dip down. i have made
 my two hands into a shape
 and i have darkened the wall
 to see what it looks like--i have
 shortened my two broken fingers
 to make the small tail and twisted
 the knuckles sideways so when
 they come in to eat one shadow
 overtakes the other, that way
 i can live in the darkness
 with franco's poisonous head
 and crosby's ears, who fainted,
 a thousand to one, behind a
 number two club, though no swift
 died for him, well, for them,
 digging for clubs. i watch the
 birds every night they fly
 in a great circle, much larger
 than what i can see, their dipping
 is what i dreaded in front of
 my plain white wall--i say it
 for the nine hundred americans
 who died in spain. i thought
 i'd have to wait forever
 to do them a tiny justice
 and listen to their songs
 and die a little from the foolhardy
 mournful words, flying down
 one air current or another
 and doing the sides of buildings
 and tops of trees, the low-lying
 straggling dogwood, the full-bodied
 huge red maple, my dear ones.


blizzard to lilac. dandelion
to leaf. endless
variation of seasons i note

in passing, smells
i cannot smell rotting
gardens, feces, musk of cat. 
                                              these two       

run in front of me, golden
shoulder to patchwork, heads
lifted or lowered into

scent, tongues lolling. ears
damp with their own
spittle and each other's

tell me, tethered a pace behind,
their journey's epic tipping
forward to the familiar or
stranger's distant yap angling

to my breathing, whispered
praise, my slightest
suggestion.

                                              ignored. 
                                                          the shepherd 
throws herself into

any whirring wheel, to herd
the neighbor's tractor mower or
the ups truck's packets
home pulling her back,

the golden's oblivious
ballast, instinct heading
always for the gutter's

deepest puddle, her own way
within the forked leash's
one-foot range. as we pass,

the clans set up
their barking, as if we
were news, gathering center

of a congenial warning
din--mine answer with
disturbances of pace, an extra pull
or lollop, grins thrown

slant-eyed over shoulders
until one hears a call
she can't ignore, surrenders

to baying's ferocious
joy moving through
muscle and bone. moving
storm, storm's eye happy

universes whirl in their skins
as i do in mine. unknowable,
their fate. mediums between
foreign principalities, they're tied

to me, to each other, by my will,
by love to that other realm
by song, and tooth, and blood.


they say you can jinx a poem 
if you talk about it before it is done. 
if you let it out too early, they warn, 
your poem will fly away, 
and this time they are absolutely right. 

take the night i mentioned to you 
i wanted to write about the madmen, 
as the newspapers so blithely call them, 
who attack art, not in reviews, 
but with breadknives and hammers 
in the quiet museums of prague and amsterdam. 

   actually, they are the real artists, 
you said, spinning the ice in your glass. 
the screwdriver is their brush. 
the real vandals are the restorers, 
you went on, slowly turning me upside-down, 
the ones in the white doctor's smocks 
who close the wound in the landscape, 
and thus ruin the true art of the mad. 

i watched my poem fly down to the front 
of the bar and hover there 
until the next customer walked in-- 
then i watched it fly out the open door into the night 
and sail away, i could only imagine, 
over the dark tenements of the city. 

all i had wished to say 
was that art was also short, 
as a razor can teach with a slash or two, 
that it only seems long compared to life, 
but that night, i drove home alone 
with nothing swinging in the cage of my heart 
except the faint hope that i might 
catch a glimpse of the thing 
in the fan of my headlights, 
maybe perched on a road sign or a street lamp, 
poor unwritten bird, its wings folded, 
staring down at me with tiny illuminated eyes.


i plan to be the world authority on peafowl. believe i'll be offered a chair someday at the chicken college. --flannery o'connor
certainly are nice
to want to give me that dog.
i raise peacocks--

you can't keep dogs
and them on the same place.
people come here

have to leave the dog in the car else the peachickens take to the trees

with nervous prostrations.
i have twenty-seven. place
sounds like a jungle

at night. they yell
and scream at the least
atmospheric disturbance

or mechanical noise.
sitting on the back steps, i spend
days studying how

they could decorate
the lawn to advantage. they prefer
to sit on the tractors,

the top of the chicken
house or garbage can lid. i adjust
to their taste, which

is anti-dog. thanks

a poem that turns on his first finding neruda's one year walk
he said it lit up the night like a perfect crime, so i left everything--

pairs of headlights coming towards me, Bright Eyes

street lights like lollipops

— Henri Rousseau
Aglitter in the dromedary dawn 
 with cold rubles, the old cyclone 
 boasts come what come may, sir. 
 Like a silly curlicue, for instance, 
 that you called August. It too had 
 a way, prescient and plunderable, 
 a mix of corsage and assemblage, 
 or coconut if you can imagine it.
A wax cylinder in the wind was 
 carrying us chevalierly through 
 the alphabets of petite longings, 
 our gumption of restless itching. 
 If we stop here it’s because here 
 it’s thick dusk. Streaming ribbons 
 from the sun, yellow fields of sky 
 matriculating without thinking.
Slowly, the aperture goes bronze 
 squinting in the marble harbor, 
 guffawing, crocheting a speech. 
 The morning buildings are air 
 sugared with stiff upper lip. 
 Clipped romance butters our 
 pockets with comic-book accents, 
 pocked lingo and perfumed lint.
Yesterday, the dazzlement washed us 
 away like laundry boats bedraggled
      toward a ventilated hexagon of sea, 
 its coils and plungers, its plumber’s tape
      amid lulling processions of joggers.
     One spring patio is for rodeos 
 niggled with iodine figures, weaved
      tapestries inside bat tulieries. 
 But that reminds me, how exactly 
      do words form brittle histories —
     rummaging a basement heap, a guttural 
 section, suppose, or an anatomical plane,
      a slice of what should be and has been said 
 but wasn’t, like some yogurty radio static
      giving way assuredly to sweet hosannas.
     We bench-press archways with our eyes 
 recalling a time when we actually had eyes. 
 Yes, that was eons ago, gazing inside at TV
      bunkers as Shock-&-Awe hunkered down
     for supper, a roseate ghostly assembly line 
 producing but bruise. I could use a good one c
 ome to think of it. And nickeled-and-dimed,
      halter-top waters rise. Ferries a-glint with
     restaurant dementias. Some happenstance 
 meant to be talked about. We’ll have to let be, 
 with addled doo-wop and haughty pince-nez.
      Alone here in the river walk you buoy it all.
You, walking stick, are emptier in a crowd, 
                though not as empty as one.
 Amateur, I’m watching your surveys shrug 
                to the ground, dear and ruthless. The
fiesta has begun. And waffling in the breeze, 
                this is the time to reprogram
 an ideogram or two, flinging pants off 
                for stoic sleepiness.
Dreams have the following architecture: 
                metallic substance, pursuant laws
 of mineralness. Vague plunder of booty, 
                plastic robe of pearls. Sesame
pirates of our wonderfully dull childhood 
                where a perverted man
 usurps your surname and wanders the lawn, 
                sprinkling reindeer tears.
Just as to love is to doze, so what I crave 
                is to nose about. I, however,
 in 17th-century fashion, stare at your chaps 
                of frolicking gold, apparel
that includes a spigot, which cargoes some 
                mumbling grudge in its hull
 quarters to Tribeca. There we can arrange 
                a spotted coordinate for the Star,
the strait pass that was kindred, mortal. Now 
                resume the pose. Walk, rub, walk.
It only takes a brochure in your palms to let me see 
      native Indias and corpulent Africas open gently 
 your cornet wrists, your marigold-clumped brow.
People should be able to account for something in 
      what they desire or they roam fore’er, secluded
 under western bandanas. This leads to reclusiveness.
Extreme passivity, puss ocher and the like. General 
      spiels of uneasiness. I should know, happening to be
 one myself, a curmudgeon crayfish like the Fantômas.
A board was laid out. It had your legs on it, suspended 
      scissor-like. A mode I knew from albums. Speaking
 of which, one bum was overheard saying to the other,
“I like your bum.” Quite moving mumbo-jumbo really. 
      One door slices us to the next, the tunnels funnel us
 into faraway space with pristine shops. You snicker to
friends across absolute distance. They always ask 
      me the fable of my life, the accurate one, replete
 with liquid bones to pick at or throw as testimony.
I prefer sassafras to crème brûlée on any given day. 
      Brutal and cunning, but unknown, I love cyclists.
 So a cloud curtailed me. And I awoke horizon.
The result 
 of such 
 expressiveness cannot 
 be denied. 
 Especially honey, 
 figures of 
 rain buttressing 
 cheeks with
small change — 
 contingencies due — 
 and this 
 mosaic: a 
 Giotto chapel 
 we’ll name 
 our stone-braced 
 embodiment. Neither
reconditioning nor 
 resurrection needed 
 to become 
 The Possible.
 You once 
 told me, 
 first giving 
 up. Give
up what? 
 A stripper 
 made in 
 toothy encaustic. 
 Boring. We 
 were literally 
 boring holes 
 in spy
stations. 
 Calling this all 
 a pipe-dream, 
 a.k.a. Yourself, 
 a something
 for our 
 lips, sandwiched 
 in stares
stuck in 
 Porta-johns. This 
 kind of 
 looking isn’t 
 seeing. This 
 kind of 
 consumption ’tis 
 blindness. An
igloo rug — 
 it’s not 
 enough to 
 be relative 
 to example 
 and talk 
 art for
 the dear
and near 
 to us, 
 picking up 
 the phone 
 one day 
 saying clearly 
 but only
                                  “And?”
I take refuge in each skittery movement and moment 
      I’m given when not forced to dwell on a monument.
 Iron’s the last bastion afforded to a materialist state. 
      Next to gentle gardens, for a bit, we argued. Polluted
scales were a kind of resolution to wrestle us from 
      ourselves, though I kept noticing the way our lips
 pinched themselves accidentally, the vanity roped 
      around its waist, delicate and burnt, as if dread
had come into the room with a waltz on our breath. 
      At such gestured pace, you induce a sigh. Yes, you
 ignorant child, those fireworks were yours. And this 
      time they were. Pyrotechnics fade. Experiments not
talked about until today in the skyrise of cabinets 
      and windows of papers flustered from sunlight
 rise like a Goth girl costumed in hardened beeswax 
 whose tattoo reads Buried on the Breath of Dawn.
 
Wonder needed, patois needed, monkey brains optional. 
 Suitors needed, comforters needed, lactose-tolerance optional.
 Spray-painted suits, undulating lanterns, scenes of frantic night
 all for a checkbook that I would seize before surrendering
my love of The Real. One who will be for the future, if only 
 to turn back his long and lioned head with remorse code.
 Acknowledging acknowledgements. Like a magnet we drifted 
 in a boy’s blink for years not knowing we were drifting.
It is always dusk here. Mechanical animals wait for us. 
 We wait for each other. Berry-eyed and bituminous, a tortoise 
 of waiting and wanting, mating and pray mantising. So 
 what are you really interested in, Pythagoras?
Things as they are, or judgments? Careful, the truth’s a pill, 
 so chew before swallowing. Maybe it’s just a tromp l’oeil 
 effect, on second thought. Even so, it is what it is, and 
 what it is, we must swallow. And we do. We do.To range in the war was corruption, an error, a snow.
            A snow over Rome. Near the garage to sew and to
            sing — a crystal, inherent, and a wink to the
            chevalier.
To range in the Roman manner was to manage it raw.
The seagoer pressed by the woman in arson. The manager,
            waiting, and in the distance, at least, was wrong.
            He had played it too near and announced in answers.
            A changing is shown.
A personal letter is addressed to the seagoer. Now the
            rangers warn to swear. A reminder grows. The
            manner of the answer is warmer.
 The ram, the swarm and the wren, Ramon and Sergei, all
            wane.
Is the seagoer Negro? Arms is the song when the women
            are meaner. And the mason is worse. As the snow
             nears, the green grocer is warned. The owner of
            the organ remains behind. As in Rome, we wear
            sweaters to visit the gorge.A history of Australian Aboriginal songpoetry in English is a shadow project. Of course it exists as a thing in and of itself. But in translation, as it so often is, songpoetry can be considered symptomatic of an Anglophone poetry project. This is not to suggest there is no exchange between the country of the songs and the poetry context into which they are translated. It is surely a work of collaboration. However, what we do see when we read songpoetry in translation are the changes in Australian poetry itself — there is, for example, strict meter, rhyme, and line in the early nineteenth century, wholly replaced by freer forms of expression 150 years later. The most recent example of Aboriginal songpoetry in mainstream literary publishing is Stuart Cooke’s George Dyungayan’s Bulu Line: A West Kimberly Song Cycle (Puncher and Wattman 2014). Cooke uses changes in font, loose rhyme, minor repetition, and a free, fragmentary approach comprising short lines that recalls some classical Greek and Chinese texts as they are currently presented in the transnational Anglophonic world. In other words, this rendering by Cooke relies on a whole series of poetic choices that are themselves indicators of what is happening in poetry now not just songpoetry in its home location.
Given there are around 150 Australian Aboriginal languages still being spoken today, often by only a few hundred speakers, one reads mainly in translation. Perhaps more than other cultures, where the liberal author function is sacrosanct and where the history of colonial exploitation less pronounced, Aboriginal songpoetry in the archive often neglects the originary poet. These verses are embedded in explorers’ diaries, settlers’ letters, anthropologists’ journals, and country newspapers where the “informants” are mainly unnamed. Such is the ethnopoetic tradition as it stands here. To redefine it one must establish a counterhistory and reveal a secret anthology, which relies on reframing existing work for its sustenance and participating in cultural repatriation projects tailored to the digital era.
In presenting these texts as poetry rather than as lyrics or myth or data, we propose a different way of reading. Habits of reflection, nodes of association, expectations of nature are just some of the ways in which this reframing is discursively productive, without even mentioning the importance of examining poetic devices. The poems I have selected for this piece cover most of the geographic continent and span 150 years, which is the majority of Australian colonization. They offer a wide range of themes, styles, and devices that reorient our understandings of love, settlement, hunting, and the environment. For the most part I have simply copied them as they exist in their original written form; I have not changed line breaks or exempted words in Aboriginal languages, even as it is unclear in some of the sources themselves what those languages actually are. There are three Aranda/Arrernte songs here to demonstrate the changes in one particular language and provide some sort of focus. Similar projects could have been undertaken with songpoetry from the Pilbara, Kimberley, or Arnhem land.

My hope for Australian Aboriginal songpoetry is that there is an increase in readership, which helps create a consciousness that changes the everyday material circumstances of indigenous Australians today. Songpoetry is simply the first step in reinvigorating remote and urban homelands. Recognizing and celebrating this work also changes our ideas of what poetry has been or could be, especially with regard to translation, and the ecosystem of writing as a whole is improved by such diversification.
For more on the history of songpoetry see Stuart Cooke, “Tracing a Trajectory from Songpoetry to Contemporary Aboriginal Poetry,” in A Companion to Australian Aboriginal Literature, ed. Belinda Wheeler (London: Camden House, 2013), 88–106. There is also good work by Linda Barwick, Alan Marett, and Sally Treloyne.

Effort has been made to contact the relevant communities from which these songs come. I understand the delicate cultural practices around songpoetry and it is not my intention to disrupt this. If I have done so I apologize unreservedly and would also like to make it apparent that the presentation of these works is wholly for educational rather than commercial reasons. — R. D. Wood

The white man dropped from the sun bright sky,
For he envied the blackfellow’s land,
With greed and revenge in his restless eye,  
And disease and death in his hand.
And he grasped the forest, and he seized the strand,
And claimed the blue mountains high;
And he scours the bush with a ruthless band,
’Till its denizens trembling fly —
And his pigs and his cattle pollute the land
’Till it stinks, and the blackfellows die.

From “A Drama of North Eastern Arnhem Land”
The white gidgid bird is hunting fish,
It stabs the fish with its beak and calls as it flies,
It stoops low over the water looking for fish,
As the fish leaps away in fear,
“You and I, mother seagull, we fly.”
The bird saw the east wind blow as it hunted fish,
And the fish leapt forward in fear,
Leaping away from its beak as the wind came blowing.

I was camping on Bilin Bilin, a strong wind blowing
I see Thaawirdi Gorge
I take flight
The wind over the coast is rushing through
Over the Bilin Bilin.
 
A tree touches me, I see fire light
I am loaded full with power.
I see them dancing, stamping on the wet broken ground
I see the dancing ground now
I near a great beating rhythm
I see two of us traveling together through a whirlwind of fires,
I rest.
Then again I see the road follow
The world touches me, the world touches me with fire
I am loaded with power, dancing, dancing
 
Dark pools of water standing on Jingingayirnanha
I feel tired now
I give my dreams to the water
The wind is blowing hard across Jingingayirnanha
Where the water stands.

Kaporilya, such a beautiful spring
Kaporilya, its water so sweet
God in heaven makes it flow
 
 
A long time ago in Ntaria
Severe drought gripped the land
The ground was bare and no food
Many people died
 
Missionary Albrecht thought deeply
And earnestly prayed to Jesus
Together with all the old people
They saw the suffering of everyone
 
They built a long water pipeline
From Kaporilya to Ntaria
Through hard limestone and soft sand
The men worked long and hard
 
Armstrong, Ratara, and Inkamala
Rabaraba, Emitja
Malbunka, Ngalaia, Pareroultja
All the men were working
 
The water came, the people rejoiced
Everyone became well and alive
Today we all thank Jesus
He is the water of life

 
 
‘Verse 2’ of Bulu Line
Dyungayan:
guwararrirarri yinanydina
dyidi yarrabanydyina
nanbalinblai yinanydina
Cooke:
a flock of snipes
flying toward us
wait! they’re rai
   fast approaching
we nearly collide
                    their bellies like birds’
wait their flying
        belly-up
becoming rai
racing through sky
flying towards us
 from far away
birds becoming rai
      no more distance
nearly on top of us
     watch out!
the snipes are
  flying toward us
we watch snipe become rai
   flying belly up …
 — Mahāprajñāpāramitā
But somewhere caught inside
the skeined string knots some bulb of decision —
            tired crying out knife marks at myself
            within footsteps footsteps
                                                            move the street
quietly forever — I only speak to myself;
            utter fatigue of brain wound
where some animal left the tangled-up ball of cord.
Inside still one solid piece in the middle,
            still    still?    At the end of long long
staring down to this faith of constant
            consonance. And all I have ever known
the cardboard boxes my time has given me
            dust in layers
            between inherent generosity
and myself.
 
The curtain of rain that hasn’t come,
            because I want it cooler today, to end
            heat ending activity —
and this corner I look down on constantly —
I even seize the trees for living wage of syrup
            for my palms, for the staring, for the eyes above all
            as if I could not hear or taste or feel that
            shrank disgust and gave me lightning —
and place the trees …
                                            but place, place: I that move,
starfaced mole pushing, even my leaves
in the gutter — how? That does not yield
salvation — and all the manipulation
            even slashing the dead canvases of ancestors
gives nothing to know the blinding milk sugared eyes
            to live in the world, in.
 
And the heat ends activity. I am, still.
            The I want    I want    I want    anyone tortures with
            in these streets, the hoped for burned up pasts
            into everything, futures:  to live we have to burn
            even one minute to hold on to forever, exist around one
            pinhead and a paper of pins stretched out to death.
But I can’t explode even once. No.
Where will I look out? And
all to the death we want to hide. Look away, look away.
 
It is not crucifixion anymore, no blood to spurt, no world
enduring, no anguishes for anyone, turning the corner.
            Everywhere. I look toward the summer
            burning even the tonsils, to shout, to urinate into the earth
myself back into myself, the home soil dirtying my own soft hair.
            But everywhere: and this too, this poem, a path backwards into
            the twisted brush so no one will see —
                                                                                   either to look away,
whether it is brilliant nights alive alive
or fervent union with a private earth,
                                                                       or sink into ice
at the mind’s center —
                                            I cannot look at death toward the open crest
                      it is my end, but not my bones, not my mirror, never sweet beard,
                                    never the trickle of happiness.
 
Ha! that we want to live.
The heavy opaque eyeball weights us down.
            I can’t fly. I can’t sink into myself.
And where I turn this street glance up toward my room,
glance outward at the world like yellow birds and landscape on my walls —
            the wall, the wall, beyond me like my hands.
 
 Note on the text: Page  numbers and section breaks in this searchable Word transcript have been   editorially imposed. The three sections are determined by changes in   Barbara Rosenthal’s tearing/slicing/knife-cutting patterns. In   unpublished correspondence, Rosenthal identifies the points in Weiner’s   text where the pattern and/or tool alters. To create section 1 (from   “forthcoming and absolutely” to “no one can eliminate a particle”),   Rosenthal placed a steel straightedge on the page in sequenced parallels   and grasped at the paper in the lower corner with her right hand,   bearing down on the steel with her left and pulling upward to form   straight rips with a slightly textured edge; to create section 2 (from   “read more about it in the papers” to “absence of time between 5 and   7”), she used an X-Acto #2 fine point blade to slice concentric or   nested angles or rectangles; and to create the final section, she used a   combination of these techniques: the pages from “renunciation and   something else” to “she writes not me like this,” here simply labeled   “Section 3,” were created with the straightedge, and the pages from “the   insatiable quotient quote” to “love come to a,” here labeled “Section   3a,” were created with an X-Acto knife.
Note on the title: The unconventional capitalization of the word “Of” in Hannah Weiner’s The Book Of Revelation has been retained here. Although we cannot be certain that the  capitalization is intentional, Weiner did type the title on the white  label she then affixed to the notebook’s cover. The tension between the  typed, all-caps title and the handwritten pages in which a capital  rarely appears is provocative.

Dear Hannah,
Happy New Year!
Love, 1989

[Section 1]
(1)
forthcoming and absolutely
(2)
important only to those
(3)
sunshine is almost
without
(4)
something else that isn’t
substitute
(5)
a cross between a fox
and a bear
mere sensationalism since
(6)
underneath it all shone
indelicacy is a noble assignment
speak so no one will listen
(7)
whatever made you say
that!
alas!
something else could happen here
(8)
subsequent to this
observation
nevertheless we have our beliefs
dont ignore the garbage
never forget that you are identified
(9)
passages are infinite
so is this vacation
probably not too much
forgotten disciplines
remember everything
have you learned
substantive arrogance
(10)
somewhere else lies a secret
not everything is known
a person is indifferent
so many lies tell stories
satisfaction is important
nevertheless we can obliterate
constancy is a terrible problem
(11)
pretenses are seldom unalterable
patience is fortune’s caretaker
seldom has heredity struck
the ultimate importance of ingénue
the incapacity to make sense
everlasting pine trees on a calm day
suddenly everything went blue
however I cant decide anymore
everything equal comes to an end
speculation is a joint venture
(12)
alternatives are fashionable
general intelligence isn’t a mistake
special references can be made
I am always indolent in a
late day craziness is almost
terrified of all consequences
carefully we cross inbetween
idealism is an opportunity
cant you concentrate on getting anything at all
(13)
influences are opportunities
subsequent to examination
alienation is a cause
inevitable has a certain strain
opportunities are unanimous
falsification is a ritual
untidiness breeds habits
beneficial to the unemployed
alternating waves of fluency
in a trap just like the others
personalities are not permitted here
(14)
we are not concerned about
in places the rainfall is very wet
Indications point to the left
in a very important circumstance I cry
all life cannot be imported
fraudulent use of time
make believe wisdom
I cant feel the power anymore
songs may at last be inherited
too many people tell me it is impossible
(15)
fortunately there are circumstances
absence is always luminous
forget everything I ever said
some containers are inflamable
just discuss it quietly
dawn is inconsequential
everyone cant believe
unlikely to happen
please dont admit
foreclosure
understand
remote
hold
the
is
(16)
please give up all consideration
thoroughness is a consequence
waiting too long for it to happen
so many people have a long way
temptations go wild at last
inevitability recurrance
constantly without the
imagination justifies
cross reference impulses
uninhabitable now
disreferentia
upside down
conflicted
remorse
unstable
too loose
with
{fe}
(17)
without impulses to grow on
plenty of time to experiment
happily the results complain
indecisions are the fruit of delicacy
she cant stand the consequences
undeniably a certain strain
positive forces are the equivalent
infectious without pretension
remote unless prohibited
also unclear to many
something has to help
without prejudice
trying it on hard
very intermediate
softly once
cant do it
whatever
since
but
a
(18)
consequences are unjustified
temperature rises above normal
whenever clouds interfere twice
informality brings us green
temptation to become valid
progress is a mistake below
conflicts arise from indifference
sensations apply to a rose
coming inbetween us again
alienation is a round a bout form
consider the opposite happening
take care that you dont go too often
a close decision was down
semi-attached to a fit
unlikely to succeed
beginning again also
forwith permitted to
unconscious over
signals confuse
obfuscation
careful to
solidify
tempt
called
from
it
(19)
indefinite resolution to forget
tomorrow incapable of substance
fortune tellers infinitely
without any independence
autonomy is an experience
behaviour is uptown
sensations intimate
varieties of wild
concentration
more of a show
sensless of
reminder

folks
any

to
(20)
obliterations are enjoyable
removal of all objects required
limitations are interfearing late
fortunately irrelevancies decline
insensible to collusion with
pressures are inconsolable
acquisitions are unforgivable
nerveless throughout
a horror of pretense
an honor of patience
endurance prohibited
the golden aura
fools believe
sequential
automatic
anonymous
lasting
eager
bond
over
no
(21)
the late irreducible formality
brilliantly without a system
cancel every reminder of it
consideration is absent from form
overlooking a view of insanity
melody informant of cue
overturned in return by a charm
the fallacy of quaint ideas
forgetting the better blind
almost hysterically above
unanimously undone
recurrently simple
inaccurate and so
very capabable
to be too soon
formality
unrelieved
abandoned
surplus
power
turn
bow
so
(22)
bonded to a neutrality calm
notwithstanding the elegance
symetry has been condoned once
over controlled without simple
undeniably an appetite inactive
forcefully to come to conclusion
the unwavering fondness of sea
solely to perform one instant
aggravated by constant cure
only a moth can perceive it
integrated storms rise
forget the irreconcilable
not too many ways to
listen unconsolably
everything is able
inconsistency for
the measure of
useless words
unmeaning
remodel fast
drop it now
balance
livid
time
ok
(23)
endurance is a respectable sin
from one time to another we
consequently there is medium
obliterate obsessions locally
forget every device for learning
inevitable results linger on
the space is almost required
a burst of infiltration defined
nevertheless I was inconsolable
tragedies occur up side down
guess what happens next
underneath it all it all
sometimes theres a play
indifference coincides
an idea begins to show
purity is a question
definitely poor
without surprise
indeterminate
leaving
contest
diary
seem
luck
in
(24)
pretenses are unalterable
the sequence is obnoxious
many have left here
pain is not to be considered
almost again we have
with us without complaint
society has made a definite
giving up requires failure
too many aspects of this
formidable without restraint
anti-capitalism comes first
no more required dociers
once more we sing bridges
overcome with immaculate
the terror is something small
all experience is expendable
(25)
to decide limits your future
changes cannot be made twice
sensations become harmony
unalterable facts withheld
too many silent watchers
give up the end of the sentence
withholding information slowly
its only another idea to do
uninhabitable in three generations
permanence is restrictive
falling down in a blue suit
contrasts make a definition
unacustomed to a reality
before we begin upside
temporarily without repetition
a nominal form of being
concrete reluctant to form
informal geraniums {blow}
happiness is also a habit
(26)
formidable and softly
more coming than we thought
somehow we give up early
nobody understands the instant
a rejection that interferes only
anywhere else would have been
privacy is not allowed anymore
consideration for an ability
consolation is without enterprise
certainty projects desirability
inevitability of propulsion
adaptability confuses screens
foremost is the pronoun it
absolutely the only path to take
nonsense is only a bit of understanding
comfort is a redeemable pleasure
loveliness is inconsequential
inevitability is a standard
cross references become useful
never forget the incomplete
behave as if you were once young
transmit occassions on also
demand acceptance ineptly
force altruism conceded
(27)
substance requires alienation
forfeit all sentences ending
further delay reminds me of it
a consequence believes us
alliances become impervious to
the reluctance of consistency
the lead comes from the heart
the suddenness of capitulation
correlative determination
business without bond
obliteration of molecules
contrasting phenomena do
the only way out is admissible
contrasts are unanimous
the elimination of subject
sensory completeness for it
doubtless concentration helps
conservation of virtues
behaviour without program
purpose is decipt subjected
obstinacy combines plagerism
wakefulness and decision
propositions of failure
(28)
probability determines chance
one less to think about today
forever a favorite insulation
absence is a prominent conclusion
too many broke people cry out
independence is a tolerance factor
waves of instability lessen
inconsiderate and within
something else began again
ability to concentrate lightly
some distance from the whole
forgiven for not holding on
expecting delicious surprises
fundamentals dont cry
inhibitions lack lazyness
repetition requires defense
solitude is without form
fortunately too many apples
not to be without remembrance
steadily overcoming slow
one time only upside down
curiosity in formal dress
absolutely no concessions
unstable singing low
(29)
persistence requires illumination
stubbornness meets requirements
less than enough is the usual
fourteen acts of bravery village
sometimes I think without wondering
too many consistencies relinquish
absolute freedom finds a form
empty solutions are regenerated
secrets can be kept momentarily
implications are forecast also
tenderness is applicable here
judging the concept of lying
fortunately he could remember
I cant seem to believe in anything
too many commodities hurt
all at once she saw the ending
describe a situation deluxe
pretend you cant understand
forget all previous encounters
reform society to equal
a mediator has gained praise
certain tendencies were ignored
the formal application of freedom
some chance is taken Monday
too many people too many people
(30)
consult someone who knows
remind yourself of intolerance
put away those stupid phrases
ignore everything that happens
happiness is permissable once
forgive me for not talking to you sooner
obliterate intentions of blank
fundamentals are out of the way
calling for help requires a voice
too many birds have flown here
in another year the result will vanish
behave by discontent and surprise
a mirror without any reflection
totally seductive and in reverse
qualities tell us we are going away
jealously is locally unstable
forget permanence or the future
understand only one thing please
consideration for all beings was taught
exaggerate principals systematically
overload will cause confusion
upside down is a good way
many times I spoke to you of
letting everything go was at last
consider the power of the land
an unfortunate occurance took
sometimes she succeeds
there’s plenty of thought for
tiresome rituals become rare
(31)
red diaper baby
(32)
flagrant delusions
optimal suspense
(33)
courtesy for all others
sentiment is not brave
no excuses in the spring
foretelling is not always forbidden
some day you rode a horse
coming home is a venture
(34)
save all the surprises for you
tonight we can expect anarchy
in one moment I will tell you
forty nine people cannot stand
the beginning was a little bore
expect little help from midgets
in some sense all words travel
there must be no suspicion
dont ally yourself with imps
(35)
no future without importance
a second look into the closet
no reminders of inconsistency
partially incomplete in form
nonsense can be betrayed
average abilities just belong
give up your hopes of failure
despise credentials in folders
speak about your past history
change nothing until the order
prospects are becoming red
(36)
also we have been behaving
stumbling across the yellow line
plenty of time to think silly
theory just backs us up
modern technology becomes live
fortunately only three people believe
condescension is a form of surplus
some of the pieces will be pure
no one can understand excuses
second thoughts are for children
you must destroy all consequences
instead of two there were four
consistency is a summer tone
complete the requirements before
(37)
hopefully I can change my form
without memory surprises occur
many people were left waiting
information gathering is open
concessions can be made Tuesday
sincerity blinds us to disbelief
proportionate methods reconcile
a never ending race for space
formally I would consent to be
there is no solution in pain
concrete brevity is one example
consider the cause of rebellion
do not go without me unless
four or more people are needed
the object was supposed to be eliminated
(38)
occurances that take place at night
what would happen if you did
no one else knows exactly what
temptation is just emotional
you have to make the space fit
only reluctance prompts facts
sincerity is so simple to learn
brevity counts if you believe in it
the land cannot belong to anyone
organized forces hide in the woods
screaming for it every where
understand limits underneath
the invisible is more powerful
be careful when joining the party
substantive play comes into action
behave as if nothing had occured
adventures occur when you are polite
(39)
applause is like laughter too
lighten the load before you carry it
tenderness is without thought
another decision has been rude
blame yourself for the complexity
you will forget what has happened
justify returning to the place
fortunately there are occasions
formidable without obstinacy
a future destined to be blue
consideration is for old folks
northwest is a permanent direction
I can see the light shining around you
preferences must be considered
no one helps without forgiving
give me more back than I gave
hesitate until the moment
something absurd always happens
(40)
second thoughts are altruistic
apples are good for breakfast
sensations delay obsessions
preposterous but accurate
able to consider illusions
noticeable indifference to color
formidable with abstract
conditions improved in the best
circular withdrawal remote
tendency to be immaculate
forbidden to speak out loud
intense diminution of chords
consideration was once considered
applause for those who stand
dont interfere with her impulse
give into those who speak fast
if it is printed disregard it
stand still if someone is lost
remember the elders speak first
almost everyone has a color
elimination of restrictions
forecast of a rainy day
someone else thinks
before there were any
give up speeding
dont tell the men
always be there
ignore white
(41)
generous impulses lack facts
correlate the two inbetween the
cast shadows when you walk
pretend no one believes in anything
give up trying to console people
much is to be gained by softly
there are many important insects
underground we do not behave
something tells me to be silent
often I cant care if you do
constancy requires impotence
alive in a reticent fashion
no one else can see beyond the
if in an instant you can do
relating to an artificial form
formidable friends working
equal pay for equal time
dont consider the production
by standing up straight you
illusions are only gaining on us
letting the grass grow instantly
defy authority until the very end
contagious people forget you
fortunate occurances will be
somebody else told on you
the information is for sale
pretend you dont love her
(42)
a release of confessions omits
the failure of innocence at
are there really important persons
impermeable without delay costs
indecision makes us vulnerable
constancy permits obstinacy
a book of horrors to be deleted
this or that is a phrase
undone and solely alone
speak of unusual possibilities
contrasts are for many
something encourages
small time pimps
a purpose to deny
we agree upon it
fortitude only
inaccessible
unalterable
too short
for many
forgive
pleasant
omit
plus
just
me
(43)
a future witheld indifferently
a shield of defense probability
scenes of nature pass by
only the forest is impermeable
tomorrow will tell differently
subject to exchange forever
read it upside down first
ignore the differences in the
disguise problems with
second choices offer
ignore signals some
disguise the facts
choose to ignore
be belligerent
escape from night
follow the point
intrude fast
be allowed
children
all the rest
solitude
cages
dumb
offer
trim
the
(44)
favors imply condescension
sentences should be considered
there is never any use for the usual
articles have been written on it
the test was to develop identity
brutal displays of hilarity over
the difference between us is
condemned versions of texts
innocence cannot be denied
terrible afflictions of prose
ceremonies are wasted on us
truth is just a conclusion
pastimes lack vitality
once again by remote control
centrally located and this
no disturbance is alone
someone else comes along
propositions become
no one thinks of it
practically done
plurality loses
overcome silly
dont pretend
give up
somber
succinct
(45)
dont condescend to reality
nobody likes resistance
put away your new fears
incredible solutions resist
toxisity is to be levelled off
transfer images to the brain
make sure the future is known
someday you will see it clearly
beneath the surface is discontent
many more insist on change
also intolerable to noisiness
business cannot be contained
insist on distant illusions
extreme definitions persist
the chance to take is off
stress relaxes the arm
much sense relates
tension plus pause
take yourself to the
buckle your belt
leave before it
sense the place
contrasting
impermeable
soft shoe
(46)
take heed before the sun rises
report all interference at once
succumb entirely to the sentence
incidental parts can be new
release the impulse to negate
question the offer you made
someday you will see the difference
listen to your grandmother closely
send more money please
let me be alone with this
dont study the small details
give up hoping for change
let the new ideas come first
instant retaliation is the rule
prevent one more delay easily
see if the selfish people count
allow all repetitions to be
only four people can understand
try doing it over again
no one else knows the lies
believe in persistence
always cover your tracks
put yourself away
dont hurt anyone
decide about peace
(47)
multiple subjects tell the story
events make a big difference
get off at the corner and turn
leave old fashioned ideas behind
behave as if you were visible
give in to impulse on occasion
laugh at those that do not wait
perhaps a decision can be made
take the children with you
imitate the loss of subject
let impossible things believe
try hard to run faster
enough restraint listless
listen to remote sensations
any interference can be recommended
dont let the others escape early
promise me you wont push the button
not many people think about it
colors are important if you believe
give up sending messages
have a little fun first
somebody else listens
interest only widens
let the rebels go
(48)
reminiscences are dying out
laughing until you cant stop
dedicated to broadening the past
pursuing an individual occupation
falling down is humerous
anyone else would rebel against
sensations are frivolous when we scream
it happens only once in a while
one handles oneself much better
letting go without trembling
reminding you of every difference
plenty of humor in a twist of verbs
eventually you can understand
all the letters are in different colors
considering witnesses in opposition
Tuesdays there can be no let up
conclusive by telling stories
unacountable to anyone small
by joining two bolts together
quickly go underground before
overcoming objections can be lewd
all the young girls gather bark
only patriots are frustrated when
it doesn’t matter if you begin or not
dont listen with your mouth
preservation impulses are granted
no one else had such a good time
more hesitations before noon
dont come too early please
(49)
a consensus had to be made
(50)
forthright decisions are real
overlook this instance of past
(51)
protests over eating were decided
it took too many chances to call
there is a vision to be seen
consider the autonomy of pirates
sometimes a mistake is made
make your application anonymous
(52)
sentimentality has nothing to do
dont pretend you cant understand
make sure it feels real to
the error was made unconsciously
leave the details unattended to
plenty of time is left to imagine
I cannot understand why you are so
give permission to those who want it
(53)
Nobody comes without asking
There is no room for relevance
once we thought the same exact thing
we disagree but it can be ignored
once I tried to help him but I
do you long to live by the sea
it doesnt matter if you like
at the end of this sentence there
speaking freely we must over
distinctions have to be made
(54)
some institutions have been
work all the time if you believe
something has to be done about
no one else would consider it
forget you exist for a moment
make an end to craving
discover it without desire
if you cant afford it say so
dont let go of the changes
it has to be decided quickly
see what the interference is
postpone meeting stubborn
(55)
give up gladly when they call
make an exception alternately
place yourself in a difficult
go around one more time
think of the implications of power
when you are weak you will be
find a new system to work by
words were invented for explicit
where is the wheel in nature
put yourself in a position to
clinging by twos or threes
change the top so it is visible
break all previous conceptions
begin somewhere else but dont
(56)
prevent destruction before you go
dont mention a leaf to me
meet an opposite force with
plan everything carefully first
I cant tell the difference anymore
there has to be more than one
it always ends up as a sentence
no coincidences count so
put your troubles away
reverse sequence is to be built
the individual has decided to
unemotional people have been
trust no one but the boss
make sure you know where
close your eyes and the hidden
sit in a circle and hold hands
(57)
everyone lacks some confidence
put yourself in his position
eliminate pronouns before and
progressive literature is to be
scorn those who will not
deliver opportunities quickly
forget the opposition when you
drive consequently to left and
signals confuse me when read
too many calamities Wednesday
you must learn to forgive
fight your way through the
people just walk in on you
the page decides where the sentence
settle the differences between you
nullify the agreements that have
secure your thought against any
stop fooling around and listen
skip the next two paragraphs
leave nothing to the imagination
(58)
no one has a suspicion that
dont decline the invitation
There is no procedure without
all successes are to be determined
fortunately you dont think properly
tomorrow will make me under
let all equals be subdivided
give up insisting on your own
in a minute or two you will
coming to his senses just to
push the margin further
no one knows more than they

to blendIf there is one concern in my work, it is to reduce the form to the minimum necessary in order to visualize a thought or idea. Tomas Schmit put it like this: “What you can say with a sculpture you do not need to build as architecture, what you can do with a drawing you do not need to search in image, and what you can clear up on a piece of paper does not need to become a huge drawing; and what you can make up in your mind does not even need any piece of paper.”[1] This is something I can definitely relate to. In general, I try to keep a certain simplicity or minimalism both in writing and in visual expression, as well as in realizing the final object. This minimizing of means is also intended as a countermovement against today’s massive flood of information and waste of material; my ideal would probably be a continual reduction towards almost nothing. — Cia Rinne

Nico Vassilakis returns to Jacket2 with a new feature on the current state of visual poetry in Finland. “There’s a stir going on, a textual free-for-all, a visible shift in how language is being handled in response to the machines in our lives,” he notes. “In Finland, visual poetry, in some way, sprang up almost fully formed. There are few antecedents that point to its appearance, yet here it is. The fully mature mingle with the nascent and in so doing form a new constellation of visual poetries.”a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  i  j  k  l  m  n  o  p  q  r  s  t  u  v  w  x  y  z

If a line leafs, as leaves follow flowers
fading before they have ever happened,
that is spring, and this is language.
A simultaneity happens that has never happened —
speaking to you now of magnolias
edging brown before description —
before description allows itself to be enacted
before magnolias transition from winter bud, possibly
to scatter on sidewalk. Before us, before we
have walked over them before us. They develop in
time that moves through us, even as we move against
it, losing a day as we float backward past datelines and
equators, in time that moves whether in space or in motion
that time is in our body, and while in our minds, which
are energies made of an incessant construction of the various
entities of our body rubbing against each other in constant
reorganization of combustion and transmission — even in
our mind-energies, there is only simultaneity — our multiple
consciousness frames events as one happening relational, the trip
10 years ago jostles the plan for employment — memory
is future — we remember as to be able to travel forward — if
we do not, would not, dwell in the past we become disorganized
our parts no longer able to communicate: communication depends on
electrical flash mobilized from pt. A to pt. B and instantly back
again creating a simultaneous line of both and all directions,
even affecting all the points, creating not a circle but a woven
sphere within spheres and triangle and all ovoid, rectangles, elliptical —
cohered into a cone that travelled through by plane then wears
on the body, again the body is time in that these instantaneous,
multidirectional, simultaneous communiqués show by their
energies, or no, there is no cause right now to find. Instead, display
what seems to be a passage of time thru the body, but the
body is time — nothing passes through it, time is not a river
but the body in beautiful entropy, is of it, not just in it,
Cannot be described in conjunction or as other.
Just body/time without equal sign. But nature is a temple,
filled with living pillars, the flat plane passes through the cone
made of many geometric parts, the cone is altered, the plane
has passed through and has not happened yet, the plane is memory
and the cone is what is being assembled, always under construction,
a collection of tangents, and as plane passes through, small pieces
cling to it, journeying elsewhere and leaving cone eroded, as
living pillars speak in blurry languages, what they say is mistranslated
they may be in the temple of nature, or of it, or the temple is
where time becomes the entity we always imagined it to be,
something separate and comprehensible in that separation
from us, to be able to stand apart like a pillar and observe, even if
for one second, a second occurring with all the other seconds
around it, companionably, to make a minute that occurs with
all the other minutes, to take a hold of, like grabbing a river,
That which exactly what it is not and therefore maybe might be.
The space between eye and eye elided in transmission
of gazing at self in a mirror and looking once and
at the other organ of vision, the brain compensates and reaches
conclusion before induction has even laddered.              The nights let us have leaves
 
                       we have them           the leaves have let us
 
            & then they let us
 
                                     smaller

To sentence is to seizure.
(that much we agree on?)
A caesura cut in               space/a splice 
                 or white ribbon tying 
                 & untying anguish 
                 to language. 
“What then is the size of the loss?” 
Is it measured by the darkness of the archives
where each word clings
                 tenuously
to its orbital aura — a page, a scrap
                 a frayed map
singed at the edges, standing wave
                  reverb.
Catapult, elegy, expenditure. 
“Every word teeming and bereft.”
Murmur nocturne, weep aubade.

At night the <altered> precise
possibilities for <stopping> speaking
dissolve <persist> into the whiteness
joining a blink & a <disjointed> waver —         
“the beyond

weaving calliope migraine
to reclaim the remnant, translating
the dead out of their rubbleinto a language of messianic
                                                                                                      shimmer 
Yeah, but the old franchise on dulcor

“To thread thru rant/a wire”
                “to write just small, though hungry” 
To fall asleep

A question
                mark makes 
a world by 
                marring. 
But living is what comes before
the amends for living.
                After is for making
                the broken into
letters that can
                regather
                the scattered.
A poem is a séance

A point anywhere along a line
running from ruin to gift.

“All serifs are seraphim,” folded in the 
margins, the unruly dream 
of a text that would 
mend an alphabet. 
But if A = null-a 
the impossible repair will
                  always be deferred.  
Aptly, the trace of 
disaster scores 
what it carries —
                a continual sonata for
escaping 
                entropy. 
                Splathed across
its full range, it lights
itself by
                fracture.
Jagged hosannahs where
                enigma becomes kerygma.
 
 
(surge)

Is this a book?
                No, but each letter’s
                                a rift/in the hinge
                                of the text.
Distance elides us. Letters recombine.
God, according to the Sefer Yetzirah, only needed 22 to create the entire world — 
how very thrifty of him! But we grow older in letters, wearied by them, worried 
by them — how do we re-invent the letter?
 
                                Inside
the vacant room the letter
                                drops to the floor.
                The white saw of its ash
                cuts a groove
in the grain of the wood.
                And the operable lexicon is swarming with bad apples.
Yet disaster is also
song, its splendid
crowbar
                smashing windows, prying locks
cobbling
thatness out of shatteredness. 
A spidered quire barbed with
                fonts of sunlight. A
gathering of signatures crowned
                with burst bind.

Summer Writing Program 2013I. Of the Dead
 
March was the month when fissures opened.
It was a completely clean hallucination. It all made a kind of sense.
Larger rifts were earth wide. Smaller were local hairline cracks. There were multiple scales 
of events, unsorted, uneven.
Who can evaluate the destabilizing, limp paralysis, the thin shim under the everyday, and 
then the worse normalization?
She said “the canary in the mine field.” The phrase was totally logical.
“Mann geboren frei ist” had been graffito’d on the train station. The “chains” clause was left 
uncited. 
Water poured into the streets, dragging everyone under. Drought became endemic 
desertification, humus to dust.
Poetic autonomy never existed. In a few weeks, a dead zone had to be declared.
Any yeast that’s left will take decades to work.
The instruments are ghosts of themselves.
 
Here include the base and superstructure of me. But of course can’t draw a line, one on one 
side.
What is being breathed, when breathing in this air?
The interconnections among things remained unspoken, untraceable, inextinguishable, like 
the smell of mold. 
Chains are cumbersome, enslaving; links are necessary, and some are irrevocable.
When it gets revealed as jerry-built decisions, poor oversight, technological hubris, 
malfeasance and profiteering, then deflect attention.
To what, depends on site-specific calibrations: to claims of your “excessive” anger, to 
formally choreographed “apologies,” to crimes of mimesis, to saleable scandals and 
titillations. Occasional scapegoating. Scatters of random amulets. Perhaps analysis. The odd 
exemplary sentence. Exchanges of experts.
 
Slowly I leave a much-loved place I probably won’t return to.
What is the target genre? “Stony rubbish”? This is a textbook case. Hold on tight.
The question of bees. The question of bats.  
“Nature suddenly appeared like an emptied room.” Pencil marks up the wainscoting, some 
child’s sizes, dates. The room, however, was splintered, the child crushed.
“Do you please remember me?” the long-ago asked from her shadow.
This is a collective though partial account, after the detonation of frameworks.
So carefully biting around the meaty pericarp of Apple, she stood there.
That woman is called irksome.
It might even snow, end March, early April.

When Three Mile Island went, everyone stood outside and became an instant expert on the 
prevailing winds.
The surge in the discursive system was so enormous that one could not walk, drink, eat, even 
breathe without feeling endangered by its uncontrolled electricity.
What’s in it? What’s in it for them? But these questions eroded, frayed, abraded.
Then the actual system surfaced, with its un-degradable plastic, with “odds and ends in 
constant flux manipulated by desire and fear.”
Some have deliberately made the seeds infertile. This is a consequence of profit taking.
The future will wonder “what the fuck were they thinking.”
 
Three languages, but now she could not speak, a symptom of her dying.
Olfactory hallucination as I wake: the smell of coffee brewing.
Being “born,” as Olson said, “not of the buried but these unburied dead.” “You must change 
your life.” Me alone, or who?  
Poetry — something “replete with signifiers and gibberish.” Makes a kind of sense.
They are predicting a lot of snow up the East Coast.
But I don’t feel bad. Can’t apologize (too much) for this pock-marked landscape. 
Nevertheless, I feel terrible. “Why? April is the coolest month!” Can you say “parallel 
universe”? 
Occasional flowering is a normal characteristic. The poem’s not about the baby Christ child 
just because the word frankincense is in it. 
Severe choices of brilliant play. Temporality happens every day.
Let’s tie the hands of the assholes.
Alternative life: orthopedic surgeon. Hobby: trekking. 
Keep your valuable properties with you at all times.
The social world drained back into the work; the dam was over-passed.
Chaos Became a Way of Life. 
Canvas bags with a special logo got distributed to the task force. 
 
Meantime, I have other plans. So to speak.
Does anyone here really know why he saw poets as “horses”?
Q. teased that he would write his memoirs and call it My Lie.
The exhibit featured a colonial baroque silver teapot in the shape of a giant turkey. That level 
of extraction was almost startling.
A “secular Jewish Pegasus” would be what?
The sheer excess of the untransparent impossible has no verb right now. Sorry. 
A long time ago, when things got bad, they’d grind up the inner layer of tree bark — pine 
only, a soft wood — and bake it with rye flour. How long ago a time was that?
Here include the dominant, residual and emergent of me.
Here, rhizomic nekuia.
 
“Let the dead bury their dead” being completely impossible — now what?  
Being half-dead — a strained, self-estranged under-acknowledged fear? Particular “end of 
world” apocalyptic prophecies get media play.
On the other hand, the radioactive waste and debris will arrive on these shores in about one 
year. With the bare hands — plus a few pair of latex gloves to go around. Sea to shining sea.
Our lives are privatized, all except our private lives. This has been reviewed and is legal.
Are there real differences between here and there?
The sand was pocked and garbaged with tar clumps. Will we rupture and pull to shreds the 
ribbon of life simply by default?
Even those one wished to idealize were full-scale despoilers.
It would starve you more slowly.
 
We live here in this time, saturated with a few other times, and some few people. We’re 
friends or whatever. The between is where we are.
This is a confused sadness, where you can’t even feel that sadness.
The page, the door, the wall; whatever can be learned, it’s pinholes, although “the word,” she 
said, “leads inward into itself.” This is only half the story, although perhaps the more 
attractive half.
We’re propelled into linked emergencies with unintended fallout.
 
My skin imagines lines —
there’s me and him, and
me and it, her, us, you, and the time
we have been together when we’ve
foraged in what is, and
some things got smashed, and
some are rejoined, and
we quote from each other,
sister and brother.
Do not turn away.
 
Reader, if any! We are a symptom.
We are mirrors of our own corpses.
This is closest to darkness.
Surrender to it.
 
II. Gamut
 
The stone, as in all Moravian cemeteries, was exactly equal to the others, set flush with the 
ground. But I found it by the shells encircling her name. Chatter to fill up time on the death 
watch — but what to say? Student: “Why would God make His people suffer such great 
deals?” In this colorful escapade, A is for Apple, B is for black hole. One to ten billion in one 
fell swoop. These socio-lexical sparklers, these sounds and codes pulse in saturated rhythmic 
segments. Makes a lot of sense. Let’s rank the rambles. And together we woke, readjusted 
warmly, and fell back asleep. It didn’t seem a stroke of luck at the time — just, like, normal. 
Surf-intense danger; buried clots on the mud flats. Alternative life: social geographer. Hobby: 
fencing. “Are you keeping up with yourself, or not?”
 
Jade is extremely refractory by its nature. K. missed his mother, why he wore ambiguous 
clothing and his hair long like a girl’s. People kept saying “she” about him. And there was a 
time when L. had cropped hair, chose boys’ clothing, and got harassed in ladies rooms 
whenever she went to pee. Call the question. I want to bleed this over the margins of every 
single page.
 
Ribbons — Green White Violet — Give Women Votes. Makes a kind of sense. I feel I’ve barely 
lived my real life. Once the word “feminist” surfaced, all hell broke loose in the comment 
stream. The eye zoomed up from underneath as if a lens were buried underground. Men in 
work clothes and in suits threw women. Picked them up, threw them, throwing hard with the 
intent to break them. Terrible sleep, my heart then racing. Mushy day, with a dank chill under 
the surface. Ze — another entrant into the pronoun problem. Hir as a solution for the 
possessive? May I pronoun myself — e.g., I, Tiresias, the King Self? We own or own up to 
what parts of social gender? Paid on a sliding scale. Then I thought that a number 12 might 
be coming, so ran that last half block and finally made it home. And one day in Bethlehem, I 
washed H.D.’s grave, cleaning off the lichen with my wet bandana. 
 
Chicken at 40,000 feet, 4 Perrier, 3 Tampex, 2 cabernet, and one movie where it’s a blonde 
and a bimbo decoding [irony].™ He had a student who thought “The Oven Bird” was about 
Thanksgiving. Makes a kind of sense. “A little doll is the solution.” To what? So women 
hold up half the sky — who cares? Fragmentation implies a theory of wholes. But possibly 
not. The pencil was invented the year after Shakespeare was born. Wherever did you read 
that? The secret to cooking turkey is to turn it off quite early, letting it sit for a long while in 
the warm oven. It’s beginning to feel like a serious snow. Those were imitation or decorative 
oghams, whose marks, according to experts, actually said nothing.
 
This work, she said, is a darting arrow. There is such fervent, obsessive interest in policing 
women and in punishing women. Why did these years happen the way they did? What are the 
relationships among different margins? The lawyer’s pen was printed “Helping people
 preserve their wealth” in small gold letters. “One best-selling book!” (what‘re you a writer 
for if you don’t want one?) “you’d make a lot of money — then you could do poetry, or 
whatever you want.” Alternatively, low production values. The glue showing. No set level. 
And the rips. De-story the book; destroy the page but in the gaps, two-homedness, 
Zweiheimigkeit. Mapped “in these labyrinths of terrible differences — the dilemmas of truths.” 
 
Mis-en-abyme-ishly,
she seizes the pages of discarded books
she weeding she shewing she feeling she seeing
pages of the scarred books in which
“the unspeakable words never cease their subversive action.” 
Though never quickly.
If not now, when?
“I hold my honey and I store my bread …”
There was an attic
& then a second door into a second attic.
The airports of the living face the airports of the dead.
To run before walking — that’s what she wanted.

The ordained woman remarked categorically: “St. Paul didn’t write that!” But as it’s 
canonical, now what? The generic matchbook on the sidewalk was printed “THANKS.” 
Despite the delicacy of edelkayt, you must articulate your rascal side. T. is writing on one of 
those lost women artists. She told me who, but I forget her name. A man and a woman get 
into a taxi. I lost my nice cosmetic bag in that very taxi. Everything is a thread.
 
Ends up at 28.5 inches. This year’s Philly record, and the third overall. 4181 is the 19th Fibonacci number. It’s the whole nine yards. I’d suggest the word “human” or the word “person.” She wrote a section of her piano trio for toys. They changed the instruments mid-performance, and played toy violin, cello, and piano reflectively, like bits of girlhood thinly pinging. 2000 blackbirds baked in the sky. Is going beyond gender through gender enough? I make action plans. I plan my own loss.
 
Ze is the sibyl in her fetid bottle. The answer to the question is delusional: “I want to live 
again!” I learned today it’s older hens that lay those larger eggs. How about equality of 
questioning. Equality of straining. Of struggling. But then — it is not yet equal. So act as if? 
Then what?
 
The sounds a-blur confuse the statement. Hearing aids don’t clarify when many voices speak 
at once. The scherzo is scored as if the whole orchestra were tuning, scratching, randomly 
plucking. That’s a tough egg to follow! Another genre: epyllion. Not this one. Or is it? Full 
moon sex. Makes a lot of sense. Choose the phrase “female-bodied people.” After her lecture 
on women’s post-dictatorship civic status, a man stood up to ask “What about the penis?” 
 
That “best seller” woman didn’t credit that consciousness might follow from such operational 
choices. She was far too rich to think that! So much has happened. Quite suddenly. A snake 
struck Lady-dog, and I cried “HELP” in the dream. Thus I woke, stunned by the sound of 
that desperate interior voice. Anyway, it’s time now. It’s really time.
 
III. Fire Surf
 
Thereupon gigantic figures, earth and clay, announced that I stood with my feet only half 
planted. But the surface of the earth was in motion. I thought I had constructed these images, 
but detritus and its muddy tide had, in fact, made me. With its oil-gritty crescent strips and 
nipple-puckered seed buttons, the eucalyptus is a mightily combustible tree. I saw rogue 
energy; I saw piles of smashed debris; I saw the ribbon-braided holding place for river, but in 
this season being weedy furrowed dust in a wide, flat gully.
I was wood and could be burned.
“We have our marching orders. We will be playing the killed civilians.”
For a while, half sleep, it seemed much better, but given insomniac anxiety, it was not in fact 
better.
Bright lights refracted back downward under the blue-black clouds into one of the world’s 
tiniest airports. The wheels made their dark ripping sound as the bottom opened. Still, I’m 
endlessly making up for lost time.
Shunt the folded twists up and down the synapse; there were questions, but it was simpler 
just pointing to that spot.
Plans — big. Follow-thru — compromised.
No blades, awls, large shampoos, or gels. Headquarters miscalculated. We must stick with it. 
So much has already been invested.
 
He responds to the downturn by more intense tactics of marketing. Photoshop satiety.
Brightness, seductive pouting, chiaroscuro — how to trigger someone’s desire.
Mortgage companies began to destabilize, then to fail. Real assets did not match their 
liabilities.
The ogham slice and one more notch on the tree-thick stone — 
is this a real one, or a fake?
Who knows how to read this language?
All the big firms, Morgan Stanley, Lehman, Bear Stearns, held artful arrangements of debts 
and slice-and-dice notes so intricately segmented that it was all finally untrackable.
The attack of the difficult spread sheet.
Whatever was guaranteeing solvency might have been the same thing over and over.
(Buzzer sound.)
(Ignore buzzer sound.)
All of them making big money, big plunder,
smash and grab, a pretty ugly ferment that foretold the rest,
and impossible to ignore (one would have thought).
                        What one would have thought got squandered.
            There was no lack of telling, and
the operable lexicon
            couldn’t turn away
                        but it couldn’t intervene either.
The houses were broken, the walls fell open.
This is, of course, a pyramid scheme, so the system began to collapse.
 
They were just rogue soldiers. They were just bad apples. There were unfortunate mis-
calculations. An official apology will be sent.
On this stela, the motif of the handshake with the dead.
Jade cannot be carved with metal tools.
S. is worn down with chemo.
And now she cannot speak. Only by hard mineral abrasive, worked into a paste.
That company’s name was Chimera Capital.
I saw the sign. I was there.
The stylized masculinity of the noir does make a certain sense. Mannered so beautifully 
under its scrim of attractive doubt, packing heat, it’s almost comedy.
In life, however, the firewall is discontinuous. It has already become rubble.
 
Therefore it is good
to have companions
 
even if those were few
and sometimes unavailable.
If only time had not passed

the way it did, dribbled in bits,
us slogging through, oddly
glad it’s over — but think of that.
 
It is good also
to feel compassion
inside the dream and out of it.
 
He just keeled over. It was beyond understanding.
There was an exchange of birds between the living and the dead. 
“As they exit, they strike an antique cymbal, which reverberates in unison
with the cello harmonic.”
All those incipits were historiated letters.
This poem has been given a lot of ink.
Prosody: modulations of the void.
I lost one lapis earring.
Singular sadness, far in excess of the object.
What the genre said.
 
The news was such that I learned the word for slaughter, massacre: la strage.
Fire use in hominids — a benchmark.
Sign at the diner take-out — “ham bagel.”  
“Effortlessly” they said, “she effortlessly transmutes the personal into the political.” Oh, 
please.
This will be a surgical strike. We have very accurate data where they are.
He etches the places you are not supposed to notice — storage units, airport scanners, rooms 
with no windows, shipping containers, concrete barriers.
In their place — all smoke, some luck, but barely, the only thing saving them, three-alarm fire, 
was a double brick wall.
Waking at 5, I saw a pink moon setting. Pouring over the numbers and letters of meaning, 
one forces the tiniest marks and nets to hold this splay. Inflame, inflamed, inflaming images.
 
The green hose snakes through the pocky grass, but with a crimp in it. Uncrimp it and get the 
backlogged water to pour out.
Turn one’s pockets inside out, push open the corners to find the dust, the grift, the grit and 
fuzz of lint we are.
It is frightening, this part of the world’s work — of a technical uselessness (so far as 
accounting goes). But the articulation of multiple complexities, the saturations of syntax 
within lexicons, the synapses’ unpredictable pulsation
become portal to a hard and puzzling insistence. 
 
              “The voices of the children,
                          singing in the dome above.”   
Alongside
              “anxious about the market of everything
                          About the sound of our voices in the cavernous dome”
 
Odic abyss and Odos — the pilgrimage. Take the whole as a spirit journey into the real.
My friends and I have come to stay / to visit in another life. This is a powerful place I am 
looking to live. Magnetic. Who is it that turns up! You!
 
This is a different kind of counting. Bring me my arrows of desire.
 
 
IV. By Water
 
Food is manipulated, water is manipulated, education is manipulated, ownership, land, 
resources, medicine, heavily manipulated. Prisons are a profitable service industry. This is a 
double-entry ledger. But you’ll have to gather, prune, and repack this array — the boat is 
leaving in twenty minutes! Grab what you need — do you know what that is? Throw it in the 
suitcase, stuff it into the plastic trash bag. We have to get on that boat. No, but maybe we 
don’t. Maybe we should stay. What ever shall we do? Hard to watch the dithering. The scrum 
at the dock. What do we need? It really is a pity. Call it the “whatever.” Whatever bits there 
were, folded and crumpled together. Consider this a cultural heritage. Dead yellow-bellied 
sapsucker on Pine. I used to be a “Sagittarius” and now am that other one, the new sign. It 
was (as they say now) a “mute point.” Just leave the water on the moon alone!
 
 
V. Thunderstorm Dawn
 
I woke to a thunderstorm dawn, a yellow-gray dim with thin rising and polka dots of pinkish 
petals driven off the bloomed, blown cherry.
It rained for twenty hours. No more drought for us. At least right now. 
Dream of much confusion with suitcases. Could wake to find the same. What a story board! 
There’s no particular “elsewhere.”
But this new social subject, neither individual nor collective — isn’t quite me, either. More 
pronouns needed? Just saying.
This cup was made by one of the Little Masters.
At South Square Market, when they mist the veggies, a small loudspeaker plays “Singin’ in 
the Rain.” 
All your hard work will soon be paid off.
“It’s plain American that talented cats and dogs could read.”
 
Making a list — but always missing an item. There was always something else. I couldn’t 
identify what, but one felt it there. Blurred. Uncanny.
Bony travelers
scrabble across the looped and wayward scroll,
decoding or suffering
overgrown paths and scrub oaks,
and hinging, half-hung, half-off broken doors.
They swing, riding a riffled book.

Who was the third one, and the fourth?
I needed to bring them into focus.
Was that a man or was that a woman?
Interesting to think.
 
Alternative life: cellist. Hobby: my vegetable plot.
It seems perfectly clear that we will not outlast the on-earth years of the dinosaurs. Though 
this was a longish time — is that consolation? or not? Unthinkable?
The works and days, the sediments and glistening minerals, the fuzz and furze — it will make 
a thick and blasted palimpsest, yet perhaps only marginally readable. Who will decode it?
Every one of us so stuffed already, yet still trying to fill the void: religion, food, fat, glut, 
candy, shopping, stuff. Nothing is what I want. Well, just this.
 
Au lecteur de l’avenir! Salve! Here it is! I am decorating nothing. I am stating.
The dry stream down the rock side suddenly flowed to flood. An incredible storm. 
Afterwards, picked up the unripe tomatoes blown to the ground.
The storm discharged that pent-up electricity. We could all finally sleep. Not the same rain as 
yesterday, but a new dripping drupe shape, in droopy drops.
 
Cf. that second and third beside you, that third and fourth, wandering in cadence. A familiar 
cadence of familiar droning. Intensities of keening create humming.
Deiknumena: here are the many mysteries; these are the things shown.
Here they are!
 
When the ants ate the dead bat, they ate it all the way down, including the bones. There was 
no bat skeleton left. There was nothing but sated ants. Which is something after all.
The page, just printed, feels warm to the touch.
To make fried green tomatoes with the falls, use corn meal or polenta for the coating.
There were five military over-flights per day — fighter jets cracking over the top of the hill. 
That was right before the newest, freshest war.
 
“There was a brief break before the beating resumed,
 and my first impulse was to cover my ears, but then I thought,
‘If this man is crying, shouldn’t someone hear him?’"
 
 The mystical
            lettristic elaborations
of numbers couldn’t.
            A net made only of documents
            couldn’t. Nor, curiously,
could the mourners. The tasks:
           to listen, to identify & to respond.
Marvel to walk in language within being.
            Even cloaked by desperation and by rage.
I can no longer resist
what this is
and what it has become
 
in all elaboration
and beyond-itself complexity.
Let it begin again,
begin against again.
 
An early poem was called “The War Years.” And it is still. 
My right eye’s blurry, filled with something thin, irritating, and folded. 
It is a translation without an original.
“They baffle me, too. That’s all I’m painting for.”
 
Now’s the time when people post their news upon a wall. 
Choose talismans to hang above their desks.
Citations. Aphorisms. Gifts of the ever-receding angel.
Museum postcard of a glistening lemon. “Voyage autour de mes cartes postales.”
They look. We look. At it. The full array.
Of metamorphosis, tolerance, curiosity, attentiveness; of humility, conjunctures and 
juxtapositions. Of clashes and debates. Of pain.
Write messages, press send.
The journey did not end. I arrived almost nowhere and knew almost nothing. But still it did 
not end. So that — 
“I would like to be able to write a book that is only an Incipit, that maintains for its whole 
duration the potentiality of the beginning, the expectation still not focused on an object.”
 
Aura. Aurora. Prototype, all being preamble to the first figure,
like a documentary, only different.
Selva oscura meet obscure self,
wandering among itchy plants and between brambles,
a confrontation
with the fact of a question.
To follow there, “discovering new ways of folding.”
But never, luckily, enough.
 
So that my nudity
and the rumbles of language
in my curly gut morph into
magnetism and polyphonic eros.
And thus or thereupon
one recent summer day,
I found a long pubic hair
growing twisted and wiry 
right from my listing ear.
 
Hum hum humn, hymn and bong,
detritus and vertigo in sentences and lines,
you ethical ecology of vectors: you’ve stunned
me yet again with that incandescent
mix of arousal, illogic and grief I call my time.
And coming to this endless wall of volatility
that thing becomes a name.
 
Begin with any letter. Swallow and disgorge.
“this rrrr     to be a river”
“rien    n’aura eu lieu    que le lieu”
“She carries a book
of the unwritten volume”
that fills and empties pulse and surge.
 
Singing the exergue
nmnmnm — going backwards
half-hazardly mn und nm & utterals from
the knotted self, suffused with such a
dirty, yearning light, with such
ungainly lifht, with such 
clustering reverberation,
it underscored the toll.
 
“Wer, wenn ich schriee, hörte mich denn.…”
 “We have constructed ruins
to be reborn out of.”

Certain animals whose names I don’t know came to eat once from
             my hand.
 
They were of bronze or maybe some alloy in stages that without my
              understanding it
              ended up as
              flesh.
 
 In any case they were hungry the smell of food drove them crazy though
              the fruits were 
              onyx the liquids
              all rust.

 They scratched me I understand from frustration at their hunger; I
              slammed the 
              gate shut with a  
              thud that sounded
              like the metallic 
              echo of the oldest
              instruments a
              triangle or vihuela
              could imagine.
 
 I gave up since it also concerned my nasal voice of all the wiseguys in
              the neighborhood
              also a kind of
              food they call
              thingamies in the
              country with it
              they name loggerhead
              turtles or if they
              have to feed their
              horses they say
              corn stalks.
 
 These are words from which those animals ate that time they crossed
              the threshold and
              settled down right
              there in the garden.
 
 I can describe the garden as clasps of dyer’s rocket that buzz at the
              moment of greatest
             immobility subject to
              four opposing
              winds round some
              calyx.
 
 Then they leave then the sound of the gates closing the large doors of
              two barns on the
              district’s outskirts
              click shut you 
              hear the exact
              instant of the
              vertical flute when
              it commands.
 
 Everything stops, Orpheus the females the clay in the pottery’s very
              shape: the animals of
              only one existence, draw
              back.
 
 Only then do I hear that a window has just opened do I recognize for
              certain the voice that
              from the side calls
              me almost as if
              it will call my name
              that holds the
              name cast in
              bronze of several
              very ordinary animals
              that have disappeared. 
 
 I turn round since I think I’ve been standing all this time, I
              feel hungry.
 
 My wife who has blonde hair done in a spiral whose gathered
              strands are a
              flounce cast in
              yellow, is
              naked: opposite
              her with every-
              thing placed on
              the table with
              praiseworthy
              precision I see
              myself with the
              dark blue woollen 
              sweater under
              which I’m wearing
              a sienna polka-dot
              tie a double knot
              that looks like I
              don’t know whether
              the heart of the
              orchards or what
              lies below the city
              another city Ich
              möchte rauchen
              doubtless of
              recently-rained-down
              slates.
 
Ecos
Ciertos animales cuyos nombres desconozco vinieron 
              a comer una vez de mi 
              mano.
 
 Eran de bronce o tal vez una aleación en etapas que  
              sin yo comprenderlo 
              terminaron en la 
              carne.
 
 En todo caso estaban hambrientos el olor de la comida 
              los desesperaba aunque 
              las frutas eran de ónix 
              los líquidos herrumbrosos.
 
 Me rasguñaron comprendo que de contrariedad en el 
              hambre: cerré la verja de 
              un golpe que sonó al eco 
              metálico de los mayores 
              instrumentos que puedan 
              concebir el triángulo o la 
              vihuela.
 
 Desistí pues también se trataba de mi voz gangosa 
              de todos los acoy del 
              vecindario también 
              de una cosa de 
              alimentación que 
              llaman féferes en el 
              país con ello nombran 
              a la caguama o por si 
              tienen que dar de comer 
              a sus caballerías dicen 
              maloja. 
 
 Son palabras de las que aquellos animales comieron 
              aquella vez traspasado 
              el umbral situados 
              de lleno en el jardín.
 
 Puedo describir el jardín como broches gualda que 
              zumban en el instante  
              de mayor inmovilidad 
              sometidos por cuatro 
              vientos contrarios 
              encima de algún cáliz.
 
 Luego se marchan luego se oyen cerrar los postigos 
              trancar los portones de 
              las dos trojes en las 
              afueras de la comarca 
              se oye el instante 
              preciso de la flauta 
              vertical cuando rige.
 
 Todo se detiene, Orfeo las hembras la arcilla en la 
              propia figura de la cerámica:

 Sólo entonces oigo que se acaba de abrir una ventana

             animales corrientes

 Me doy la vuelta pues creo haber estado de pie todo

 Mi mujer que es rubia de pelo acaracolado cuyos 
              frunces son escarola

Peter Boyle has translated three poems from Cuban poet José Kozer’s 1988 collection Carece de causa (“No known cause” or “It lacks a cause”), which Boyle describes in his accompanying essay as a work that signals increased complexity, strangeness, and difficulty in the poet’s work. 
Translator’s essayEddy Street in Fort Scott runs north & south
The house I grew up in faces east, the back door to the west
 
As I write this in San Francisco I sit facing west to the ocean
The plains stretch between our backs
 
I sleep with my head to the south, and there, to the north
I went east from our house to go to grade school, and then high school, south & east
 
As here the work, if there is any, is east & north
You went by various right angles to get to
 
The freeways have reverted from the 19th century grid to the wandering path around obstacles
The main street here, Market, runs NE, SW
 
And in Fort Scott, Main Street, runs north and south
It is a ‘main street’ and a ‘city square’ town both —
 
the old square of the fort, the town grew up beyond, down Main Street —
as Market Street there runs NW, SE
 
(But ‘the square’ there, though, meant the triangle between Market, Wall & National, not the fort
Eyes in the back of the head tell me where I went there
 
It is an east-west axis —
as here they look north, the bare Marin headlands
 
But it is the angled turns that turn new vistas
On the plains you cannot even tell what you’ll hit, gone catty-corner off
 
Here    point to the unknown four corners of the state
And crossings, then? or what, simply, these roads and directions
 
carry?
.            .            .
 
 That car doesn’t leave the driveway but she’s in it.
— Chester Ashbery
with a destination or just destiny, inclining with wind
of what’s next up around bend or bridge above
river or creek or crick or tributary running to
Hudson or Red Hook, Catskill or Claverack,
Fish and Game Road where the hunting club holds parties

 
thirty years of autumn on the Parkway, spring on the Interstate,
summer on 66, black ice on Route 9,
to farm stand and farm store and way upstate, holy
old family farm and its orchardland, over and back to Lee,
to Lenox, to Tanglewood, to Amherst in smoky November,
 
 
and always again returning to the city
with stories as trophies or new trophies and their stories
tropes and true stories, news of whose atrocious restorations
changed a view we’d recognized for decades
music from QXR from AMC from MHT
 
 
and then from tape and then from compact disc
music becomes road and water, car wheels hydroplane
upon it, frictionless conversation of where should we
go now, what’s for dinner, what happened Saturday, where
should we go tomorrow, do you have the list
 
 
they love short sleeve cotton shirts and chinos they
wear the same size they’re both small town and city
they grew up near bodies of water they are magicians
and men of their word they read books and cards and
laugh at intertitles billboards roadsigns headlines ads
 
 
and at old radio, Bob and Ray, and whole plots of Great
Gildersleeves, plots of operas (Pelleas et Melisande), soap operas
(Twin Peaks), names of actors long forgotten by all except
one-time Whiz Kids, who won Oscars, who should have,
what’s the best movie in town, what’s at Upstate, what’s in Chatham
 
 
Johnny picks up on what Gene drops, Eugene picks up lines
from John, windshield an unmoving frame around
motion of landscape, commotion of traffic, emotional weather
or thunderstorms like standing right underneath Kaaterskill Falls
as spring thaw bursts down-mountain
 
 
somewhere a friend’s house was, somewhere an accident off
this exit just last weekend, somewhere we drove by last time and missed
the turn-off, or found the restaurant or roadside stand with hanging
pots or apples, the first of the berries or last of the
pumpkins at Love Farm or Mrs. Shortcake’s or Hotaling’s
 
 
and always another party where someone met someone,
do you remember? We met them Sunday, on Warren Street,
antiquing: they bought that chair. The lawnmower circles stonework
walls, cicadas sing to twilight, there are brown paper bags
from the Book Barn in the trunk of the blue Dodge Aries
 
 
box of fresh tomatoes on the floor in the old white Nova
records and papers from storage to storage, in back of the Odyssey
in the midnight Accord, a black walking-stick and
a small sack of Belgian chocolate; the silver Civic’s
passenger seat slung back at a generous angle
 
 
while a Piano Concerto in G Major enters a stretch of rapids.
“This isn’t the one-handed one Ravel wrote for Paul Wittgenstein,” says John;
at this point, in fact, it sounds like you might need three.
Then as phlox and syringa banks flash by, we are out on the lake.
“This is a nice part of this concerto.” Driving near Angel Hill
 
 
sharing experience, fresh intention, discoveries or
decisions, in momentum’s for-granted continuum,
won’t you come with us? There’s room for another, if
I’m in back: David or Joe, sometimes Trevor
and, once upon a time, Aladar, Jimmy, Pierre
 
 
and they’re off, to see patterns in Adams or Aunt Janet in
Elmira, to read in Toronto, snag kudos from Alma Mater,
inspect the new cartoon museum or gilded-age mansion just regilded,
for Le Misanthrope in the theater church in Stockbridge,
for friends reading poems at the Spencertown Academy, also a church
 
 
for Shakespeare at the Mount, or a Carter premier — he is just one hundred —
for Blue Stores, for Rhinebeck Fairgrounds, for Almar’s
meats, for Hawthorne Valley, for Otto’s in Germantown’s BLT at a
tablette by the window, for smoked goose from the Kingston market —
tonight’s sauerkraut casserole baked past eleven —
 
 
out on the island for Jane and Joe, for Larry’s tree lawn-sculptures,
dinner with Marc and Susan, Anne, to see new work by Darragh
way up Maine for Bob and Penelope, over to visit Michael,
through quiet New England woods to the antique house of a Deerfield classmate
in France for that Pompidou Centre to-do; why not Cabourg to see Balbec?
 
 
Like Helen, who always jumped first in the Buick when anyone was driving
they’re both “great goers,” they started to leave home early, they’re still going
they have gigs and tickets, appointments, invitations, news of wonders — of
hundreds of miniscule wonders of the western world, like children
to rescue from history by wandering, to bring riding
 
 
and both of them love to talk and they both love to listen
unbeholden, each beholds the other with such graceful
sheer irritationlessness, like a blue canoe on a green summer
river, as memory frozen in attitude drifts by like printed paper
and futures ripple outward in knowable, unknowable renewalThe space out of the river lands I saw
spread, go on to you
still now, I left before
they had gone there, I turned at Burley
along the river’s meadows out of sight of
the starch plants, I knew you lived
way past.
 
And look to now. This sight
in sight out a window at a snow
lighting on the yard and truck yard next door
goes on to you. What is any friend-
ship for
is given.
 
Worth or not worth it, hope
gives on this snow
somehow
falls to you
warmly.  Open o open
up our moments
 
The highways another summer go over
the inches unfrozen under the wet snowed ground
fallen on now —
Massachusetts slums muddy and snow on gone
to Kansas grasses
plait, winds home to
like pigeons
to Idaho
I know is there only
you are.
Lacking out of
wrapped in
land wrapped in this snow.

From The Next One Thousand Years, Selected Poems of Cid Corman, edited by Bob Arnold and Ce Rosenow (Longhouse, 2008)To Gerrit Lansing
There is a fire that burns in us
                          consumes us in equal flame.
To renew the flame, to cause each day
                          To burn with equal ambition.
That is our goal, that is our aim.
              To renew, to please, to stay
              These begot today.
This section of Jim Dunn and Kevin Gallagher's feature on poetry of Massachusetts, “Mass: Raw Poetry from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts," focuses on the influence of Gerrit Lansing.The Deer Hunters
Come, dear friend, we shall save something
for posterity. What is your opinion
of this gentleman urinating in the alley
that we have so many memories of?
I shall tell him that it is not nice
and you at the same time shall catch him
good. Just like that! Hold
on tight to the net and be careful, so that
he does not get his coat dirty (a fine garment
from the early sixties), and I
will be right back, after I get
a bigger stick pin.
 
 

 
 
 
Outside the Map 
Christ, darling, it always gives out
when we’re almost there. It always gives out
 
when pottery provides employment
to many of our rural folk, and starts to
 
bring in profits. It always gives out
when I pour water on a whale.
 
It always gives out when I ask:
“Isn’t there a gas station nearby?”
 
It always gives out when I say:
“We sure could use a gas station.”
 
It always gives out when I shout:
“Look out for a gas station!”
 
It always gives out when I request:
“If you see a gas station,
 
please tell me.” It always gives out
when I translate everything into English
 
or Japanese. It always it gives out
when we pass the house of a gynecologist
 
where at least three patients
are sitting, and each driver
 
of the cars at the front of the gate
wonders about his own full tank,
 
without which there’s less of everything,
without which nothing goes (and the map
 
won’t give out). It always gives out
when you need to write on both sides
 
(because you need to write on both sides
and the map gives out on you.) It always
 
could have given out sooner.
 

 
 
 
Birch Wood 
In our building
one guy
leaves for
work at five
a.m. He ought to
move out
the sooner the better.
Ideally at four
thirty,
 
son. The bombs
Hitler dropped didn’t
catch the milkman.
He went out as usual
on the streets of London
in his slightly wrinkled
milkman’s uniform.
Milkmen
are among us.
 
Hitler’s bombs
did catch
the bottles
that had hoped
to welcome the milkman
in the early morning
The early morning
went out to fuck
with Hitler’s bombs.
 
I saw the milkman
in a photo
in National Geographic.
He was the only milkman
I looked at closely.
His cart 
full of bottles
is my cart
full of bottles.
 
I can’t say
to myself “Son,”
and this complicates
matters a little, if maybe
I wanted to play the father.
Son, now I
am talking to Mama,
who sent me to the cellar
for wine, where there
 
is no television.
Space Heater,
which I subscribed to
in April
has not yet arrived.
It should have come
in November.
“Cozy poems,
cozy stories,
 
hot reviews.”
Very early
this year I paid
for the subscription
to Sestina.
They were to publish
three of my pieces,
the ones about the army.
It’s likely they published
 
one. It’s likely
the lady
who delivers the letters
knows it by heart.
Her husband
was a sergeant.
Crushed by a tank.
The lady delivers letters
because she cannot
 
sit still. The bicycle
her husband left her.
She won’t talk
with strangers
about the chain.
She doesn’t need lights:
her brother-in-law
picks her up on his way
to the station. She gets a discount
 
on everything,
even on Transportation,
which she’s been reading since May.
Since May she’s also been
looking through Cherished Italics,
Friday’s Haiku,
Baroque with Us,
and Elegy for the Partisans.
 
I write: “Dear Madam,
I dedicate the sestina
to the memory of your husband,
who was a sergeant
who was crushed
by a tank (although
the sestina concerns
lighter arms
and victory).
 
At the same time I ask
for the return of Space Heater.
Please hold on to
the other magazines.
I also wish
to inform you
that yesterday I paid for
a subscription to
The Worm of Rhyme,
 
which should be
to your taste.”
I put the envelope
into a copy of Orcio
the Brave,
which she probably
hasn’t heard of yet,
because I picked it up
Friday at the printers.
 
I concentrated
on the dustiest
bottles
to honor the milkman
from London,
who I mentioned
before. Is he sleeping?
He sleeps when he smells milk.
I missed
 
the scene in which
Bolesław torments
Ola, excuse me,
Daniel Olbrychski,
abuses Elżbieta 
Żołek. To judge
from the expression
on your face, they
haven’t yet cut
that scene. “Uncut.”
 
The guy from the building
across the way promised
that if he does not receive
the latest issue of
Polish Sander,
he will take out a stun gun
from his sofa bed and he will leave
it on all night.
 
We plan to organize
for our hospital patients
a beach vacation.
Polish Mail will foot the bill.
We’ll deliver them
by bus. The national bus
company will chip in. That’s why
I asked you to leave
the curtains alone.
 

 
 
 
 
Elaborate Train 
I have stripped her of gray postmodernism
and lacey O’Haraism.
My right hand rested on her left classicist,
my left fell upon the barbarian on the right.
Our ideas for an anthology matched
one hundred percent. We climaxed
at ninety thousand words.
 
The co-owner of the apartment, the crazy aunts
Polish Television and Gazeta Wyborcza,
went to the movies to see Independence Day 
or something of the sort
and came back on foot
because some student
had slashed every kind of diction.
 
We moved the dresser of tomorrow and hope
near the door, so as to scan the author’s portraits in peace.
The aunts stood on the sidewalk under the window
and nagged. We replied: “Copy yourself, both of you!”
The hard drive crashed in the wee hours.
We had everything on floppies,
 so with one last burst of energy we designed the cover.
 

 
 


 
Why I Am Not a Gravedigger 
I am not a gravedigger, I am a woodworker.
Why? Maybe I would rather be
a gravedigger, but I am a woodworker. I work
 
with gravediggers. I meet one:
he starts to dig. I look closely at this shovel.
“Sit down and have a drink,” he says. I sit
and drink. We both drink. I regard
the shovel. “There’s a clump of clay on it.”
“I knew something was too heavy.”
“Aha.” I walk away and days pass
and I come back again. The digging
goes on, and I sink too, and days
likewise. I come back again. The grave is
dug. “But where did the clay
go?” There is only
the shovel. “I buried it,” he says.
 
And me? One day I think of
a coffin made of oak. I cut
boards. Soon I have a whole
stack of boards, not planed.
Then a second stack. I could use
a plane, not the one I have, but
a sharp one that could bring out the wood’s
color and life. Days pass. It is even
a piece of furniture, I am a real woodworker. I cut
but I haven’t yet mentioned
nailing it together. There are twelve coffins,
I put them in a van. And one day
I see near the cemetery a van full of shovels.

The Reading Room in Christianshavn
“Tulips originated in Turkey,”
an intrusive old man lectures his
sleeping neighbor. “In the Netherlands
around the year 1560 …” But no one
pays him any attention!
The previous day the Danish
successor visited Aalborg
where he and city residents dined
on roasted lamb entrails.
 

 
 
 
A Conspiracy
He caught up with him and with a string impeded his ability to breathe.
Squeezed as tight as he could.
But it still wasn’t enough.
He also carved out a few holes, to look at the blood up close.
It was a cruel act.
(A topic of conversations at soirees and parties.)
A psychopath, a pervert, a vampire, a truly unpredictable
human being.
Ms. Gunilla says these are typical complexes from the kindergarten.
Mr. Per, however, blames his twisted nature.
In any case, what an unpleasant matter.
If I tell someone, they’ll cut off my head.
 

 
 
 
Ostrich Farm
These three overgrown ostriches (each with a purple
stamp on its neck) are calmly following the man
who has sold them for meat.

 
 
 
Light in the Cathedral
What took place a moment ago
no longer has any importance.
 
Stop thinking about the silverware,
We’ll give it to the Salvation Army.
 
Dazzled, you whisper Light …
and I follow you in silence,
 
wondering what will happen to us
when you see the sun again.
 
Poem
The box on the table has begun to think.
Thinking beyond me.
Or is it just my imagination?
Of course not. It is. Meditating behind my back.
 
I don’t see it. How do I know it is thinking?
This thought has just occurred to me.
The thought that a wooden cube
has begun to think.
 
I turn around.
Tap my finger against the plywood.
Look inside.
 
I can see one hollow thought.
 

 
 
 
Reading Homer
to Stanisław Vicenz
Another stilt, another verse
to prop the rest. The sky is sour, full
of lingering snow. Beyond that hill
we find some washed up afternoon red,
but that’s it. The words tilt in our direction
and the signal arrives, the road is cleared: we set off from a venerable
German village to a city of memories,
passing by the undeveloped pictures of the past.
 
How come, Odysseus? All you needed to do was reach
Ithaca. No sentimental excursions,
metered sentences, wondrous pictures
scattered like poppy seed from an open hand.
Your task was to return and settle down. And here you are — entering gardens
like swift digressions, seducing girls and birds,
traversing in stately gait the ungainly whole.
 

 
 


 
Parched Throat
Can’t speak. The last rainless droplet.
Dust blocks the passage of thoughts,
And they get mired at midpoints; soon they’ll be stuck for good.
Gravel. Pebbles. Each crack filled to the brim.
A veritable congestion. Like there are no words.
You say something and you hear a river flee to its dry spring,
An orchard coming down to light close to the earth and deeper, into grainy dusk
Beneath your fingers. Life got stuck inside and stays there, baked in.
It would rather speak; instead it makes parched circles.
 

 
 


 
Breath
Why I keep silent is a question
it makes no sense to answer the trees
crowd the horizon in rows only the song
remains the song is a confession
band over band of yellow sky
at evening when platforms
depopulate the case is closed just please
no more questions the boat finally
at rest at some age
one no longer waits for wind one waits for a deeper
breath that’s why I keep silent why I am silent now
 
There are orioles
in the woods, and in
metric poetry
the only measure
is the length of vowels.
 
But only once a year
is quantity poured
into nature, as in the
meter of Homer.
 
That day yawns
like a caesura:
from morning on
there is a peace, and
arduous prolixities.
 
The oxen are pas-
turing, and there is
a golden laziness
to even take
from the reeds
the richness
of a whole note.
 
(1914)
 
__________
 
 
Sleeplessness. Homer. Taut sails.
I have counted the list of ships
halfway: that long-stretched flock, that
flight of cranes that once rose up
over Hellas.
 
As if a wedge of cranes on off to far-off lands —
on the heads of emperors the froth of gods —
where do you sail? If there were not Helen,
what would only Troy be to you, o Achaean husbands?
 
The sea, and Homer — all is moved by love.
To which should I listen then? And now Homer is silent,
and the black sea, declaiming, roars,
and with it heavy thunder nears the pillow of my bed.

Hagia Sophia 
 
Hagia Sophia — God has ordained that
nations and kings should stop here!
Your dome, in one eye-witness’ words,
hangs from heaven, as if on chains.
 
And to all the ages is Justinian’s example —
when the Ephesus Diana let him abduct
one hundred-seven columns of green marble
for alien gods.
 
But, exalted in his soul and thought,
what was in your lavish boulder’s thoughts
when he laid out the apses and exedrae
pointing them to the east and west?
 
The temple is beautiful, and bathed in peace;
the forty windows are a festival of light;
on pendentives underneath the dome, the four
archangels are more beautiful than anything.
 
And the wise spherical building
will outlive nations and centuries —
and the resonant sobbing of seraphim
will not warp the dark and golden surfaces.

At a fearful height, a wandering light —
but does a star so twinkle?
O transparent star, o wandering light,
your brother, Petropolis, is dying.
 
At a fearful height, earth’s dreams burn,
a green star twinkles —
O if you’re a star — the water and heaven’s brother,
your brother, Petropolis, is dying.
 
A monstrous ship at fearful height
speeds on, spreading its wings —
o green star, in beautiful abject poverty
your brother, Petropolis, is dying.
 
Above the black Neva transparent spring
is shattered, the wax of immortality melts —
O if you’re a star — Petropolis, your city,
your brother, Petropolis, is dying.

The Insignificant
     — “What is more pleasant than the blue sky, unless it’s a cloud, submissive in the sunlight?
     “That is why I prefer a commonplace idea to silence, and, even more than a white page, some writing considered insignificant.
     “This is my only exercise, and my hygienic sigh.”
 
The Candle 
     Sometimes night revives a singular plant whose gleam breaks up rooms and their furniture into solid masses of shadow.
     Its leaf of gold clings impassively to the hollow of a little alabaster column by means of a very black stem.
     Seedy moths attack it in preference to the too-high moon, which is vaporizing the woods. But, instantly singed or worn out by the struggle, they lie trembling, on the verge of a madness that is close to stupor.
     Meanwhile the candle encourages the reader with the flickering light it throws on his book at each sudden release of an unusual smoke — and then bends over its plate to drown itself in its food.
Later in secret
Later in secret the general
Bends to remove something
To lean against a fresco.
The rules which run
Around the walls
The walls of court
Determine a course,
Declare if he had not:
 
Sulphur and pitch, sulphur and lead, sulphur and
gum mastic, sulphur and varnish, mixed with the
husks of pine-kernels, sawdust, isinglass, shells
of snails, husks of beans, and seed of myrtle.
 
From here any direction is shown.
The woods must be razed — resumption of growth
The market growing, profusion, the question
To hold — to hold
Parts or acts in the act of disintegrating wholly.
A sign over the hull — the eveningOne comes back
always to the
same dark
corner across
the mind the
half lot the
brick dark
screen or
movie screen or
patch open
in the roof
the stars shine
through, an
animal looks
down into
and the eyes
shine
I am lost in the face
in front of me. Yours, of some
girl I have never seen before,
the photograph taken —
 
into the wall, or where the eyes
look upward ecstatic
on out of the picture, and the dark corner
settles, is loved in, hands
 
out of the picture touch,
and the body gives to.  Where in the darkness
of the corner across the way in this room
her face bends, looks up, smiles, the skin
 
rough
and to be loved.
Where, and what
entrance? are to
those people not ever
known before, to meet
what is at the back
of the head, looking away
to the front, or what is
beyond the entrance
to the picture,
looking only
toward us. Cross
in the dark, bend
in the dark corner
out of the frame
might be endlessly
the whole open body there
 
Only to know
is the only value —
that one comes back to,
always, to the same
corner
 
… Rough,
and to be loved.
The heat of spring has driven me into my hands for coolness,
looking deep past the finger lines at ice beneath the skin,
           as if I could not even stand the fever of the days
auguring love for anyone beneath the lilacs.
Why can’t I camp my speech into all sorts of forest fires,
why is it ice on the lakes I want to give to anyone of understanding?
The why why why out of the carved figures
           put up unnoticed at the back porch long ago,
all the unconscious decisions toward the reason of exactitude,
the great fertility of intelligence, looking for the secrecy of maturity
in vaults of knowledge —
                                             and now I count gravel in the driveway
looking for a smidgen of emotion, laughter for feelings,
the live and not the dead.
                                                  And yet I know just as well
there is no blood here, even to cut myself —
laddering cold water, that’s all, here in the shadow
of those damned figures.
                                                The rotten backyard will not serve up
any brimming sky — and still I sit on the back steps
gathering up what axe handles there are …
to add heft to decay, but it’s no good, no good.
I know I lived on bright hills once, I tell it
constantly, I wish the world in sunblind colors again,
           I hate intelligence sitting on the floor telling
seriousness for the party, from sterility, from this gin and tonic …
and I have only stomped down the July hills to this corner,
long footsteps into utter sickness till now
I want to vomit the whole mind away.
           Regret regret regret up and down
the driveway, wanting blind ignorance
to flow out from between the marigolds, to see only
the tomato plants I played in fifteen years ago ….
I understand things too well.
           This hot spring offers me the warmth
of all existence, but I cannot feel at all.
           I know the sweating loves beneath the trees
like logic, logic lying in my cold tin pans.

 the keys to yonder have been dropped off in
 the midst of space covered over by a greasy 
 hair, or by a kickback of laundered dough,
 or by a slurp of excreted mucus — 
 covered by everything that requires a special key,
 granting hope to thy neighbor with the promise
 of closeness, they bring him to the place where, cut the
 crap: there’s no mercy here
 
 
2
 the keys to yonder have been jammed in there
 the passage is plugged, giving the floor to a gangsta’s
 dull moan, to the indecent giggle
 of a schoolgirl, squatting with a nasty smirk
 in the entrance hall, to a hoarse cough
 tearing the trochea apart, to the smack of oatmeal
 into an unwashed bowl, to one more missed cycle,
 cause of agony, got to go knock one back
 
 
3
 the keys to yonder won’t do the trick
 today blasphemy is always banality
 sick head twisted sideways
 all-inclusive services all the way 
 up to anal, and having been skinned, 
 crying, flayed in a slaughterhouse, and can’t 
 call her either bitch or sweet-pea, the best morsels
 left on the plate, takes a smoke, voguishly
 
 
4
 the keys to yonder shake in the hand
 of the average joe who didn’t make the grade,
 the crater has long been silent, but the volcano
 has not gone out, get together trails off in 
 careless screw, the slacker hormone 
 gave voice, the trashed efficiency dwelling
 stinks of no hope, that shout wasn’t:
 watch out; it was: give it to them in the mug
 
 
5
 the keys to yonder can take the place of an axe
 or an opener, the three-day drunk 
 was broken up by EMTs, the grinding 
 ignition in that wreck melted 
 a snow smear, cut-rate cogñac
 heats up the insides, producing
 a stale, enclosed reek, cut the
 squirming, as they say, clean and sober
 
 
6
 the keys to yonder must be cast 
 into the dye, to become disgustingly
 variegated, their owner’s on good terms with 
 a neighbor lady’s pussy, compares 
 statures with a patriotic-minded 
 pensioner, used to kneading the breast
 from sudden pain in the ribcage, breaking in
 the boots, wiping grease on
 
 
7
 the keys to yonder need no hanging
 or mortise lock, no problemo
 slow grind called on the dance floor, ecsing out
 squeezes his mama’s handles, pus
 dribbles out of the inflamed inner, the ankle trip
 tumbles the guy hurrying to defend
 his convictions, could be worse, so the baby
 grand’s mouldering, the larvae bothersome to this day

8
 the lease on the keys to yonder
 is expiring, beer with bar-snack pistachios
 tastes cut with something, in the fuzzy bathrobe
 looks more miniature-like, pimple pokes through
 the cover-up, on the clothing every 
 gill bulges, it’s like junior high here 
 thanks to the shareholders discovering 
 the developer’s fraud, nasty stare glazes over
 
 
9
 usually the keys to yonder come 
 in only one copy, they rarely cut 
 duplicates by machine-tool equipped with 
 software support for heightened precision, and then
 the benchmark becomes the stink of
 success, of semblance to an exchange
 about Gasprom, that swiped up the media  
 magnate’s empire, gave the go-ahead just in time
 
 
10
 none can deprive the keys to yonder
 of power, even a dude past all limits 
 walks on eggshells before them, disinfects 
 with hydroxide on cotton swab, tile was laid
 in the half-bath, the showdown 
 among investors resulted in 
 a merger, late frosts brace the weekender’s
 spirits, hassles due to arrears
 
 
11
 the keys to yonder get inspected are they 
 the real deal, checked with a tooth, slaves away 24/7
 like Pinocchio’s papa, the water tower
 renovated into a sweet club, wildman 
 exterior still no reason to get
 out of bounds, boozed up graduate can’t
 keep hands to himself, fashionista’s freckled
 chin swings, chewing something, gotta get used to it
 
 
12
 the keys to yonder practically don’t exist
 yonder don’t open, the keyhole
 hasn’t been cut, after days
 spent in this horizonlessness you might just
 shit yourself, a chum drives totally nuts
 with that manaiacal seriousness
 while choosing beer, sorta dowdy but going
 places, used to hookups with silly broads
 
 
13
 the keys to yonder are like spit, apparently meant 
 for the well, but hooting off into nowhere
 our dear little friend, searching out the WC
 bumbles into the storage, more melons sold
 than usual, the info brought by the little birdie
 don’t warm the heart, the news is so SFW
 excesses stack up, looks like an axe-murderer
 more or less a softie, a bug infestation
 
 
14
 whoever was sent for the keys to yonder
 is in no hurry, knows that time runs slowly
 ahead, there are missing entries 
 in the price-list, better to remain 
 unnoticed until the next
 inspection, there’s not much use from
 foundering branches of industry, rusty blade
 runner in place, the innards are out
 
 
 
Ключи от края
 
 1
 ключи от края обронены на
 пространство посередине, покрытое лохматой
 волосиной, иль слитого грина
 откатом, или выделенной смазки
 хлюпаньем, всем, к чему нужен ключ
 особенный, обнадежив близкого обещаньем
 близости, его подводят туда, где плюнь
 и разотри, тут не до пощады
 
 
2 
 ключи от края вставлены до упора 
 язычок отодвинут, слово теперь тупому
 мычанью бандоса, нескромному хихику
 школьницы, в парадняке с ехидной
 миной севшей по-маленькому, глухому кашлю
 разрывающему трахею, плюханью каши
 в недомытую миску, очередной задержке
 вызывающей терзания, треснуть где бы
 
 
3
 ключи от края не проканают
 кощунство сегодня всегда банальность
 скособочена голова больная
 в услуги все включено до анала
 вплоть, плачет по снятой шкуре
 освежеванный на живодерне, паскудой
 не назовешь, также милашкой, вкусно
 оставленное на тарелке, манерно курит
 
 
4
 ключи от края дрожат в руке
 середнячка, не встроенного в обойму
 кратер давно молчит, но вулкан 
 не потух, нечаянно оттрахал
 при встрече, разыгрался гормон
 раздолбайский, убитая распашонка
 смердит безнадегой, не караул
 выкрикнуто, а в репу врежь им
 
 
5
 заменяют ключи от края топор
 и открывалку, тяжкий запой
 прерван амбулаторно, жигуль
 заводясь, оставляет в снегу
 проталину, ординарный коньяк 
 разогревает внутренности, обонять
 заставляя в них спертое, харэ
 говорят тебе ершиться, умн и трезв
 
 
6
 ключи от края в краситель кинуть
 положено, чтобы стали противно
 пестрыми, владелец их дружит с киской
 жительницы микрорайона, ростишком
 меряется с мыслящим патриотично
 пенсионером, привык соски мять
 от внезапной боли в грудине, ботинки
 разнашивает, наносит мазки на
 
 
7
 ключам от края замок навесной
 или врезной не нужен, к чему проблемы
 в клубе медляк объявлен, весь на таблетках
 обнимает партнершу за талию, гной
 вытекает из воспаленного, подсечка
 валит слишком спешащего отстоять
 свои убеждения, еще полбеды, что рояль
 трухляв, досаждают личинки по сей день 
 
 
8
 ключей от края срок эксплуатации
 истекает, пиво в прикуску с фисташками
 отдает разбодяжкой, в халате мягоньком
 смотрится миниатюрнее, подрумяненный
 прыщик топорщится, на одежде все
 шхеры оттопырены, просто детский сад
 устроили пайщики, обман раскрыв
 застройщика, соловеет взгляд масляный
 
 
9
 ключи от края обычно в одном
 экземпляре даются, редко их дубликаты
 изготовляются на станке с программным
 обеспечением повышенной точности, и тогда
 этаблированной ценностью становится вонь
 успешности, похожести на разговор
 о Газпроме, схапавшем у медиа-магната
 его империю, вовремя дали отмашку
 
 
10
 у ключей от края власть не отымет
 никто, и законченный беспредельщик
 перед ними на цырлах, ватою с нашатырным
 спиртом обеззараживает, в раздельном
 санузле положили плитку, разборка
 между инвесторами послужила слиянью
 предприятий, вселяют в дачника бодрость 
 поздние заморозки, из-за недоимок дрязги
 
 
11
 ключи от края проверяют на подлинность
 берут на зубок, внеурочно вкалывает
 как папа карло, башня водонапорная
 перестроена в клубешник, дикарская
 внешность еще не повод разнузданно 
 себя вести, распускает руки подвыпивший
 выпускник, у фифы подбородок веснушчатый
 ходит, что-то жуя, придется свыкнуться
 
 
12
 ключей от края фактически нет
 край не отворяется, замочная
 скважина в нем не врезана, после дней
 проведенных в бескрайности можно ведь
 усраться, кореш здорово загрузил
 своей маниакальной серьезностью
 при выборе пива, вроде бы неказист
 а пробивной, привык путаться с дурехами
 
 
13
 ключи от края будто плевок в колодец
 вроде прицельный, а ухает в никуды
 друг дражайший, разыскивая ватер-клозет
 тыркается в подсобку, продано дынь
 больше обычного, не греет известье
 узнанное от верблюда, новость по кочану
 излишки копятся, похожий на изувера
 достаточно мягкотел, налетела гнусь 
 
 
14
 за ключами от края отправленный 
 не торопится, знает, что время медленно
 бежит впереди, значатся в прайс-листе
 отсутствующие позиции, незамеченным
 выгодно оставаться до следующей
 проверки, от загибающейся отраслиRien ne me rend plus heureux que de sortir dans la campagne et de peindre ce que je vois.
— Henri Rousseau
Aglitter in the dromedary dawn 
 with cold rubles, the old cyclone 
 boasts come what come may, sir. 
 Like a silly curlicue, for instance, 
 that you called August. It too had 
 a way, prescient and plunderable, 
 a mix of corsage and assemblage, 
 or coconut if you can imagine it.
A wax cylinder in the wind was 
 carrying us chevalierly through 
 the alphabets of petite longings, 
 our gumption of restless itching. 
 If we stop here it’s because here 
 it’s thick dusk. Streaming ribbons 
 from the sun, yellow fields of sky 
 matriculating without thinking.
Slowly, the aperture goes bronze 
 squinting in the marble harbor, 
 guffawing, crocheting a speech. 
 The morning buildings are air 
 sugared with stiff upper lip. 
 Clipped romance butters our 
 pockets with comic-book accents, 
 pocked lingo and perfumed lint.
Yesterday, the dazzlement washed us 
 away like laundry boats bedraggled
      toward a ventilated hexagon of sea, 
 its coils and plungers, its plumber’s tape
      amid lulling processions of joggers.
     One spring patio is for rodeos 
 niggled with iodine figures, weaved
      tapestries inside bat tulieries. 
 But that reminds me, how exactly 
      do words form brittle histories —
     rummaging a basement heap, a guttural 
 section, suppose, or an anatomical plane,
      a slice of what should be and has been said 
 but wasn’t, like some yogurty radio static
      giving way assuredly to sweet hosannas.
     We bench-press archways with our eyes 
 recalling a time when we actually had eyes. 
 Yes, that was eons ago, gazing inside at TV
      bunkers as Shock-&-Awe hunkered down
     for supper, a roseate ghostly assembly line 
 producing but bruise. I could use a good one c
 ome to think of it. And nickeled-and-dimed,
      halter-top waters rise. Ferries a-glint with
     restaurant dementias. Some happenstance 
 meant to be talked about. We’ll have to let be, 
 with addled doo-wop and haughty pince-nez.
      Alone here in the river walk you buoy it all.
You, walking stick, are emptier in a crowd, 
                though not as empty as one.
 Amateur, I’m watching your surveys shrug 
                to the ground, dear and ruthless. The
fiesta has begun. And waffling in the breeze, 
                this is the time to reprogram
 an ideogram or two, flinging pants off 
                for stoic sleepiness.
Dreams have the following architecture: 
                metallic substance, pursuant laws
 of mineralness. Vague plunder of booty, 
                plastic robe of pearls. Sesame
pirates of our wonderfully dull childhood 
                where a perverted man
 usurps your surname and wanders the lawn, 
                sprinkling reindeer tears.
Just as to love is to doze, so what I crave 
                is to nose about. I, however,
 in 17th-century fashion, stare at your chaps 
                of frolicking gold, apparel
that includes a spigot, which cargoes some 
                mumbling grudge in its hull
 quarters to Tribeca. There we can arrange 
                a spotted coordinate for the Star,
the strait pass that was kindred, mortal. Now 
                resume the pose. Walk, rub, walk.
It only takes a brochure in your palms to let me see 
      native Indias and corpulent Africas open gently 
 your cornet wrists, your marigold-clumped brow.
People should be able to account for something in 
      what they desire or they roam fore’er, secluded
 under western bandanas. This leads to reclusiveness.
Extreme passivity, puss ocher and the like. General 
      spiels of uneasiness. I should know, happening to be
 one myself, a curmudgeon crayfish like the Fantômas.
A board was laid out. It had your legs on it, suspended 
      scissor-like. A mode I knew from albums. Speaking
 of which, one bum was overheard saying to the other,
“I like your bum.” Quite moving mumbo-jumbo really. 
      One door slices us to the next, the tunnels funnel us
 into faraway space with pristine shops. You snicker to
friends across absolute distance. They always ask 
      me the fable of my life, the accurate one, replete
 with liquid bones to pick at or throw as testimony.
I prefer sassafras to crème brûlée on any given day. 
      Brutal and cunning, but unknown, I love cyclists.
 So a cloud curtailed me. And I awoke horizon.
The result 
 of such 
 expressiveness cannot 
 be denied. 
 Especially honey, 
 figures of 
 rain buttressing 
 cheeks with
small change — 
 contingencies due — 
 and this 
 mosaic: a 
 Giotto chapel 
 we’ll name 
 our stone-braced 
 embodiment. Neither
reconditioning nor 
 resurrection needed 
 to become 
 The Possible.
 You once 
 told me, 
 first giving 
 up. Give
up what? 
 A stripper 
 made in 
 toothy encaustic. 
 Boring. We 
 were literally 
 boring holes 
 in spy
stations. 
 Calling this all 
 a pipe-dream, 
 a.k.a. Yourself, 
 a something
 for our 
 lips, sandwiched 
 in stares
stuck in 
 Porta-johns. This 
 kind of 
 looking isn’t 
 seeing. This 
 kind of 
 consumption ’tis 
 blindness. An
igloo rug — 
 it’s not 
 enough to 
 be relative 
 to example 
 and talk 
 art for
 the dear
and near 
 to us, 
 picking up 
 the phone 
 one day 
 saying clearly 
 but only
                                  “And?”
I take refuge in each skittery movement and moment 
      I’m given when not forced to dwell on a monument.
 Iron’s the last bastion afforded to a materialist state. 
      Next to gentle gardens, for a bit, we argued. Polluted
scales were a kind of resolution to wrestle us from 
      ourselves, though I kept noticing the way our lips
 pinched themselves accidentally, the vanity roped 
      around its waist, delicate and burnt, as if dread
had come into the room with a waltz on our breath. 
      At such gestured pace, you induce a sigh. Yes, you
 ignorant child, those fireworks were yours. And this 
      time they were. Pyrotechnics fade. Experiments not
talked about until today in the skyrise of cabinets 
      and windows of papers flustered from sunlight
 rise like a Goth girl costumed in hardened beeswax 
 whose tattoo reads Buried on the Breath of Dawn.
 
Wonder needed, patois needed, monkey brains optional. 
 Suitors needed, comforters needed, lactose-tolerance optional.
 Spray-painted suits, undulating lanterns, scenes of frantic night
 all for a checkbook that I would seize before surrendering
my love of The Real. One who will be for the future, if only 
 to turn back his long and lioned head with remorse code.
 Acknowledging acknowledgements. Like a magnet we drifted 
 in a boy’s blink for years not knowing we were drifting.
It is always dusk here. Mechanical animals wait for us. 
 We wait for each other. Berry-eyed and bituminous, a tortoise 
 of waiting and wanting, mating and pray mantising. So 
 what are you really interested in, Pythagoras?
Things as they are, or judgments? Careful, the truth’s a pill, 
 so chew before swallowing. Maybe it’s just a tromp l’oeil 
 effect, on second thought. Even so, it is what it is, and 
 what it is, we must swallow. And we do. We do.The swallow is flying in a red dress.
The dress interrupts work to be done in the woods.

Frills in rows and layers are little speech acts.
The dress is doing all the talking.

What is little can become what is larger.
Big bloom and parlando.

Sooner or later frills can become direct appeals.
Not frivolous.

“Be my” is direct.
“Be my/be my baby” is no less direct.

It is an interruption.
Pleading please so won’t you please interruption.
 
 
There was woods and there was only woods in the beginning only canopy
and understory stories with the Indians in and out of the stories which became
different stories with the settlers who cut down the woods to make houses
and fields and to keep houses warm in long unrelentingly cold winter.

Leaving only tallest sycamores with massive camouflage colored trunks and
cream colored narrow tops not good for burning or for building who cut
down the woods to make houses and fields who cut down and through
the understory story to make a mill-race a wooden mill with a wooden wheel.
 

The mill abandoned the mill-race silted over and clogged where it joins
a creek or small river with many turnings the fields going to weeds
dewberry trumpet vine poisonous pokeweed goldenrod the woods returning
to woods cherry witchhazel hawthorn hackberry redbud hard and soft maples.

The creek or small river remaining with its many turnings remaining not
moving but flowing weeds cut down the fields plowed and disced and
disced again and dragged the woods re-cut and mowed to make a path with
its own turnings under the canopy remaining and through the understory.
 
Near the path which has no Indian name nor any other name but is
beckoning in its own turnings near the path are planted new trees and bushes
new maples with open palm-shaped or deeply divided or moon-shaped
leaves new viburnums fragrant in spring clustered bright berries in autumn.

What has been planted dogwoods and magnolias in addition spireas and
more spireas in addition must be well-tended in hot humid summer the path
well-tended in each season that those who visit the woods may walk
unhindered and if not finding peace or the lady hope may walk unhindered.
 
 
Pleading is powerful.
Knocks you off your horse and makes you cry.

Can happen.
Something else can happen after direct directions.

Sooner or later in layers after layers.
Hushed.

Can happen despite the clamor of angels.
This is despite clamor in mind.

Across a blue formation under a florid sky formation.
This is after all the talking.
It’s the call of the swallow.
The call hushes and is itself hushed.
Today I leave Cambridge, I mark out of these grey old boulders
left before even the glaciers
back to a center of beginnings, what world alone I knew
when I was young, what circle established everything
the times I let nothing end my silver, my gazes high
in the pincers ending school, ending someday —
                                                                                       it all moved toward
the stores, the town, then, whenever involvement would come,
but certainty, certainty, the hardwood floors I cherished
to replace my worn linoleum …
home, now, like sun setting behind my back
always on the edge of earth — burned, burned to death in Kansas summer
but it is open! sweet fence at my front yard
open, old black paint carved for me then,
needless to break down —
 
I stood out in the rain and loped
stagecoaches around the block — imitating
life as real, the constant goal of growing up
syringing the house full of    absolute eternity.
And I go back now almost expecting it all
to flood over me again, I leave having hated all my awareness
of long, long tunnel here in ancient Cambridge. A year, most of it
drop by drop driving down beneath Chinese worryings, twelve months
down to the last nothing glance in the mirror, the year ending me
with hatred from this dumb constant grey decision in the North,
too far from shaven wheatfields, too far from always blond
instead of black heads: — engaged by dying out of a Missouri night in bus,
circling overhead till I hoped for Rilke visions in my drying up
by the mailbox, till I break down and write along the sidewalks
Harvard leads me to boxes of scholarship —
                                                                                and not even the mysteries
of endless time into China in the characters turned out before me
open any tomorrow’s window onto Christmas, snow, intelligence
in a happy sky.
                              Having hated starvation of the toes looking
for my footsteps again, having sunk into monologue
with the portrait of Tzu Hsi gracing the commons room
for Asian specialists.
                                            But now, at least I leave unfeeling
out of rain and humidity. Today the sun is shining, shining all my mirrors
over everybody America, looking down the tall forest roads
out of this East, out of this gradual slope to sea,
back to the settlements on rivers watering only the pasts,
only my childhood, back to Kansas.
 
 My interest in visual poetry (or video poetry) began when I started doing performances. I’ve been quite interested in the possibility of writing between picture and text. It is a process of learning how to read this relationship: how text changes the picture and vice versa. I work by taking textual metaphor and breaking it down to its concrete DNA level. — Mari Laaksonen

Heinä

Nico Vassilakis returns to Jacket2 with a new feature on the current state of visual poetry in Finland. “There’s a stir going on, a textual free-for-all, a visible shift in how language is being handled in response to the machines in our lives,” he notes. “In Finland, visual poetry, in some way, sprang up almost fully formed. There are few antecedents that point to its appearance, yet here it is. The fully mature mingle with the nascent and in so doing form a new constellation of visual poetries.” for John Taggart

Speaking from
the branch in/at each line
 
I sat in my room, a wanderer
catching prayers,
 
lifted language
from the additive
 
Spoke of it, how soon
we’ll be beginning as we end
 
How much waste the resistance
Language can be a brick wall
 
a way not to say hello, “Hello!”
Much of the time/an old story
 
Pavements here not like in Mexico
so rich we must acknowledge
 
the surface sentence
I will not let you go until …
 
You touch me city of cities
Things of the spirit touch
 
Spoke of how we all live together
buildings, bricks, a neighborhood playground

                  Djuna Barnes said
                                      “One thought of 
death in reverse.” Seeing 
the Baroness, one 
thought, Djuna Barnes did not say
had no need to say,
of thought itself, 
             philosophical 
                              thought, 
one thought, that is, 
of death …

Seeing 
the Baroness
one thought all
                of death that 
can be 
thought:
                  “Death in reverse”
                         
One can never think death itself
only the steps away from and towards …

One thought of death coming towards us, but in reverse.
One thought of such steps as the Baroness took or may have taken

in Munich, Cincinnati, New York, Berlin, Paris
memorable steps, unknowing steps
with a dog on a leash with several dogs 
several dogs on several leashes
The Baroness, 70 black and purple anklets
Christmas tree balls as earrings
a tea strainer around her neck
a wig of purple and gold.

The Baroness,
who once said: I have
spiritual cancer of the womb …

She steals the crepe from the door
of a funeral home and makes a dress of it …

The Baroness, 
who once said: High culture is 
only possible with emotional people …

The Baroness,
a postage stamp on her cheek,
foreign, cancelled …

The Baroness 
does not violate the rules
but enters a realm, Bodenheim said,
into which they can’t pursue her …
A realm without rules
that could appear as Dada
but Dada could also be a desert,
a dead realm of dry distance.
It is not even that she alone 
of all the Dadaists “lived Dada,” 
lived Dada as Duchamp, Man Ray and Picabia 
did not, but that the Dada she lived
was never quite Dada, was
overtly apocalyptic, was in fact 
pure Expressionism, that 
final vision to which 
she bore such true witness
in an earlier, European life,
when she was a baroness only in spirit,
a baroness purely of the spirit.
And so in all matters 
regarding Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven
there resides what can only be 
called a spiritual quality
though one never so evident 
as in the most violent of
her antagonisms,
where she shone forth
as the living instance of
“a principal of 
non-acquiescence.” (Pound)

The Baroness,
with every gesture,
ecstasy and transcendence …
The Baroness and Wagner,
The Baroness and Stephan George,
The Baroness and Wedekind, renown for
masturbating on a Munich stage.
The Baroness and the lyrics her mother loved. 
The disdain of the Baroness is, ultimately, 
less the diffidence of Duchamp
than a clear indication of 
what Kandinsky 
called for, an art of 
“internal necessity,” 
an art that called forth 
“the purposive vibration 
of the human soul …”
The Baroness, 
as Djuna Barnes said, 
“irreparably 
German.”

The Baroness
before her entitlement
was prayerful,
an Art Nouveau Orpheus: 
in a forest, virginal, with lyre 
and halo in a field of flowers 
that could be nodding with 
narcotic glamour in the garden 
of Odelon Redon. As if for a moment 
she were secretly H.D., wandering 
in the woods of Rossetti
hushed, the trees all birches.
This is the sacred forest of Europe,
the green light of Celtic grail quests
and pre-Raphaelite agonies.
(Or, amid homosexuals in togas:
I am, the Baroness said, 
the berhymed adoration of 
a circle of acolytes, around the 
Weimar Mallarmé.) Still, here, 
in this painting, suppliant, 
androgynous, as if Orpheus 
were half Eurydice, as if 
Eurydice is lost within him or her, 
As if Eurydice is dead, as if
Eurydice is put to death, 
is murdered within, too 
feminine to live, in keeping 
with the adjuration of, let’s say
for the moment, de Saint Point,
the Futurist dancer and later 
convert to Islam, who said: “Let 
woman rediscover her 
own cruelty, the violence 
that makes her turn on 
the beaten, just because they 
are vanquished, and mutilate them …”



          *



Or perhaps all mythic hope
is in the end illusions, is a dead dog 
on a beach, a dog the Baroness poked 
with a stick, as Barnes observed, 
to see what it was made of,
and all possible futures find us
selling newspapers on the streets of Berlin
in the waning days of the Weimar.
Or will we all again be as a sylph 
in an entourage of aesthetes:
A brilliant, joyful sun, one says.
An unparalleled purity, says another.

Return, O Elsa Plotz, 
the classical soul of art to Italy. 
In Florence, theaters free of charge,
the doors of private galleries swing open.
By Mt. Vesuvius, above the Bay of Naples,
she sleeps in a hotel beloved of Nietzsche,
bedrooms with ceilings like churches, 
stairs, hewn rock down to the sea …
In Venice, she compels her way 
into a pornographic cabinet,
approaching the phalluses,
“as if they were antique lamps …”
The Baroness not yet the Baroness 
journeys far or not so far from 
her childhood Saturnalias on the Baltic:
“We slaughtered pigs. That’s what pigs are for …”
Finally, the Baroness not yet a baroness
is ready for New York, ready 
for rebirth in the new world,
ready for her apotheosis
as a splendidly offensive 
Demeter, in a hat 
“inconspicuously 
trimmed with gilded carrots …”



          *



The grotesque, a critic argues, is deeply congruent with Expressionist aesthetics, in which art exists around the poles of empathy and abstraction. Empathy when our relation to the world is untroubled, abstraction, when we have given up, when we seek redemption in form . . . 



          *



The Baroness
delighting as a child
in the cruel cartoons of Wilhelm Busch, 
the grandfather of the Katzenjammer Kids
“psychoanalytic before his time,” said Peter Gay.
The Baroness, a girl who especially cherished 
“Pious Helena,” a tale in which 
“a fading alcoholic beauty 
overturns her oil lamp in a drunken 
stupor, incinerating herself, 
then dropping into a boiling 
cauldron in hell where 
her cousin Franz, 
a priest, father of her twins, 
is waiting for her,” Peter Gay 
summarizes in The Cultivation of Hatred …



          *



The Baroness,
appearing in a dream to Bakhtin
so one imagines, to tell him God was a plumbing pipe … 



          *



The Baroness,
finally entitled, notes: If I eat 
I can eliminate — it is logic. It is why I eat. 
My machinery is built that way. Yours also. 
Though you do not like to think of it
Because you are not an aristocrat …



          *



The Baroness,
finally entitled, defends the
pornographer, James Joyce: Without him, without his help, 
she tells America, you would become 
less than a dog, a cow, a worm …



          *



Finally entitled
the Baroness was not, 
as one critic claimed, in herself
the mystic marriage of New York and Paris, 
but that of New York and Thebes.
Seeing as the Baroness
                           As Djuna Barnes said, 
is a citizen of terror, 
                   would that mean, 
                               and, as Barnes said it, 
could it not help but mean, 
a citizen of Thebes, 
                        a citizen of terror, as if of 
the ancient city that denied the god, 
that staged the entire drama of the arrival of Dionysus
that other death in reverse, without which western 
thought cannot be imagined.
In seeing the Baroness
we see Barnes as 
Tiresias, 
         Tiresias seeing 
the Baroness 
who is 
seeing the snake, seeing
the moment of 
union 
between man and woman, 
woman and woman, man and man, 
being and being, being and 
nonbeing, 
human and divine, 
self and soul 
who found a figure of the divine
in a piece of plumbing
which could be male genitalia
which could be the workings of the womb
which could be the valves of the heart
which could be a vortex into which 
rushes all our bodies are.

I am, the Baroness said,
the abode of terror and a snake …



          *



Such is the pathos of the expressionist self: alienated, it would be made whole through expression, only to find there another sign of its alienation … its utterance is less an expression of its being than an address, or plea to another … for even as expressionism insists on the primary, originary, interior self, it reveals that this self is never anterior to its traces, its gestures, its “body.” 



          *



Soul: his hair is molten gold and a red pelt
Self: he is vain, not gold. His soulless beauty makes me sad

Soul: his nostrils sweep like a scythe up to his cheek.
Self: cast iron, not even death, because death has at least been life.

Soul: hammered iron will quiver. Iron is alive to flame. Are you flame?
Self: I could be.

Soul: you know you are flame, and we are one.
Self: I am your fuel; you hinder my wish to touch …

Soul: We are artisans, we flare and are satisfied, and all you say is alas.
Self: I want him to step into you through me

And you will break him down, dissolve him, build him up, shake him, make him quiver, and two will be one, “as it was in olden times.”

(After all, the Baroness as much as asks
as she opens the inquiry into her own madness
in the pages of The Little Review, can one really be 
Dionysian without dialogue, without the imagination 
of a consciousness that does not know the god, 
without the division of perspectives, the imagination 
of ignorance of the god, of estrangement of, 
from, the god, of denial of the god, without 
the knock on the gate of the city, the promise of 
gentle pleasure, or a horrific immanence …)

Soul: Are not your eyes my fingers, do they not touch 
until they form his image in me

Self: I do not want his image, my fingers suffer, 
they are my eyes, my touch is sight, my fingers caress with a look

My eyes, your fingers, grow unsteady, dim
Soul: my body, you are making me sad. Go, leave …

(Here our text seems uncertain: does the soul ask
the body to leave, or has the body asked the soul to leave?)

are they saying now together: we must wait and smile,
I am thine body, mine soul, thine revolting body

I sing my soul, the Baroness writes

Reddish complexion, pale ivory, talons finely chiseled, finely carved animal, cast iron animal, chiseled animal, with hands, that never was born, I touch them, they quiver, I kiss them, they grasp, tear, draw blood

Cave animal, animal of shadow, around the edges it runs over with crimson, 

his hair is molten gold and a red pelt

golden eyes, eyes of a toad, hidden behind shining surfaces of glass,
jewels hidden in his head, a toad, a king on a read throne, dreaming he is a bee

is this the toad at the roots of the tree of the great work, Saturnine, associated with the First Matter, alchemical Baroness, her soul is a toad ugly and venomous, “Wears yet a precious jewel in his head.” As Shakespeare might observe … 



          *



Now we see 
the Baroness smoking 
pot in a china pipe “that must 
have held half an ounce or more …”



          *



Now we see 
the Baroness opening 
a scarlet raincoat: over her nipples, 
two tomato cans, held up with green string around her back
between the tomato cans, a very small bird cage
with a live canary …



          *



Now we see
the Baroness stripping 
the bachelors bare, the bride with red nail polish.
The Baroness is the future, Duchamp said.



          *



Now we see
the Baroness looking 
at me through her blue-white 
crazy eyes and saying: “are you afraid to 
let me kiss you?” I was shaking all over when 
I left the dark stairway, and came out on 14th street …



          *



Now we see
the Baroness, smearing
emerald paint on her cheeks
eyelashes of gilded porcupine quills …



          *



Now we see
the Baroness with ropes 
of dried figs around her neck,
in deep poverty, facing deportation, 
speaking to an embassy bureaucrat 
“rustling coquettishly” 



          *



Now we see 
how the click of her eyelashes 
make her, she says, irresistible …



          *



Now we see 
the Baroness expelled 
nonetheless from Germany, 
scheming to get a visa for France,
wearing a birthday cake on her head,
not long before her suicide …



          *



About a hundred years ago
in New York City, a woman 
from Germany became a Baroness 
became, possibly the last truly regal figure 
the earth could sustain, an entitlement
verified in city hall in 1913,
the year of the Armory show.
Scholars have yet to determine
If the Armory Show was 
In fact, her bridal shower … 
So: a woman from Germany
becomes a Baroness, and later, 
roams around gathering up outcast items 
and makes them art, brings together 
grain and metal and wood
in a way that explains
how the universe works
an immigrant, a Baroness, 
a woman, Djuna Barnes said, 
“undismayed about the facts of life,”
on whose cheeks might be found
on certain ceremonial occasions
streaks of mustard color
a woman who, on the way 
to her wedding, finds a metal ring
on the street, a sign of Venus
and her touch makes it so
forever, a woman 
whom it would not be 
unwarranted to characterize 
as abrasive, charming, devastated, 
frightfully hilarious, bringing her spectacular grief
at so much death and abandonment
to the forest of Manhattan 
of which Mina Loy 
once said: 
“No one who has not lived in 
New York has lived in the Modern world.”
the Baroness in the years of her honeymoon
and her grieving “amid the turmoil, 
Ezra Pound said, of yids, letts, finns, Estonians, 
cravats, niberians, Nubians, Algerians 
sweeping along 8th Avenue 
in the splendor of 
their vigorous, 
unwashed animality …”



          *



Williams and Stevens and Mina Loy 
are sleeping. The Baroness is in her basement
befriending vermin, granting sanctuary to insects
amassing the glories of a secret regency
stepping onto the street, arrayed, 
shaved, painted, dyed, bedecked
to bring art to America,
a country that, unfortunately,
was so given to mercantilism that
it might never be much better than a Jew …



          *



Now we see
the Baroness arriving
at a soiree for an opera singer
in a bright blue dress, a peacock fan, 
on her head, the lid of a coal 
scuttle strapped under 
her chin like a helmet
two mustard spoons 
hang like feathers 
beside her face
She knows the voice 
in all its throes,
intelligible and otherwise.
She has long known 
the dream of a total artwork,
that modernity could be transfigured
by a glorious ritual art, a new myth
could bring gods into being.
the Baroness knew what 
an aria could accomplish
had composed, after all, 
her own threnody, 
her own deathwail, her own
“metaphysical speculations on consolation”
in a language beyond language,
a pure lament, a music 
that anyone could understand,
that any grief could enter, that could 
recover, possibly, the soul blown apart by the world:

Ildrich mitzdonja — astatooch
Ninj — iffe kniek —
Ninj — iffe kniek —
Arrkarr — barr
Kararr — barr —

Arr —
Arrkarr —
Mardar
Mar — doorde — dar —



          *



At the soiree, the Baroness
had a chance to mingle with the stars —

I sing only for humanity, the opera singer said.
I wouldn’t lift a leg for humanity, the Baroness said …Editorial note: Jacket2 is very happy to present this portfolio of eleven new poems by Norman Fischer, which accompanies Zen Monster editor Brian Unger’s essay “Norman Fischer: A ‘test case for being.’”  Fischer was also the subject of PoemTalk #38, for which host Al Filreis was joined by Linh Dinh, Julia Bloch, and Frank Sherlock. — Michael S. Hennessey
 
Test Case
It’s quiet or in the quiet
Where the tongues of disjunction lick the arms of affection
And one plus one’s not two
It doesn’t follow from this …
All the strange words summon him
The strange arms embrace him
In the ever-persistent end-game
Where world’s objects pretend to lurk
They are not there
My hard-earned cash
Your vaunted self-esteem —
Halted, halted
Not a psychological fact,
This love like syrup poured upon a willing head
In a storm
In its wake. What pleasure is there
In simple deconstruction
Of all I think, feel
Let thought’s river flow
Uncanny occurrence
Test case for being
 
 
 
Odysseus Speaks
I sail to keep from crying
Or cry to keep from sailing
Truth is a lie, I lie
To find some truth
Memory is song: it works
By song, otherwise how re-
Member anything from within
Memory’s myth (the sirens know this)
The gods are memory’s memory
And I can’t live a single day
Without their song that means
Something but what
I speak to keep from sailing, crying,
Speak to lie to find some truth
Not making a quiddity, no word
Process but a meaningful, memorable,
Exhale, then an inhale,
Exhale, after which
Words pour forth, my darling lies
My oars, my foment
 
 
 
Forgiveness
What are we trying to get at here?
Would you hold that up so I can see it?
In remembrance of things
That are here in front of us
Looking right at us
In this case they remain themselves
Talking within earshot
Hydrants and honeysuckle,
Enjambed declensions
In the house, the garden
Where one belongs, place
Made of itself, “that was an experience,
I experienced it” and down you go,
Buried in time, or over and out,
Why pretend or boast?
She shot a look at him,
Determined to be seen, to be correct in that,
Determined analytically, crossing out
The parts that “don’t fit”
And fitting them in, they are not
Crossed out
In what vocabulary
Do I see the hawk
Shrug her massive shoulders
Do I see a blackbird,
Wing as whisper, fall
Toward roof-edge
To soar then set upon
The grass of the earth
Presence ensconced in words,
Demanded, scored,
Delivered as promised
Isn’t the world promising, green
Again, so why say anything?
I am quiet, still,
I persist
As the world ends
Together in that case
And tearing each other
Apart as we would want
Inwardness commences
It takes two to create life, it scares us,
We want to get rid of it altogether
Forgive us who know not what we do
 
 
 
And so to leave with a noteworthy swagger’s
Not lexically popular but anyhow’s an improvement over rote
Possibilities, this little cute pet person one is and used to be,
Like lint or steam or a curtsy for the queen
Something commonplace and polite
That ends when the many run amok convinced
The world was made for them that they seize it with their meat hooks like a chop
Purring all the while like a cat, cooing crooner lyrics
That saturate the airways and the waves
Till storms’ peaks droop over the whole show
Beginning at the beginning, just between the times of hope
That got cast out toward the edges of the lawn
Like lariats at a bar mitzvah
Or confetti at a masquerade ball —
Still, hope or hoop manages to compute
On the grand mathematical scales
As on the ones that obscure always
The eyes
 
 
 
Nothing Matters
Nothing matters
But the quality
Of the affection
In the end
Nothing matters
But the quality
Of the affection, how
Smooth, how
Rough,
Nothing matters
But the quality
At the end of
The affection, how it
Wears, its weal,
Nothing matters
But the survival
Of the affection
Rough or smooth
If it is possible
In the end
Nothing matters
But affection
One cannot speak it
One cannot speak of it
In the end
Did you expect
To go on
Forever, that we would
Go on forever
That there would be
No end to us
Our life here
As there’s an end
To anything
In the quality
Of the affection
Find the end
In the beginning
Savor that, its force
A satisfactory completion
Woe to them
That conquer with armies
Whose only right is might
 
 
 
Soap, Thyme, and Brie
I am human, I ring the bell
Behind the grocery or appliance store
Behind the bank or big box
Where the reprimanded people lurk
Was a complaint lodged against me?
With consequences to be meted out?
Truncating time so it didn’t count?
Confounding place so it didn’t sound?
The hyena calmly counting cactus stalks
On an abacus, someone commented that
“That’s the way it’s done around here”
But there was no sense that this was so
The hyena was simply improvising
Having been a bassoon in a previous life
Where did these various life forms
That came forth then come forth from?
Why, from inside (if there is an inside
Inside this contraption) does it all look
So different, so muffled and smoky
As if seen from a precipice in a dream?
These are critical categories in the shade
Echoes or murmurs in the sea-foam haze
The voyage out and no
Voyage back
Which is tougher
Where the band plays on
The march goes forth
Evoking ancient tales
What’s the motivation, the aura?
As we know, have been instructed,
That line of silent trees
Bears the burden forward
The need to be
Such as it is
 
 
 
Expensive Arrangements
It is indicative of the loose arrangements
That apply in this place
That those who pose as bosses
Don’t really know any better
And all the sophisticated prototypes
Have lately been misconstrued — all about
Themselves they heap their ribbons
And these flow on as if crystalline into the bare and tidy
Nights that give us all pause
And not a little glow, so that our friends
Can better see us as we leave
In a series of city blocks, arranged like long pegs
In baize drawers one loses track too quickly
Of the sense of things
The purpose for which this little hunting party
Has been organized
Which is why the others
Long for such clarified sentences
They want the clear demarcations
That money as money, hefty money,
Would provide and do not see the colorists
Are making themselves out to be
Anything but what they are, as if the shapes we see
Were the shapes they are, and they are not
But it’s impossible to tell —
If you stretch this cloth any tighter
I think surely your bell will crack
And where would any of us be at that point
Other than East of here
In the other language we spoke
Before we knew then what we know now
In a new convention
As clear as anything is
Despite all the gasses
 
 
 
If You Say So
Notorious urges urge us on to denials
But what’s the difference? Mere taste?
But what does one taste and why does one stand for it
Or stand in for it, for something
Or anything else
Does a word stand in for
What the word stands for and how dare a word
Stand if only on its own steam, on my two feet
Dearer by far, a sensation of balance and deterioration
Only once I say so to myself
So I am more humble
In recognition of the limits of knowledge
I’m continually impressed
By the ever-advancing range
Of my stupidity, how even what’s plain as day
As the nose on my face
Remains blind to me, won’t receive me
For all my filial chattering
What could this be, an age of huts,
Era of darkness even in midst of such
Information showers, such illuminating facts
I’m unsure of any delinquency on my part
For I have always been here as far as I am concerned
 
 
 
A Flatter Form of Research
What can be seen, which means what
You or I can say we see can’t be the limit
Or the norm of what may be as they say
“Out there” which I guess means it’s not me
Or you and we are not it which does leave us rather
High and dry and this is not a matter of opinion
Ah art, etc, to be improvised upon, a new-fangled form
Of investigation — one wants description
For it, the thing we are, the life, one wants verification
Of the pedigree but then that will never work
Will it, for clouds are only such in the world we know
Never the world beyond that world, the world
That makes the world a world by virtue of what’s not in it
Or of it or round it so smooth
It all comes down to a single stone
In the eye of the beholder
Now we have a brain over here
And over there a jar of water
Let us mix the two and observe the action
See it glisten and dissolve
Into rancor or desire for one wants
To be more than that — whatever that ever is
A pushing toward a limit which can’t be transgressed
Even on pain of nothing
 
 
 
Rugged Individualism
Here’s a dollar amount, a little regular parcel
To be pieced out into irregulars, militias
For the protection of the like-minded, the family
It must mean identity, “A is A, it is not B”
For how could “B” be “A” unless we decide to say so
It is not logical nor is it ordinary, it is precisely
Extraordinary that I am not I I am you or otherwise
The reverse would be true, see the terms unglue
Themselves even as we speak, as they tighten,
So that we never know who speaks or why
And can’t know how to listen, what to listen for
And therefore can’t interpret
But only fall slowly and desperately asleep
As did our ancestors
The minions of them that ate each other as they
Rolled their “r’s” to sound Irish or English or Welch
Lets eat our words like butter
There’s nothing dim about it, and this page isn’t full
Of things, it’s empty of them, all of them,
Stacks and racks and piles of them
I’m speaking of dishes, flatware, and enamel serving ware
The heft of it, the sound it makes
When shattering

На 30‑м году своей жизни …
Из старого стихотворения
На 59‑м году с сигаретой во рту,
 еще боле плешивый, вновь оказался на пороге двери
 лицом к заходящему февральскому солнцу,
 за которым собачья звезда на ветру нежно скреблась
 в предчувствии ночи
 и множество теснилось предметов,
 и каждый был дольше, чем глазу ресница,
 а также сияло
 стесненье имен, в разлученье
 которых взор проникнуть не в силах, —
 да и не нужно, — вне очертаний маятник вещи,
 перешивающий память.
 
 Однако солнце слабело, и его умаление
 раздвигало пределы прорех.
 Желтые лампы тлели навылет, и птицы с улыбками
 падали в стекла. Но звук отставал,
 а потом его было не слышно. Хлопок.
 И дело даже не в этом, не в повторенье того,
 что известно; возможно, в короткой догадке о том,
 что пятьдесят девять лет уместились
 в несколько строк, на дне которых мерцает
 проточная пряжа.
 (Жижа прозрачности и прощения; перечисления
 достигнешь конца, достигнешь бессмертия,
 воск в верху глаза под веком, конъюнктивит,
 кипарисы, даты прощания), —
 приумножение строк — сколько теперь? —
 не прибавят ни слова
 даже к первому слогу, не упоминая о выдохе.
 Иней ярче на ощупь. Терять нечего —
 разве что снег во рту, — поэтому не о чем говорить.
 А потому все как надо. О дальнейшем нет смысла.
 По многим причинам. И не спрашивай, пожалуйста,
 куда переехал, что взял с собой,
 
 кому пишу письма, каким уловкам отдаю предпочтение …
 
 мир настолько просторно сквозит,
 
 что в нем нет ни места, ни смерти.
 
 
 
 
 
 
For Many Reasons
En l’an trentiesme de mon aage
(from an old poem)
Fifty-ninth year, with a cigarette between lips,
 ever more bald, I again found myself on the threshold of a door,
 facing the setting February sun,
 the dog star in the wind made gentle scratching noises behind it
 in expectation of night
 as a multitude of objects thronged to,
 each of them longer than an eyelash to an eye,
 also there glowed
 crush of names, their fault
 the eye cannot enter, it hasn’t the force — and what
 would be the point — nothing delineates the thing’s pendulum
 that sews memory over again.
 
 Yet the sun was weakening, and its wane
 rendered rents more rotund.
 Yellow lamps smoldered right through, and birds smilingly
 dropped into windows. As for sound, it lagged behind,
 and then you couldn’t hear it at all. Clap.
 Still, even that’s not the point, not in repeating
 what we know already; it might be in the sudden surmise
 that fifty-nine years fit
 into several lines, over whose floor flickers
 the flowing yarn.
 (Liquid of clarity, charity; come you will
 to the end of number; come
 to immortality, wax under the eyelid, conjunctivitis,
 cypresses over vales, dates of valediction), —
 multiplication of lines — how many now? —
 won’t add a word
 even to the first syllable, if not for the exhale.
Rime looks bright to the touch. There’s nothing to lose —
except for snow in the mouth — so nothing to talk about.
That’s why all is as it must be. No sense speaking of what follows.
For many reasons. And don’t ask, please,
where I moved to, what took along,

whom I write letters to, what ruses prefer to rely on …

the world is so drafty and spacious

there is neither place in it, nor death.
 



 
 
 
A мне и не убежать никуда. Во-первых,
рассматриваю страницу, на которой это написано.
Во-вторых, разные фотокамеры, серебряные ложки, тени.
Буквы, которые расклеваны между теней, разное...
даже и отражение на всякий случай. Я вижу еще —
окно. И у меня болит голова. И она болит сильнее.
«Не убежать никуда» становится
неким оперным пением. А мне и не нужно
никуда убегать. Лучше — чтобы голова «пополам».
И петь, а лучше никого не видеть, типа «прощай»
тогда, — быстрее и легче. А иногда вина
и зеленый лист. Подержать в руках,
а потом зажечь сигарету.

 
 
 
 
And it’s not like I can run off somewhere. First,
I’m poring over the page this is written on.
Second, all sorts of photo cameras, silver spoons, shadows.
Letters that are pecked out among shadows, various …
reflections even, just in case. Also I see
a window. And I have a headache. And I have more of a headache.
“Not like I can run off somewhere” becomes
a kind of opera singing. Why should I even need to
run off somewhere. Better my head split “in two.”
To sing — better, without seeing anybody — something like “farewell”
then, it’s faster and easier that way. And occasionally some wine
and a green leaf. To feel it in my hands,
and then light up a cigarette.
 

 
 
 
Сны, которые видят фотографов 
шелкография для гипса ноги Анатолия Барзаха
«Умираем». Значит ли, что цветы никнут, как.
Означает ли, что крошатся многословием пепла —
а мы в других странах и нет паспорта,
транспорта, какая-то Касабланка, станция.
Тронь что-либо, а потом, много спустя,
после расслоится «тем временем».

Одно «лишь». Значит ли, что жест мерцает
сквозняком в переходах, где точке
не суждено преступить меру ряби,
когда ты равен сумме зрачка и влаги;
закат в ней вогнут залогом. Воздух темен —
кто дышит им? Черств и сомкнут.
Сух. Как пляж беспечен. Ты вообще — репейник,
матрица уподобления в устье цвета,
 
налет зернистый на языке, кислотная забава
послеполуденного расписания. Ключа латунного
на восковом шнурке отпечаток в стекле.
Лед ли, таянье — и то и другое
голубям привычно на аметистовых.
Впрочем, слова беструдны. С нами: «склоны», «пята»,
«счисление» соочередностей тетивы. Также
дурное пение. Да нет... вот и окно в полуметре,
рукой подать, — огромное,
как сухарь жевать деснами.
К тому же давно открыто... Ни прорезей крови,
бессмертие в ржавой извести. Ничто
не омрачает руку, тем паче белое поле тушью.
 



Dreams Photographers Appear To
a silkscreen for Anatoly Barzakh’s leg cast 
“We are dying.” Does this mean that flowers are wilting, how.
Does it mean they are crumbling with the prattle of ash —
while we are in other countries, without passports,
no transportation, some Casablanca, a station.
Touch anything and then, much later,
“in the meanwhile” will stratify afterwards.

Just “merely.” Does it mean that the gesture shimmers
like a draft in a passage, where a point
can never surpass the measure of ripples,
when you equal the sum of your pupil and moisture;
the sunset curled into it like a pledge. The air is dark —
who breathes it? Clenched and stale.
Dry. Like a beach, untroubled. You’re just a thistle,
an assimilation matrix for the stoma of color,

a grainy film on the tongue, acid amusement
of a free afternoon. A glass print
of a brass key on a wax string.
Ice or thaw — either one being
habitual to doves on the amethyst —
In any case, words give no work. With us are: “slopes,” “heel,”
“numbering” of bowstring co-oscillations. Also out of tune
song. Yet no … there’s the window
half a meter away, within reach — enormous,
like chewing croutons with your gums.
Besides, it’s long been open … No hemorrhaging,
immortality in rusty quicklime. Nothing
darkens the hand, no ink falls on the white field.
 

 
 
Agora 
Железная дорога. Несколько утративший очарование «предмет» представления? Либо явление, чьи границы ни в чем не определены. Вокзал, аэропорт, почтовая станция, узлы иной лимфатической природы. В не явственно выраженном, однако довольно известном месте между представлением и помышлением возникает «иная материальность». Не помню, почему несколько лет тому возникло желание заново «переписать троянскую войну». Сегодня кажется, это было необходимо, как и любая случайность, поскольку «дном истории» залегал «щит Ахилла» почти как затертая монета в песке под водой. У воображения дно предстает будущим отражением. Дело не в том, что едва ли не каждый брался за «описание» щита, а в том, что щит постепенно обретал черты «вавилонской башни», машины транспозиции. Затем вместо искомой фотографии несколько строк, не вошедших в книгу «Распределение», обязанной как собственному легкомыслию, так и незавершенности «троянской войны». Мне интересно не «к чему», а «из чего». Впрочем, это легко меняется местами.
 
 
AgoraBeyond the Helplessness Principle
Something will occur and at once it will be found
among other occurrences I know
that the heaviest dreams are only an illusion
I know it from experience I see my own
experience now that it is over
Of course it is still alive statistical
and divine
 
Later on the poem
does not ask me any questions
about my wife kids work and photography
I just let it drink
from the well Your water
is hard clear with a note of iron
it says and it drinks greedily
like some kind of refugee
heretic
 

 
 
 
 
Macroethicist 
I have come downstairs to get
something to eat
 
To rinse the throat To replenish the supply
of minerals On the wall
quiet and promising
lightly trembled one gigantic
drop of water
 
It has gathered into itself
dust a pill
a model of the ocean
a postcard from memory
Natural sediment
nutritious and well-balanced
 
Keep it I say
Don’t compile Don’t add to it
If it’s the leak
you’ve been waiting for wait
until you say something
 
 

 
 
 
Advanced Driving Lessons
Our lives are calculated
at one hundred and twenty kilometers
per hour or even two hundred
and if you stay hungry you can live
to be one hundred and fifty It’s in your genes
 
Our generation met in the corridors
of institutions where we work full-time
but we cannot be found there within the walls
of former headquarters of the secret police
which remember those times We call each other
and arrange for further canceled meetings
 
This is history and all this sugar is the result
of my travels Eight years ago in Greece
the ferryman gave me high blood pressure but I can sleep now
surrounded by sweetness In magazines they write so much about life
but we’re losing our position
because of a wave of new opinion polls
 

 
 


 
No Time
The world functions like a cooperative
Reciprocally It trades in literally
everything It’s lonely
and it travels with one piece of luggage
without moving No matter what you say
it’s already in the bag At least there’s always
some beginning and right away
a far-sighted sequence of events
The watch runs on bacteria and frost
appears grainy like in real life
as forecast but different
you can’t see it and there’s no
condensation to give it the fullness of a dream
in which the sense of touch the conductor
cancels the ticket What remains is the feel
of foreign languages Good morning
I am from here and there I am like a Dane
in Europa Like Eskimos in Antarctica How can I get
to the nearest place and can I have
a light I’m perfecting my tenses because they thrill me
to the bone They make me hot Past continuous
Future perfect Another difficult tense
is the present simple
 

 
 


 
Practically Speaking
Try to put yourself in my situation
when there is no situation Every day
I have to give my all and work for a living
Play for high stakes Sort through portfolios
that hold clues to sudden desires
attached to the bra straps and collarbones of women
Every day some sort of weather
corrects itself with us in the background
in which you can also be seen
as you put yourself in your situation
and try to comprehend the background of events
There’s a hospital in the background and cases of malpractice
finally reach an arbitrary limit
like longer verse forms
without the showy repetitions so obligatory
today A summons arrives
from the tax office and if you appear
at the appointment with the right official
notebook in hand you can correct
your record They’ll forgive you Everything
all the logistics will come into play
The cell phone ring tones will harmonize
and float through your mind as usual
like the juice of our practical experience
 

 
 


 
The Notary of Finitude
This lady and this gentleman are potential buyers
of one of the plots in our real estate listings
therefore they will acquire plotlessness
 
This gentleman is an important representation
of another gentleman’s interests
and so sometimes he has interests in representation
 
The figures gathered in the small yard
are parents But other plots of land
know them as parties to a conflict
 
Oh assets Oh groups Oh heavens
of interests Shed your light upon us
in our assigned plots
 

 
 
 
A Fairytale World
A girl with a bottle of bleach
is writing me a ticket for illegal
parking and she says that I am here for a check
for her impending death Her spirit
 
is making a deal with me that it will be haunting
the city sanitation department Mine is a police car
and the girl asks me once more
what time is it and the curfew
 
With a ticket or without you owe a hypothesis
which has not lived long enough to become obsolete
 

 
 


 
Realism Protocols A
You strand of virus that writhes at the tip of the penis
you sway the hosts of nations
 
You string of immune bacteria
researchers admire you and work harder more efficiently for you
 
You mutation that lurks in the nucleus
you are the gate to the future
 
You toxic particle that taints the nervous systems of the unborn besides the taste of local
            waters
you too are included in the calculations
 
You artificial currency over which nations wage wars thus encouraged to greater productivity
we bring you baskets full of the harvest
 
You spreadsheet from robbery so clean that it is invisible
I see your point and admire it
 
You violence unleashed on the sick and helpless
what else will you say
 
You grass, grass, grass, and grass again
vegetate on us you will not be sorry
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Realism Protocols B
 
You blob of mucus that I am
I greet you
 
You nicotine inhaling that shot through my parents’ entrails in days of yore
I bow to you
 
You lump of dust that has consented to assume my shape
I thank you
 
You knot of circumstance long dispersed into dirt and dust
Be hailed
 
 
You emulsion that peeled off the photographs of beloved faces and flowed into silicates and
           pyroclasts
You shine for us in darkness
 
You drool of dust courageously bonded by grease and sperm for a few hours before dry wind 
           blows
You nourish eternally
 
You albumin that has undergone numberless petrifications before you became a synapsis in a 
           child’s head
Glory be with you
 
 
You generous specks, lobopodia, rich phlegm, you particles converging from nowhere onto 
           this poem
Let us rejoice
 
Ovulation Blues
Nothing for it these days but Lipton tea with
chapbooks by Bohdan Zadura or practicing elocution
in front of the brown mirror.
 
At the bus stop, blowing your nose straight into
the trash, holding one nostril,
and in the Czech manner mixing up the bus numbers,
but it makes no difference: they both end up at the same place.
 
Nothing for it but washing your hands of everything
that matters and doesn’t, of all the lost battles,
once and for all. Accidentally breathing in the dust
from the soles of your shoes, by the street lamp a winking eye:
a run in your fishnet stockings.
 
They call this a wide frame of reference
if it means something to anyone.
 
Nothing for it these days but recycling bottles
for more emptiness, for more.
 

 
 


Graffiti
It could be another poem like this one: you go somewhere
leaving behind a scorched city, though really you were
the only one smoked out of there. The high voltage power lines between
us haven’t broken down. Beep beep, goes the telegraph.
 
“Read poetry or you will be fucked up.” Graffiti on the wall
of a music hall brings out smiles in the dark room
like photographs. (Nobody signed it. The least literal
of meanings is the only one that lasts.) When you’ve had
 
eight beers the next one no longer matters, the idea comes back,
a hiccupping drunken declaration: “Read poetry or …”
(In the morning no one will remember.) Another
bar where you’re just like a letter — all burnt up.
 
 

 
 
 
Recent Times
She came back to the starting point, beyond the light,
calm and certain. Optimistic about people and reading,
conscientious, at the keyboard six hours a day.
Winter is over, and the bottom line is that we got
 
through it warm. Numbed by the cold
I discover new forms: MTV without sound, a monthly magazine,
Your Cell Phone, a diary years afterward. The mess
aggravates beyond reason, the lack of cigarettes
 
is so annoying it’s funny. The pile of papers
contains one simple story, without a moral. A man
gets lost in the ending, the story is fragmented
and the point makes a small impact. Leave it, I’ll clean it up.
 
 

 
 
 
Class of 1994
Advanced French. Our bible is Sartre, our Faust
von Daniken. A new sensitivity is yet to come.
Sex hovers at the edges of enviable dates,
the notion of obligation we grasp vaguely, time relatively.
Some girls have the bad luck to understand to the fullest
the complexity of chance, others worry too much
about the fate of Leukon. The channels of perception will burst any day
releasing the fruit of the very first choices. We know nothing,
but already the end of our history is being written;
though each believes she can protect herself,
if not she will not —
 
 

 
 
 
A Long May
I can accept I can hand over my new life
you’ll express your opinion about it in a letter or in a while
unexpectedly sensibly when I start to think us
when they start to talk about us when you suggest
to them these are still adjustments speaking tactfully
vague impressions out of concern for me
because we do have intuitions sometimes so
what’s important is corpus christi is coming up my birthday
you’ll explain your decision unless you don’t want to
then I won’t insist I won’t accept I won’t hand over
I am a carrier now only that
  

 
 
 
Emancipation
A certain woman read a lot: feminists everywhere
put up a sign HEIDEGGER YOU KANT, no idea
why, for lack of something else to do? The 2000 dictionary
is silent on the matter, their drinks got cold, before going
to bed she liked to pour herself a nightcap. As a victim
of bad circulation (the second cycle) love made
her ill (you can’t make fun of illness)
but she was brave she went to war she blew down
a paper house, and then she dug up
the telephone in the park.
 
 

 
 
 
Not a Word
One two an omen’s due
dark woods I’ll go through
I’ll watch it all as I go
croaked the old crow
 
Far away a dream betrayed
two people one shade
your half my quarter
death baked the cake to order
 
Tick tock who’s gone
darkness waits beneath the limes
the sky it seems has gone away
over me the sky remains
 
Zip zap darkness light
I’ll have it all a while longer
the bad old crow died of hunger
it didn’t happen twice
 
 

 
 
 
Scenes from a Good Day
Yes I was even from birth a daughter an engineer
a love of perfection and a fondness for details
with difficulty I choose with the glue of chance that has no taste
sometimes even Mohammed must go to the mountain
 
sometimes even Mohammed must go to the bathroom
no one is a prophet in his own bathroom
the world hardly tries to provide me with an episode
in someone else’s life yet unfortunately such scenes

People Are Bad
People are bad. Let him know, the one who dreams: he’s wrong.
Even in a dream they boil tar that rhyme stirs.
The tar made of names and hearts is boiling; we made love today in
the poplar dust; we waded in hills of leaves,
 
by the playground, in a dream. Without swearing until the end;
the sun will throw down leaves; the hurt song will awaken
a call for blood. People are simply bad. Newspapers give you to edit
just like a death contract. This park is clenching into a fist.
 
They aren’t bad at the bottom of their hearts, no. They could have loved
you even; but to read? No, none of this: From
a veil, her black train, she made curtains out of it (and
she knows and I know), you know: People are simply bad. They will dig
 
a hole for you, wherever you want. Each one will throw you a little clod
on the surface of the lid, which will stifle sound. They peck pigeons
and they will fondly recite the poem from your letters; they will bring back to life lying
and fading tears. It’s not enough for you? So go to sleep, people are only bad.

after John Ashbery
 
No charges of treason — yet — so the property
 remains untouched if not untaxed.
 And surely bigger banks and asses have been broken
 in half or into, making for happy thieves.
 Timeless hands have made valueless change.
 (Honey, here you are with a toothpick
 when what’s required is a meat cleaver.)
 The TV trays are all set up, dinner’s in the oven,
 There’s raspberry trifle for dessert.
 A robe awaits wearer, hangs limp and ill-formed,
 gathers light and stillness and regrets.
 
 The logic of wicks made for a proper burn,
 patches of light illuminating the gray,
 the house seems lighter if no less solemn
 now that the departed has returned home.
 The diary contains cries of every color,
 an orchard of thorn and briar and bane.
 The academy of the future has closed doors.
 It is unwilling — books banned, curtains drawn.

Coleman’s “In No Time at All,” written after John Ashbery, is a powerful ars poetica. Coleman’s poem shares a core value with Ashbery in its resistance against that which is “fixed” in place. Further, it may be that Coleman saw something of her own independent vision in aspects of Ashbery. The poem’s second stanza reveals more germane as well subtle affinities between both poets. She writes: “The diary contains cries of every color, / an orchard of thorn and briar and bane.” Yet Coleman’s poem and its aesthetic verve are distinctly her own. Her uncompromising voice reaches off the page: “(Honey, here you are with a toothpick / when what’s required is a meat cleaver.)” And from the first to the closing lines, as in so many of Coleman’s most striking poems, the stakes are of the highest import: “No charges of treason — yet” and “The academy of the future has closed doors.” It is an honor to publish Coleman’s poem here. — Thomas Devaney and Marcella Durand— Robert Duncan

Or to turn again to what we have known
by other days —
                                   come home
                                   to this house and yard —
                                                                                    the eye
                                   into the spring immediacy
                                   of images, lanes, right turns, old
                                   hedge rows and stone
                                   fences, fields simply —
 
                                   the eye opens not by night’s
                                   or day, day’s
                                   or wished open for,
                                   but that we are turned
                                   to — I do not know when
                                   the clouds will cover or uncover
                                   the sun (moon) but wait in its shining
                                   to see the leaves veined
                                   taken from the pear tree, dirt
                                   dug up by the hose nozzle
                                   watering the flowers.
 
You are
come home. Till it
opens, but come
 
to where it opens
 
                                        Having crossed
the street, or the whole country, distance
that has been carried
in me, wasn’t it? the crossing
back
 
is to myself — simply
to this Fort Scott
or this house and grass on S. Eddy, that
will be lost back again at leaving them,
 
but to myself in them.
 
Or this would not be so simple,
or this would not be
a homecoming, or I would not
have seen again, what looks by now
The eye opened
 
                                                                      Open the gates
                                                                      And the flowers
 
                                                                      must be watered
 
 
2.
 
The people I love are
only in the distances.  — The red
field of blackberry thickets to cross
in an empty lot, a backyard
 
in another city, stays with me. —
To even think of those few people, last nights
seen, across the table, eating, or
at some last noon meal, out of a window,
 
driving away. And the photograph
carried, I have walked out of,
even the red leaves of those berry vines
have torn what old pants and the legs
 
through them, again? I have
come home, walked through
whatever that distance was I had like a wall
in front of me, into a calm there, old references,
 
relevances, the opening of the clenched fist to go home,
old house and town grown up from,
in me.  And the people I love,
are in what distances now?
 
                                       *
 
                       They come down from the city
                       and look over the old town again
                       and knock it, crank out
                       the whole lot of hard words, or the empty
 
                       ones about old times, old memories, old
                       buddies gone off, great times. But get red,
                       and drink beer, and fed up enough with it,
                       go back home.
 
              I even feel, coming back to Fort Scott,
              even the same
              visiting of relatives, my father, and enjoy
              his house for a while, as easily, not my own
              living room and icebox
                   (Relish the ease, and
                     settle the relatives
 
                     for another year) —
 
              If there were no focus here, of what
              to look into, it would be the same
              as that (if there had not been
              the try, in other places, the whole world
              already, or the tries already    here, back from the Army
              wandering around in the rain? —
                   They don’t have
              coming back to the old / home / town
              from wherever, other city,
                   or have
              even in the home they’ve made — job, family,
              or these streets,
              where there is no light to focus
              or care about a light.
 
                                       *
 
Love, for what people, finally?  Can I
restrict it?  come down
to say there is no light to focus
in those people, names after names I read
in the News Briefs in the paper, come back
to visit —
 
                     or into (as certain as) this
old land come back to, my own
past’s references still flowing here —
To what people come down
those references?
 
The people I love, the people
I do not even know — in all
 
their distances. What light
I can even see to see
If it is or is not there
 
Where the figures are
in the landscape. And when I
come to them, wave
as if across a field
 
To meet
yet, in this landscape, in these
flowers, quiet,
opening and closing in the backyard —
 
the distances where are
still the people I love, where love
is, to come to as certainly
 
as this house.
 
 
3.                                                                           for Elie
Otherwise, what am I talking about?
 
The lines of the fields I knew as a child
from books I read,
run on down to the sea
north of Boston.
 
I cannot see you there now. That
was the first drive
into the country of my mind
come real. I only see you
 
over and over on the bed,
out of the sunlight in that room, sweated.
That before, might as well have been
as imaginary as that land. It is out of that
 
we can come back to each other? Or find
whatever country — even in the other room
of that apartment — we were not in before, is
its own unknown country, or land
 
thought of as so well known, its real
face was never seen before, our own,
opening into each other, only now
in this distance, separated, we come to.
 
Or else, what am I talking about,
where is the fire of flow of
all relevances
that goes on and on, I am come home to.

The kids across the alley still lose themselves in the hollyhocks,
in the next block from their own
is another country — and the country
is what is still left, age or not, mine
 
or their own Now, flows, the way
streets run here, or the constant going and coming
of their dad’s car back there,
and goes on off all directions from this town.
 
I look west
                            (is the next block)
 
                            I look right inward, only
                            to be expert in home cosmography
 
cross the border,
hasn’t ever stopped under this town
since it was founded, the flow
under the efforts stationed on it —
 
where I have found my bloodstream pulse
countable, the grass does not end,
where the eye is opened
in me, and the heart
 
beats home to.

Cambridge, Mass.                        — Flow wonders.
                                                    As words, the generative meat music of their materiality 
and consonance of their inner contours. As worlds, his own, from Harlem and before and 
after, as well as those drawn from those inexhaustible interior wellsprings, revealing new 
ways of thinking and living.
                                                                                                                             Bars, bridges, Baruch
 Spinoza, Babel; polymathy, phalluses, subtle patterns, prose; toilets, theories, Times 
Square, tales; möbius-essays, piss-stained crotches, bitten nails. He pierces the sweat 
flesh of the known and unknown, always witting, for there is no concept or idea that 
remains impermeable to him.
                                                                                                              What is speculation, one of 
his fortes, but the capacity to raise one’s antennae to the invisible, to divine what hovers 
on the other side of what’s near or far away? What are ideas, which he wields with a 
magician’s legerdemain, but the thing seen or unseen, at the level of abstraction?
                            What is fiction, which he creates as an indelible art, but the conjuration 
and extension of the metonymic beyond the limits of an individual life or experience? 
What he gifts us with in his life and work is another set of eyes, multiple bodies, psyches, 
desiring into and through the deepest subterranean veins of feeling.
                                           Following his paths through myth, memory, language, sex, affect, 
something new always coloring into our vision. Critique, comics, Çiron, camp; Fiedler, 
Foucault, foreskins and Yoni rings, fucking; Aptor, aporia; newels and stairwells, 
Neveryóna; genius, the Georgia utopia of the Dump, generosity.

John Keene, “In the Rhizome” (detail).Sarsaparilla: a Calypso
 for Ivor Indyk

Fifty years past, for a fact,
on some semi-rural tract,
lived a man whose prayers asked, “Boss,
what on earth can follow Voss?”
Question answered, thus he wrote
(as my ballad shall denote)
in his hardly elfin grot:
Riders in the Chariot.
 
Riders in the Chariot,
ev’ry page a new bon mot,
“t”s to cross and “i”s to dot,
Riders in the Chariot.
 
Through market gardens, orchards, hives,
kids would ask on Sunday drives:
“Who’s that curmudgeon in our sight?”
Dad would answer “Mr. White.
Son of the squattocracy,
he breeds dogs with Man-oly.
(Two grown men in double cot
dreaming of their chariot.)”
 
 
So either side of Showground Road
Patrick mined his mother lode:
Brick veneers throughout the land/
Yahweh in a grain of sand.
No pink elephants or snakes,
His were visions like William Blake’s.
What he saw was what we got:
Riders in the Chariot.
 
Assailed by egos and by ids,
asthma, A.D. Hope and midst
encroaching avenues and streets,
see him back outcast elites.
Civic fathers earn rebuke,
Rose Bay matrons make him puke;
this pitiless dun-colored lot
won’t see any chariot.
 
Lest we forget, come Eastertide,
Himmelfarb gets crucified.
Isn’t that the way it was
mateship-style in fifties Oz?
Abos, poofters, refugees,
there’s a limit if you please …
What a copy book to blot,
they no ride our chariot!
 
 
On through Menzies’ days and Holt’s,
Patrick logged up minor faults:
countless friendships never stick
(what a temperamental prick!).
Laboured syntax? Let it pass.
Can’t quite “get” the working class.
Down at the dump though, smoking pot …
Riders in the Chariot!
 
What the fury? What the fuss?
Poor man’s not quite one of us,
till he tops that Nobel poll
(one year after Heinrich Böll).
Now a nation in his debt,
and with all the world to jet:
Pan Am? Qantas? Aeroflot?
He’ll stick to his chariot.
 
Forty plus years down the track,
stretched on Johnny Jackboot’s rack,
with ev’ry reborn Philistine
tuned to Seven, Ten and Nine,
lapping up each dumbed-down stunt,
through it all we still confront
Australia’s God Almighty What?
Riders in the Chariot.
 
Riders in the Chariot,
ev’ry page a new bon mot,
“t”s to cross and “i”s to dot,
Riders in the Chariot.

Fingers
fingers i stroke you look
i gasp, tingle
i want, i want, i want

i look, you smile
you kiss, i melt
you kiss, stroke scars on scars
you kiss, stroke skin
you kiss, stroke ears
you kiss, hold close
your kiss, inside
me
your love
i want, i want, i wantLove is Ever So Lovely
She is loath to but still she comes
down the ladder saying
love
Saying this pleases her lips
and other lips are pleased as well,
smoothing the progress of a
kiss:
a bit of wire deftly wormed into a
small but lively keyhole. Which in turn leaves the door ajar
for a break in
0 becomes ∞, and even though there’s still a distance
even though she’s not yet fully willing, still
she uses it to hollow out a hole, to lay, as it were, a land-
mine
Doing this she pleases her hands
and other hands are grateful
which thus enables an
embrace:
doubled pairs of coupling serpents coiling up
as if to bathe in the air
Sharing this bath, they blow a 0 into ∞
steadily
evenly
and so
double
their capacity to bear this
display
so pleasing to the eye

 
 I shall never be lonely again, because of the love that dwells
      within poetry’s mouth
Music gives the transmitters a workout
which, once coaxed, no filters fit.
This song is an old misfortune.
I have spent my life trying
to stay out of my own way
I was caught by a tremor of strings
mingled with traffic
 
Work ethic notwithstanding
I ripen in your hands
the fruit of labor’s love.
 
What sieves through consciousness
dances in a borderless zone
between first and second natures
humbling the proclamations of  State
 
I will not be your lamb tonight
who ladles the moon another broadcast
there are 3 sides to every coin
and who are angels to the eye transfixed
are alchemized and otherwise melted down to earth 
      where I first learned
Silence is my Mother Tongue
and Song my Second Language.Suite from Final Theory
 
“… in this language there is nothing weird about the histories of physical systems.” (Steven Weinberg, “The Universes We Still Don’t Know”)

Understudy/starring 
 
At dawn, the mess of trees produced stars.
The radio news gave thanks for another — found the week before, 300 times our sun.  
They said it could be hauled closer, to understudy our panting source.  In classrooms 
children drew the procedure, of colossal ropes and lake-sized mirrors.
 
As morning dropped
the stars forced through the leaves, joining together
inhaling space. 
                              Once during a Roy Anderson film I saw celluloid burn that way.
                              First, the sound departed and the room went still; then, the shimmering
                              rocking screen like heated oil; before a dark pupil burst the scene and 
                              grew.
 
*
 
                                                                                                             They stopped the moon.
After the tide, paddocks were styrofoam pinned with spines of radiata; odd stumps, 
caked with gold to bring their detail up on tourist film.  Without its flow the coast 
halted, and let them hold the soil together a little longer.  We all lost that sinking 
feeling. 
Over the curve rolled the rhythms of jets.
From the passenger windows,
the unmoved detritus of the old harbours, and a soft floodlit earth.
 

2.
 
There are only layers, stuck through with time’s arrow like a Valentine.
Its splinters sinking
distant resolutions
to return
shear
to the water,
cumulus sponge
 
X
 
Through, down to the drift valley
of twisted, scissored glass
its grains itch
 
X
 
White speed, sleepless piff.
We woke to cars
churning the road
from mountain to sea.

3.
The Dependency
 
The sea bloomed under 3 million tones of desert dust — its low bed drove
right off the coast             onto the waves, seeding itself.
 
The sea will come back to us, if we can wait.  Don’t die, you say.
I shrug, Okay.  I’ll wait until the desert breeds tides; your camera might sink
but we’ll be the negative itself, the holotype.
 
*
 
As the peak dragged away, a few strands of hair
clung to its back
crackling the radio to dust.
The wires traversing its wake zone
so strong at first
cut into gradual forgetting.
They gestured to a final perspective
 
End-point was only an idea, though, which dissolved
the sharpening arrival of the distant
ranging sheet of light.
 
*
 
We took the desert road.
Reluctantly handing up its palms of fire, the plain of hard blonde grass
for the purposes of (light) was white and black, on black.
                                                       The road slunk.  Movements on the tar
wormed their way brightly to the other side, seeking a spot beyond the dislodged 
crust.  We crossed a few
facing the peak
on their chests, eyes downcast against the red.
 
*
 
Raw trajectory rendered imagination redundant; the speculative line had no place.  
That new space was dense with actuality.  Its absurd dimensions became acceptable; 
for instance, everything was middle ground.
Distance arrived from above and stayed until cloud locked us in.
 
*
I went into the centre of the cloud.
I waited.
The floor closed, held and closed.
It might have been a grinding cave.
The below-ahead.
Already the floor had opened.
I had given east and west.  I had parted into.
 
*
 
Clearing: one way, the scorched basin, the spring
after the catastrophe; another, woundedness, its open-ended reasons
making disaster run.
 
Filling: both islands are paths.
Our images will ride                        once/now/then/there/oh.
A Personal History of A Clockwork Orange
 

(i)
 
In nineteen seventy-three,
the year I turned six,
I was taken to see my first
 
James Bond film, Live
and Let Die. Nervous
beforehand, I asked
 
my brother, five
years older than me,
if I would like it.
 
‘Yes, if you like violence,’
was his answer, or how
I remember it. ‘What’s violence?’
 
I asked him, looking
forward to the warm
dark of the cinema.
 
Earlier that year, Mad
magazine had run a parody
of A Clockwork Orange, in
 
which the audience are
made physically sick by
what they have witnessed.
 
My brother, who bought
Mad, would sometimes
let me read his magazines
 
for money. One day, whether
for money or not, I can’t
remember, I looked over
 
the parody, understanding
nothing, no doubt. Some years
later, I talked about the film —
 
still unseen — with my brother
and a friend of his. The friend,
eager as a toddler, sketched
 
out the rape scene for me,
or for himself, or for my
brother, noting the three
 
points of the woman’s red
jump suit that Alex cuts
when he is about to rape her:
 
left tit; right tit; cunt.
 
 

(ii)
 
In the early nineteen eighties —
my Bowie years — the soundtrack
to A Clockwork Orange made
 
its way around my circle of friends,
briefly turning one into a Beethoven
fan. The soundtrack, released in
 
nineteen seventy-two, was by Wendy
Carlos, who gained fame for Switched-
On Bach in nineteen sixty-eight when
 
still Walter Carlos. Her synthesised classics
sounded queasy to me, so I preferred
Bowie, unaware that his Ziggy Stardust
 
persona was a camp parody of
Alex and his Droogs (‘Ultraviolence
in Liberty fabric,’ as the man said).
 
Unaware, too, that Andy Warhol —
about whom Bowie had written
a song — had beaten him to it, buying
 
the rights to A Clockwork Orange
in the nineteen sixties, filming the
novel in black and white as Vinyl:
 
the homoerotic S-&-M re-education
of a juvenile delinquent, Victor,
who dances to ‘Nowhere to Run’

In nineteen eighty-two
I went to a screening of
A Clockwork Orange at the
 
Western Australian Institute
of Technology, with its brutalist
architecture and engineering
 
students. The night was cold.
The film had an R rating, so
I was under-aged, though
 
no-one cared. I was with friends
who believed that only Federal
police could make an arrest on
 
a university campus. They were
all stoned. The audience was
almost entirely young men.
 
They laughed through the film’s
first fifteen minutes: a homeless
man being attacked, two gangs
 
beating one another up,
and the gang-rape of a woman
inside a house called ‘HOME.’
 
I was fifteen years of age, the
same age as Alex. I had finally
seen the film. All the laughter
 
confused me, made me
feel picked on. What had
something wrong with it:
 
me, the film, or the audience?

(iv)
In two thousand and five
I saw A Clockwork Orange
for the last time, with the poet
 
Maria Takolander. The previous
year we had married. We had
bought a Magnavox DVD player
 
for sixty-nine dollars and we
were working through the
films of Stanley Kubrick
 
in our usual way, methodical
or obsessive. Maria did not
like A Clockwork Orange.
 
It made her feel ill, as predicted
by Mad magazine the year
she was born. We talked it
 
over in the uncanny night, our
house suddenly over-lit and alien,
and then we went to bed. Our
 
shared sleep — free from history’s
horror, the mistakes of childhood,
and the turmoil of others —
 
a blessing in the moon-coloured night.The World
The world is not outside, it’s here
In these trailers where every hour of the day
War and terror, love and laughter
Heroes and demons, celebrities and children
Flying or floating through
Prehistory or futurity
Pass before our eyes like ghostly visions
Myopic and heavy with sleep
The world is here
Inside this endless spectacle of
Formulaic teasers
No need to even buy a ticket
You can stand here and watch them for hours
And in every single one they all speak English

 The Whole Creation
for Harold Bloom
I still believe in it, though I don’t know who else does.
I first experienced it in the building I have an office in now
And called it poetry, but the word was just a placeholder
For something undefined, though that’s too simple a way to put it.
You aspire to what you admire, whether you understand it
Or not, and now that I’ve retired into it, I want to remain here
In my home away from home, roaming without sadness
Through the whole creation, through the long song of myself.
Some days I wake up in a room suffused with sunlight
“Like a yellow jelly bean,” as Jimmy Schuyler put it
In his great poem “Hymn to Life,” but it’s not that kind of day.
There was a blizzard overnight, and everything’s shut down,
Including my seminar, and so instead of ruminating on that poem
I’m fooling around with this one, and looking out the window at the snow.
What is poetry anyway? It falls like snow, and settles where it falls,
And melts. I thought I was going to wake up in another world,
And so I have, but it’s the one where I began. The sunlight
Just came back, as what begins in gladness and uncertainty matures
Into a kind of baffled happiness, unfinished and complete.
I have the sense of something constantly receding, the way
The future does, then suddenly returning, like the past.
It’s all so confusing, and yet it doesn’t bother me —
Everything evaporates, but some of it eventually comes back
In the uncertain form it assumed in the first place —
A remnant still intact and seemingly as distant from me
As the books in the library I keep remembering and looking up,The Anaglyph
Hasn’t the charisma leaked away from the café crowd, and that other
Authority, the Salon des Refusés? I have forgotten much of
That old sack of enthusiasms and snake-oil recipes, the way
You have forgotten your own childhood, since
You woke up just in time to watch the adults disappear
From the world they had bequeathed us. It seems the scenery all around
Is hilly and unfarmable. Being brilliant has been reckoned
Into a procedure by some old guy, with a motto that is
More fitness, less flab. I hanker to go back to the land.
This means ruin to the culture-watchers. But the basic
Principle of my ambition is to be one excessively distracted
Entity at the mercy of the lurid, blurred and half-perceived
Motions of the Martians at the Halloween Hop. Fake? They sure are.
Summer is called Humidor here, the month of damp draughts.
The tale of my attempt to farm stubborn soil leaked from
Untruth to legend, my unlikely phase of boy-scout honesty being
Before I came to the big city. Here behind the tiny horological waterfall
Drums amplify the fun, but only at nightfall, then just for a moment
Of horrible error as I clutch the wrong person’s hand. That was true,
Only I said it wrong. Ugh. Now watch my serpentine
Gesture as I withdraw my hand, only to replace it with a congruent
Message that attempts to excuse this tactless fact,
Tearing at the sky over Twenty-second Street, but
The sky leans nonchalantly against the coop — I mean “co-op” — about
As graceful as a cowboy leaning on a chicken co-op — I mean “coop” — who either[1]
Has an anger management problem or is under the influence of a form of
Some anxiety that eats at him. I’m not the fly-away
Marrying kind, nor a grumpy bachelor with a broken heart whose pieces
Are seen scattered over the range. That begs for an independent
Yet symbolic judgment from the Judge now alighting from the caboose, whose arrival
Whether timely, to the tick of a caesium atom, or tardy, has to be
Seen to be believed, like
The face of a hunter in the dim mirror killing a bear. As
Nostrils give away suppressed anger by flaring, so an argument
That is over leaves traces — nervous twitch, grimace. It
Is impossible to hide my feelings, I guess. Look ahead,
That effervescent persona and its emotional lurches and rocketings
Affected so much, and its magnum opus that was called
By another name is now the old school-teacher’s chief creed and belief,
Or something very like it, gleaming in the rain. Hold up that light.
Has it shone on the tenebrous backyards yet? Or yet admitted that
It is unable to illuminate the wasteland of wet barbecues, so much
Of its fuel has flared and lit up the landscape … this project, I admit that
It is like gutting then refurbishing a friend’s apartment. Now, are
The reply and the echo done with? I asked a redundant question, and
That answer suffocated it, as a firmly pressed pillow
Has choked a banker, but no one knows whodunnit. That whole thing
Of returning to my sources, raking through my prototypes until
The last blueprint is found and seems just right: perhaps this is
Peace — a crowded peace — under the hot sun.
That we are afraid of it — inhabiting a reputation, the whole thing
About establishing who you genuinely were — are — I’ll admit. There
You hope your opus will be taken for legerdemain, but your effort sinks
Deeper into the mulch of history, while I adjust the mask that
Just fits more loosely every decade, and then I add up the little
That memory leaves me, a kind of pittance, the totality
Mustered and gathered … a look of boredom in a young person’s eyes,
And all those hopes and struggles are quite lost.
Accents and dialects distort them, once again.
To have escaped from a tangle of difficulties, from
Nothing but obstructions, into a glowing absence
And then to take a deep breath and plunge into
Those crowded riverine cities, greedy for contact with ghosts that are
Precisely what we want them to be, our plans furthered,
Seeing alphabet soup spell out the aleatory message and the time,
Casting caution to the winds and the weather — sorry, welter
Of neighbors, barking dogs, traffic cops in a dreadful confusion.
And permit me … no, commit me, please, while the cops are standing
Around chewing the fat, and pray that these
Moments miss you like a whistling arrow. Thunk! The old tapir tapered
Into the bar: a Scotsman, an Italian, and a capybara — I’ve heard it. But
Wasn’t the story of an Eskimo inside an eviscerated bear like this?
The fact that he “inhabited’ the smelly bear-skin … I feel that
Neither brave feats nor stories about them can cut it.
Did not a Dandy Dinmont yap? I deliberately stayed
This way, spiritually a hunchback, drooling and gaping at the stars
That promised ashes and diamonds and nourishing food all the way,
As though clambering inside an animal was simply the reverse
Of some method of becoming notorious. My cheating heart is known
Once its modus operandi is — among the cognoscenti — firmly established.
The look of a man is the man, Buffon said, and style a condition
Of those whose reputation is a handbag and whose blindness
Was being talked about even in Paris: a troubling myopia, so
That their left and right perceptual fields, red and green, slowly separated,
Only to hitch up again, like inspiration and perspiration. Go on, shout
And be heard. Is this anaglyph what I really want? My declamatory
Nature was made to seem just a yokel act. I must admit it is
Not without a certain eau-de-cologne charm, insinuated the farmer. And yet
An invisible dread prevents me making love to you among the previsions,
Then the post-visions that afflict me arrive, fits of
The assurance Baron Corvo had an excess of, a crowing assurance[2]
Which tainted his career, under the blasts of air conditioning,
Whatever. There on the bank statement
At the beginning of the Age of Façadism was a catalogue of waste.
A dumb waiter brought me the tablets and a note about the projected
After-effects: they may amplify the symptoms instead of curing them,
Though Frederick Rolfe was never cured. This
Emptiness will do fine. Just pop it in a doggy bag, thanks. Did you say “previsions”?
Was that a mispronunciation? “Provisions,” maybe, held
Too close to the chest, a fake poker hand of fate. The fireworks, they
Ended with a fizzing Roman candle sound that frightened the guest who was
Intended to rescue Gertie McDowell from that dirty old man. It’s
Gesture that fills out the role, as water makes the weather.
It was stupid of me to harp on the sadness
Of that animal’s demise: I should forget about the feeling
Which resembles taxidermy at midnight on an empty highway.
A telescope brings us a soothing view of distant mountains
And all the mountain people. Who knows where they’re going?
Moving from crag to cave to avoid the night
There, which is really ghastly when it comes on.
Beside the darkness, each farmer carries his own personal
Landscape around inside his head, a “landscape” being
What surrounds your idea of yourself, it’s so
Honorably framed, but presented in a Potemkin-village spirit.[3]
There was a vast electrical disturbance just outside the walls.[4]
Each time it’s different, down through the centuries
For the sake of cultural improvements they repeat a dream that
Continually gives out a soft fluorescent glow, it was
Like standing on the prow of a moving ferry in the morning
With the spray bursting all around
And a feeling of nausea mixed with ecstasy washing over me. In a way
The whole experience was fake, except for the scale.
Really, what do Eskimos think of giants?
Not too much, I reckon. They say they like them.
A moment later they’re saying how needlessly big they are. But
Also they are likely to flatter them. A cloud of dust
Or whirling fragments resembling a mistral rises up ahead,
But no one understands it: the old verbal torrent
In new guise, transformed into a sheaf of falling leaves, which
Are gathered up, bound, and stuffed into a briefcase,
And it’s time for coffee and a Strega at Il Miglior Fabbro. When[5][6]
Acts of killing fill nightmares and movies, only the calm
Of this bibulous routine can bring surcease. Then the shreds
Of another adventure assemble: a tour of the old college premises
Undertaken to the tune of the jig “From Rochester he came hence,
A writ of Cease and Desist clenched in his teeth.” Here, see this,
Like a pistol on a silver platter, it’s all yours
And it was mine once. Take it, go on. I kept it because
It had been handed down, and I had hoped it might be my insurance
Against the waves of devoted fans inefficiently
Seeking to take over the social scene and then the whole world.
The round platter, alas, has always been covered with dust,
So small it can hardly hold the pearl-handled revolver reclining on it.[7]
Thereafter it should be passed on to other worthies, noted by
The comfort of strangers they fail to offer you, or me, even.
Like the wily coyote, I’m no sleep-abed; I tried all
The most difficult forms, even threnodies ending with the words
“After all” or “Never mind!” And in my fine eye-rolling frenzy I almost
Exaggerated my métier into an obligation. This,
It seemed, was the way to build the future. But it was
Not likely to allow me to escape the whirligig of voracious time.[8]
After all, tempus fugit however we might chase it. Indeed,
All kinds of regret sprinkled my breakfast as the slant angle of
The day lit up the diner and the light began to increase
So that I was dazzled, then I heard a loud thump, dull, heavy,
Like a polar bear falling over, and the hunter saying something
Not quite obscene, but close enough. Criminy! The way
Things fade away, le temps perdu seems to be the point
Of this rodomontade. Does a traditional verse form simply provide
A protected place for the poet to plead the case for his vital
Concern for la vie littéraire, or is it a carapace, a palace?
And you can meditate there all summer long.
It was a little insight I had, one of the world’s smallest.
Distant requests annoy me. The Poetry Club may be ultra-sensitive
But its supine and self-serving acquiescence
To the demands of those creeps … okay, that’s in the past
And it belongs there and I promised not to whine. But oh, how
The past haunts me, its vapid fashions, the rigmaroles … they wish
But also harangue, that’s why I resent them, the ones I talk with.
And in this way my paean to non-discovery
In brittle yet oracular verse persuades us, but nevertheless
The map you provided was helpful in leading us beyond
Madness to something better: squatting in Circe’s mansion. Only
You desire us to fail — just there, perhaps, where your verbal acts
Are sentinels warning us of the slow-moving, quiet
Invasion of middle America by pod people over many years.
Be quiet — hush! — they are nearby, whispering the poem itself
In a parody of oratory. I’ll explain more plainly: the map
Of the literary world is a pantomime, and its longueurs have become
Prolongations of our prevarications on bad weather days, and also
Fine days where things seem okay but are not, those dull events
We shall banish from the Ideal Republic. Who called? No, I am
Not speaking to that shit: he just wants to be
Opposite me at the literary lunch. He got some fame recently, only
To be thrust into obscurity soon, I hope. It seems broader,
The sum total, a canal reflecting its own anagram, but will it ever[9]
Become legible? Hidden behind a screen of rocks
And foliage, the creep quickly inhales the distant
Ether and faints, thank goodness, and what I own
I see before me shining like a dagger. Meanwhile
I am only me, a faithful shadow of my real self, and
Private doubts evaporate between the Spring and the Fall
And even this is seasonal, and I thank you
For being so patient, you could have made some other
Voluntary or involuntary gesture like sneezing to prove your
Maturity or you could have hung and dangled from the branches
Of a tree to attract my attention a step or two away from them.[10]
It intensifies my desire to know you, a gesture like that, to
Form an opinion of your feints, apparitions and mode of locomotion.
In this way I control the crowded avenue to the Palace of Fame, the one
Leading to a rowboat mounted in a park where I perch and think to[11]
Myself and then jot it down, being careful to leave a blank space
That is the secret indication of Mallarmé’s abyss, a.k.a. “The Unknown.”
Eating ragwort is morally better than gobbling a quail tagine; the difference
Can never be explained to the obtuse. At this distance
It seemed impossible to reach the reader, Valéry murmured, then said the phrase
“Over and over” to himself, again and again. Meanwhile
Infant mortality was declining as aspirin consumption increased. There was[12]
To be a meeting about aspirin and other drugs later that evening,
He was told. He read poems about killing large animals to keep awake
On the tepid waters of café society. Go to the meeting, don’t go, whatever.
“Whose centre wobbles must fail,” the Latin motto says, and having
The progression of the equinox too much in mind brings rain
As they form a phalanx of epigones, those who come after.
Why don’t they just get used to that? They can’t be equal
Without coming before, and that’s impossible. The cup of
Contentment will never touch their lips. Ministering
To stunted talents is my fate; each day I tread that lonesome trail alone
And return at nightfall bereft and grinding my teeth at
What they dish out: similes as appliqué aperçus. They
Might as well hand in embroidery. The Force, puissant yet invisible,
Still surrounds us. Yet there is also a Dark Force
Between the cruel mandates of history and them.
It is because the greatness of art is like a snobbish relative
That we shall never agree on a strategy, and
Entertainment washes over us, leaving us ethically incomplete.
Former East German border guards know too well that that
Closes off an awful lot of options. The Moment
Of Death is dallying on Ninth Avenue, as yet uncertain of[13]
Its intentions. I’ll just leaf through the paper until
You wake up. I’m not planning to go anywhere. You know, it
Wasn’t a small thing, to turn your back on Europe. The walls[14]
Are turning into their own murals. Please don’t speak
Of time within the hearing of that tiny hydraulic clock you
Invented, it can be self-centered and jealous, and has now
Grown furious. Deep within its complex innards a purple jewel
Exists as a blazon, rotating slowly, saying that this
Existence is temporary, that you may lodge and idle here
Only so long as you don’t irritate the gods. Someone’s
Purpose niggles at you. Then the sunbeams flood in at acute
Angles and frighten the other diners. I thought, then,
Of having whatever I wanted, but it seemed that a distant
Image of you chided me. My admiration is a test
Of how you might accept it: gracefully, or boorishly, or not.
You hesitate, don’t you? I hate that. Please accept this
Wooden gesture, and you’re right, the over-decorated representation
Returns whence it came, though it was easily said, and simply meant,
With nothing ulterior about it: a simple entendre. I’d like to alight
With you from the caboose on a hot dry day in a wonderful town. You
Must help the Judge measure the exact length of the shadow of
Your well-wrought urn in the center of the square — it is still intact;[15]
Appreciation gives it the shine and the shadow — but just now somebody
Is phoning to arrange for drinks — will you join me? — later this evening.
 
 
“The Anaglyph” initially resulted from a commission from the Toronto magazine The Modern Review to write an essay of any type on John Ashbery’s 1967 long poem   “Clepsydra.” In response Tranter took the first word or two and also the   last word or two of each line from John Ashbery’s poem, and wrote   material of my own to fill each line out.
A clepsydra is a water-driven clock, invented in Ancient Greece. An anaglyph is a drawn or photographic image, usually printed in red and   bluish-green ink, that, when viewed through spectacles containing one   bluish-green lens and one red lens, presents a three-dimensional image;   that is, an image consisting of two superimposed and   differently-colored views of the same scene.

Notes
1.  lines 23–25: the sky over Twenty-second Street, but / The sky leans   nonchalantly against the coop ― I mean “co-op” ― about / As graceful as a   cowboy leaning on a chicken co-op ― I mean “coop”] John Ashbery’s   apartment is in a building that bears a large sign advertising “COOPS”,   or cooperatively owned apartments. The vertical alignment of the word   “coops” does not allow for hyphens. See the note to “Ninth Avenue”   below.
2. Line 91: The  assurance Baron Corvo had an excess of, a crowing  assurance] The  eccentric writer Frederick Rolfe (1860–1913) adopted the  pseudonym  “Baron Corvo” (along with several others). The Corvidae are a family of birds including crows, ravens and jays; corvine: crow-like.
3.   Line 114: presented in a Potemkin-Village spirit] Potemkin-Village, a   pretentiously showy or imposing façade intended to mask or divert   attention from an embarrassing or shabby fact or condition. 1935–40;   after Prince Potëmkin. “Catherine’s [the Great’s] tour of the south in   1787 was a triumph for Potëmkin, for he disguised all the weak points of   his administration ― hence the apocryphal tale of his erecting   artificial villages to be seen by the empress in passing” (Encyclopaedia Britannica Deluxe edition 2004 CD ROM).
4.   Line 115: a vast electrical disturbance] The phrase comes from an  early  line of John Ashbery’s: “My child, I love any vast electrical   disturbance” (Some Trees, Corinth, 20) and is used again in “Electrical Disturbance: A dramatic interlude.”
5. 131: coffee and a Strega] Strega (Italian: witch ) is a liqueur. In Frank O’Hara’s poem “The Day Lady Died”:
It is 12:20 in New York a Friday […]
 and for Mike I just stroll into the PARK LANE
 Liquor Store and ask for a bottle of Strega and
 then I go back where I came from to 6th Avenue […]
6.   Line 131: Il Miglior Fabbro] Not in fact a New York café, bar or   restaurant, though perhaps it should be. This phrase was T. S. Eliot’s   dedication of The Waste Land to Pound: “the better maker” or “the   finer craftsman,” which is what Dante calls Arnaut Danièl, an Occitan   troubadour of the twelfth century and the inventor of the difficult   sestina poem form, a favorite of Ashbery’s.
7.   Line 143: the pearl-handled revolver] A radio play device: a common   name for any clumsy explanatory dialogue. In an archetypal radio play,   to identify the villain to the radio audience, who are “blind,” and   where the type of gun the villain is holding is vital in identifying the   real murderer, typical dialogue ran thus: “Carruthers, you swine, put   down that pearl-handled revolver!”]
8. Line 151: Not likely to allow me to escape the whirligig of voracious time.] Shakespeare, Twelfth Night, act 5, scene 1:
Clown: … And thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges.
9.   Line 186: a canal reflecting its own anagram] Psychoanalytic   philosopher Jacques Lacan developed a theory of the “mirror stage” of   ego development. Reflections and mirrors are of course symbolic of the   central process this poem enacts. Canal is an anagram of Lacan, whose name appears in another mirror later in the thesis.
10. Line 197: a step or two away from them] Frank O’Hara again. His 1956 poem “A Step Away From Them” contains the lines:
It’s my lunch hour, so I go
 for a walk among the hum-colored
 cabs. […] First
 Bunny died, then John Latouche,
 then Jackson Pollock. But is the
 earth as full as life was full, of them? […]
 A glass of papaya juice
 and back to work. My heart is in my
 pocket, it is Poems by Pierre Reverdy.
11. Line 200: Leading to a rowboat mounted in a park] From John Forbes, “Monkey’s Pride”:
I’ll be employed on a rowing boat
 mounted in a park,
 the one the avenues lead to
 because society has elected me / to decorate
 its falling apart with a useless panache […]
12.   Line 208: Infant mortality was declining as aspirin consumption   increased.] Though the two trends are not directly related, each is a   product of scientific advances occurring over the same period:
In  1897, scientists at the drug and dye firm Bayer began investigating   acetylsalicylic acid as a less-irritating replacement for standard   common salicylate medicines. By 1899, Bayer had dubbed this drug   “Aspirin” and was selling it around the world. Aspirin’s popularity grew   over the first half of the twentieth century, spurred by its   effectiveness in the wake of Spanish flu pandemic of 1918, and aspirin’s   profitability led to fierce competition and the proliferation of   aspirin brands and products. (Wikipedia)
Starting  in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a precipitous  decline in  infant mortality was observed in the United States. Economic  growth,  improved nutrition, new sanitary measures, and advances in  knowledge  about infant care all contributed to this decline in infant  mortality.  (Kwang-SunLee, “Infant Mortality Decline in the Late 19th  and Early  20th Centuries: The Role of Market Milk,” Perspectives in Biology and Medicine 50, no. 4 [Autumn 2007]: 585–602)
13. Line 229: Ninth Avenue] John Ashbery’s New York apartment abuts Ninth Avenue. See the note to “Twenty-second Street,” above.
14.   Line 232: to turn your back on Europe] As a young man, John Ashbery   lived in Europe for a decade from 1955 to 1965 ― indeed, one of his   poems is titled “Europe,” though it is mainly about the eponymous Paris   metro stop and its neighborhood ― then returned to live in the United   States. “Clepsydra” was “one of the last poems Ashbery wrote while he   was in France. The poem was composed in the Spring of 1965 …” (Shoptaw,  83). The unusual number of French phrases and names in “The Anaglyph”   also suggest this French connection: Salon des Refusés, Buffon, Paris,   eau-de-cologne, la vie littéraire, longeurs, Mallarmé’s abyss, Valéry,   appliqué aperçus, puissant, les temps perdu, simple entendre.
15.   Line 251: Your well wrought urn] Ashbery’s oeuvre; the reference is to   both the noted critical study of poems by Donne, Wordsworth, Keats,  and  Eliot, The Well Wrought Urn by Cleanth Brooks, and to John  Keats’s poem “Ode on a Grecian Urn,” which ends: “Beauty is truth, truth   beauty. That is all ye know on Earth, and all ye need to know.”
 
 
 
General Notes
John Tranter and poet David Brooks introduced John  Ashbery’s reading at the University of Sydney in September 1992. (The  reading was held at 6:30 p.m. on Wednesday 16 September 1992 in Room  N395, Woolley Building, University of Sydney.) One of the poems Ashbery  read was the double sestina from his book Flow Chart. In his  preamble to the poem Ashbery revealed that his double sestina uses the  end-words of Algernon Charles Swinburne’s double sestina “The Complaint  of Lisa” (1870). Sestinas are of course based on a string of repeated  and rearranged end-words, not on rhyme or on any particular metrical  shape. Extend the idea to other kinds of poems, borrowing the last word  or two of each line, and you have the process or form that Tranter has  called “terminals.”
 
 He has written many poems in this mode, taking end-words from Matthew  Arnold, W. H. Auden, Barbara Guest, John Keats, Frank O’Hara, Banjo Paterson and others. The US poet, editor and critic Brian Henry has  studied and summarized this technique of Tranter’s in a paper published  in Antipodes magazine in 2004; his paper is reprinted on the Internet here.  Henry mentions and quotes from the Ashbery sestina. He looks at ten of  Tranter’s poems and discusses each different kind and example of  borrowing in detail. 
 
 Brian Henry says, inter alia:
With the sestina as a model, John Tranter has created a new form similar  to the sestina but far more flexible in its emphasis on end-words: the  terminal. Taking only the line endings from previously published poems,  the terminal can be any length, and the number of terminals possible in  the English language is limited only by the number of poems in the  English language. The form has infinite potential. Unrestricted to 39  lines as in the sestina, not limited to 14 or 19 rhyming lines as with  the sonnet and the villanelle, not expected to repeat itself like the  pantoum and the villanelle, and not tethered to any rhyme scheme or  syllable count like the ballad, terza rima, heroic couplet, alexandrine,  sapphics, or ottava rima, the terminal as a poetic form is vastly open  to possibility. […]
… the terminal raises various issues about poetic form, conservation,  usurpation, influence, and composition that no other form can raise.  Because Tranter overwrites ― and in the process simultaneously effaces  and preserves ― his source poem while retaining the anchoring points of  the source poem, his terminals are both conservative and destructive.  (Henry 32)

In one of her most frequently cited circumference poems, “The Poets  light but Lamps ―” (Poems 883), Dickinson describes the influence that  poets have on later readers as a kind of “vital Light” that ensures that  the poets’ “Circumference” will be preserved. Both of Ashbery’s  references to circumference reflect this Dickinsonian luminance,  explicitly linking an image of light to a spatial circumference  figure (2). In this way “Clepsydra” registers the dimension of  Dickinsonian circumference that suggests that the “vital Light” of a  prior poet continues to exist, even after she is dead, by lighting the  “Lamps” of later poets. (1998)
Tranter’s “response” to the poem was quite different. With Mr. Ashbery’s permission he set out to dismantle and rebuild it. 
 
 He took the last word of two of each line from “Clepsydra,” as with his  earlier experiments with “terminals,” and also the first word or two  from each line. Thus each line of Tranter’s reworked poem had its  beginning and ending given to him; his task was to replace the meat in  the sandwich, as it were. 
 
 So “The Anaglyph” is a reinvented, perhaps flawed, or perhaps improved,  version of that master poem, which is here reduced to the status of  ancestor, model, maquette, or template. 
 
 “The Anaglyph” is partly about its own process ― that is, the  deconstructing and reconstructing of a poem. It is also about Tranter’s  relationship as a developing poet with John Ashbery and with Ashbery’s  poetry. 
 
 The word “blazon” gives us a clue to one of the poem’s effects (“Deep  within its complex innards a purple jewel / Exists as a blazon, rotating  slowly … ” lines 236–7). In the essay on John Ashbery in his remarkable  study of forty-one US poets, Alone With America, Richard Howard points out that Ashbery often buries a small “blazon” in his poems, and quotes André Gide:
I like discovering in a work of art … transposed to the scale of the  characters, the very subject of that work … Thus in certain paintings … a  tiny dark convex mirror reflects the interior of the room where the  scene painted occurs … the comparison with that method in heraldry which  consists of putting a second blazon in the centre of the first, en abyme. (19–20)
That is, inside the poem is a reduced diagram of the poem itself, “a  tiny mirror for the plot, or maybe narrative,” as Tranter writes,  referring to just this device, in his poem “The Alphabet Murders,”  written over thirty years ago. The buried presence of Ashbery’s poem ―  that is, the line-beginnings and line-endings from it ― haunts “The  Anaglyph’ as a kind of fragmented and half-buried blazon. 
 
 The title of the poem itself, “The Anaglyph,” is embodied in some of the  poem’s “business,” for example in the line “their left and right  perceptual fields, red and green” (84). This hints at the anaglyph’s  dependence on binocular vision. An anaglyph is an image usually  drawn or printed in red and bluish-green ink that, when viewed through  spectacles containing one bluish-green lens and one red lens, presents a  three-dimensional image. As such, an anaglyph is a binary image  consisting of two superimposed and differently-colored views of the  same scene, each perceived from a slightly different viewpoint. 
 
 “The Anaglyph” is similar to Ashbery’s original poem “Clepsydra,” having  the same number of lines and the same line beginnings and line endings,  yet it has been written by a different author at a different time in a  different society, colored differently and seen from a slightly  different point of view, and one which has one more layer of knowledge  than the original. When Ashbery began work on “Clepsydra” in the 1960s,  nothing like it had existed before. When “The Anaglyph” was begun, its  progenitor had been modifying the ideal order of the literary landscape,  to use Eliot’s phrase, for three decades. “The existing monuments form  an ideal order among themselves, which is modified by the introduction  of the new (the really new) work of art among them.” (Eliot, Tradition, 47–48) “The Anaglyph” depends on the earlier poem, and perceives the world partly through and from that poem’s viewpoint. 
 
 On the first page Ashbery’s poem is displaced, codified and  rationalised. The title of Ashbery’s poem, “Clepsydra,” refers to an  ancient Greek water-clock, which appears disguised twice in “The  Anaglyph”:
Here behind the tiny horological waterfall
 Drums amplify the fun, but only at nightfall, then just for a moment
 Of horrible error as I clutch the wrong person’s hand. (17–19)
Later in the poem, “that tiny hydraulic clock” (234). 
 
 The mention of Proust’s great novel (“The way / Things fade away, les temps perdu seems to be the point / Of this rodomontade” 157–9) reminds us that the  scents and flavors of his remembered life soaked into Proust’s  writing. Over many years these changed from private, evanescent memories  into private handwriting fixed on paper, then to corrected proofs, the  text of which was reified into public print, and eventually entirely  replaced Proust’s own actual life, as this poem seeks to replace its  progenitor. 
 
 Favorite themes of Ashbery’s are also glancingly referred to: old  schoolteachers, for example (“the old school-teacher’s chief act of  belief” 39) and his use of ornate words harvested from the dictionary:  “Those crowded riverine cities” (63) reminds us of Ashbery’s title  “Those Lacustrine Cities” ― that is, cities built beside or on a lake.  The phrase “ashes and diamonds and nourishing food” (77) obliquely  refers to the title of the 1958 Polish movie Ashes and Diamonds directed by Andrzej Wajda, based on the novel by Jerzy Andrzejewski.  Ashbery had the nickname “Ashes” bestowed on him in that decade by his  poet friends Kenneth Koch and Frank O’Hara. In the movie, a poem by the  nineteenth-century Polish poet Cyprian Norwid is quoted:
So often, are you as a blazing torch with flames
 of burning rags falling about you flaming,
 you know not if flames bring freedom or death.
 Consuming all that you must cherish
 if ashes only will be left, and want Chaos and tempest
 Or will the ashes hold the glory of a star-like diamond
 The Morning Star of everlasting triumph.

Ashbery himself, as the maimed father-figure, makes a brief appearance  to protest what has happened to his poem: “From Rochester he came hence,  / A writ of Cease and Desist clenched in his teeth” (135–6). Ashbery  was born in Rochester, New York State, in 1927.

Speaking of father-figures, the distancing yet ligaturing effect “The  Anaglyph” seeks to enact between Tranter the translator and Ashbery the  originator is addressed by Lacan:
Rather, the subject would now find him­self alienated in a symbolic  system which he shares with others. That system structures the human  uncon­scious, and communication with the other can now be enacted  through the shifting positions of signifiers in a system of symbolic  exchange. The self is still an ap­propriated self, but what is  appropriated is language as the other, and not an ideal but alienated  image of an individual self. (In the resolution of the Oedipus complex,  this would involve moving from a specular rivalry with the father, in  which the child seeks to take the father’s place, to an assumption of  the function of the father and, most fundamentally, of the symbolic  father who, as Law, is that which makes possible all symbolic  operations.) (Bersani, summarising Lacan, 115–16)
One final function of the poetic father is to license the son to take  his place. It is worth noting that Tranter has stated that he asked  Ashbery’s permission before embarking on this disfigurative exercise: 
 
 After wrestling with [“Clepsydra”] for a while, I felt that it needed  demolishing and rebuilding, and ― with Mr. Ashbery’s permission ― that is  what I did. (Feints 29) 
 
 Perhaps to empower Ashbery as the lawgiver, other elder poets are  downgraded. The most common thematic reference in “The Anaglyph” is a  series of references to bear hunting, the first of which is “a hunter in  the dim mirror killing a bear” (33). Poet Galway Kinnell was born in  the same year as John Ashbery, and also lives in New York City. Daniel  Schenker says
In one of his [Kinnell’s] best known poems, “The Bear,” an Eskimo hunter  stalks a polar bear who eventually succumbs to the sharpened bone  coiled in the hunter’s bait. When the hunter comes upon the bear’s  carcass he eats voraciously of the animal’s flesh as we would expect.  But instead of then abandoning the carcass or considering its other  uses, the hunter climbs into the body and life and death of the bear.  The object of the hunt thus becomes not the mere domination of the bear  by the hunter, but an effort to acquire an understanding of what it’s  like to be something other than oneself. As if to validate his attempt  to identify with the other, the hunter is granted a vision of spring at  the end of the poem as geese come trailing up the flyway and a mother  bear tends to a litter of new-born cubs.

And then a rocket sprang and bang shot blind and O! then the Roman  candle burst and it was like a sigh of O! and everyone cried O! O! in  raptures and it gushed out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads and  they shed and ah! they were all greeny dewy stars falling with golden, O  so lively! O so soft, sweet, soft! (Joyce, 477)

“The only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live,  mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time,  the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn  like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across the  stars and in the middle you see the blue centerlight pop and everybody  goes ‘Awww!’” (Kerouac, 8)[Tossed] off all the champagne punch on

102 Today 

                           i.m. James Schuyler
If Wystan Auden were alive today
he’d be a small tangle of black lines
on a rumpled white bedsheet,
his little eyes looking up at you.
What did you bring?
Some yellow daffodils and green stems.
Or did they bring you?
 
Auden once said,
“Where the hell is Bobby?”
and we looked around,
but there was no Bobby there.
Ah, Auden, no Bobby for you.The Rabbit Woman of Honolulu
You a tourist? No, I work here. A college student? Good. Tourists are always photographing my rabbits. Now you’ve met the Rabbit Woman of Honolulu.
I’d broken my own taboo on photographing people without asking them first. She waved a finger at me. I apologized. I thought she’d tell me to fuck off. She had that right. It was like she had eyes in the back of her head when I was pressing the shutter.
We walked down Kapi’olani Boulevard.
Rabbit Woman –– or was it Rabbit Lady? My memory getting into mythic mode. But that’s her own name for herself, the name she said. (This is a poem, not a police report.)
Then she told me how the world was going to end when a black hole at the center of the earth would suck everything into it.
Like all media savvy, she knows how to deal with the media. She’s got the Press Release memorized.
Habla Español? Where are you from? You look Latino. My mother was an Arab, my father a Spanish aristocrat. I never knew his surname.
Do you have a number I can call you?
The world will end. But there is a solution –– a massive NOAH’S ARK a 1000 feet long and 300 feet high built out of Koah wood, the Hawaiian super timber that resists rot.
Read the bible, it was all in there. Make sure to seal the insides with waterproof tar. If I could get the students of the university to build it she would appreciate it a lot.
They were smart college students, and they could make it.
The hills of Manoa. She pointed to them. They’d be wiped out by a thousand foot Tsunami. But the ark would float above it all. I was heading there for lecture. I thought of turning back. Maybe she’d be right. Maybe she was the PROPHET.
The TV guys came and photographed me. I was on TV. She smiled.
I asked her if she lived in Kapi’olani Park. (Lived there, like a home I thought? A stupid question.) I move around she said. Why I asked. I get bored she said, and she didn’t hang around the library in McCully.
Too many crackheads. Then she told me about her rabbits. How a certain crackhead in McCully Park had taken one, stole it out of its kennel and cut its throat.
Then he burnt his mouth on a crack pipe. But the police had his number, and so did the Filipino Mafia. The bastard. The police had had it with him.
The police photographed the rabbit, the dead one.
“And that fucking rabbit-killer, he were gonna to die.”
 
 
Ala Moana
Ala Moana, a path to the sea.
Here is an island chain fringed with nostalgia
homegrown and the foreign.
The tourist vision from balconies of hotels
where you’d expect colonial ambience,
and you’d pay good money
for smooth transits to beauty and tradition,
where the waiter’s impeccable but his one rebel gesture
is a large punkish leather belt and buckle
he bought at Guess.
Otherwise here the food grows more locally,
like mostly all the staff,
and the lunchtime fashion models are twinned –– one a blond, the other
Polynesian –– one in a blue dress, the other in beige,
where the unique horizontal ceiling fans
survived the renovation.
Nostalgia is the voice of TheBus, the welcomeaboard
noneedtotakecareofyourbelongings bus.
Nostalgia. Each destination is the one you fondly remember
but not the one you know.
Nostalgia breaks out on the distant reef
where longboarders are sharing waves
in a civil way and remind you
of Duke Kahanamoku, and where
the Duke’s statue attracts smiling lovers.
This is nostalgic, not the love part,
but the statue’s permanent gesture of aloha,
made permanent in bronze,
festooned with lei and other gifts of pilgrims.
The very idea of a good wave left untaken, left to the gods,
gods who are not nostalgic but quarrelsome,
they are the pastpresentfutureforever
in this sky, this water, this every place.
When it rains it’s nostalgic, the double rainbows
in Manoa Valley, like the auto-art
spray canned on a surfer’s panel van
in a stoner’s village, my world in 1975.
What we called fuck trucks, way back then and they’re
collectable and nostalgic.
The mothers of Big Island, Hilo’s SUV driving kind,
dragging their kids and bags of organic vegetables.
Under the Banyan tree in Hawi, you’ll find nostalgia
but it’s real, as real as a cool piece of shade
where the pickup trucks unload chill boxes
of poi and pupu and food for the farmers market
and the locals catch up on the goss.
No doubt there are tensions but it was Sunday in Hawi
and it was “Eat Local Day” and everyone was
wearing their best.
Even the military are nostalgia’s guardians,
for what gives them a warm afterburn is
Patriot Day, and the launch of a new frigate
by a real war veteran who’d had his arm shot off
but still managed to take the machine gun nest
on a hill in Italy in 1945.
So I want to write 747 poems
and not worry. Whose home is it?
Whose nostalgia?
I can write 300 pages of drug related commerce
and abusive relationship break-ups,
this place that’s better not to argue with,
in case the present or the future makes me feel nervous,
(for that is my present).
Great writing, not nostalgia.
A union demo at the Hilton,
old style chants, placards that still mean we’re here, now,
echoing and unmaking my silences,
in-between ear-plug moments sliding shut
the plate-glass lanai door on a 40 storey condo.
Homeless, the homeless, are they nostalgic,
like the schizophrenic shouting into a public phone
with the passion of Armageddon with not
the slightest hint of irony?
Heard, seen, acknowledged, at least
when all the places that have really changed
are the places even old timers can’t remember.
You want to shout Fuck Tourism,
but that would be nostalgic.

or was it just in the ear
of an ambo … well, uh, now
I’m not so sure.

 Card games
I was just about to take some liquid
nitrogen, because no problem
ever lurks in steam, when my dear neighbour says
let's play some nude card games. Steaming, of course
I said no. But there are cards and card games:
nothing dirty, nothing too out there. Just
hands and touching, here and there. Touching
the way we touch and go a mesmerising disaster.
Look at all the papers out there going for it. Swirling
around town. I knew some of them by name.
But let's play.
                            Forget the tear gas. The lilts. Shoves
and pushes. Touching we let the world stay solid. And
the world touches back, gently, lovingly, in lieu
of disasters.




Three cheers for liberation 
The best fish flies in entirely unexpected. Yesterday's
silver bullet with origami fins. We do not fillet the topic,
it has far too much gravitas. It spins. Please turn the whale
music down. Roger. I see your turntable is also back in fashion:
just don't forget to bandage the broken newsflash.
Right, you say, the wrong. But salt does not eat you out
like a toothache. No, you say, it's more of a migraine. Exploding
abbreviations of nuclear powered rust. Roger means well
but is often found with trouble. As if trouble spreads itself out
warm on the bed just calling his name. Eating lead off the fish
and chips, you know he won't live long. You say bless you
when the ground troops arrive. Geiger's gurgling syrup means
business. Now we're all out of hygiene, try pharmaceuticals for dust.




Easter
Each of us chooses an egg.
Uncle who has just passed away
gets the blue.
My first cousin wraps herself around
her sunny child. Yellow.
The boy next door brings a wooden one.
(We let him win for a while.)
My mother picks the most stubborn of the lot,
one that remains intact when all the others
are crushed and crumbed into saffron yolk.
The late uncle sneezes and we close all
the windows.
I tell you April has wide nostrils
and a touch of hay fever.Letter to Adam Smith

For a year of my undergraduate degree I studied in Philadelphia and also spent time in New York, where I first encountered some of the work that has since become important to me — and in fact partly accounts for my recent move to Vancouver in the Pacific Northwest.
The poetry I love most — that I most want to write — is that which erupts from lived experience and is capable of spontaneity, ‘un-knowledge’ in freefall, happy accidents which show me ‘I’ am not who I thought ‘I’ was — and so allow me to step outside of myself. Alice Notley’s sonnets, H.D.’s Sea Garden, or Joseph Ceravolo’s Spring in this World of Poor Mutts offer a kind of expansion, play, pleasure in language that give way to a messiness and ecstasy sometimes lost in other modes of (dialectical, linear, or perhaps deliberately programmatic) thought.
Partly because feminism has been a prevalent discourse among North American (especially Canadian) poetry conversations, I’ve found the writing happening on the other side of the Atlantic to be a lifeline and springboard for my own work. To borrow a phrase from Rachel Blau DuPlessis, I don’t feel the need to ‘invent a new and total culture’ that a previous generation felt: in poetry that’s been done for me, by Lyn Hejinian, Joan Retallack, Susan Howe, and others. Perhaps the space those poets have cleared means there is no need to fall abjectly into the category of the ‘feminine other’ anymore (though I do think women poets in the UK continue to suffer from a lack of serious critical attention paid to their work relative to their male counterparts).
At the same time I’m stuck on how poetic language is constantly and ever more inventively appropriated by popular (digital) culture — how can I begin to write my love poem when Hipster Runoff and Vice magazine have already eaten it? The point is that I can begin, though. And there is so much North American poetry to turn to in thinking about this, especially recent work by Kevin Davies, Lisa Robertson, Catriona Strang, Brian Stefans, Stephen Collis, Cathy Wagner. “Give me hackneyed words because they are good,” says Robertson, and her books — especially The Men, Magenta Soul Whip, and Debbie — have helped me to see how I might disregard or circumvent the limits of the conventional or depleted lyric in my efforts to be sincere. Similarly, while Davies’s work enacts the malaise and social logic of late capitalism, it works through a funny, affective, and subtle irony that affirms the presence of an individual and collective conscience which is at once politicized and self-reflexive. I’m interested in the work these rhetorical affects can do, how the kinds of pleasure and sincerity — perhaps the excess — I want from poetry can be transformative, a form of affective politics.
 


In Case of Sleep
Sitting on a retro toilet that once belonged to Geena Davis
I stand for what I pee. A mighty maze speaks Olivia
through its annals & look! Her apology implodes.
I came to see you to tell you that the weather is finally listening
when your chest bleats into the cul-de-sac, but dining into the human
species and their revolving loopholes all I hear is your blood
and see it flooding out on a doubly romantic dream of mine which
the poets say is beautiful but is really glamorous and tiring.
Sleeping with my childhood wardrobe in a garden centre
responsibly and respectfully sharing my angst with the lobelia
I might recline like a cat but I wouldn’t sell my wares openly
I wouldn’t want to be that memory-cat with the power to die the power
to be put back on my feet I came to see you’d been eaten by tar sands
and cat didn’t exist                                 what kind of a country is this
what did you say                        I missed that
I miss that cat
 
 


Just Handcuff Me

Then paint me the sum of polygamy.
Tender brawny snippets, pear pips
& a drainpipe running down to the
sea. Not you not me.
With night you come stomping,
It’s kristallnacht in my dream —
why did you shave our heads?
When will we reinvent love?
Look at me orbiting the earth:
cool extreme organic oil.
I tower above the Shard wearing my
new raspberry jeans and orange t-shirt.
Some worlds still purr apart
a fly         or fact         or loaf
some people are just called bodies
but I’d rather die clean on the spot!
Some feel a baby kicking.
Asterisk nipples the real September
I began and where I started. With
shining intuition. Esoteric holler.
 
 


Hallucination
Pin on your hopeless dream
blu-ray flash bird            now I see devotion
mapping through a soft-top
then I am watching the blue leaf               
                                          turning blue.
Then I am Piccolo Mondo, killer of joy boys
and the third wave and I have been
a long time coming in the ovens.
The foothills are fleshing out, obituaries
are turning the corner of the street
to meet you dissipated and tuck the corner of
the sheet among your family maybe wash
your house down at dawn,
               maybe make a genius snowman
let it float towards the future             asking itself
what bloated life can be, turning
to the wall asking, what snow can be?
I have been a long time coming
The sun and the prince            go on and on,
pulling on each other, looking for a party,
caught with their tails on fire
or worse, fucking with a weaponless pigeon.
Now I see devotion pulling            and cover versions
cascading to the pit of the archive
where my hand is now, grubby Peyko-chic
Whatever drainage stinks down the wall
I will still,
Any flames can eat me up
You know —
Delinquency forgets its echo    Yea
Karaoke was always sung across two seas
 
 
 
Fast Eddy
Or why, in the Dalston CLR James
Library                             in the blonde ages
the enquiries could melt a man’s
heart, or touch him, make a fool of
him, or spread like bible engines
and really sorrowful. At that desk
we first knew the time                        I didn’t have
the cash on me, that was            when
Big fence            like might            you broke.
I thought you might be the shredded
water beneath my hair, my
Enlightened life. I thought the
steam room into Stevie Nicks’ head
Revolving on Stevie Nicks’ neck.
It’s not that I condone heraldry to get
close to death and colours
it’s that my feet are frequently misled
via Pontoon Dock            or West Silvertown
where I see an LED soul frazzle hanging
& chicken bones            rule the roost
where sometimes            it demeans us
               to where things leave us
and where we leave things
             alone, dancing on
the showboat, a glazed wooden brain.
What’s not great about this            is this:
in the soft fruit brain, what’s binary
and what’s not                         *poverty under the sun
*software that knows you            and the two
of us asleep on Pluto where, if a porn image
ever dumbs up,            hits itself in the eye
needs love               phobia of love or
    stickies,                I will be there to give it.
So bad I need money, I hire out benignity
I’m huh            your syndicat d’initiative
            go bounce in the night
            Hug me —
“tell me it’s okay not to be modern,”
that Louise Labe would’ve made believe
              Not found goat in her bed
not sunk head-first            into woolly Caracas
called her mum to say             “call me.”
              It’s not that I want a showy title
I just want to believe I saw the arrows
Pointing to each hole in the sky
you’ve gone to buy me a birthday present
of voluminous capacity, I
know                        where things leave us blown across
the window            where the sound of train rolls
or at night wake up: to me, my favourite
time was in the street,                           junky cuss
but aside from this tenet what I see is
bands of poems: hairspray-encrusted plenary power
my self-pity bawling with the local yoga babies
that when I was too tepid was when my heart rubble
and my milk feet.
                           Somebody!
                           Coax down the decade
                           pine away palinode
                           stretch roving echo
                           to Vancouver’s alacrity
                           a shaky shoe-rack above Japan,
the atmosphere’s an apple layer for us
our opal loss

Confidence in Lack
Most recent modernist, and much subsequent, significant poetry writing has negotiated damage, in awe of a range of specialist vocabularies, used in the public sector by commerce, education, and the war machine. Throughout this period it has been evident that in spite of, or in deference to, the restricted and figurative use of language much that is public has involved catching a logic bus into an aspiration for coherence. One apprehension and understanding would be that poetry is at great variance to these expectations, both with regard to logic and coherence, and with regard to making vocabulary available and has led to a confidence in lack — a confidence that poetry, when it is at its most efficacious, cannot propose logic, as it is variously perpetuated in paternal and public thinking, and cannot aspire to coherence, as this is also prescribed. In particular, poetry needs to make these proposals or have these aspirations in a period following the extensive pollarding and retro-harnessing of modernism and its huge variety of materialist and fascist engines.
In February 2007, writing for Nature, an international weekly journal of science, a group of physicists, supported by the American army, Yale University and commerce, proposes to resolve the issue of photon number states in a superconducting circuit where they expect to distinguish between coherent and thermal fields (two apparently different orders of vocabulary) and create a photon statistics analyzer which will generate non-classical states of light and perform superconductivity quantum bit-photon conditional logic, the basis of a logic bus for a quantum computer.
The paper thus celebrates a dilemma. Poetry and engagement with a Public, like Science and its public, provide a significant mismatch, potentially involved with self-deception, or more often, active deceit. The premise for this mismatch derives from a range of incapacities and inabilities necessary to the frailties that underpin vulnerabilities and contribute to sensitive thinking; that contribute to the æsthetic and ethical basis for all written poetic and scientific practice. This is a necessary dilemma in conceptual and historical terms, set against the western proposals for logic and its modernist aspiration to cohere …

We are dying in April showers
falsehood of sweet options
The geneticist joins us for lunch
The garden is rosy
I can smell metal

even though I am the spinner, whose
music willing did mask

Tired of walking marks

I simply wanted to label the axons, it was only,
The Geneticist ordered more cocktails,

Weren’t you using a modified gene trap?

When taste brings death

Offended by reliance on measurement

The International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium used a
hierarchical mapping and sequencing strategy to construct the
working draft of the human genome. This clone-based approach
involves generating an overlapping series of clones that covers the
entire genome. Each clone ‘fingerprinted’ on the basis of the pattern
of fragments generated by restriction enzyme digestion. Clones
selected ed for shotgun sequencing and the whole genome sequence
reconstructed by map-guided assembly of overlapping clone
sequences.
At the time of the pilot phase the sequencing efforts were renewed to
develop clone-based maps covering specific regions of the genome.
To construct these regional maps, we screened artificial chromosome
clones for sequence-tagged site markers,

fingerprinted the positive clones, integrated them into the existing
maps, and selected the largest, intact clones with minimal overlap for
sequencing.
In three years, to keep pace with the ramping up of the sequencing
effort, the ongoing efforts to construct the whole-genome bacterial
artificial chromosome map were increased approximately tenfold.
This map allowed the integration of a range of data, including
fluorescence in situ hybridization cytogenic clone localizations,
landmark data, obtained by polymerase chain reaction and hybridisa-
tion screening, clones from other libraries with associated map data,
and working draft and finished clone sequence and associated
electronic polymerase chain reaction landmarks.
Together, the human genome clone map and anchored sequence

Winging Step  
from Entanglement (1991–2003)
 
Initial engagement recorded risk in London commerce
a recognition of damage perhaps simply fragmentation
dimensions recorded in exhaust gas and tiredness
given shape in air moved
the narrative takes rein specifies location on a road
encounter with a second tarmacker
abrupted into syntax and narrative journey simultaneous with
natural phenomena juxtaposed rail tracks crabs of colour.
A following engagement named discipline and context
then specific quest and spacetime
linked back into initial risk and at a county boundary
traps and ideas of eternity or
the movement of a müller over glass
and in a garden focussed
followed by a return to the second engagement.
A new initiative locks in with specific semiotics
chains onto a shift of meaning
notes troat artificiality
and its natural semantic parallel
crossed with further record of damage
in rationalised details.
Again initiative clocks in as imaginative
memory of self in the image
trapped in London commerce
with a sense of helplessness.
 
A momentary sheen from complexity unfastens
relieves a pressure
undermines history
intertraced with added memory.
Rhetoric held in deluded appearance of natural images
the possible absence of representational tropes
superimposed orders, the riflemen cross the border
permits multiplication of represented object
implies a series riflemen cross the border.
An enveloping sheen, gossamer egg
a paranomasis braided to
mimesis and metaphor
a diachronic pattern of narrative discourse
usurped by radicals injected by machines
Another record of explosion or gun fire
as if randomly spotted
across a graph of moving trail lines
in a witness box, on a geiger check, by the self.
The Painter skate boards a range of chemistry boxes
posts a range of letters.
 
Tendency to perceive connected regions
uniform image properties
different from the neutron trap
luminance, colour, texture,
motion and disparity
stops responses
adapts, but retinal blood not
perceived sees what she expects
experience on the basis of edge information
lost focus, reception dependence
shape largely invariant over similarity transformations
underlie internal representation
conscious perception of texture segregation
requires attention
suggests expectation
as an important component of inattention’s blindness.
From the middle of the enclosure
clipped hedges and a fountain
air craft and sirens dependent
on personal meaningfulness of extra stimulus
a kind of attentional blink
perceived viewpoint remains
non-conscious process to the level
of memory.
 
The trapping region fills
with isotropically pure helium
in a cupronickel tube. A cold
beam passes through a series of
teflon windows, collimated
by a boron carbide ring, and
into the trapping region gets absorbed
by a beam stop. The trapping field
created by an assembly
of superconducting magnets continue to be
confined by quadruple racetrack constructions.
 
Switches from one object to another
incur additional cost
do not attribute to distance
a number of disconnected spatial regions
at the sametime attention split
among multiple objects
at different levels of her visual system.
A direct association cluster
printed colour word and sound of colour name
between colour itself and the naming
A logic of relation
between brain and consciousness
a supervenience in which conscious events
require corresponding neural activity
without relational structures she does not
experience different colours as more closely related
than shapes. Her expression of red
could be completely different from
the Burglar’s attention to corresponding
internal experiences that arise from
viewing the same modified plant forms
“We were up,” the mobile noted,
“l don’t study objects but the relations
between them.” The emergent complexed
neurons firing as low as 35 hertz
and as high as 75 correlate their
brain activity of visual consciousness.
 
More material than the Painter can possibly
cope with each moment she
visualises a recalcitrant fact
rises out of confrontation with this
to break it up and
make a further effort again
and again several until something
not in the surface looks
somehow in imaginative grasp
consciousness immersed in activity
that she may not wake up from
to reinvent herself enters
the room knowing she is away
in another country a different trap
attempts to keep innocence
to avoid dilution of the world
noticing what no one else has paid attention to
as surprising as a new species of lizard
incoherent experience caught in coherence
conveys new sensation of proportion or connection
early in the morning
incessant burning
200 sketches blazing in preparation
for anyone to warm from

a friendship derived from instant intimacy
announce a fall regained to trick stammering bereavement
Some humbler attendant of my understanding
negative spacetime as potential meeting within me
envenomed traces from rays that strike
Stalked agreement to share careerman’s site
marked  on local maps with a purplish blotch
the lineaments of the body express a diversity of passion
Shift the toadstool showers stenched with spores.

She entered a fluorescent, timed air
shot with gene-coated gold particles
knowing in transition does not to abide
held by ligare in the cut ring of the plasmid
sporzando duties
amid roots in the cork sway
liberating subjectivity from lack of culture
abstraction as a method, landscape experience as source
 
rails and wires gleamed like so many traps
the possibility that we might be organized in
hitherto unsuspected avenues of gravity
Join’d to the prattle of the purling rills
 
An itinerary of procedures in the form of recipe
the scents of an Eden’s mulberry
hair upon the Horses the Leaves upon the Trees
the real visible and tangible promotes the problem of consciousness
that each of us constructs projects it into a further construction
Precarious descent of Roehampton Lane
experience a fund for spacetime’s properties
nervous excitement in which idle speculation chases
 
devices discreetly play white noise mask window
vibrations picked by laser-based eaves dropper scans
fraught by twinges in position
turn against a random pleiotropic effect
the gravitational pull of oblivion
Bright pink walls, The Haywain
arousing spleen to administer vapour
on circuit through visible purchasers
a care frayed to pen
A pleasing land of drowsy-head
in strident disbelief read
photocopy of an antique map.

It is a question of changing the horizon itself
the fish gene did not work in the tomato
until a promoter with a flag was included
a street in Italy set against a plastic frog
emulsion of tubercular bean sprout phage
to stake out shifts between gas and solid
registered by the sounds of burning acids
the whole process of gene expression
 
Anxiety for the knowing, for the beautiful and good
promotes a confusion of time without space
Glistens in a waste of regeneration
This far suffering concealment
dispelled wonders from a constructed posterity
polished copper, glass, chrome, plasticised wood
and the Stones and Gravel upon the road
station to station in a wireless embrace
a false consciousness of timid objects
The time chosen early morning before Sunrise
transcribed into a single stranded molecule
simulation energised with poly-adenylation
 
horizontal bands of wood chrome buttons
The smooth returning flow of epanalepsis and epanodos
Rent in perturbance and re-sorted clones
A fall fastened and penned
Drawn in fragility and combustible
A warning
In each quiver of line each breakage
the copiousness of merismus within merismus
Pour fleece and fronds
Storm in fragility and combustible to
a gather clocked and screened
marble aggregates table top and floor

In a quest for chasing and haranguing the self
on a map in suspended animation
                that kind of fudge
north of an exclusion zone, ‘the night bar’
Does it really matter what we die of?
passaged in snow ash bleats beyond strain
contours intertwined, sometimes through each other
an inscribed wall of plaster hung on the surface
The factual concealment and configured purism
enthusiasm I felt that day
infra-sound of the trochaic conundrum
deplored this sheen of taste
become active in the ‘quiet’ DNA
An enclosure inside the enclosure beginning to burst
Taste, a myriad intruding nose and eyes
rotating with continual range
Bent into the risk of a scud before wind
Simulates permission to cross concrete and gravel
shifting views of the same location
An enclosure inside the enclosure beginning to burst
Taste, a myriad intruding nose and eyes
rotating with continual range
Bent into the risk of a scud before wind
Simulates permission to cross concrete and gravel
shifting views of same location
exquisite posing of similarity against variety
in a poignantly negative reprise
Acoustic torch a message without signs
Lace rimes fool to feed mesmeric care
Anamorphic shoes tread gas where
the soul remains unnumbered, unmeasured
she knows influx without worry if its lead
a broken mirage in toasted air
distinct, indivisible preoccupations
analysis of new samples of weight
studs in boot base confirm marked out space
turquoise, maroon, cream wall blanks
a still life, a chrome and neon ‘R’
in the midst of the town, the feeling of being self-sufficient.
 
 
Slop
from Leans (2003–2005)
 
The Burglar effect
holds light a moment
less than a millisecond
robbed of love
blowing clover and the falling rain
entanglement with mythical forms
of multiple experience
ancient shields scoured of rust
into an old pot-lid
liberated from ritual and cult
 
Her garment was so bright and wondrous sheene
That my frail wit cannot devize to what
It to compare, nor finde like stuffe to that,
From her unhastie beast she did alight,
And on the grasses her daintie limbes did lay
In secret shadow, farre from all mens sight:
 
Laboured to render myself useless
entangled by logical fallacy
that delight in giddiness
count it a bondage to fix a truth
which judge itself
teaches that inquiry
of love-making
enjoying that truth a sovereign
knowledge that too much amorous affection
quites both riches and wisdom
of no computer programme whatsoever
 
Things combined, halved, interchanged,
connected
in preparation for nuclear attack
that great persons had need to borrow
other opinions to think themselves happy
He judges by his own feeling, cannot find it
but if he thinks with himself
what other placed moments
would fain be as he holds
 
The Seraph of Peace from fury had fled
The room in which the interrogation
as opposed to torture
to be conducted defines coercion
The colours of walls,
ceilings, rugs, furniture
should not be startling
should be free of distractions, Pictures
should be missing
 
identities presence absence
page as
    installation space
                                       timed
talk and composition
where good is prescribed
   privileged time
      spaced
   from left margin
 
The mixture in the City
solemn, silent, sterile,
bogus, provocative, inactive,
very expensive
unsure which is which
counterpoised
spontaneous, shameless, fertile,
ordered, arduous, active, love offers
grave serenity and peace as much as sexual and felt
 
Then he holds happiness
as it were by report
when he finds the contrary within
he lifts the first that finds his own grief
and last to find his own faults
where parts and signs of goodness are many
his gracious touch
and courteous to the Stranger
shows he is citizen of the world.
 
Spin and momentum coupled
in spin-orbit
ultrafast optical techniques to spatiotemporal
resolve spin dynamics
in strained gallium arsenide and
indium gallium arsenide
epitaxial layers unexpected
observation of spin splits
arise from strain in semiconductor films
 
His heart not an island cut off but
joins to other continents
compassionate towards
the affliction of others
shows his heart
wounded itself when it gives balm
tasked to discover connections and their expansion
dangers no more light
if they seem right
 
Sensations vary and appear to
duplicate or repeat
experiences link memory to these
sensations and finds difference
and similarity
whether to renew experience or
repeat it as likely as new
experience at each perception facility
to memorate spacetime with internal gorse
 
Trapped inside phase-coherence,
two pulses inject the control
results in absorbance of a signal field and
storage of a quantum state of the signal.
The suppression of noise
vital to avoid decoherence,
even tiny amounts of stationary light
introduce large nonlinear
effects
 
Every medicine an innovation
hard to speak with truth and untruth together
in a few words, Whoever delighted in solitude
either wild or a god where natural or secret hatred
towards society is savage unless out of a love
and desire to sequester his own high conversation
where solitude in a crowd produces without love
and friends are scattered needed only in misery
aperspectively to make visibility
 
Contemporaneity of the future
difference of dry light to his drenched affections
a councel given by others and
his own flattery
Friendship offers peace in affection
support of judgement
twin desires in a body
a body confined once with a typewriter
and ideas of politics in another.
 
 
Boogie Stomp
from Brixton Fractals (1985), now in Gravity (2004)
 
It’s easy being alone, but who cherishes it.  cooperative motion.  accommodation of transient energy.  fluctuations.  not an intrinsic cycle.  happiness without local strain on interchain bonds.  for instance, the exchange stability of beta-sheet protons reflecting structural flexibility.  combined interaction between particles.  turn out more than you’d get by using the parts.  sum-up an overview.  then reject it.  put down the ’phone.  again.  continue diagram of a crystal.  condensation on window.  cold identified.  ice caps, glaciers already melted, retreated.  sculptured land.  viscous, just underneath it, adjusts, to decreased load.  the dimmest flash.  a postglacial rebound. 
 
Perhaps eye strain.  an average of seven equalising particulates.  a simple proton.  tectonic acts.  relaxation of impacted areas.  rheological and viscous properties.  irritation, but no real discomfort.  circadian what?  male periodicities.  not agreement with the world, yet happiness.  the sun spots.  a solar core rotating about twice observed rotation.  thermodynamics of becoming.  recognise this whilst the feeling hurt.  core flash mix without prediction.  stellar change.  lattices of breath.  puckered hexagonal rings of water. 
 
Stacks in sequence.  ABAB.  or turbulent plasmas in a pressure-drop.  a magical study.  ice as “one of the strongest materials known.”  ordered sets of oxygen ions.  compare stars of different masses enveloped by tenuous plasma.  chromospheres, coronas, with ice subjected to high dynamic stresses.  fractures by cleavage.  creeping solids stress-directed.  diffusional flow car.  slow carriage.  taking each breath.  as if that simple.  blood volume in the head above minimum.  facilitate recall.  letting it happen in the same environment as that in which learning occurred.  position as multiple quantity.  drawn in as forces on the diagram.  draw a vector label it v, times the unit vector i.  frictional losses recorded.  dot. 
 
dot.  eight cans.  each once held tomatoes.  each identified, labelled.  space between a can inside another.  Toscanini, told by his bassoonist of a break on the lowest key note, paused in phase space, “It’s alright — that note does not occur in tonight’s concert.”  name the grass.  cost of the seed.  method for cutting.  cost of shears.  servicing mower.  volume of water.  sharpening shears.  frequency of cutting.  plants weeded out.  where’s the seed from.  where’s the mower made.  where’s all that water from.  what’s the soil underneath. 
 
Exercise.  forget the counting.  bone cracks.  another press-up.  count.  short breath count.  enough of counting.  vision as memory plus perception: possibly.  a creep law calculated with a power law dependence.  dependence on what else.  stress marketing.  cross the room and forget.  activation energy equal to energy for proton rearrangement.  adjusts.  an adjusts.  from experimental lout.  science policing.  intensive analysis on every moment, each transition.  temporal dimension extended to the whole process.  incalculable motion.  in the far, for instance, decline in spectral sensitivity.  perhaps bruising from over blinking.  unaffected by absorption in the lens.  unaffected by self-screening.  affected by distress in another. 
 
Order in ice two, disorder in ice one.  glide of dislocations.  rhomboided.  melancholia.  periodic scream.  optical light modulation from red dwarfs.  understanding as an extreme.  manifestation of star spots.  the use of niacin, or simply yeast tablets.  look into ice six.  a structure of two identical and independent frames.  chains of tetrahedrally linked water.  mutual interpenetration of molecules.  self-clathration.  (one of the components enclosed in cavities of the crystals of another component.)  difficulty with the principle.  difficulty with least action for continuity.  eloquent error.  typed as whurr.  overstain or, reposition the table lamp.  eidetic analysis of perhaps.  a language and an energy to speak.  but you’re not here.  until the ’phone, or bus across town. 
 
Two different environments the same time.  alone in each.  how to mutually recall.  avoid tenacious illusion.  meet you at the sands if we get out of here alive.  periodicity of intense love and inertia.  dealt with in the physicality of this expectancy.  a such (where shape offers spatial affinity).  not search as renewal.  not legalised or rational.  the independence of pigments prior meeting without notions of mixing, or analogies of new colour.  rather, configurations of tactile boundaries.  almost definity.  instead, the slightly possible. 
 
Many directions (misunderstood as spread).  each hormonal event sets a readiness for the next.  another ovulation.  or pregnancy intervenes.  watched as ice six formed at room temperature.  compressed water in a gasket between sapphire anvils.  ABAB.  computing the photometric parallax.  assumption of alternativicity.  crystal another comfort.  seat of disorder over stability.  stability repressed alarm.  dark noise.  scaled to fit the zero peak in the flash.  generalised laughter parodied as six crystal systems.  glide in the structure seen on dense planes.  dislocates glide after a steam bath on the glide set.  bonds cut.  dissociates low energy stacking fault. 
 
Science vocabulary in hysteresis.  measured wheezes.  dislocations moving on the shuffle bus.  going for reorientations.  an intellect steeped in empiric lockjaw.  ice compressed into silicon or whatever it’s forced to.  begins move.  cuts through obstacles to analytical solutions of thermodynamic lattice problems.  imports techniques from particle fields.  I makes Ising lattice problem arbitrary.  the good chthoned into strata.  hierolatries.  increases of nearest-neighbour interactions.  a tensor algebra to derive a focussing.  the elegant mambo.
 
Changes in size shape orientation.  you’re not here, that’s difficult.  too easy to be difficult.  the approach involves bringing another dimension of analysis, to relativise the contents of this analysis.  oscillations of bioplasma.  affined to a change in male responses at the same time as the partner.  the whiff of your attention.  in the presence of the magnetofield.  whiteness hums in my head.  on the ’phone.  suddenly a tapping in the phase space.  why we need to know about control.  preempt its ability.  eidetics and empirics moved to a phenomenology of vision.  a search for alternatives to coherence.  range of perceptive angles.  parity not conserved.  radio interference.  eye strain.  telephoned conversation.  a focus on sound that changes the phase space as well. 
 
 
(All the above are from the three volumes of Gravity as a consequence of shape [1982–2005]; all the titles are from jazz dances.)

This slow universe does not seem at all isotropic, on your back in
tension it’s difficult to imagine at half the speed of light watching
starlight and the radiation background coming toward you, from the
direction toward which you are moving, with much higher intensity
than from behind. Beyond this skylight window the universe is said
to be the same all around, an isotropy precise in cosmic background
microwaves traveling through you
from the day of your conception,
somewhat more difficult to speculate that you, or humankind,
are in any special position. In formulating the assumption of isotropy,
you could specify that the universe seems the same in all directions
to a murmuration of freely falling neighbours, each with the average
velocity of typical galaxies, typical brain muscles and simultaneously
all of them might see conditions pretty much the same.

How determinations are conventional, to maintain Euclidean geometryThe Told World
A day of vision — fields bound by rain,
in unaffected shanties not merely human:
birds moving out to the open.
And what’s to be done with the hexbolt
and stop-action, when absent more gently
— isn’t it meaningless or not quite truthful?
Compare our three hundred days of sunshine
or morning wordless : your hand, that
operates so delicately in complicit grounds.
It is a period of exile
with its pivotal shot, impartial of shadow,
and light that frames the narrow window,
to stand disproportionate in daylight
and perfect avoidance, the told-world,
thin as celluloid, we risk at every step.
A prospect — I lose belief!
While we are apart,
there is comfort in blades of muscle
and bone. How could there not?
Alert to a whole repertoire of touch,
away from all necessary politeness.
So fall the blows, the big ugly voices,
covered only in darkness and singing.
The birds fly back. Somehow they give
no inkling of survival.
 
 
Featherweight 
The shadow of a bird flew past —
a brief darkening.
I thought you had
and then I wasn’t sure 

… for every reason
the oxygenated blood’s welling
bright and asymmetric
a feather, a sonic of sunlight.
The weight of a soul
the weight of a feather
lifted from this shared atlas
this cage of branches,
in opened space that sometimes
I see clearly through.
Altogether too responsive
the sky bare against the body
unable to write even the shadow
of a bird against air.
 
 
Sanctuary
vast — the whole bright
pixilated
banking aircraft
yet under, the tree’s dark
green edible leaf
                               (sward)
we work like birds turning
over the soft fruit — piercing

it is no consolation mother
to sweeten my mouth
your arms are evening
clad the sky undone

Above — the huntsman
passe auant
  

blunder his gentleman
their dogs to a mechanical hare
always ahead
                           always coursing
their wide agencies of data
 ignorant
of our small tasks
of sanctuary — withheld

               like

               blue uniform

               matching her

               like Madeline
               independent and brave
 
an image of stones
walking on the black and white
paving stones
passing by the ruins of St Paul’s
the wrought iron balconies
the lovely yellow painted walls
 
an image of street vendors
 
assembled from tourist memories
like
 
a childhood image
her freedom and safety
small city, big town
 
walking to a school
in pre-casino Macao
 
               there are stones in this stream
               that I want to cross
 
               stepping stones
               or obstacles
 
her life as an artist
that determination
visible in her face
 
it’s like
 
brings up
my own past
 
sometime freedom and safety
but then this thing
               with a black tail
               appears
               suddenly swings around
 
hovers over the baby’s cot
soothing with silky words
then turns into something
else
 
               like
               Magdalene
 
               I had a dream of the stigmata
               but it didn’t help
               you can see it coming
               but you can’t escape
 
colour can drive it away
I see it in her work
the saturation
               the loveliness
 
representing the impossible
 


The Salty Sea/Sydney by Night        

I remember the time we watched the day break over the beach
sitting cross-legged on the road around midnight 
(this is late ’70s, I was very physically fit)
looking up along the studs running up the side seam of a man’s jeans
still believing in the public performance of poetry
and in the efficacy of the lifestyle which sustained it
being out of touch with a domestic life, out of touch with men 
and therefore out of contact with the normal ’70s woman 

There’s the flash of a car’s headlights sweeping across the grass in the park
there’s the shock of the sight in the rearview mirror, those eyes —
what question are they asking?
well, everyone’s a foreigner to me
and the car, a longed-for oasis
thirsting for sleep, longing to be home at last
so far away now we might as well be in another country

Other countries seem so close
that now travelling and staying here are not dissimilar
I saw a real desert oasis tucked into its waddy
breath-taking, thirst-quenching, vegetation threatening to burst out into the desert 
like the patterns of the mosaics and carpets in the Dome of the Rock
that fabulous building

I remember the way I felt about the boulders embedded in the dry creek bed
and the way the casuarinas all bent in one direction
as I sketched them
then understanding later that they’d been bent by floods
and the whole painting had a sense of aftermath
it was the biggest painting I ever did

And the woman who was there with me 
must have been thinking very different thoughts
she and her husband setting up house together 
in a different way from me
where their nesting instincts definitely centred on children
and in my memory the image of her stomach and her breasts
as we lay near our tents under the trees by the river bank
and the idea of embryos implanting themselves in the uterine wall
are connected

For me the painting, structurally a bit like blue poles
was more important
I could feel the sense of choking claustrophobia and boredom
in the other alternative
there wasn’t much variety of lifestyle in the ’60s

I remember looking at buildings out of interest in them
wanting to discuss ideas
being interested in male intellectuals for that reason
(being deluded about the nature of their interest in me 
and not assessing them as husband material) 
and being swept off my feet by their lack of interest in me
as a thinking person, their imperviousness
bearing down on you like a blistering wave of heat
over the point from the huge and inert silos of White Bay
inert by day and by night

I remember the inner city lifestyles of the ’70s
the kitchens, the tarot, the numerology
the herbal tea, things that are institutionalized now
my world straddling the women’s movement and the small press scene
when performance was the only way we could reach an audience
in times before the institutionalized creative writing courses
and the massive takeover by the multinational presses
marketeers reaching into our back rooms and kicking us out
whitewashing the whole thing, creating acceptable poets
acceptable feminists, acceptable ethnics

There used to be wild and interesting women around
articulate and heroic at meetings and in lectures
being politically correct, actually
not like now when people are too scared to say boo
as though the tidal wave myth actually came true 
in a metaphoric sense, sweeping away everything in its path
and the survivors are the ones who retreated to the country
or just retreated into a defensive position

I remember a dream I had of a wide salty sea
the water shallow and whitish with salt
there was nothing but water, no land 
and I swam up to a figure draped on a dead tree
an old female relative, so old that her body was like silky hemp
she had no clothes only long blond silky hair 
she was more than helpless, she was no use
outside the water her body had the stiffness of hemp
but in the water she was amorphous like fine seaweed
it seemed like the previous generations weren’t going to be much help
and this proved to be true

In another dream we were forced to move way out past Woop-Woop
to apartments on the tidal flats
and once the tide came in at night we were trapped there
a metaphor for an oppositional upbringing and its legacy perhaps
but not just where you choose to be, exile is not it  

Trying to leap across fields across continents
to build up a sense of complexity and density
to simulate the experience of the metropolis we don’t have
to escape the parochial in a parochial environment
without denying the significant things 
to locate significant work and become immersed in it
to make your life multidimensional
to leave the multitude of connections
to avoid tying up loose ends
to collage like a violent mosaic
where every piece is torn not neat 
to expose the ruptures not smooth them over
to participate but refuse
like the old idea of seizing the available platform

The actions of the tradition-breakers persisting in our memories
alongside the fragments of the old traditions 
and now difficult to disentangle

Typographical err Or makes me live you more
              peach day; all the fruitiest
                            salad days of my unastounding youth
fresh firm to ouch, sluice running rivulets

leaves of green a sticky miss. Wilt. Upturned facia to cuss,
my inner coast dealings on display,
                                          here they are 4 all 2 cc. Can I
whistle fluent profanities to you if my mood autocorrects
song to joy always as

Moonlight soon after by compost Lord pig’s van,
my blind blissful germ and his bland loaves. Fly this motion

A Poem Like Alice
 
Imagine: the daughters of the daughters
of the good doctor left with
a wardrobe of lilaceous effects,
              all made to measure
but in American sizes. The lyric perhaps
              a little too roomy for those with
cultural cringe. Our intimacies still
              with side crack, or a sign that
says tragic follower, needs new home. I am
not the burning woman you speak of,
              I have not the burning heart, the burning cradle.
                                          Our red centres here,
                                          trademarked and trampled,
                                          have become transposed,
              plain targets for the secular. We are, as they say,
incessantly mall-eable.
 
              And yet passion is still sought
                            the need for sustenance, new grace
                                          beyond the over-imported,
                            boxed synthetic, summer lite.
You offer this tantalizingly, graven heiress.
While we yearn for that which lets
                            lyric be born more handsomely;
                                          the sorrow of things so intricately shipped,
                                          yet custom stalled.
 
             How do we fashion a form, skirt such glamour,
                            thrust the speculum southward
                                          looking for progeniture
                            if “alice ordered me to be made”?
 
 
Wall-mount Malady in Western Vic.
 
Love with spurs of an echidna,
its stretched skin adorning the wall
of a kiosk at Wyperfeld National Park.
I expect, on cue, Twin Peaks music
or Sherilyn Fenn sashaying through the door,
elasta-girl in a wrapped backwater brashness.
You know every part of the echidna’s skin
is sharp, even those soft-looking bits.
And its spurs do not poison, unlike the platypus,
all billable hours and flat pack fur-real.
Somewhere over Rainbow way, they know
it as monotreme “Maud”-lin. More often, though,
it’s just played as a folksy native duet
in an old new Australian bar with faux-timber walls and
a plyboard interior that passes for the heart, or at the very least,
a Rimbaudian log-lad. If asking for a map, you’ll get
the gold rustic sucker-punch they call poetic history
with optional Dream-weaver and a packet of Turf,
money on the fridge, pending Dransfield’s overdue return.
The black swan ceramic sits alongside the glaze
of the gas heater; the desk ladies shuffle past
with cups of overcooked tea and weekend scores
practicing pattern-book Cleckheaton and a cuddle
me grandmother aspic ambition for the Grand Final pick.
Readers Digest pack the shelves and the semi-arid
landscape heaves its way towards the border
like a poet laureate on an overripe reading tour
through the Beaujolais ekphrasis. Just like the promos said,
dust on the rose, dust on the divan, that one’s called Laura, coach.
And where is love in all of this? Bandied and splayed,
nose pointing south, dry-snouting the silverfish.
Overlooked memorabilia for those taking the Wimmera

fighting with words
hate is tattooed
beneath the knuckles
of my right fist
love beneath those
of my left
my words are
uppercuts
my lines are
left and right hooks
each verse is a jab
i fight with hate
and love when I write
with an upper cut
a left and right hook
and a jab





dame Margot on the line
dame Margot raises
        her hands
        to the sky

hanging out the washing
            the sheets
Franks rugby sox

teen Tanias
thousand and one towels

in a pirouette
she spins the world around

remembers when she was
        the Queen

dancing with the stars
    on Saturday night

the streets and lights
       called her name

Margret Brown

dancing in the city

how sweet to make love
             in the rain

now there’s hooverin to do

hell the washing machine
      shakes the state house
         like Ruaumoko

at night the dark wind
             blows

the sheets and towels are weeping ghosts
            whirling around
               the moon

love went to get the milk one morning
        fifteen years ago

he rang her from Aus once

Frank and Tania don’t know him

          ‘it was for the best’
                she says

            pegging things out

she’s dame Margot on the line
      still dancing in there
              somewhere

and her heart sings like the birds
         in the trees

        her wairua
like the wild wind and sea

Isolated System
 
farther from where the crop-mattress ends
a space isolated
in tremors i see i saw
in tremors on the see and saw
which breaks equilibrium. that is pre-condition
number one
when the woods breathe in isolation
and breathe out green made from a
free tension, pure energy.
 
to make work in an isolated system
several objects must create their own heat
and their own innate pressures
in the tremors i see i saw.
from see to saw when balance strikes
there’s no more work in isolation.
it can find its grave, remembers the species
of insects that fill the yard, its intrinsic flowers.
 
let aerial pressure pushes the piston’s life
a little gentle further into the cylinder
into a thermal equilibrium
a fine tremor then registers as see moves to saw
 
devoid of a pulsation
plunging into the invincible weight of an equilibrium
there’s no work left in melancholia anymore
no breeze
no tremor between see and saw.
 
Some would advice a change of place, of woods
where the air works
moving into a different contraction of reality
ask the blood its atomic militia
it’s not work, a thermal rhyme
that breaks away from the antique joints
renewed mudras of the palm beating on a new drum
percussion that’s partly sound, born pressure, felt heat.
 
how far must the roots run so its not rooted enough
forget the conjoints in favor of its syllables
earth stone and water
a fundamentalism
that upsets balance to make work isolated
in tremors i see i saw
in tremors on the see and saw
 
a desolation stands firm and fenced
amidst a shade and garden untouched by the sun
when heat is spoken it doesn’t necessarily work
maybe fruits are plucked from a variety of elevations
or in a mild wave runs through the blades of grass
an animal fruit in a lightening instant
in a moment that’s itself unstill
transforming into what is still unclear duality
no work records at this time in the lightening woods
observe their changing levels   keep eyes on the glass
its consciousness is borning remember
heat makes energy and they aren’t duals.
 
if you could remember that there is a state
where the fluid, dense and ether can co-function
informing us about the colorscents that occupy nature
you would recall all the other forests
that need to be touched upon as part of the
transition plan
you would remember the siblings of our nature
their huts, roots, floral hairs
their suckling touch
 
how much of yourself do you reflect in this wood
how many mirrors have you seen
the apple under sky was expected to be blue
wasn’t it?
is blue liberty? what does the atom say?
 
it is the causal element on the surface
of all the twists and phantasms
that could alter the length of a wave
to make horizon red
and the apple will now look brown
or applied red
its boughs would blossom roses
before the fruit arrives
 
watch the levels of freedom in the other woods
measure them and the tremors we need
in the tremors we see and saw
to work in isolation work
that needs to be.   
 
 
 
Woodense
 
Until our husbands return we will mourn their absence.
We are the pseudo-widow. The ritual is our ancestor.
 
inquisition saliva percolates into woodense
it trains the spider
tiger comes out from a corner webcell
or a belljar in where the lily blooms
and we do not hear but the
commentator of despotic state machine
acknowledges the being’s endangered crisis
it spins around us as news
which needs a media no wonder noise does
in order to carry itself to us
sauce thickens with the spin and the loop
on the top’s surface is invisible
 
Official honey collection season began in the Sunderbans 
last Monday. Tiger attacks are more likely this year. 
Untraceable changes in the process of collecting honey 
from deep inside the forests. Nor have the bees changed. 
As expected, they’re vacationing. 
 
abrupt thought is sharpened by the uncertainties
of commodity
in the maneater’s blood
unwritten entropy
prepares a leap at this end
and compression at another
a quarter on the left pan
a nickel on the right
language fence crushed and royal white
it is in the patio                            it roars
and rules the republic of words
in a sign system of one equals one
 
Most men of these islands live either as lumberjacks, 
honey-collectors or hunt crabs in afforested rivulets. The 
tiger is a regular royal — royal and endangered. 
Prevention rules. Guns or weapons are not allowed in the 
woods. Occasionally, the forest department uses shotguns 
with sleeping bullets. 
 
power is an abstraction best portrayed by a mix
of clay and salt
that makes Banbibi state machine in wood-goddess role
she’s the protector
nature mother
the beast is her mount
in the soft grip of power
in the ease of elite control
even some hyper days
turn overcast in minutes
handing ice-cream to robustious selves
a little attention
mud subsides and the water calms
deity atop the sad tiger
 
this honeyseason she accepts
flowers
 
Hardship of local data. Challenged dichotomies of 
commerce and economy. Faced with such lives, they 
choose to ignore the animal. The tiger remains a destiny 
as thunder fells cinchona. Uncertainty pawprints as 
a mouli, the honey collector, goes into the forest. The wife 
knows. How unsure is his return. She has learned to 
accept it. The practice. Imagined widow. 
 
noya opened    free       barefeet           mouli-wife
artist’s compatriot
the strength of temporary widowship to which it adds birds
on the flyleaf of Art ’n Life
or the widow in the henhouse
picking up the shreds
and knowledge
and knowledge knows best            where the bird-catchers are
in the backdrop                                              & where the quack
 
Last Monday was the official commencement of the honey 
collection season. Mouli-wives have begun offering 
prayers to Banbibi — sacred the wood goddess. A 
thousand families. Temporary widowship until the 
husbands return. The women turn vegetarian. Refrain 
from using soap, oil, vermillion; take off their wedding 
bangles, stay barefeet and milk-clad (wear white saris 
only).
 
artist       connoisseur of life       though helpless submitter to one’s
propensities                                  family starving
yet benevolence drawn from wooden material
climbs up the cinchona to break the hive
while cohorts wait below
for more honey
dropping dripping
a strange hollow noise at the root of dire
brings a woodpecker out of
the broken boat
 
“Twice a day we would pretend to be widow but continue 
to offer water and honey to the sacred Banbibi. We pray 
for the safekeeping of our men.” Tarubala Mondal, a 
hexagenarian from Jamespur, said, “We have had more 
tiger attacks this year. Quite often the tiger has entered 
the village. Now our folks have invaded its den. Mother 
Banbibi will protect them.” 
 
even the brave hunter is oppressor
poetry blinds the bee’s nature
in continuous cycles of aesthetic birth
 
the moulis work differently
 
153 Mouli groups, according to the state department, 
have entered the forest in the Tiger Project Area. In small 
groups of 5–7, 1,120 men. Men of the green and dense. 
Men as prey. Hunted hunters with a mission. Of 
collecting honey from deserted hives. They are allowed 
up to two weeks for collection. All honey and wax will be 
purchased from the Moulis by the State at government 
stipulated rates. 
 
culture of workplace is above all
where bees swarm over the tiger
mouli-wives      milk-clad      vermillionless
don’t touch fish                        just wait
free & cloistered            penchant for hybridtext
and cloned arts
the hunter comes full circle and gets hunted
circles overlap                as in a Venn diagram
 
One’s own ways to beat the dread. Some believe in 
superstitions, voodoos, some in the Banbibi, some in 
clairvoyants and jungle magic. But most importantly we 
give protective masks to the Moulis. Masks with carefully 
painted bloody faces that’ll scare away the tiger. They 
must use it at all times. Mask is nakedest weapon.
 
forest department knows it all
observes            measures
we accept the proprietor’s law as just
moulimask is a bloody face
meant to scare away the tiger
it’s the carnivore’s social psychology that triumphs
in our favor
and the maskmaker                        evermore[1]

the tower of silence
 
feather-float at the end of tower crest 
disjunct released spirit
in mid-air drift      blue soul abiota     as it understands
and quits iniquity’s illusory word power 
at the peak           of silence
 
a popular Parsi myth describes how a tribehead approached an Indian 
king and introduced sugar, insisted that the white powder, an emblem of 
purity, be thrown into a glass of milk, the Parsis, or the Zoroastrians of 
India waited while the King was enchanted by the taste of the treated milk 
which neither changed color nor composition, they moved in from ancient 
Persia around 10th century AD, the Parsi leader remarked — like it 
(sugar), we will blend into the body and soul of this country ….
 
a complete absence of sound courtesy bird o’ bird
carnivore 
has the sky lost another living metaphor?
the remnant biodegradable this residual waste
an abandoned home designs destiny’s vice
pierced by a cruel economy
a mind produced that doesn’t ring streets empty of peddlers
like of silence of what they are
 
the innermost circle holds children, at the Parsi practise of sky-burial atop 
a tall cylindrical structure following Zoroastrian tradition that considers a 
corpse to be “nasu” or unclean and the dead are displayed to the sun in 
three concentric annular areas, the first annular area following the core is 
designated for women and the outer annulus holds bodies of men….
 
as destiny rules     as it had to happen     it is accepted
like the value of ∏
3.14159265358979323846 ….
yet
people think a circle’s area can be measured with
burgeoning confidence
split into three societal parts
children in the inner core
the bodies of their dead mothers herding the mantle
and male corpses devoid of significant density
float in the outer crust
 
the sun first decomposes the body of the dead human, vultures strip it of its 
meat and the bones are later collected and burned all this done in order to 
protect against the short supply of clean wood, water, earth and air in the 
region, they consider the dead body to be contaminative, not however at 
ethereal heights as they are offered to the sun and the birds in what might 
be one of the greenest of disposition options ….
 
there is silence             there is the toiling sun     and decomposition
just the missing non-migratory
 
its like how the wolf is a janitor of wilderness    like the fox
in a small wood            of symbols
of ornamental city with its hidden waste        here is the janitor-bird
swooping low to snatch
as the sun does       to strip soul off the body
but it latches on      a raincoat does
and one needs to scrub the paint before one can begin
needs that vulture-pull so the meat-coat can snap
and it can rain
 
eaten by the same birds the custom can be considered to be an extension 
of the faith’s egalitarian ethics, as everyone, rich or poor, fair unfair, 
right wrong are cremated in the same tower, within the same circles 
drawn as if on a tree’s ageing journal and under the same sun ….
 
extinct cause lurks in the name of disabled work
extinct work suspends the cause
we say ritual shapes collective identity
there is no art in a spotless sky
 
in the recent years the funeral system almost became dysfunctional as the 
vultures vanished in Mumbai, the home of the largest concentration of 
Parsis, hundreds of vultures once circled above the tower of silence, those 
numbers had dropped to teens in one of the richest suburbs, the area of 
the dead ….
 
and always a sad river next to development
next to any focused task
and forgotten scenes of a line of Hargiles waiting
on the Ganga bank at dusk           familiar janitors all
extinct and abandoned from memory
so many of the city’s rooms locked up     unused
so many trees behind the placards
with their keys thrown into the river
 
oh! the holy cow! the indeed holy Indian cattle, used primarily for farming 
— agricultural and dairy, predominantly Hindu, few consume cattle meat 
and most cattle living fuller lives, requiring treatment when they’re infirm 
are adminstered Diclofenac — a non-steroidal painkiller and anti-
inflammatory drug, proven to be extremely safe on humans and other 
animals, but not the birds as Diclofenac strangely and fatally affected the 
vulture kidney; the birds almost instantly dropping dead as they feed on 
the large volumes of cattle carcass dumped in designated areas ….
 
our selfish milk       cow so close to the heart     lovely animal
and Diclofenac       our scientific gem
anti-inflammatory         crunching overbearing emotion from
the play’s spirit             from cattle gland     it’s a job    an important one
to tuck in a morsel of termitic mood in the fabric of all construction
we understand that
 
vultures collapse in dozens  in the cattle-pit
the word “corpse” holds a strange literary stillness
and pretending not to understand its cause-effect
holding up the head high against the sun
to a get a feel for its height
to know why a tower is in love with silence
to know why does it lack vultures
when a biodegradable creation runs out of subscribers
 
you really don’t need to know
in a recent interview with a Parsi scholar that focussed on this crisis, he 
said, “Our last act of charity was with the vulture, with tradition under 
threat and that’s what we have grown up to follow, look at most cultures, 
they are scavengers seen in a very negative light, to us the vulture 
is a religious bird it performs a religious duty. ...”[2]

ONE IS ALSO CHIPS
 
I am the line itself, a small, esp. thin piece
in hewing or cutting; the course of a wood-
 
man’s work. I am a woodman’s Chyppe. He
broke dates, sodden then dry, for a blaze: on
 
the ground the parsley’s a sapling, the tile of
a battle of turpentine. I love you. I love you
 
as I am embedded in the doughy earlobe next
to your brain. Poets and their German Work-
 
shops, their fracture of a potato as scorched in
molten fats. Orange wedges, a salt cellar, the
 
tug of Dickens at the back of the throat. I’m so
thirst. And I am just like my mother, betrayed
 
by cunning sauces, a piece of money, a willing
to pile. Straddling a driver, straddling one who
 
plays that damn insurance game. One wish is to
close your circuit, to route all nervous systems

 
and tech-gear through my palm, as though sopped
 into bread. Inside every cell is a system beyond your
 
own capacity for mathematics. Inside every wire
is a bloodline beyond our sense of community.
 
You, whom thy fingers walke. I walked into the
space inside your downy cat’s ear, folded as an
 
envelope between my fingerpads, threaded as
hats into baskets. One thing filleted from another
 
to add strength, threading as mutton or dung of
buffalo, skin of gravy, a potato, a grammatical device.
 
I know a chip or two: I stand on my leg like a heron,
sole into knee-crook, fist into waist, toastcrust, yes,
 
as a sword, demanding the right to conduct this
breakfast as it ought to be, a quarrel for a dial. What?
 
We nivver had these chips when we be wed.
Love is a baker’s dozen, strokes of an axe. Strokes.

 
Thus removing small parts, small parts at a time:
 With, of, from, bred, stepet, etc. You make it all as
 
an egg-shell or leaf-curl, nursling of some ten-acre
graincrop. I threw in my pocketknife for this stake,
 
I slipped it into the net, smooth as cruelty, as you lay
back, chippin oot with a nod. Smooth and cold like a
 
cuke thrown laterally, Mr Chips done lost his chips.
Silicon nitride! I fit right into this archipelago, so do
 
you. Electronics as in a Greek tragedy, fed through
cassette narratives of sex, transformation, war and
 
deep economy. Sublimated as warm yeast’d ale up
through the chipboard of a bedframe, becoming the
 
rain of two neural systems and two sets of thighs. He
always had a chip on his shoulder re: psychoanalysis.
 
Why? Because it whips one into an auto-meringue,
all air as time all self-concern, all ultimate tender-

 
ness and vulnerability, immune to contamination.
 But seedy trilogy would say all manner to the
 

contrary, a lesson in affect, at the very least.
Animated as a whiff, tracked like a domestic rabbit,
 
he is hugging a python until it dies, then arranging
a funeral service for it, or stripping off his undies at
 
a sunset-themed dragshow
 


PHOTOGRAPH
the one who wants his photographic
portrait taken as a hero, as a rose’s
lip, as the powdery stamen or heir
loom. the fabrics through which your
photons pass, like fingers. your ether
salts and photons all your photons
at their upper limit speed are fingers,
the photocopy are finger
 
you photograph full-length naked scalar,
the grain of your skin shoving around two
giant faces and an electronic lilac. traits
miniaturised, lacking a zone and a bird’s view
(tissue, cell, a fish thudded to death on a boat’s haunch)
the photo for example, showing Kafka as a shabby
industrial township

formate of the printed poem: fat inner
thighs, alert, saving a finger. the
photo on a brief introduction to drop
in technologies. raked-light photographs,
a hundred hours a dozen or so bytes.
teutonic words snug around my knuckle
a passage way the front wheels jammed a
small slip the bit the pattern where you
split into five or more hookworms.
 
you, as a library paper machine or pocket-
book. as serious as I am I want your photograph
as a dust of contact. here lies the dimension of sense,
the exactitude of a sea lion. the answer? exactly!
exactly as you are, filling a photograph with your head,
obscure as a prime number.
 
my mouth extended to yours, as later remarks suggest. my
mouth at exactly the same time coming into
your mouth as a photograph makes us stretch
together in identification.

photons moving into a new caricature, this
time of science. two photographs of roughly
the same scale revealing you as a plate,
leaking gas, you as an enzyme, leaking yourself.
you as an animist so conic and singular.
 
this is a photograph of rats, a photograph of cotton
and a family of rats arranged around a cotton
field. substituting language with photons that
are fingers fingers through the plane stratic
fingers fingers finding a certain faciality and
pining for a new motto, correct and perceived,
vegetal, sexed, a plateau stretched and hided.
 
this photograph finds a bedroom lost to seeds
thrown and cracked by a rocket. if it were a
sentence, if it were an interior — casts or fossils,
the palette of desert between dead rabbits —
it would be two lines, a sentence made from two
lines, as an x-ray of a forearm. a series of
colour photographs, some as big as the wall
that mounts them, all photographs of transfer.

photo as bombardment, as a neighbourhood
for process, as spots blacker yet, a kind of
strong pathology. Tokyo, the photograph.
Tokyo, the luminous cubes. Tokyo, a woman,
from a photograph in 1992 showing a kabuki theatre.
 
crushing everything in its path, this photograph
is a concrete machine, a disaster, lit by parallel neon bars
lit by electronic music and a dense but misleading
spectacle above your head

Hell’s Wisdom
(read the original manuscript in the Baroness archives)
<All wisdom is profoundly trivial>
Love is gravitation
My "Derangement" dwells in absence – as – under circumstances existing – normally – it 
should be present.
It maintains in circumstance –
There I leave it.
My being in senses right is normal height.
It being uncommon – presents strange - as genius does - uncompanioned.
Victim of circumstance I am not – as I am no dweller in
For me - to be touched - touchably - by circumstance - normal
To vacuous spectres of substance past - should so be abnormal – as to cause revulsion 
degree –

 Considering Ern Malley’s The Darkening Ecliptic 
on a fine spring morning in the front garden 
 
it’s not so much the caterpillar
 
itself —
 
but the shape
 
of the hole
 
it has left
 
in the heart
 
of the leaf
 
 
Patience
 
Clouds fracture —
            the weight of sparrows
                         splinters
                                      glass delusions —
 
green verge
            of painted days —
 
                         compress this
                                        out of silence
 
            §
 
            winter’s edge —
 
the eye traces
            flight
                        toward definition —
 
            blue jeans
                         crimson leaves
                                      wing shapes
            cutting
                         sharp light

            come
                         the day beckons —
 
            patience flowers
                         in cool bowls
            a surface
                         to commence with —
 
                         there is much
                                      to be done —
 
                         all that’s
            at the tip
                         of naked branches
 
 
Borders
 
The crisp sunlight, the pale
blue sky, are only part
of the subject —
 
better this Autumn
afternoon the orange
butterfly with
 
black-edged wings,
who by chance
enters the garden
 
that is no space
to him (or
her) at all,
 
who goes on through
the white pickets,
through the rust-
 
coloured grapevine —
of this poemIt was reading Lorine Niedecker that got me back to writing. There had been a fifteen-year gap or refusal, and then in 2004 the poetry started pouring out in sequences, like writing a back catalogue. I’d always picked up on American cadences alongside English traditions, the directness of sound and speech. Growing up in Britain in the sixties, a kind of American timbre came through in music, film, and especially on TV. There was a lag, we often got it late. It’s no surprise it was formative somehow, mixing with everything else that comes through the ear. There are frequencies I look for. I’ve found that traveling in the US has allowed me to hear them, the everyday differences and attachments. That as much as reading. So there’s a journey across North Dakota between the minimal lines of When Blue Light Falls. Wrack begins by taking on the punned complicity of a verb as much as wrecked booty — ‘I wrack’ — that came from George Bush’s verbalizing of ‘I-raq’ on the news. I wrote on Dogtown after going into the swamps there in search of eighteenth-century cellar holes before I realized — duh! — that Charles Olson owned it. Parts of my new collection, Occasionals, while rooted in London and John Clare’s wanderings, were also written in Bolinas and carry freight from Massachusetts, spliced at the level of the line in what I see as irrational cuts. There’s a cartoon coyote that turns up at one moment — it’s for me as much registering the distracted wolf in Beuys’s “I Like America and America Likes Me” as the wily one.
Most immediately and as a given I hear Stein, Williams, Creeley alongside the British writers who matter to me. Meeting Bob Grenier in the UK in 2005 opened up his minimal poems, both their Keatsian attention and the four-color ‘scrawl’ that makes them material and difficult to decipher. I also work in other media, use handwriting, there was a permission in seeing them. I discussed Zukofsky’s small horse by email with Bob, began to think about Larry Eigner (I’m remembering Steve McCaffery’s discussion in London of Eigner’s word ‘fleering’). Lyn Hejinian’s Happily. Stephen Ratcliffe’s epic durational works. Substantially, however, the most important writing to me has been that by Alice Notley and Leslie Scalapino, for the integrity of their encounter with language, two forms of being uncompromising. I hear the stakes of writing there. I am listening these days to Eleni Sikelianos, Cathy Wagner, Lee Ann Brown, and thinking about song.
I could go on.

Five from Occasionals
Cosas que pasan. Things happen. In the occasional,
without recognition. Risks run, tessellate. He would
burn her back, he says, his. Mother, into presence.
As if she would return to herself in his desire.
Too close. To see she might want in her own terms.
Horror is best domesticated, and we weep
vainly. When the wind swells, the plane enters sound
differently. Spins, the way a compass needle does,
finding. Direction, a lag catching, before it steadies.
What happens in an indrawn. Breath, on that scale.
A thunder clap, restarting. If Living Is Without You,
across hedge groins, privet privates. At night, chorus,
I Can’t. We climbed the pines, he buried. Cut-out
pictures, leaving holes. The small incline was
freedom. Resin, bark, bending under weight.
It might pitch us. To the ground, coyotes falling
from the cliff. Followed by a rock, suspended.
Any More, plangent warbling. The hum of wings,
happens. Colour of a green beetle, catching. Light
between branches, this summer. Taped birdsong,
ticks in the sink bowl, shaken. Water trapped
in its own form, mild. Planetary skin, float, tasting.
Clear borealis, we went to look, treading it. The cliffs
rose, let my limbs get me there and back. About
to dive and you shouted, what about. The book,
panic. Caves, where children swing. In times of
famine. They stockpile. Supplies, mouldering
in deserted buildings, infrequently visited. Yes.

2 October
 
 
 
 
He died in a desert town. The quiet
of his lines, baking. In the heat, where
something in the trees, is. Rising, as birds
might. I am not there, to interrupt. Or to
cut, irrationally, in. Perhaps I slide my finger
along the edge, each. Blade too close
to see, now. It is autumn. Insist on its
seriousness. This seam, inside frayed.
To pull apart, as threads do, when.
Flesh expands. And darned up, badly,
the lift of matter. Tugs and scabs, not
for want of trying. He runs, awkwardly.
Enough to leave them, sometimes. To
work their own accommodation, each.
Space can be a fragment, a sliver. Of
shrapnel, tossed up. In circumstance.
Dragging on the skin. Or a number of
other things. A stumbling looking after,
he said. Did he, or perhaps not. The time
when soot. Flooded the room, a bird
escaping, when. In the process of relating,
the same event occurred. The time, when
soot had flooded. The astonishment
of friends, at this relation. Clearing up,
after. In every finger, there are. Silences,
drawn along, and rough. Against, what
surfaces. Or lines, when he was here. Not
sparing the impulse, when. What bird falls.

2 October
 
 
 
The absence of harm is not the place to begin.
In the mildness of. Seasons, insufficient leaf
fall, they hang on. By the last thread, needing.
Definition, the gasp of frost. To let go. I know
what it is and then I do not, this game. Quietens
us down. If you break it open why, is there only
this silence, cracked open, the salt of other.
Pain, is not mine to own. It does not have a
cavity, for light. Or breath, but it serves, pain
persisting. To find a relation. Will you cut out
eyes and mouth, place it. At the window, lamp
for an evening. When they come asking, or
punishing. Replace the roof, it begins to burn.
That is for tomorrow. Now the purl of sky engine,
the point when it turns, sound dropping. Will
descent remain after it has gone, do we. Know
the reliance of gravity as a reluctant measure.
When it leaves us, only. Aggregations, do not
think of it as a lightness. Stacks of crimson,
the gnarl of globes, residues. Of distant earth,
chambers of flesh and light. The nature of over
wintering, buoyed up, hardened to its lasting, is.
Convincing, it does not ask to be. A mode of
attention. The thickness, is a red hide. Density
reassures, the beat of. Knuckles checking
ripeness, you know. He said, the rest are all
sold, and these the last. Red, green veins, will
open at the ceremonial, the knife. Sticks.

31 October
 
 
 
Rest, is. Also a gathering. Sometimes,
it constellates happily, or pintucks. Tacked
up for later attention, in. Moments of early
afternoon, when labour is. Required, there
are. Patches of quiet worked in, pulled down
where thought. Waits in deeper compass,
it waits. Awhile. For the clearing of ground
to end, when gleaning is. A later gathering
that stacks up hopefully. Later corn will grow
as high as the fence, does it. Begin in thought
before ground determines. Where it rises,
already. Where birds quilt in sound, when
they prick it out in shoots. Or in small pursed
seeds. Bursting. Are there cries. Of alarm at
beginning again, or. Nothing of contention,
just round in the palm repeatedly. Watered
to the depth of several minutes. Do they answer,
each. Hole is an undertaking, a wager with.
The darkness of woods, where. Eyes roll in
the silence, without animals, do they. Return
from broken trees, the blue branches, suddenly.
In spans of limbs and elbows, when waking
is a condition loosely remembered. This tree
bends, it is a woman’s back today, it pauses.
Under the moss, aching in hollows. Has the
calendar passed by, or does it fan out. Overhead,
and wheel with others. Congregating, does
it wheel freely. This is. A branch, a root.

29 March
 
 
 
Thinking to greet light early. When sun rises,
it falls through the slats in patches. In which
direction to catch it. Surely, the small moth.
Spreads itself on the white wall. Today,
does it sweat. Or take heat from the damp
air, some principle of silicate. Animates,
it has. A brown perfection, scaled from. A
forest floor. Water would recoil, it holds
itself distinct. Will it break, so much mounts.
Skywards, thickened thrown. But held in
vapour, you could not keep it at bay. Unless
something in you. Demanded that desiccation,
in lieu of. Attention. While your mind busies
itself. With elsewhere, and seasons take place.
In a grand rolling, you think. Of extension,
arms outflung, languorous, the weight of
gravity. As resettlement, still. It is night, they
fall over the edge. Are sighing, the sheen of.
Sleep, this dark syrup. Muttering. Bats wildly
against the light, it wheels, is white. Blinding,
so close to. Magnesium flares, the dry roar
of it. On a smaller. But it would seem a
conflagration. Under glass, is that abandon. In
wheeling, or what distraction is. Compulsion
to bring bodies near. Sight, its reach, or. This
trust falling towards. Experience, night secrecies.
Ending. The warm plane of outside, enters.

17 July
jump rope for heart
(after Janet Charman: set point) 
 
milk-emulsion sky above
ghost-image sun
strung out, I ride along
 
flailing, discomposed
 
I know the drill
one-two-three, one-two-
three
 
it’s a synchronised swim
 
a skipping game, right?
just a few small pricks
keep the ball in play
 
 
in the case
of the dog
three yards   over
 
he thinks it’s curtains
 
daily
when the gate
swings to
 
each morning’s desertion unhinges him
 
his choking howls
wasted                        on no-nonsense Nonna
business to see to            muttering
 
 
Moominmamma
my old buddy
what do you say?
 
 
ever-mellow
 
 
filling Pappa’s top-hat with seasonal berries
my troll-cup can always force a smile
a moomin lady and her handbag
 
are never separated
 
she’s humming
a rosebud
held between her ears
 
 
 
 
fruit trees and beehives
the moomins make apple cheese
in the autumn air
 
Mamma keeps Granny’s book of potions
 
on the cup’s far side
she hurls a ball
clutching her bag with her free paw
 
less comfortable in this pose
 
but doing it for Moomintroll, her boy
the cup a gift from my moomin, for the record
what matter if
 
a grey afternoon takes the boys with it
gone with the hattifatteners
interested only in travelling onwards
 
over “the absolute and enormous sea”
 
Pappa will wake
on a stormy island
turn the skiff
 
around
 
plying oars towards “his family
and his verandah”
his Isolde
 
 
 
 
 
Hello, sunshine
sit bolt upright, staring
time to give your night-self the brushoff
 
panting
 
let her go            the murderer’s
accomplice, swinging from the handrail
of a bus, recoiling
 
from what Katy did
 
expunge her
though rags of dream get tangled
in the master-plot            claw their way back
 
 
 
 
today
we’re seeking spells
Moominmamma reads:
 
 
“Remedies
 
… Evil Eye.
Melancholy.
Colds. No.
 
‘If people start getting misty and difficult to see.’ Good.”
 
 
sheep, sheep, come home
the wolf’s gone to Devonshire
and won’t be back for seven years
 
 so sheep, sheep, come home
 
 
 
They skive off
over the hill
a little cough-mixture, maestro, please
 
 
 
 
 
 
sun moves up the sky, bellied
on mashed-potato cloud
absent yesterday
 
and through the gap despondency came in
 
wrapping your efforts in muddy clouts
weighing up the day’s handiwork
as nothing
 
urn burial, this way
 
 
yet Cynthia at seventy
goes nursing
devotes herself to
 
spreading ease
 
her grasp
of tin-tacks
tightening
 
 
 
 
This pen I hold
has journeyed far
beyond where it belongs
 
 
Country Roads
Motor Inn
Goondiwindi.
 
 
no shit
 
 
while Gondwana strains
to stay above the sea
in the heaving southern swell
 
 
humpbacks pause for an unscheduled feed
 
 
shoot plumes
flick us a wave                        lump-sums
they scoot before we get their number
  

 
Strange Perfecter
 
Who was that strange perfecter occasionally
stepping in to give my life a sideways nudge?
Or was it just a series of accidents?
Despite the multiplying data there’s not
necessarily anyone on your case
in a world where biometric differences
can cover up the gulf that is fixed between
darlings of Morpheus and insomniacs
strapped into the home theatre of their thought,
or between people who feel that the real life
is intimated by bare, windswept uplands
and those who want to live where rhinoplasty
is already as normal as filling teeth.
 
I was the perfect stranger continually
stumbling by chance back into my life to find
it was getting on pretty well without me
in a world where what people wear correlates
poorly with what they’re capable of doing
to someone who’ll never be useful to them,
where some can sing an ache to sleep and others
are quite sure they know what intelligence is.
 
 
Zombie Charmers
 
Don’t go thinking we’re like the sad guys you use
to test sunny, fun-loving ideas of sex —
So how would you feel about him doing it
with your ghost? — whose bluish foreheads are inscribed
with the epitaph of the corporate undead:
He lost his life trying to get a CV.
Whenever you’re making a meal of those guys,
we shall be among you. We do jocular
menace: keep laughing or the gloves come off. Look,
it’s better all round if we win because we
are seriously bad losers, mate. On campus
we like the word eliminativism
and shuddering at the conceptually poor.
 
Some say we’re fabulously implausible
like a pint of stout lighting up the world or
innervated space or a donkey on fire
only more so. But we don’t need your belief.
Don’t come trying to put yourself in our shoes.
You don’t know what it’s like and you never will.
We’re atom-for-atom duplicates of you
but there’s nothing at all it’s like to be us.
 
 
Like Le Tellier Says
 
I came away from that seminar thinking
Losers would have to be better company.
A headache was having itself in my head.
The city was glowing like an ember-cave,
but the wind smelt like snow. Like Le Tellier says
The day you begin to believe you deserve
your good luck, that’s when you become an arsehole.
Only the magic of fear had been holding
me down in my seat. I could get up and walk
away from that rigorous river of grey
flowing on behind me, professionally.
Happily the city was riddled with bars
competing for the title of best hidden.
 
I’d rather be doing brute mood improvement.
I’d rather be astray in a dictionary
— ember week: a week in which ember days fall —
or taking a gap for a walk in the hope
of stumbling on the missing piece by a stroke
of crackpot luck, never mind how fat the chance.
Go figure the proportion of ice crystals

Once, for a period of time, I was
                                                                   “beside myself”
             or midway between
I went without Church
                      or Whitechapel Bars, on
                                                                        the street;
our neighbourhood continued very easy.
                                                  great: and the richer sort of p
              particularly
                                                                     filled with people
         all hurrying away;    empty wagons
                       men on horseback,
                 servants,
                 baggage
                                             their appearance
it was apparent,                                                       innumerable
                   was nothing else
                                  was coming
                                                          would be left
                       within the liberties
      hurry, I say,
                                     Government from London
                                                          bringing the injection 
                                                          be still
                                    my fleeting parts & they
                                                                                    bacilli perhaps
                                            among them but also
                   the viral array
flocked hither.
                  I gave myself up
                                 to a readiness of being
ruined
                  in cold Blood
to pass for a Whore here, so I let that go; I told them
                  it was true
One must leave Nature
                                                to fight it Out, so Slowly
                                   that
                                                  my own                         Curiosity
                                                                   gazed
                impatient                    day after day, reflecting
                                               the black tide
                upon this, the Whole
                                 with this proviso:
that the physicians apprehended
              that I was in love;
with who[m]? but as I
                           smil’d and said,
No, indeed Sir, that’s none
of my Distemper.
                                       My restraint
                            would fill a little Volume
               to shut               the eyes of the Watchmen
                            to deceive them, and escape
                            the terrible Pit
               it was
                                                          and could not
resist the retreat.
                                  At the Beginning
                        I went continually
              in a Fright about the Wizards
out of my usual Course, this temporal field
           a sort of gravity conundrum
                        You don’t say, oh sapient one
my doors and windows bolted; then the Accident
             I have related, happened
                        & could not stay within
entirely my self, potentially the One thing essentially
             the other, mute host to a virulent ghost, my voice
                          a replicant, and every choice aswarm
with bygone instants; for all were promiscuously the Subject
             of these Mens Drollery, which the Visitation
                        brought back again by Night.
                                  Preternaturally,
                        the Whole thing
            appeared to me from His direction
A great way out of the hurry now
            “a space of ground designed by Heaven”
                        & wicked which & evil or
          receded into a representation
the element of contagion beginning
          “A quiet and simple grace in his arms …”
                        & All people were grown gay &
          Death come to carry you away
                       merged into a common stream
             the ponderous matter of substance

jetting warm streams from the mailbox clouds above 
the buildings, and every action 
lies chiefly in the out-parishes, which being
                                                             very strange to observe
                   The face of things soon changed

He was propped up on the white sheets

                unarmed and legless

& smil’d at most of the particulars,
                an entire country plugged 
                                        crawls in centre upon centre 
              being                    all of them petty Matters,
and infinitely below
                                         delivering invitations and catcalls
              to turn to Him and live
 
         hanging out in the hole,
                                                      in short
bursts and retirement villages,
                                                      because, as I suppose,
they would not mingle with any Body

                                           over the dirt 
                  like a million larvae triumphant
among the healthiest of people,

The big picture

The next few hours, though intermittent, soon proved exponential. As the light grew nacreous, I travelled through enemy frost crystals tilted a minky blue until even the engine-driver was moved, I fancy. He gave a little speech that drew a long, white, serious face into ever-decreasing circles — a nice complementary touch, I felt, to my travelling ensemble: all the passengers talking at once and giving different advice and directions, the glare of the lights, the coffin-like smell of the sleeping-car and, later, at the grand hotel, the bumping of boxes on stairs after midnight.
        The humping sound of people carrying luggage around drifts through the halls here. Typical. Yet I remain sane, since some mistakes cannot be atoned for. My job’s to get people here, there and everywhere before anyone notices I’m missing.
        But back to the big picture. As always, it’s today when I get there — after which, the precipice looms and the erstwhile barrel-toned gentlemen all go over it or not, prodding. That’s the best way to get to know things, they tell me. Give ’em a good poke.
 


The trip to the grand hotel 
 
For a moment, things seemed just as they were: there was the tree, the balcony, the shining river, the dismal church displaced to the right, the enormous days, weeks — possibly a year or so — as he rang, and rang, and rang down to reception. For security reasons
 
not a word of this 
 
a heavy panting was audible, and questions shouted in foreign tongues. “What do you want? Are you hungry? Have they made you do this sort of thing before? And where did this machine come from?” Unlikely that anyone ever knew
 
about Mr Brown, driver.
 
 
Do you copy?
 
Yes, I hear you. I hear
something else too.
 
Litter, I suspect. Let it brush
against you as you blow
 
down the street — you’ll
soon find out how sticky things
can get when you
really stop
concentrating.
 
I stopped copulating
ears ago. These days the only
f. twinges I forget are forced
metaphors. Ah, here’s
an example.
 
This one’s me, kiddo. It was taken
someplace no-one went to
and was, they told me,
dribblingly attractive. Do I
believe this? What do you think?
 
I relieve no-one, sir, for less
than a hundred dolours.
 
You do it for me though.
Exactly.
 
 
Verily 
 
In Capital! and in his earlier writings
they said he was living in a room by himself,
a Joseph Cornell album
owed to and demanded by
the principle of identity
not two minutes ago. Lo
and Behold were coeval developments:
long before ad infinitum, dependable
clockwork etc., the problem was
the idea of deciding. Wherever
he went he saw semi-
quavers — gold, then salt, then
today sand and stones — meaning
“to reveal oneself”
piecemeal, e.g. “problematic
Handbuch enclosure” —
oak or willow, hard to say which —
whilst shepherding the huluppu-tree
via Tablet XII, plus notes.
Yet there were dates
to be determined,
crates to be unpacked:
he’d tracked them
down through nether regions
hatched from the holus bolus.
Servant or priest of 40 or of 2/3,
he was doomed to live exhausted,
out of breath,
not words.
 
 
something needs expression
 
you can only be as honest
as you are self-aware
 
in the evening light
the purple of the morning glory
is more self-realised
 
the headlights light up
the cobwebs I am walking into
 
 
closed for private function
 
on the chalk-board of your face
 
we deliver what we promise
says the truck stuck in traffic
 
do the writing that kills you
she says
 
I am already dead
I was killed as a child
 
why would a dead person
bother filling out an A-frame
 
a mercenary
with six sessional teaching jobs
 
so many codes
the fear of urgency
will make me memorise
the code for the staff toilet door
 
bumper to bumper
one leaf falls
through all the others
 
 
I dreamt I was feeling vertigo on the stairs 
 
a candle in a jar
it is on the table with the intake of breath
water beads like words before meanings
 
the piece does nothing for you, what have you done for it
I can see the future clearly; up close I need my glasses
a flame in a jar, me in your eyes
 
inevitability with its nose to a false tomorrow
with all your hunger you can start completely new
water beads on the glass
 
the dirty moon through the window
it is harder to get back the withheld
two of me in your eyes that see one
 
broken off bits of graffiti
parakeets dart from backyard wall to gum
words bead like water before falling
 
we leave our families, communities then look for a book club
a clean house does not mean you are not going to die
a flame away from the wind
water beads like meaningspretty chintzy
 
off stage i’d abandoned the
chiffon and spectator shoes but
i don’t know what i’d replaced
them with, not exactly. my memory
is pretty chintzy, just like i was
telling you: one bouquet for five
guys. i mean i refuse to do maths
but it didn’t take my head
long to get around that sum: a
couple of buds each, max, and
that’s supposing we gave tim
the stalks! and the office is plush,
what’s so strange, or a little.
 
would you believe that after
all the money he’d laid out,
for the party, for all of that,
and he’d look embarrassed?
well, he did. and it only made me
want to tousle him more, to
sink him or something, because
all he could think was that one of
his secretaries must have goofed
but really he wasn’t so bad.

arrington de dionyso is the front man
from the band “old time relijun.” he’s
on stage looking haunted, as if he wants
to infect us all with his haunt, like an extra
from the £45 cult hit zombie horror film
“colin.” he’s here promoting his new
album, a mouthful of a solo project:
“arrington de dionyso’s malaikat dan singa.”
drumming, he’s roped in owen curtis
williams. sometimes it feels as if it’s
impossible to see a band in edinburgh
without seeing owen unzip his grey
hoodie and crack his knuckles, getting
ready to play drums. he plays with
jesus h foxx, the pineapple chunks, rob
st john, randan discotheque, benni hemm 
hemm and that’s what the old man said and 
he never came back. he’s previously played
with emily scott, woodpigeon, our ladies of 
sorrow, sher khan, eagleowl, tisso lake and
prose. then there’re these one-off flirtations
with visiting bands. i’m panging horrendously,
coveting that floaty, amorphous, polygamous
creative life, dreaming of enslaving myself
all the time to the whims and attitudes
of other artists but through that, well, i don’t really
know how it works, owen’s his own artist too, a
better one, because of the (must be)
exhilarating influence of all these other
bands with all their different ideas and styles.
anyway, the truth is owen’s so in-demand
because he’s a really great drummer,
his tongue lolling out, his head flung back, as if
his brain had slipped down his chest and that’s
what’s instructing the battering of
the sticks in his fists onto the kit. when i first
arrived tonight he was smoking a cigarette outside
and i did that sort of awkward nod. he’s wearing a
black t-shirt with a cute, angry, embossed
picture of a grizzly bear that i’m sure i’ve seen
him wear before.
 
we’re not dressing
 
the silk though there’s none
kind of sticking to where our
trousers would be the jewellery
weighing heavy on our fists:
inordinately, inexplicably, but

The sky is what we apologize for as the ecumenical
and you reply “hydroponics are possible anyplace,”
those who read Transnistria closely do not necessarily ferry
from polity to métier,
something up and wanting,
harboring the cat burglar in their closet, an actor
making Tennyson of the cloaked darkness, marching. So then,
agreed, say it is the sky from which the bullet flies, Acéphale.
 
My thoughts were to hang the contorted scowl of Poe’s
portrait above the landing and investigate
the salt of his earth, the plaster.
               The white desert is purest furthest, flung-set, like
the roll of the dice or feline plummet. To think they shortened
the lemon tree so that it’d stop producing citrus.
               One man’s steamboat is another man’s King James Bible,
the Song of Songs of Song of Songs of Song of Songs
of Song of Songs of Song of Songs of Solomon
torn out.
What morass exhausts you,
hides you from the third procurement,
turning back the hair and letting the sweat dribble, as if it came
from the anxious vein throbbing like a world of sighs or
peristalsis.
You-know-what in the gape of the orange
of the birds of paradise, purged but for purgatorial
High Wycombe secured in reticulation. To finish
with a conjunction would be worth the pelting of the lead brigade
by members of economist corner, by the economist of the economists
of economist corner, for the economist of the economists of economist corner,
had they the squinty eye of all genius, the woman in daffodils
with a half glass of lager, puckering her lips like a rosebud at her
husband, turned to the tree lopper in overalls shammed by
the sawdust of spruce.
The sky is thus what we apologize for and why we
fondle alone in night hours, backs to the ceiling. If not that
then at least mock drowning staged of the wreck
of the HMS Orange.
Look into the orifice of Da Vinci,
the riddle is a skull not another body, nor another body
of bodies of the body bodies, nor by the body of bodies
of the body bodies, nor for the body of bodies of
the body bodies.
The curled back the bald hull of the Orange,
the desert a swelling surface of sawdust of spruce,
the reflection of sky in night hours the songs
of the mock drowning.
 
No Head for Old Boardwalks
Question time in broad country, this
is no head for old boardwalks considering
the hinterland cottage and the fifteen
ancestors and someone’s designs to be
emissary. One lobe then of a bicameral
bush trail that eventuates in the desert,
like the sweating pub in Toodyay,
or the bush mouth at Kalamunda’s peak.
No head to stirrup or give the bit, rummaging
through heirloom trunks for unfilled postcards,
though tarnished brooches with profiles of
those other than the faces of ancestors were
uncovered, not to be unexpected,
of brass, lead and pewter.
Abandoned by her caravan, a young woman
is visited by Venus of Willendorf though a library
does not clutch her collar but a coloured knit
scarf, the floating Venus no longer a projection
from an archive of defunction.
Nudity is the embarrassment of both loners,
the woman invites where the Venus departs,
the woman mouths soundlessly where the Venus
stirs sounds of underbrush by the footsteps
of her ephemeral museum.
They say the capital has stolen her now,
the woman thinks it is her lips mouthing the captions
of lit artefacts and the Rosetta stone floor
of the empty form of a glorious fleet.
Moldavite feet, she now reads the horses aside
the delivery vans with the speed of the tongue,
their pseudo tetanus shots and fleeced
physiotherapists, the hardness of hooves and
the sobriquets that deliver them healthy,
like black caviar or monkey’s pride. A good enough
talisman if you’re haunted by the artefact and
you wish to plunge into the sedge and seek the
coastline of Albany or the eyes that are the sweating
lights of the museum, having to abjure and omit
the facility of the beachcomber Parisian.
Such feet do not deliver you like the fleet rather
crack you like a hardboiled egg, the
question is does she plunge or does she investigate?
Jarrah floorboards fitted poorly let light and
dust through, she smells the thinking of the curator’s
eyes from beneath him. When it is that the brooch
of the decapitated profile, the gleam of the Moldavite
foot, or the oolite figure are sought by her, the questions
of the attic start their chain dragging and horse reading.
To quote her eisegesis on Melbourne’s khaki jacket,
“if I went back to my parent’s street, I would find
myself beginning the Bibbulmun track again.”
 
 
 
Success
 
There are some bloodhounds lost to the east of the olive grove
and the eldest white gums, where the earth is marshy
and all the blue granite turns green by moss. There are those
who aren’t afraid of the canines of the poem. “Don’t suck
a lemon — Success.”[1] And the wombat comes out of its hole
with its hands up. And the fox comes out of its hole with
its hands up. And the rabbit comes out of its hole with its
hands up. And the bilby comes out of its hole with its hands up.
And the brown snake comes out of its hole with its hands up.
And the platypus comes out of its hole with its hands up. And
the wolf spider comes out of its hole with its hands up. And
the opossum comes out of its hole with its hands up. And
the fruit bat comes out of its hole with its hands up. And the
Bombala comes out of its hole with its hands up.
The bloodhounds responsible are the poem.
The canines of the bloodhound are soft from the work of Success.
    The milieu is something like the hole coming out of itself, like a stony
      nail strip employed by the police to stop done up Valiants and tinted Fairlanes.
          By turning the grit of the subterranean are we to close Brunswick Road
            for our dolly of the wolf spider pageant, for the dolly of the rabbit pageant,
                for the dolly of the wombat pageant, for the dolly of the brown snake pageant,
for the dolly of the fruit bat pageant, for the dolly of the Bombala pageant, videlicet the
pageant of the hole coming out of itself with its hands up for the poem
          where the earth is marshy and shaded by the eldest white gums
              and granite glows green with new moss. Éclat for those unafraid of the
                    canines of the poem.

Shriek
 
To leave a shriek keyboard and
not a corpse, cadaver permitting.
For the anatomy show
or apprenticeship in synthesizers,
shrieks in browns and reds
apprising the only poet of
how death neared the first
trespasser drenched wet
but never frozen to the nostrils,
like the expedition for nothing.
Full of notes in flagellation country,
might read the breast reversed,
flesh fallen off like a cloister.ginen organic acts

Mom asks: “What does ‘Saina’ mean?”
“Grandma is saina,” dad translates. We
sit, with auntie Cissy, in the living
room. They take turns reading
“Organic Acts” aloud, grandma’s voice
reflected in her daughters’ voices. “This
is your story, mom. You’re famous
now,” they joke. “Look, here’s your name.”
They continue reading. We listen:
pages turn. Suddenly, they’re silent.
Mom says: “I didn’t know they buried
the radio.” When the story
fragments, grandma sounds out letters, sparks.
Slowly, words: “qui-et,” “whis-per-ing,” “ark.”
 
 Algae
Sure I read about that Australian ‘interior’ bit, and ‘shearing,’
and about the experience and death of Gordon, the poet …
— Walt Whitman to Bernard O’Dowd (1892)
To think of Adam Lindsay Gordon
              on Brighton Beach lying
dead in the sand while the bombs
              went off in his brain — how dangerous!
 
To think of Bernard O’Dowd 
              sad minor key! excuse me!
visiting A.L.G.’s grave each year on
              his own birthday — how depressing!
 
To think of Brighton beach covered
              with chunks of A.L.G,
like pinkish algae on the shoreline
              & the sand no longer sand — how gruesome!
 
To think of the nuclear apocalypse
              movie On The Beach
which was shot on Brighton Beach
              (where Algae blew his head off — how paranoid!
 
To think of B.O’D’s solitary heart
              & how he liked to go on long walks …
where he probably thought about
              the melancholy of Algae — how sentimental!
 
To suppose the Algae was bright green —
              perhaps it even glowed faintly yellow;
maybe there was an outfall nearby; or
              maybe it was just Algae — how realistic!
 
To think that Algae may have played
              many parts in the drama of his own life:
gold digger, stock rider, policeman, MP,
              something else & then suicide — how fatalistic!
 
To think of Algae lying dead in a sandy
              grave & Bernard O’Dowd on the beach,
and then of Whitman who never met either of
              them in that cold war movie — how pointless!
 
excuse me Walt

TL;DR

 Your poems are too long; I don’t read them
      (in fact I barely have the energy to scroll …
this intranetting format being so unsuited
      to any role, except that of lurker &/or troll.
 
Your life has gone on far too long; I can’t
      read between its lines, can’t bring myself
to think, in fact, of anything at all to bray.
      But as they say you’ve still got your health,
 
& just think of all the bits you won’t need to
      expend in the future. I’m too lazy; I didn’t
bother checking first before hammering
      away at the keys. But I don’t care & won’t
 
be staying long. In fact I’m already gone,
      on to my next blog. Too late,
 
                           dumb rhymer!
 
 
Övergången
 
This is the phase you will need to get through
      very quickly now. It’s already too late to plead
ignorance, or a special case. You’ve strayed in-
      to the grey zone between care factors. On one
hand: zero. And on the other: none. Someone
      is about to tap you on the sholuder, asking for
something: papers, identity, drugs. It doesn’t
      matter what they want exactly, only how you
react. It must be in time. It must seem casual,
      beyond effortless. You must act as if you truly
could not care less. This is good. This is very,
      very good. As a reward, please find two single
bus tickets enclosed. The first one will get you
      to the station. The second has already expired.
 
 
Sunshine for Kim Dae-jung  
 
on the day you died i heard helicopters
& jet planes flying over seoul’s old head
the sun was shining hot & burning down
teheran-ro & the steel streets of gangnam
were full of young girls holding umbrellas
by the subway entrance a young man held
the hands of an older man who was writing
something on a small pad, both looking sad
about something though I knew it wasn’t
you; & as I walked down the stairs into the
subway station I watched girls coming up
holding handbags over their behinds to
prevent the up-skirt glances & cameras
i'd recently read were on the increase …
i knew that you had just died & so how
could anybody here have that knowledge
but it made me sad in any case to think
about your long & amazing life & the life
of gwangju people that is so different from
that of the girl walking through gangnam
wearing a face-mask not because of flu
but due to a recent visit to the face doctor
& it’s not her fault & I don’t know anything
about her life but i wonder what’s the point
of all this though i don’t expect an answer
from her let alone anyone here i must find my
own reasons for life & carrying on within me,
i have to stop thinking about sad things like
the photo of you and kim jong-il, hand in
hand at last, while ko un looked on; i have
to believe in some sphere of freedom where
girls can walk around wearing short skirts
& holding umbrellas to protect their bleached
faces from the harmful old sun’s gamma rays
& boys do not have to do their twenty six
months & old women don’t have to live in
basement apartments & crawl up the stairs
& no one tries to steal up-skirt glances at
anyone & tawdry old mats covered with red
chillis spread out to dry can be left in the
middle of the road; i have to believe in this
road & the reasons for walking alone at night
& so i write & think of you in the past tense
& know that within hours of your death your
wikipedia entry had been changed to reflect
the fact & then I knew you were really gone
& it was all beyond dispute, & your life was no
longer an article that doesn’t cite its sources
but rather a song free of kidnappers & enemies
& crocodiles crying aloe vera tears yes forget
that it doesn’t matter now, you’ll join mr roh
somewhere behind a waterfall & together you'll
wait for the rest of us to arrive (one by one like
days of summer filled with moving tears & hands
 
                        & sunshine

the crust of mascara starts to crack and flake.
She claws her way up into your kitchen to stand
wiping the cigarette smoke from her eyes.
 
You have been preparing a lentil salad and
perhaps this has brought her: steam rising with
the scent of nutmeg, cinnamon, cumin and
 
mustard powder; the bite and tang of salt and sugar.
She is like the neighbour’s cat which sometimes
steals into your kitchen, demanding to be fed.
 
Two cuts on your finger wince and sting. The
impossible knot of family: tightening and unpicking
it in your chest. Rinsing the metal bowl, you place
 
it on the draining board decisively, making it
count. The buzzing radio of thoughts: cicadas
screaming in crescendo. A tired muscle twitching
 
just above your knee. Wanting to be more
than, less than. Still, the constant tug of things
forgotten: a kite string wrapped around your finger.
 
 
Walking to Greenwich Baths
for JG
 
how you have small neat hands
the fingers red when it is cold
and fragile, ungloved, you gave
 
me a tight bunch of poppies
in a darting action: a handing over
that was a snatching back
 
how you sat across the table
at the inaugural anniversary
of the mad hatter’s tea party
 
sunlight fell into our cups
like soft white rain and tasted
like tears of single origin
 
how after lunch we sat in the grass
nibbling gingerbread biscuits cut out
in the shape of book characters
 
there were poetry readings;
I watched carefully and learnt the art
of pinning frangipanis in my hair
 
how even with the closest friends
there are so many rooms you will
never go into —
 
the voice they speak with still
differing from the sound you cup
within the acoustics of your skull —
 
what they give up
what they let go of
how hard they try to get there
Courthouse Afternoon
for Tara
 
A girl in coral and horn glasses
is discussing the relative frequency
of her massages and orgasms,
and how protein shakes
              are made from cattle hearts,
and how the sniffer dogs
might find the Valium in her handbag.
 
It’s an Indian Summer, and the fairylights
asphyxiate a tree, the bistro buzzers
skitter on the tabletops
 
and she leans in close,
and chews her plastic straw
and lets her eyes grow wide
on the nervous man beside her.
 
She tells him
about a recent wedding, where both parties
looked like they were eight months pregnant
and how she’s never understood
why lemons cost much less than limes
and that she’s still black and blue
from horse-riding
and this pub really changes of a Friday
and she never should have listened to her mother.
 
Three women haul their prams onto the balcony
and shake bottles of formula
and order bloody marys.
A girl in horn-rimmed glasses and coral nails
grabs the man beside her by his nervous hand
and leads him out into the street.
 
 
Medina
 
The city walled. The house have plain clay faces.
              These streets have not been mapped.
The stooped doors force a downcast head.
 
Cats crawl past automatic pigeon-pluckers.
You are not here,
              and black-fingered men beat metal
into dishes held between their bent, bare feet,
and children frisk wasps
from sticky green sweets.
 
Wet leather drips dye
down glistened backs of couriers,
and bulb-faced women stuff webby pastries
with pickled fat and capsicum.
 
You are not here, the button-weavers sing.
             Je t’aime, Je t’aime the thin boys grin
pressing their legs on their wall-top perches.
 
You rest beneath the broken waterclock,
the empty belfries echoing the donkey carter’s cry:
Ballack! Ballack! Step back!
The call to prayer curls out
from the carved walls of the madrasa —
             You are not here.

Dear Reader
It was not so much that events had turned out as she expected, indeed they had exceeded expectations in increasingly specific ways, but that it should all matter so much.
~~~
Under the circumstances, nothing could have been further from her inclination than to accompany this jovial imposter in his rented suit and dull shoes (even the carnation in  his lapel seemed to wilt, as if unable to sustain another moment of this tedious imposture), yet it appeared she had no choice in the matter; those on whom she had once placed such reliance now stared back with a variety of permutations of the bland and the bemused.
“It’s out of my hands” one murmured, wringing those same hands with something very like relief.
~~~
If it were courageous thus to brave the widespread condemnation of others, disputing with a cocky flourish the daily contumely of priest and pagan alike, then certainly he showed all the marks of valour and doubtless hoped they would stand him in good stead with a citizenry more impressed by bravado than good sense, compassion, respect for law — in short, those tedious middle class virtues with which all sensible dictators dispense at the first opportunity.
~~~    
Growing weary of prescription, she retired to the countryside only to find that that, too, had been spoken for.
~~~
Even the best-intentioned were confused by a rendition of events which seemed to indicate that, despite the performance of a bad thing, ill-conceived, and with an undeniably sinister motive, some measure of good had ensued.
~~~
While it was clear to all who cared to inquire, that many items of significance and with a capacity to disturb further prosperity (not to mention complacency), still remained and were plainly likely to continue thus; few indeed cared to inquire and they were generally overborne in the generally universal mood of congratulation. Indeed, one among them was heard to remark “It is a miracle we have all come through.”
~~~
One could hardly deny that the conditions of which she complained were but recent in their falling out thus and yet the listeners were unanimous in their private agreement that she had exhibited the worst possible taste in bringing it to their attention.
“I do despise such affectations.” a certain lady was heard to remark.
~~~
This is not a life, she could have replied, but it clearly was.
~~~
She never visited her father at work; the one time she had gone with her mother to Wall Street, had so overwhelmed her with nausea, she had resolved never to repeat the experience. The moment she had looked up, she had been struck by a sense of vertigo but in reverse, as though she was about to plummet into a huge pit, its walls sleek and shear. The buildings were simply monstrous and she thought how misplaced confidence was when composing a building. Stone and marble are sufficiently aggressive without the builders’ blustering pride. How she detested it!
She remembered Paris, its sins in gilt, a grotesquerie of gold on florid sculptures. You had to go back to Notre-Dame, she thought, to find honesty. Many would say it was built in faith, and thus a sort of confidence, perhaps the only important sort; and she would not disagree but add this was not the whole story. Terror had its niches, and empty bellies and burning houses and the endlessness of the night peered out from buttress and column. This was built by people who had just clawed their way out of the abyss and, still panting a little, had said, “I believe” or “Let’s make something.” or “This is our town.”
~~~
How awkward, she thought, rummaging through his desk, if the maid were to walk in. Or Henry himself. She adjusted the letter opener, a rashly incisive salamander, and stood back, gazing around feverishly at the countless shelves, crammed with books and hiding places. It was useless.
~~~
It was astounding, quite simply the most remarkable event she had ever had the good fortune to witness, truly a unique moment and one she would never, indeed could scarcely ever, forget and yet, in retrospect, she was not quite sure, certainly not as convinced as she had first thought, that it was altogether to the good.
~~~
How she loathed those dinner parties, the subtle lamps, the ravaged blooms moaning in extravagant clusters as the guests took their places, as they took everything. Reluctant though she was to do so, she could never stop herself from inspecting their eyes, whilst being careful not to catch their gaze. Even she acknowledged the value of rules while reserving the right to make her own.
Could one be both frantic and complacent? she mused. The truth was they were all so unpleasant, and the nicest were the worst. Her spirits, and her gaze, sank. She watched, as she always seemed to do, their mouths.
This is a mistake, of all the features to which one might reduce a human being, the mouth is clearly the worst and, to be caught in the actual moment of eating, why, how more than metaphorically ugly. She sighed, and her mother shot her the usual annoyed glance.
~~~
They sat long over their tea that afternoon, polishing metaphors with a diligence born of boredom. And yet, how could they be bored, it didn’t make sense, and yet there was no mistaking the droop of their long fingers, the idle feathering of the throat, the tea sipped as though languor might confer its own reward
~~~
He inquired whether this was not better. So comfortable, indeed so pleasant, to wander thus from phrase to phrase, from clause to clause and the road always riding up, meeting the well shod foot, the neat boot pointing its way on. To which she replied that the best part was the not getting lost and she attributed this to the being already quite lost and so it didn’t matter if one was occasionally a little confused. Was she not bred to deal with such occasions, to rise above, move beyond, and with the reassuring conviction that at least something was being done.
~~~
 
Would it be better if she thought more? If she thought, or so she couched it, about what she wanted to say. The difficulty that arose from this, however, was that she didn’t want to say anything; her mind was both empty and full, her heart in abeyance and her body stammered and stuttered from work to work. In short, dear reader, she had not an idea in her head beyond a memory of pleasure gleaned from the placing of words.
This not wanting to speak may seem to introduce the wanting to scream, but she had distinct reservations about screaming. Or rather, silent screaming, for, bristle as it may on the page, the poem, pinned to its own black mark, is silent. This peacefulness the page confers and she did not find that an inappropriate word, for the page seemed to her now to induce a sort of calm, feverish at first, undoubtedly, but progressing till she could sleep easily as books do, already slumbering in companionable mood upon the shelves. Certainly, some of these silences are indeed a silent screaming and she reflected that this business of mute melancholy, or madness, or whatever other variation on a familiar theme one requires, carries an unseemly cultural weight. How middle class, she thought, shrugging off the awareness of how spongy such a term was in a society as amorphous as this remote outpost of the Empire to which she had been bound in later years. Time to go home, she sometimes said, as though this were an option.Echo
 
Another all-night slugs through their scammed oeuvre
that critics nimbled in a water-taxi
but thanks for the extirpation I sift into my panniers
and ride the new estate’s jellied hills
meanwhile advertising
Brokered trees mush fields
and a blind’s fronds of green twilight
raft over the bed and baffled cat piloting a thesis on itself
Revolving doors tie behind you in a sash
Put the garden in a drawer that sniffed memory’s mopped obeisance,
now a few rooms testify
and his hands krill the glassy pool
 
 
Stuck in Traffic
 
She meant it was good to yarn, no trauma
Now you get how you mistook
swotted totally at the braked drinks and slipped physics, you’re over
 
She’s bumping in for the show and doesn’t deign to risk
a charge or block, and her child “suffers absence”
Four churches sharpen the intersection
 
You know what? I cancelled, it wasn’t cogito precisely
but who could’ve, like I put it out there
my sessions and criteria all one-on-one a tray
 
across a bridge’s attempt at grace
while ads strew the transport’s view
into meshed ideograms of capitalism
 
I jibbed into a cube, shonky life blinking through a glass, a pick,
then hoiked what’s left of friends.
It’s of no purpose.
 
I don’t want to see him a radish or leek.
Chimes pester down what boredom spored
and goes, a meddler to the heath
 
You buy the lock for the door then the door for the lock
as cords corolla sealed ears that hyphen thought
to home in the electric fields
 
 
My speech-based compositions mostly exist through performance and audio works. Every text is written to an aural/audio shape, picking up themes of linguistic algorithms and error, everyday speech and humor. Lately, I’ve been interested in noise and interference in sound media and the parasitic quality of sound poetry. Other than that, pulsars, scrimshaw, sea shanties, and space travel.
On one hand I see my work as tragically British — born out of British surreal comedy and performance, artful failure, nonsense rhyme, and folk verse. On the other hand the formal aspects of my work and my approach to poetic practice are an utter tribute to North American influences. I should start with Peter Jaeger, with a direct hand on my practice (is this cheating?) as my tutor, but also as a model for how-to poetry. His direction and work outlined a “sky’s the limit” approach to conceptualizing and composing a text, with such enthusiasm for experimentation, filtering K. Goldsmith’s “uncreative writing” into my work, bpNichol, and Steve McCaffery, and all Canadian Sound Poetry. My work particularly grew through engaging with McCaffery’s work and wonderful critical writing on sound poetry as a dimension of literature, and poetry as a performance event. I also have a lot of respect for the sci-fi exploits of Christian Bök. On a more intuitive level I have been long drawn to Hannah Weiner’s edgy, willful, experimental texts. And I felt, once I’d found it (!) that I’d been following the thread of Code Poems for a long time in my thinking. And I’d add Susan Howe, and her inspirational model for playing the deviant in the archive.
 
 
Process: the speech was taken from online minidocumentaries about the role HAM radio operators played during the Hurricane Katrina crisis in New Orleans. HAM radios are amateur, licensed radio network operators. During the storm all official emergency communication networks failed and only HAM radios were operational. This left large groups of essentially volunteer radio operators fielding and assisting distress calls. The documentaries featured extracted recordings of conversations between people trapped in flooded areas and HAMs in outposts around Louisiana.
The texts were composed by listening to the audio of the documentaries (with headphones) and reciting the heard speech into a voice recorder. The text was then transcribed from the recording of my recital. The following script is a file compression. It begins with the sound of the wind.

i’m telling you there’s tornados everywhere
and i see three trees three trees smashing tweed daddy’s barbecue
i’ve got some messages
we’ve tried to set up some communication with the locals who have no traffic and needles to say
any infrastructure
all the power lines, everything is down
we went to the eye wall and it was stuck
i can imagine well
i can’t guess what they’re gonna do until sundown
move from 35 i don’t know about hw traffic actually i have three pieces of traffic here i don’t 
know what you’re going to do with them i roger that well
the frequency that these messages are on all around the country
are just frantic and everything and pretty stressed out
and they’re just
what we’re gonna do is we’re gonna post messages in and out right here and
hopefully the communication will try and slide down
tomorrow
we will try and get down to 3935 tonight
build some antenna systems
we’ll just try
get on this frequency
40 metres and at least try and get some of these messages out
i’ve got traffic is that what you’ve got

Use your psychic power to bend a piece of metal
Use your psychic power to stop the hands of a clock
Use your psychic power to flick off the switch
I can smell you in my skin
I can smell you in my skin
I can smell you in my skin
I’m experiencing what is more what is more I am experiencing the experience
As for the rest
Let me carve it character by character on a single grain of rice
As for the rest
Let me carve it word by word on that strand of hair
As for the rest
I brought the ransom to the agreed upon location
I came at the appointed time
But the kidnapper never showed his face
He’s always been so hesitant
I can’t understand this hesitation on his part
I never even called the police
I don’t even know the person he’s holding
I too have been lured by the graceful style of being taken
By this business of being tied up and waiting

11 Plenty of chances to see old friends and relatives
They missed plenty of chances
To see their old friends and relatives
They are severely agitated personalities
Who hunger constantly
To express all the myriad thoughts in their heads
But often they have no one to listen to
They want another chance
An omniscient narrator who does not appear in the poem
He’s like a creaking pendulum teetering back and forth with narrations
He can’t afford to replace
— written in English by the poet
 
 
11 Massive opportunities to see old relatives and friends
They long for massive opportunities
See old relatives and friends
They are the serious place the individuality which agitates
Who often thirsts
Express in their heads all the countless methods
But often there is nobody listening attentively
They long for other opportunities
An omniscient narrator who does not appear in the poem
He is like a loud creaky pendulum stumbling over and over in his narrative
He cannot replace them
— a back translation by Steve Bradbury, off Sherlock’s Chinese version
 
 
Cinema Is Superseding the Gaze
All you have to do is find yourself some amateur actors
And a bargain-basement video cam
That can film in natural light and ambient sound
Your actors don’t even have to act
In fact you’re better off
If they just glance now and then at the camera
And move around a bit
Exchanging the occasional line of conversation
We have all the time in the world
For we’re making a road movie
And it should be pretty good
Turns out one of the actors is seriously narcoleptic
Which is why we have this baby alarm

 
 (untitled)
HE DOESN’T LIKE that poem of mine
that goes
like so lying sideways
your body speaks a half-moon
these verses he likes but nags me on the following
loaf of flesh discovered 
between the blue jeans
and a black shirt
etc.
he said that these (lines)
that follow
don’t quite pay the body that was lying
like so on its side
that when a body finally
goes about saying half-moons 
nothing more need be written
nothing else in the poem
bears equivalence to this 
that is
my poem wouldn’t need
anything other than bodies
which like so on their sides
say half-moons
my poem is apparently
a cripple
he’s all overtures
but where it is necessary
that whatever must be said be said
he gets this look of fear on his face
and says nothing at all
why should I say then
that while he speaks
about my poem
his body (not on its side
but belly facing up)
says a wine stain 
insisting on the old carpet 
and my eyes do not let go
of the flesh-loaf discovered
between the red shirt
and the pair of dark pants
(not sure what fabric)?
that they’ll understand me is sheer chance
but it’s not a case
for rushing
after all
what is this about?
John Ashbery said
“the poem is sad because it wants to be yours, and cannot”
and this textbook called poetry for students
argues for a cynical reading
of this line because Ashbery probably
was only trying to be funny
when he wrote it
a self-respecting poet should always
resist sentimentality
I try to take this into account
(try)
by calling the poem “Levity”
which is to say
there is a reason the poem
reads under the marquee
of Levity
that it (the marquee) is this (one) not any other
(I’m trying to organize the world)
words have acquired weight
and density
in the last couple of years
I didn’t quite grasp this
I didn’t quite grasp that one detail
capable of turning an arrangement of flowers
in disarray
(my poem must have been sad)
but something changed
yes something has changed
& I want to tell the boy of a certain
“alchemy in immanence”
I won’t do it because (as stated elsewhere)
words have acquired weight
and density
in the last couple of years
& I’m already quite wary
of the fireworks
in an alleged “alchemy in immanence”
I have a great distrust of
this “alchemy in immanence”
that has just occurred to me
it’s the kind of thing
that would make me feel tremendously ill at ease
if I were to hear it from someone else’s mouth
on the other hand the word “thing”
for example
strikes me nowadays as
one of the most beautiful
I don’t understand why people don’t enunciate
it with more reverence
(I could talk to the boy about some “thing”)
that they’ll understand me is sheer chance
but it’s not a case
for rushing
one does not write to the mountain to the aqueduct to a celestial body
the body you are coming at
is precisely the anti-celestial
& it insists on the old carpet
like a wine stain
it is there so much
that it trumps all this
my eyes do not let go
of the loaf of flesh discovered between his red shirt
and black pair of pants
(not sure what fabric)
If I could I would graph
on that gap
milk strait
frozen just ahead
that bodies
lying down like so
(one facing the other)
traditionally say full moons
most of the things
that we don’t understand
are very very close
almost under the skin

Afternoon Poem
for Gabriel Bogossian 
I.
nothing against it
nothing radically in favor
in summation nothing radically
“you’re getting chubby you should do something
about it you’re far too young”
G. said,
precisely; like noticing for the first time
that the façade of a given building we pass by
each and every day
is all tiled up
and if the sun strikes it a certain way
it’s really rather pretty
like some bathrooms that flare up becoming really
really red at sundown
 
II.
(tableau: an old woman argues with a deaf boy over a bench)
 
I’ve taken to giving little yelps on the street
as
I’m walking it suddenly ebbs
AH
(german, operistic)
we are interesting
we make things that are interesting
we hope that one day
they’ll matter
what fun
now if you really rely on the non-historicity of the sign
then you are a fool of the first order
polysemy’s where it’s at
kneading bread with empty beer bottles
(great comic potential there!)
down with the tyranny of function
what is it good for how go about it?
things have much more being
when seen as sociological trifle
and I am very sick of me
what is it good for how go about it?
has anyone in this world
in this vast vast vast vast world
ever died of a brutal hangover?
I would like a name address and number
benefits dental plan christmas
bonus a party thrown for Eunice in HR
a smart son a rich husband 
and time, still, to be aggressively frivolous
what is it good for how go about it?
how interesting!
(all this without straying
from my voice’s comfort zone)

(Sem Título) 
ELE NÃO GOSTA daquele meu poema
que diz
deitado assim de lado
teu corpo diz uma meia-lua
desses versos ele gosta
mas implica com os seguintes
naco de carne descoberta
entre o jeans azul
e a camiseta preta
etc
ele diz que esses versos
que se seguem
não pagam o corpo que deitado
assim de lado
diz uma meia-lua
que quando um corpo finalmente
dana a dizer meias-luas
não carece escrever mais
nada mais no poema
tem equivalência com isso
seja
meu poema não precisa(ria)
de outra coisa que não corpos
que assim de lado
dizem meias-luas
meu poema ao que parece
tem um aleijo
ele é todo ouvertures
mas lá onde se exige
que qualquer coisa esteja dita
ele faz cara de susto
e não diz nada
pra que dizer
que enquanto ele
fala do meu poema
seu corpo (não de lado
mas de barriga pra cima)
diz uma mancha de vinho
que renite no tapete velho
e meus olhos não largam
do naco de carne descoberta
entre a camiseta vermelha
e a calça escura
(não sei que tecido)?
é ao acaso que me entendam
mas não é caso
de se precipitar
afinal
do que é que isso se trata?
John Ashbery disse
“o poema está triste porque quer ser seu, mas não pode”
& certo guia de poesia para estudantes
nos recomenda leitura cínica
do verso porque Ashbery provavelmente
só estava tentando fazer graça
quando escreveu isso
poeta que se preze deve sempre
fazer causa contra o sentimentalismo
disso tento dar conta
(tento)
ao nomear o poema “Leviandade”
seja
há uma razão pra que o poema
se leia sob essa marquise
da Leviandade
que seja (a marquise) uma e não outra qualquer
(estou tentando organizar o mundo)
as palavras pegaram vulto
e densidade
de uns anos pra cá
eu não dava por isso
eu não dava pelo mínimo detalhe
capaz de mudar um arranjo de flores
em desarranjo
(meu poema deve ter ficado triste)
mas alguma coisa mudou
sim alguma coisa mudou
& eu quero falar para o menino de uma certa
“alquimia na imanência”
só não o faço porque (como já disse)
as palavras pegaram vulto
e densidade
de uns anos pra cá
& eu já me acautelo
dos fogos de artifício
numa suposta “alquimia na imanência”
tenho grande desconfiança dessa
“alquimia na imanência”
que acaba de me ocorrer
é o tipo da coisa
que me faria um tremendo mal-estar
se a ouvisse da boca de alguém
já a palavra “coisa”
por exemplo
me parece no corrente
das mais bonitas
não entendo porque não a enunciam
pelaí com mais reverência
(posso falar ao menino de uma “coisa”)
é ao acaso que me entendam
mas não é caso
de se precipitar
não se escreve pra viaduto montanha ou corpo celeste
o corpo onde se quer chegar
é justamente o anti-celeste
& ele renite no tapete velho
feito mancha de vinho
tanto de estar lá
que deita abaixo tudo isso
meus olhos não largam
do naco de carne descoberta
entre a camiseta vermelha
e a calça escura
(não sei que tecido)
se eu pudesse grafava
naquela brecha
estreito de leite
congelado logo à frente
que os corpos
deitados assim de lado
(um de frente para o outro)
costumam dizer luas cheias
a maior parte das coisas
que não entendemosestá muito muito próxima
quase que na pele

a Gabriel Bogossian 
I.
nada contra
nada radicalmente a favor
numa palavra nada radicalmente
“você está ficando barrigudo devia fazer algo
a respeito você é jovem demais”
G. dixit,
precisamente como reparar pela primeira vez
que a fachada de dado edifício pelo qual passamos
todo santo dia
é toda azulejada
e incidindo o sol de certa maneira
fica bem bonito
como certos banheiros que se inflamam ficam muito
muito vermelhos ao entardecer
 
II.
(tableau: uma senhora idosa disputa banco de praça
com um menino surdo)
dei pra soltar gritinhos na rua
assim
estou andando de repente reflui:
AH
(ataque germânico)
somos pessoas interessantes
fazemos coisas interessantes
esperamos que um dia relevem
que divertido
se você realmente se fia na não-historicidade do signo
então você é um imbecil de marca maior
a bossa agora é a polissemia
preparar a massa do pão com Long Necks
(grandes possibilidades cômicas!)
abaixo a tirania da função
pra que serve como faz?
as coisas têm muito mais existência
como pormenor sociológico
& eu vou muito farto de mim
pra que serve como faz?
terá alguém no mundo
nesse vasto vasto vasto vasto mundo
morrido tão bruta a ressaca?
eu quero nome endereço e telefone
comissão benefícios plano odontológico
décimo terceiro festa da Zulmira do rh
um filho esperto um marido rico
& ainda o tempo de ser
agressivamente frívolo
pra que serve como faz?
que interessante!
(tudo isso sem sair
da minha zona vocal confortável)

 Aperture
Brief squalls of blue, spliced between persistent rain.
Scene 4: a pair of black swans drift towards sunset,
slow tilt at a finite problem — soft-lighting perhaps?
But the rugby fan behind me unwraps a hotdog, wrapper
branded Hans Small Goods, & the Waikato Chiefs score again.
 
Near Bulli Pass, an isolated stag hoofs it
across the freeway’s shock of headlights, edging
away from Venison Weekend at the Austrian Club.
Each of us holds this sensation of acceleration,
approaching the drawn-out smudge which may yet be
mountain range blurred against a graphite sky.
 
Even in rewind, you look older in the makeup mirror
kept in your hip pocket for such doleful occasions.
With a flick of the wrist, you interlock its circles like a lens
though a quick survey of the foreground brings the distance,
like a taciturn stranger, too close for comfort. Ambling along
this alpine lake’s gravelly shores, petrified wood crumbles
at a touch, each piece strewn into place before the crowd
snaps the reverie with a gasp.
 
The train is a cue; we shuffle into platform gaps,
fingering this thought or that, licking our lips in anticipation.
If there is room here — enough for everyone — invite
the rugby fans, our collected friends, even the swans,
who barely register our shapes from so high above, as we move
into & out of focus, signposting this explicable mist.
 
 
Double Happiness

The Sydney Harbour Bridge cast in east-west
elevation hovers over wind-raked water.
This perspective accentuates its arch
like the handle of that vintage vinyl suitcase
you picked up for a fiver in Enmore.
 
By now you were halfway to the Hong Kong
Business Chamber’s New Year banquet,
though the cause for celebration remains, in the end,
a mystery. It might have been factory farming:
every beast imaginable stretched out in a swirling
constellation of plates; the shock of an ocean trout’s
cloudy eye, its flesh the taste of star dust.
 
Thus happiness expands at the percentile rate
of your income portfolio. You carry
the two halves to this secret, one
in each pant pocket, as the cast of characters
who populate your future prepare to bail you out
from even the blackest of indiscretions.  
 
 
 
After Wang Lü
 
I tip my hat to those Ming court artists,
each one noted for their meticulous paintings
of bright birds & propitious flowers:
precise black strokes, exact pigment for feather
& petal, bringing close the day. On the sidelines
of such style I screw up the latest draft & it floats
out the window where the sharp crags of Hua Shan &
Mount Druitt’s forlorn retail strip are framed.
Sunset’s corona burns up the bald horizon; migrating
Learjets & helicopters exchange vicious blows,
divvying up the oil. It’s a triage of sweetness,
sadly necessary in these times of short supply.
 
As in all landscapes there is a human figure
for scale. Whether it be me or you is not important,
nor that here the figure is in plain view,
free at last from the picture’s interminable mists:
you pack a reed basket with the paper folio
a third party has chosen to outlive us, & make
for the denuded hills; I push my shopping trolley
across the pot-holed bitumen towards the car.
Now is the time to deliver our best lines to the viewer
though this assumes we can be heard above the explosions
& the lumbering contraption which stomps out
from the gallery shadows; the slight scroll hung
carefully on the wall doesn’t stand a chance.

Nine predictions
In a three-harmony month your lunar horoscope
looks contradictory: you will enjoy a sudden influx
of wealth through conventional as well as unconventional
channels, but stay away from establishments offering
sensual pleasures, such as bars, casinos and nightclubs.
Coincidentally you’re drawn to the most valuable object
in the museum, a pear-shaped vase of rich crushed
raspberry with pink peony meander. To protect
your family and personal well-being, keep a low profile
and do not make any sudden moves. You’d heard
that Vietnamese dragons are often fatter and more
whimsical than their Chinese counterparts, which seem
lean and unpredictable. Ducking in time, you haggle
briefly over jade pieces of varying legitimacy
at a street market that’s just a few squares of cloth
laid on the footpath. Your hard bargaining-and-
walking-away trick doesn’t work, so instead you buy
an over-priced custard apple, which is the meaning
of your Vietnamese teacher’s name. Those in government
may receive a promotion; avoid walking alone at night
and tend to minor health issues. You yearn for a fruit-
savouring room like that in the Li Yun gardens,
as well as a walk-in bird cage. The rusty-looking Yuan
Dynasty coin is pleasing, snapped up for ten patacas
and easily identified in the shopkeeper’s well-thumbed
book of old coins. You should do ten good deeds per day
for nine consecutive days in order to encounter helpful
assistance. This is not a good time to make new friends.
 
 
 
Tender, yet gamey
The finely chopped
raw tuna glistens,
bejewelled with slices
of truffled dwarf
peaches and halves
of soft-boiled quail
eggs, the yolks still
slightly runny,
the flavours glorious.
Alas, the pursuit
of crisp skin
left the fish without
a moist core,
and the horseradish
failed to deliver
the bite I was
looking for
to hone the other
earthy peasant flavours.
To the side
is a small rocket
salad interlaced
with ribbons
of sweet and salty
house-made duck
prosciutto.
Less successful
is a large raviolo
filled with goat’s curd
lightly drizzled in basil oil,
a pale pink crescent moon
of roasted capsicum
and saffron sauce beside it,
with a small midden
of tapenade made from
ligurian olives
from Forbes.
 

Notes
Most lines in “Tender, yet gamey” were taken from restaurant reviews in The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper in 2008.
January
for Peter Gizzi
We sit to a bowl of miso ramen,
same as the night before, only this time
you’re coming down with something
and need the chilli. Later we’ll sketch
a brief history of risk, the word’s
first appearance in a seventeenth-
century translation of the Lusiad,
the Portugese retelling of Homer
with da Gama as Odysseus; how
mortality data drawn from the plagues
in England gave birth to actuarial
science, and Halley, of comet fame
crunched the numbers for the seeds
of life insurance — the epistemic
shift from the providential view
that meant you’d sooner sacrifice
a goat before a trip than trust in
numbers. These days we rationalise:
what’s the probability of the plane
falling out of the sky? You’re far
more likely to be struck by lightning.
Did I tell you my father died in a plane
crash? you’ll say, and I — mortified
by my hypothetical, nodding as you
explain your penchant for Xanax
on cross-Atlantic flights — think back
to this moment, ladling miso into
our mouths, steam rising in winter,
you explaining how you nursed
your dying mother this September
and muttering, half under your breath:
Dying is so expensive in America.
 


Dransfield in Bavaria
 
In the high land of the swan
autumn burns a path to Neuschwanstein,
castle of the mad king who had stars
cut into his bedroom ceiling, then
lit them with candles to soothe him
when he woke from bad dreams.
 
                            ~
 
Blackbirds are speaking German techno
again, trilling glitches. Our eskimo
friend spills his gluhwein on the snow:
 
wildberry birthmark, blood-red Rorschach,
enough to suspect a discarded carcass
nearby, an eviscerated swan: fox news.
 
                           ~ 
 
Pan’s stone flute glued with ice.
Munich’s cold slap shocked us
 
exiting the Hauptbahnhof. Now
we photograph the frozen fountain,
 
flicking to macro to capture the sun 
jinxing the ice in beads of focus.

                           ~
 
All-you-can-eat sushi surprised us
over the Starnbergersee. We digest
in the cemetery. Wintry pneumatics:
 
air hisses as you untwist a Sprite.
Cue the mechanised hedgehogs
and lambs of the shopfront nativity.
 
                          ~
 
On the train from Gmund, you look up
from your book at acres of crisp snow
 
and think of the man whose Beethoven
ringtone interrupted the guide’s explanation
that morning at Small Fortress, Terezin.
 
The children cry Tannenbaum! Tannenbaum! 
 
                            ~
 
To quit heroin you have to leave the country,
the novelist says with a wink.
 
I wonder what you would have made
of Europe. What I’d have made of junk.
 
I guess I’ve never truly understood
the romance of those ruins of the blood.I first visited the US in the summer of 1987 to visit a university friend and after a brief stay in New York City we traveled to coastal Maine where his family had a summer house. From there we hired an enormous car and drove through all the New England states. I was utterly seduced by the landscape and set about writing about it. Looking now at these poems they are the outcome of an undirected and, frankly, haphazard education in poetry, a mishmash of Robert Lowell and Elizabeth Bishop filtered through Seamus Heaney and Philip Larkin, the only postwar non-US poets I had been exposed to at school (oh for an English education). If only someone then had turned me on to James Schuyler and Fairfield Porter instead of Amy Clampitt and Edward Hopper! Postgraduate study of Olson and, later, Zukofsky went some way towards rectifying things and during the nineties I listened attentively to alternative British and US poetries at London reading series such as SubVoicive, East/West and Platform. I didn’t begin writing with any real intent until joining Bob Cobbing’s Writers Forum workshops in late 1999. I was thirty-three years old.
My first real book, stretchers (2006), is formally not a million miles from the later sections of Zukofsky’s “A” (long skinny poems with scant attention paid to ‘poetic’ niceties such as line endings) though its particular disjunctive modulations probably owe more to Stein than to Objectivist poetics. The examples I’ve included here, however, are not altogether representative of the text as a whole whose title, I should add, is a steal from the opening paragraph of Huckleberry Finn. My next book, Bird bird (2009), forty-one prose poems ‘about’ British birds, has something of the New Sentence to it though with an attendant lyricism I find it hard to shake off, and happily. In The Assarts (2010), a book of sonnets, is to date my most explicit attempt to grapple with, as a British poet, my debt to US poetry. The topography of the poems is mostly British but if the twentieth-century sonnet is an American form (as has been suggested, not entirely erroneously), then these are American poems. Edwin Denby, Ted Berrigan, Bernadette Mayer, Alice Notley, Ebbe Borregaard, Piero Heliczer, Joseph Ceravolo, and Stephen Rodefer (not to mention of course the un-American Sir Thomas Wyatt) are all in there somewhere and I’m really very glad.

From Bird bird

Oenanthe oenanthe (wheatear)
Found it on a ramble, comma, sometimes dense, sometimes lax. A weaver a comber a weaver a reeler. It’s very overcrowding cold & the carpeters are top, top, they’re the new bread. Sorry found it on a bramble. On the other hand a hone bee. Even overarching they send out canes & then the wheatear cometh then my slight niece & everything’s tails, wood & that, true bunnies jumping, comma, faggots shaving down. Saps such a novel scene & then it’s all so overreaching. Pause. Nearly spoiled it with the carpeters they’re so cheerful as the plough goes under & turneth up the wheatears’ wreck.
 
 
 
Corvus corone corone (carrion crow)
Who would collaborate with me now jim dine’s dead, the artist jim dine. Oh my honey he probably died though and was gone away like the heavy crow in the morning or, because of comparison, like the rain coming up. After this I ran out of the empty house of folklore. I heart this house. I think it’s raining, raining in my heart house. Didn’t it on the hydropiper & the hydropiper’s son? They’re realer than the heavy crow whose tiny bushy throat smells. A heavy crow can have a tiny throat. I want jim dine dead or alive. Marries nancy minto & they move to london in 1966 or 1967 it depends who you believe.
 
 
 
Grus grus (common crane)
These then the isles we were blown from, to, from. From this melancholy trade & back to caulking, boring, back to old boats & the sea. Cracks is a dangerous sign see as is slacks especially dune-slacks. Cracks where the cranes lived old & wet the cranes down in the deadwood. There the front crane told a story to the back crane how he slipped on a cranesbill in a dune-slack. It was a short story. The little yellow pansy story surely? Surely they lost each other in the tall hard grass story? Surely the cranesbill grows mainly on the plains? O spica-venti! O campestris! O inarticulata! 
 
 
 
Pica pica (magpie)
This is an idle tale all hat & thumbs & another one for money. So check the pipes of thy boat boat boat. I’m out now its my birthday better its my bye-bye. Then again I run around. The sprig to the wire & the wire to the ground. Then again I turn. Jenkins comes & we all say “ah” or “gee” & I love him for a whole year & he tells me something new (by the way the oldenburg girls go in the sonnenschein). Gee there’s jenkins leaving. The other birds follow & he keeps them flying in his hiding-place & to carry his hay & he comes no more his feathers have been rubbed off in the sonnenschein. The turning bird too is everywhere else. Neighbour yr gutterbox. I, have, a, very, english, joy.
 
 
From In The Assarts

11   (for Tim Atkins)
If I say a little about the timber
sorry I am become all flora interruptus.
I am tiny & exotic.
I am incapable.
I got the painless mumps
but I got you babe where we are
up in this famous ancient tree.
On my early map look over
there is our anti-highwayman trench.
Let’s gamekeep our own wood.
You be holly I’m a nut.
Later in the common market he died
not being shy storming
her world where he & forgot beautiful old rhyme.

So long Mr I done my sums &
I need no more ploughs.
Once one is the only one I know a man I flee from.
He adds up to this & this.
X & Y I flee from
what they did I don’t have to be in the Middle
Ages.
A picnic is this plus this.
To put in it a stolen trout.
My favourite place is to be in the middle
of the road.
Oi, if, I, say, you, it is not enough Mr
I done my sums
& I need more plums.

My moat has an elaborate diver. Not so.
He rises & sinks just like a boat
which is full of coney holes
I made o, o, o, by being so fly.
I filled it up with new eau,
so much so, my moat is mentioned in Milton’s odes.
Now my moat is dry.
Now my moat is dry
my diver is my driver. He drives me
to country shows not in a bateau
where we look at deer but being so shy
I return always without a doe.
No my boat’s so full of holes because
my boat's so full of moles.

I fucking love you months
January & February happily
together March & April
on their own & the smaller ones
May, June & obvious July.
August is very rare
we have to ask what happened
to August in September &
delicately. October there is
nothing to be said for
which like all fashions changes.
Months can be used to remember
like November November IPlan D: Hot Tap 
Below the thunder horse oil rig, a mile below, 
 a sea serpent is an Oarfish never seen by human eyes, 
 an oarfish far between 250 thousand god-given liberties and the surface. 
 An oarfish, the largest of the deep mesopelagic sea,
 undulates, fins splayed in a molasses current.
 
 Did Poseidon see an oarfish? Did he wear a two ton 
 top hat and did he leave it on the sea bed? And did 
 Poseidon set fire to his deepwater ice, set fire 
 to his methane slush and set his robots to thread 
 a straw to suck diamond shaped impostors through the sea bed to quench
 the thirsty Atlantis? 
 
 Atlantis the continent and the liftoff and the Saturn island 
 ringed with sea. Atlantis the plentiful, Atlantis the ship
 Atlantis the massive apparatus the earthworm
 tunneling through orbit circling the planet 
 singing to the sea Atlantis singing to the newborn star
 shaking off the cloud of its birth, 
 leaving a truly empty hole never seen 
 in the universe a truly empty hole in the sea of the sky 
 
 Did Poseidon squeeze off the surge 
 of a rogue well with a cork of experience? Did Poseidon 
 have limits of experience on the sea bottom, the god-given
 sea bottom, full of liberties?
 
 Did Poseidon have a cozy relationship with the 
 minerals management service? Did Poseidon 
 of the high-sea phase-changes change phases instead,
 declaring Aquaman a ridiculous spectacle, 
 declaring a worst-case scenario, declaring himself 
 angry and sickened, did he pull a monotheistic cloak
 about his head?
 
 Atlantis with six million tons of blastoff in a final orbit
 in a single violent gesture sinks into the horizon, 
 sinks into the obscurity of the land of the oarfish.
 
 
Psalm for Dogs and Sorcerers
Let the sea colored eels teem with urchins and worms,
 and let the orangutan with mad mouthing tongue
 fly above a slurry of swifts in the sunset
 and into a clutch of centipede eggs curled coy
 in the middens of the whitebark cones 
 come to feed the Douglas squirrels that feed the big
 brown grizzly all the way down to Idaho
 and let a rat be a short eared bunny 
 or just a rat in a short eared universe 
 and the bicyclists after their chicken catching kind
 swell their hearts too and feed the river cats 
 near the railroad track and let there be future 
 farmers among the pigs and sheared Shropshire sheep 
 and kind of a baby cow and miniature rams
 and let all be fair in the hay and sawdust 
 and in a serious storm of being aliveness teem, 
 according to a kind, and to every sea horse 
 a black tongue according to its kind and good, 
 wild medflies after their kinds, sassy potatoes 
 with corn dogs and buttermilk after their kinds 
 and all koalas that clutch according to their kinds. 
 
 And one kind hungers after another kind in accordance 
 with past nature, another kind takes after yet another
 kind in kind. According to creatures, this is kind 
 of a kindness time after time.
 
 
Census of the Fishes
 The time is ripe.
 
 Humans must share 
 with marine mammals and sea birds 
 squid, krill,
 
 and one quintillian copepods,
 the value of knowledge 
 for its inherent interest: 
 
A Census of the Fishes. 
 
 A serious Census of the fishes 
 the prowfish the lungfish the glassfish 
 the blind sharks the blue eyes the smelt 
 
 onesided livebearers and the white eye 
 the jawless fishes, pinnipends, 
 count up the deep sea sculpins, snail and limpet 
 
 the blenny, the bonnetmouths and bonytongues 
 count the catsharks and false catsharks, brotulas and false brotulas, 
 Count the lumpsuckers stuck fast to rocks 
 
 the dreamers and dottybacks, the gulpers and gunnels 
 the hingemouths and garfish with green bones 
 noodlefish, icefish, gibberfish and gar 
 
 naked suckermouth catfish
 count the ricefish 
 count rabbitfish, pigfish, roosterfish, and seahorses
 
 count the puffers 
 count milkfish 
 count emperors or scavengers 
 
 fairy basslets, catfish, thornyheads and thornfishes 
 ribbonbearers, bonnethead, menhaden and ocean-basses, 
 jacksonshark, armored gurnards, 
 
 count up the lovely hatchetfish.
 
 A serious census of the fishes
 
 whether the wish exists.

at home it was always at night, never in the morning. while she was drifting a
man in a blue swandri came along and stopped by the toilet. he unzipped his zip.
the cave opened up into sunlight — and it was full of butterflies, the size of hands,
he moved forward, bringing her chest in to her knees, disturbing the torsoes,
mobile silence. everything was shining, it was just a bath, there was nothing
stupid about it. the cliffs were sheets of hanging stuff, isinglass crisped into
land forms. “that’s embarrassing,” he said, and tucked himself in. now there
would be no problem fitting her in with the dentist. kiwis cried out in the bush
and cold came up through her wet feet. she exchanged the shoes for a pair
of white crocs, the first of the thirty pairs. it was over very quickly. the rowboats
carried on around the hot, shallow seas. there had been nowhere in her mouth
for the tartar to collect.
ii
we were in the rowboats, making our way around the hot, shallow seas. I had
been looking for a while for a dentist near the shore, and eventually found one,
advertised as offering discretion, a lack of odour, accommodation for
anxieties. debarkation was early, and the dog suffered. up in the hills birds
cried out — weak, weak. I stepped up off the platform onto the flight of stone
stairs. the surgery was glass on four sides, but the dental light blotted out
everything. while we talked an explosion had happened behind me, to the right
of my head, the cloud forming the shape of a lightbulb, so he said kindly.
"I hope no one was hurt." so he said kindly. but I couldn't define the moment
the light happened. there had been no indication at all.

I cherished my non sequiturs
spent more time out of my head
in half-baked theorising
or a vagrant continuity glitch
and some gawky deaths
 
like, the sex-drugs billets-doux
of a simple girls-night-out
that transience, routine backdrops
tracks up and down stairs
a corridor corpse and a bare-arsed man
in the courtyard, bawling
 
I’ve never enjoyed
waiting for people to do drugs
there was just enough chundering
even with my chaotic heartbeat
my pulsating deep-strange entity
 
you put yourself into
the post-punk river of traffic
or hug escalators with some
heavily ruffled drag performer
after another schooey of new
is just the beginning
of the set-up
of alien friend technology
and the drama hug
 
call me sensation-seeker, in and out of
and afterwards on Bondi bleary
crammed early with desolate drams
or the garish argue
and sand squeaks in the cold
 
save me the movie star looks
I defy that and horizons
before, there’s a lot of chumps
to be juggled: scroungers, pushers
liars, twerps, the proverbial
and her lips feeling weird
your friend’s sister
in the unforgiving forest of light
 
“some lifestyle choices,” says
the addict with answers
and that girl under-acting
in tights reading crime fiction
like it was situationist slapstick
under a Henson image in
someone’s mother’s apartment
where among the sounds
of electronic bleeps it’s getting
gritty across the surfaces
 
it’s too early to muse
on what is to die
in this grunted spring
of ageing activist cameos
and expensive graffiti art-spray
 
in each sequence we walk away
night to morning where
there are no tunes just waves
and a pat-pat hug-hug
instead of 2am strife
to pay for our confession, and the go
 
(who dies with their speech uninjured
must live on in a special time capsule)
 
don’t go gushing
and don’t go
 
allow me another version
of the “fuck you” song
and try a little tenderness
 
 
Blue Lines
 
It’s not the birds that are spectres,
they come in afternoon, true,
swing by the air, song-filled passes,
that branches come to ground, falling
with dryness and shadows, remembering
midnights rather than afternoons,
declining drugs rather than passing shots
to make shadows in the lens that swings
the casual reach through spectacle
of shadows on a dance floor and wings
flashing off drags, or you, queer bird,
dropping each sequence twisting in and out
of presence, the dry air that falls like a truism
once you’ve left the afternoon filling
its own spectre of west light and husks
of autumn that birds let fall, that grounds
fill as fallen, dance for earthed shadows,
the passing sequence husked with
casual twists of a lens through its stops
as if the machinery could drag light back
again, dancing jewels, red and green feathers
flashing a pass, a queer shot the sun’s moment
holds, not yet declining.

 
 
“It Wasn’t Anywhere”
 
It wasn’t anywhere I lived
exactly, it was more like time
full of laser dust, celebrity footballers
a zone of affable ravage
of being blinded afterwards.
We were always looking for surfaces
even as small as a credit card
and all this accompanied
by plainsong beaten at angles
through drum machines
and consequences.
Light rose like seraphim
which seems a lazy way
to put it now, at this filthy distance.
The nights preferred their ruck
and maul with averages
in drinks, sex in the broom closet
ancient fairies hot with farragoes
and heels on concrete.
What can a small town do
apart from suffer when we’d turn
inward on our germs and genius
or learn to measure things in parallel.
Let’s make sure the terms are clear
at least in a monetary sense.
You can dance down the field
in rugger bugger kit
even now, no-one thinks it queer
unless you kiss.
My tongue was bitter
and the gain did not last.
The fractals on the wall looked great
but they weren’t the only
theory you bought me.

From Senses Working Out, Vagabond Press Rare Object Series, 2012.Excerpt from “Ms Mati becomes a mother”

Drought and its opposite
where it is dead-dry
without
water and blood
oil and lava
without the flow
 
                                                the flow
 
that lets things move,
live, breathe, be themselves
in themselves and of themselves
being as a storm; a storm is only
half itself without the rushing rains,
destroying and remaking life anew
 
with dryness comes death,
desert crawling over the corpse
corrupt, sterile, stifling quartz,
its arid momentum letting nothing
                                                                             nothing new
flourish, grow, as itself
                                                in itself
                                                                 of itself
 
                            free
 
Drought is the opposite of freedom     — it grates
against life in its ugliness and horror,
against life’s beauty and despair
 
Drought is the opposite of freedom
— homophobic, fascist torturer
of all that might flower
 
so essential
                               water of hope
 
                               blood of optimism
 
                               all fluid things
 
                               spiralling on
 
                               between the moment
 
                               second of birth
 
                               instant of death
so essential
                                              so wet
                                                                                         so filling the void
 
“so fuckin what,” says Mati,
“this is not my concern
my interest is love,
I am history and the future
I am the effervescent present
my interest is love — liquid love
cascading through my earthquaking cunt
pumping in my heart
streaming through my
clitoris, womb, flesh —
in waves
                                inside
                                                              and out
 
not the
                               definite dry-deadness
                                                           of the definite article
                                                                                                     (the) 
                 but movement
                                                                        sense it”
                                                                                                                     “spin”



Fluids
 
 
Mati thinks
she’s some kind of shaman
mother-earth-fuck-good-witch
you don’t come the cunt with her
 
that’s the flavour of her juices
rich —                       
                             of the earth
of the dark soil
                            of the earth
of the crimson blood
                            of the earth
of the sweating degrading decay
                            of the earth
                                 the earth?
 
molten and flowing
metamorphic and volcanic
brutal, burning and exotic
to our paltry, human skin
 
Mati’s awright but
cool and tough but
just like a woman
 
that’s how I think about
the woman Mati,
then what she’d see
if she looked at me now
with her prophetess eyes
that melt your bones
she knows how men
like to look at women
and how to look back at men
 
right into their eyes
as if there was religious depth in the iris
- ignore the whites -
it always has to be the iris
rich with life-colour
blue and weeping
green precious emerald
brown and common as muck
but therein an ocean of creation,
wild colours not often found
unless you look long into the iris
 
never mind, if Mati looked at me now she’d
say, fuck that Jim shave and take a bath —
and that’s what I would do
for bathing is sacred so I’d
ask her to come in that bath
splash water on my back
shave the auld gray beard away
 
go on, she’d ask,
what’s your favourite punctuation mark?
I’d muse on the stupidity of the question
and the fun of it,
cum on her milky-white teeth
as if it had meaning
 
my fluids too, perhaps,
are of the earth
the soil and rock,
volcano, earthquake, rainforest,
desert
             desert
impotent, unless you know where to look
ah Mati, electric, shocking lover
that you were…   
 
Pregnant 
 
 
Mati
is pregnant
cures morning sickness
with herbal remedies, has
given up sex,
smoking, drink and drugs
sits out by the canal
in spring sun
reading Dostoyevsky,
Leonard Cohen,
Janice Galloway
 
Mati
knows the trick
like Ms Galloway
but is luckily still sane
breathes deep and easy
lets her belly grow
her breasts expand
 
people row up and down the canal,
laughter and voices, and water
breaking under the oars —
her father liked the water too
sailing and swimming
spinning under and up in his canoe
 
Sunday is her favourite day to sit 
so busy with boats and mothers
with children and fathers looking
somehow bewildered
as if the women
could send them a message of wisdom,
tell them telepathically
what they are for
somehow fathers don’t know anymoreA I D /I/ S A P P E A R A N C E

The Magic Rule of Nine
Your sonic suit may not be a perfect fit. You’ll learn to
get by. Just don’t assume that all art is all about victory 
over death all the time. Not to say one shouldn’t enjoy 
not being dead. In the swell of many a meantime, 
many have been known to divert themselves with great 
success viz. civilizations’ greatest hits. Take the 
discovery of  “The Magic Rule of Nine.” That the 
sums of all the numbers within the sums of all the 
multiplicands of 9 up to and including 9 equal 9 is 
numerically melodious (bird singing in tree) to the 
species that longs for more to it than a first glance 
affords. Someone will say if you really think this is 
magic you don’t properly understand the decimal 
system (bird falls out of tree). Who among us doesn’t 
long for magic. Who among us understands the 
decimal system.
 
 
The Ventriloquist’s Dilemma
Birdsong entered our words and left with migratory 
 echoes insufficiently dispersed. We weren’t designed 
 to perceive most of what surrounds us or to fully 
 understand the rest. Maybe it’s true that differential 
 equations drove the teenager off the road. The self-
 propagating slope remains unhindered in its x-y axis. 
 It’s really difficult to find the language to say these 
 things rigorously. Sound waves break on the shore and 
 make one feel unwelcome. And too, there’s that 
 conspicuous absence of real metaphors in nature. 
 Sorry, meant to say, there’s that conspicuous absence 
 of real nature in metaphors. Someone will always 
 claim night flew into a tree. The placement of (those) Fishing, off Kawau 

            turns and spits: which part of no don’t you understand?
N O is two islands, lumps of difference in a flat film
like skin near some place I’m taken to
fish, one of them, I’m not sure which, a sanctuary,
landing not permitted. Someone must have landed
once, there was a jetty. Whenever low tide curls
back, jagged rotting piles raise a silent jeer
as you float by. One snot-green molar sports
a gulping shag; wet globlets flick; its neck
snakes. There must be fish
here somewhere
The nearer part of N O is poorly charted,
presence of rocks noted but locations
uncertain. Not to mention
the rip.
The middle of a poem is as likely a place to find fish as anywhere else in my experience. Down here they dream past in schooling streams, eager for any morsel I care to place before them. Yes, these are my fish; they will know me well; dappled silver to scale; mouthing uncanny words ending shortly in O as I jerk awake.
Now my slender thread
    drips
        down
            through the disappearance,
                baited
                  with little hope




Did you hear the snicker/ of that piwakawaka?/
In which fold/ is the artist squeezed?
This is a lonely realm, a scary place for non-Maori
poets who’ve not wed with the land or made cousins
of forests or fucked up a kinship
with the rivers. We, too, fear there may be taniwha
at every bend of these shaky isles; it feels a long way from
safety — we so small; the landscapes so
expensive, big with uncanny sky and the squawk of some
terrified bastard out of sight, straining for a foothold. 
 At Adam’s anxious entree, same same: same stuttering litany
of names, the tic of homage to geology,
geography, flora and fantail, faint trace of our thin poetic
pencil running ahead of the eraser, touching the ground for
autistic affirmation, shitting adjectives like sheep
backing from a noun’s bark: on any approach, bound to be uphill.

A bead of moisture swells

Shiny, his old skin is
almost transparent; red
vein-lines lace his cheeks. 
Thick and white his hair
which he brushes,
according to his morning
regimen, standing on the
front porch, overlooking
the road where he can see
me pedalling to school. 
The bead splashes onto
the toe of one of his well-

holding the outer edge of
each frame between a
thumb and index finger.

 743f (Book VI)
 
I have no problem with the logic
of purgatory following paradise.
To see bees cluster about knotholes
in York gums and to smell
the honey of their community
and realise that their presence
almost certainly means the doom
of the native bee, can’t be blamed
on Varius. Toxicity is chemical.
 
In the catchment the rain is strongest
because great trees remain and great trees
have appeared because of terrain: land
and life mutually nurture. A system.
 
Pilfering the edges and working
in to the lusher centres, developer
and “citizen” work hand-in-hand
to settle where it’s most “beautiful”:
clearing away the “beauty” to make
dwellings, then fearing living
where fire comes in summer, clearing
more away that they might dwell
safely: rainfall lessening with dwindling
vegetation. Bees forced into analogies
of profit and labour. A system.
 
A thousand years in high-yielding
Elysian fields, exemplars of agriculture,
to be reborn into the imperfections
of organic farming resistance. Bodies
altered and competing for new purity.
Only language changes. Not ambition.
 
In the Theatre of Hate, they shape
the next generations. Hale fellows,
well met. So many sibyls projecting
characters, wanting applause.
Anonymity is a fate worse than.
And heroes of the people will
graciously thank the servants
of lighting and costumes. We
have done our time, they’ll gesture,
now it’s time to step out in our
new bodies, glorious as bees
away from the hive, endangered
plants offering up their flowers
as willingly as weeds: saturated
in pollen, high on the nectar.
 
 
Dividing the Shadows
inruat et frustra ferro diverberet umbras 
 — Virgil, Aeneid, book VI, lines 285–294
Most ghosts settle on the skin like eczema.
Some pass through and stimulate cancer.
It is nothing to with vengeance, even where
they are disturbed or distraught. They react
differently with different body chemistries.
They recognise genetic familiarity and follow
the trails. They show up as monsters under
black lights: Scyllas, Briareus, the rasping
creature of Lerna, flaming Chimaera, Gorgons
and persistent Harpies. Medicine and science
scythe away at them but they change shape
and rise again. Out of the shadows deep
in the gully I watch a red-capped robin
hop and skip towards a filament of fence-
line. It divides the shadows as it goes:
they close over in its wake, needing no
energy source. Darkness is the liveliest
state, they say, though the wind is light.
To untrained eyes the red-capped robin
seems unscathed, its future bright.
It casts such a small shadow.

Salmoneus: a dynamic equivalence
lines 485–495
In the ripsnarl of turbo chargers
and roll cages, the rally drivers
will unwind and rewind the loop,
trace the keyhole road with rubber
lips, “getting off on it, advertisers”
logos festooning panelwork, revving
air to shakedown trees, shatter
frosted webwork, decree thunderous
clouds of exhaust, chromed challenge
to any naysayers that show their heads —
shouted down, off-roaded, imitated
to show just how dull those gods
have become. Witness the flit of parrots,
the trauma of sheep, the “look at me!”
that sweeps onlookers once the driver’s
helmet is removed — warrior enflamed,
such danger in fuming winds of change.
 
 
The Mangled Spectre of Deiphobus
(Virgil, Aeneid, book VI, lines 494–534)
The signature of Helen hacked
into my face and body — what’s not
written tells more than the flourish
of handiwork, her first husband
making up for lost time, deleting
truth and rewriting the histories
of love and dedication: the sword
beneath my pillow removed by her,
along with every other means of defence
once hung throughout the chamber;
this legacy that leaves only a desire
for vengeance, hollow as cenotaphs
along the shore worked by wind and rain.
It compounds the insult to know that she
danced naked in mock sacredness, singing
the enemy soldiers, foetuses in the wooden
horse’s belly. Her countryman and our
wives in her band, her sparkling display.
I slept the sleep of the dead, the joy.
I woke to see myself die, desecrated.

I’m afraid, a camel, luminous,
loping panicked away from the voice
asking: Your monster?
Me? Or that grinning demon
who leapt up on my hump,
who is twisting a malnourished snake
into a halter? Suddenly around me
the trees are a cage, pomegranates
pocked moons, faces zoological or bestial,
voices, that cacophony.

14 Weeks
 
When you began, it was whether or not,
            a daily rhythm in my heart,
but now the burgeoning kicks in and spins
            your opening phrases out
into the weather of these waters,
            where the skeins of inner sun
are a sunset through the skin
            & dancing fronds resemble coral
round the bubble of your sac & your
            hands attempt to close
on nubs that stray into their grasp & your
            mouth wants to suck
the thumbs that swim under its arch ––
            taking, testing, small philosopher,
materialist of mine, with a focus never known
            once in possession of a mind.
 
 
First Words
 
Sooner or later it comes, the word for sky.
After moon and after stars, which decorate it,
the ground, which was up to then — or was it —
quite invisible. Now I talk about the sky to her
as if it were a bowl,
or a cloth draped above our heads
to shade us; now I paint it into being,
teach my daughter the solidity
of sky, though I know it in my heart
to be scatter, that particulate
blue. Things drop
from the sky: from my desk in a tower
I watched a flock of feathers
rock-rocking
on their journey to the pavement. One of them
was pink. Something happened in the sky
whose aftermath drizzled
through a minute of the morning, tugging
my attention;
then the sky clearing,
as if it were a synonym for peace.
 
 
Poet, Painter 
(for Gloria Petyarre) 
 
There should be a right distance,
at which
we would meet
if we could.
                         The sky
would pool in our hands,
the mark-making
fingers feel the infinite
diffractions
of a shared
light
              –– our aftermarks
diverging then, yearning
for infinity, blind as
worms but with an instinct
for where the earth
dreams.
 
 
Tunings
 
The thought of a leaf –– unhitched,
unmoored, steered only by the air ––
comes at a meeting in which the men describe
self-driven cars
 
as the imminent future,
directed, if at all, by the air of our voices.
 
Somewhere in the deserts
of America, they say, unmanned cars
 
already drive into valleys, tuned
to the whispering of satellites.
 
One of them jokes, Just a few 
of their crash dummy passengers survive.
 
Out of the meeting and back to the leaf.
It had no dream of losing steerage of itself ––
 
but was one day
relinquished by the tree.
 
 
Snow
(Anatole Mallarmé, 1871–1879)
 
Lamplight, shed on snow, is not itself,
not pure or plummet,
but it refracts to colour. It is self-divided.
 
A girl’s a red hand-shadow, meadow flowers
trapped in moonlight cast
an arched and azure double,
 
but if death is technicolour, restored
to black or white,
our shadows stamp our exile from the dead.
 
— Once there was a man. There was a son,
a youthful Icarus,
he kept with him in flight
 
as he orbited Ideas among the word-balloons
which freighted them.
The boy’s heart grew enlarged,
 
became a counterweight to all
his father sought
to elevate in phrases spoken and unspoken
 
by the son, king of the Work,
his shadow falling
on the page: a white flower,
 
 that asks to be remembered by
the now-departed sun.mauling and misericordia

Cento for Election Day 
 
And I heard my Coleridge say, “I am
the patron saint of everyone who died
before you.” Had to carry a torch,
a hunger you’ll never show.
Under alien skin 16A and B
I bring my body through
this mortal world, American town
founded on a hologram. This matter-
of-fact free house, this one nightmare
reaching out to consume you.
Driving down Broadway
I told my child: it was never yours,
only a naming call, pitched their tents
& destroyed whole nations
eight miles from here. What?
We live in a burning sideline,
same old fetch. We do this landscape
crowned and slow. At the crossroads
I mutate into a flower that blooms
once every 25 years. Words
large enough to contain you: during,
pine, upend, the eating of men.
 
 
 
Through a Glass Lightly
Cento for Beginners
The nasturtium is to itself already
a memory. It opens its leaves
its fire
ribbed impression in the grass
that forms like shadow.
I see it plain
as a living fretwork
in the distortion of sound,
press a leaf to a winter dream
of your hand
translated, given.
Our love calls and we lie
in the future of cells dividing,
a water drop
clean in its own shape.
A nasturtium between itself
and us, showing the light.
Time to be born.

that Eloquence — now I am free!
Atomic rocks
form like hills & dunes,
like grass. I do a lot of thinking.
Sky goes rococo as the nearest dream
is led away. We behave badly
in dangerous clothes & laugh for days.
I want to remember this chaos,
song of one breath in A.
Phantoms on the home stretch
call my name. Bird magician
sugar  concrete  
a woman opening the heavy door.
There are no lyrics left
& another reality howls
as the new gets
newer. I stood exactly where
those piles of books carried me.
Over ruins of this comedy
I lie surrounded by beauty
until the Pleaides blink
like a sparkler in the HaHa Room.
 
 
1-800-DENIED
 
Take this watch in token of my etc.
Glycerin pardon, barometric rage.
Now the dust jacket bears your name you have to wear it.
 
The sky’s a huge screen flickering omens.
The doors and windows reek of yesteryear
and tenderness continues in every detail.
 
Lonely all the time until you paged me.
Cardiac personae, heavy turncoat.
Ransack a chorine’s affection at your peril.
 
Abscond into criminal conversation.
Objection: asked and answered.
When the snow melts I’ll open a candy concession
 
and moonlight as an accident attorney.
Gynaecologists rusticate in petite laneway luxury.
I await the southerly buster like any denizen.

"for almost seven months Kevin
(pictured right) has dug in this hole:
 
that’s thirty weekends!
but who’s counting
 
says his mother (in
left of photo).
 
Dad  … " (but here our quote ends:
‘torn’ from the New Zealand News,
 
dad not pictured).
 
I had a dream once of my dad, a sort of
joke about him: he had this ball & chain attached to his leg
 
in a fir tree wood
got into a biplane, sat behind the pilot —
 
& took off  —
 
the plane buzzed furiously, all over the sky,
above the mountain that was in the dream
 
above the fir trees on its peak  —
 
unable to go beyond a certain distance —
 
& descended
Dad, sheepish but amused, got out of the plane,
 
in his cardigan,
 
& got the ball
 
wrapped, as it was,
around one of the fir trees, where it had
 
tethered the plane.

I love to say  
"Are you all right, mate?"
 
to anything I’ve dropped — & bend to pick up —
 
or that something
is not something’s  ‘bootlace’
 
—   my dad’s dismissal
 
of the substandard or secondary
"He’s not Elly Bennett’s bootlace!"
 
( of some pug )
 
 
That’s not a tomato’s bootlace: me,
of tomato  (a dud)
 
you get the hang of it.
 
My father worked in a factory
built into the foundations
 
of the Harbour Bridge  —
regularly enough
 
a suicide would land outside.  One day as the men knocked off
a body landed — with a thump — 
 
dead of course —
& the new guy asked it (him) the question
 
— & was taunted with it
 ‘ever after’
 
people yelled out to him  
around the factory
 
Hey, Frank !
Are you all right mate?
 
#
 
but don’t force it

Which is my answer to Michael:
 
Give it a try — & if it’s ‘ready’
well, something may give.
 
Maybe, maybe not.

2/12/08 — A Poem for Philip Whalen 
                       “Here it comes again, imagination of myself”
                   — Philip Whalen, ‘International Date Line, Monday/Monday 27:IX:67’ 
 
Here it comes again, imagination of myself:
I’m sitting in the harsh light in a study
(mine) — it’s the light I like  —  & it’s late.
 
“In a study” always suggests “He was in
a bad mood, tense with it”  — not that —
reading Whalen, a book of drawings by Kirchner,
 
the Berlin Street Scenes — in an attempt
to gain some purchase, kick off
from something different — thinking
 
of Yuri, a bit, Cath’s eldest son, the one
I know least but like & like his difficult life
& how he’s dealt with it —“Yuri! I will speak 
 
with you later!”  My friends the poets, famous,
in their way — in the not very satisfying way that
poets can be — large in my mind at any rate —
 
& another, rather foolish, at the same time as
rather good — well alternately, from poem to poem —
something of a comeback.  Another friend, ill
 
seriously mortally time running out.  How quickly?  How
quickly for us all the question.  (‘A’ question.)  Anna, &
boyfriend Chris,  on their anger at / fascination with
 
The Howard Years documentary a
self-serving account but, as they say, so far
the major & lone political fact of their lives
 
It will be their early history: yech — Reith,
Howard himself (whom I never expected
in the 80s I would have to hate — what future
 
did he have?).  The rest.
‘Consigned’ now ‘to oblivion’, to echo & re-echo
in succeeding waves of revision, counter-construal
 
like analyses of the Third Republic, the French
Second Empire.  Where are we now?  Even ‘interesting times’
seem to follow a pattern, the bangs & whimpers
 
louder, more ironically conventional for their
inadequacy to the occasion.  Will America go under
because of Bush?  how appropriate
 
But was that my point?  Late at night,
not even worrying.  Whalen, the Kirchner drawings.
 
Go under?  What,
next week? 
 
Okay, then.
 
"It may never happen!"  Isn’t that the joke?
 If it takes ten years, if it takes twenty,
it will be cataclysmic.  Tho — 20 years —
 
I might be out of the way — or less concerned —
if curious as to the outcomes.  For
twenty years — for thirty — I have been amused
 
— "amused at best" — by Whalen’s politics —
raving & ranting, observations
of a hippy dropout.  Well, a Beat
 
the one I like best.  What did Whalen change?
 
He was sane, he set an example.  Now,
as I read the poems, I find those same politics
both nostalgic & to the point.
 
What will I change —
if I put my crazy-arse shoulder to the wheel? 
Is the answer: "In this vassal state?" 
 
Or
"You should have thought of this earlier"? 
 
Leave a record, like Whalen did,
of clear perceptions.  The avowedly political authors
I read—Naomi Klein, Tony Negri — seem no
 
nearer the mark, tho fun to think about, think
with.  Negri, so systematic, abstract, & wishful.
The ‘Multitude’ — what a category!  How do I join, ha ha.
 
The overweening confidence & blindness of
think-tank America: the End of History.
 Wishful thinking — & the rest of the world knew.
 
(Cheney, Rumsfeld & the others — Pal, 
we make history!)  A century
of Interesting Times.  More.  When did they begin?
 
1871?  1789?  The innocence, & the percipience,
of my artistic heroes seems so touching,
even their blindness.  Manet  O’Hara  Coltrane
 
— loons like de Chirico — the Germans, Kirchner
Kokoschka, Adorno — Christa Wolf.  Did they each sit up,
as I do, in bed—a sleeping other at their side —
 
writing, nodding off   … ?

 The fan is going & blows my page occasionally
though I have weighted it now with Heavy Breathing,
Whalen’s orange-covered volume,
 
with its wonderful drawing … that is too smart
to date much, really.  Then one day it will date
suddenly — the ironies, the humour, the seriousness
 
will cease to register — a fallen, a trashed
civilization.  I hope not.  Tho Whalen of course
could live with it.  Less tied to this world than me. 
 
I like life.  I like ‘the continuing story’, anyway,
& will be unhappy about it, the rupture.  Will
the rest of my life prepare me?  ("Check the serenity!"
 
Ha ha.  Dreaming.)
My body, turning, in some future.
 
Now I read this 24 hours later, & rub Cath’s
beautiful shoulder.  If I love life
 
why haven’t I had one — like Whalen did?
Tho I must’ve.  Mine’s all gone, right?
In fact I don’t know much about what Whalen did.
 
I seem to have spent mine day-dreaming — or thinking hard
about music, blues &  jazz & art — & making jokes & quipping
& making poems out of it.  The women
 
I’ve hung around have kept me sane.  (A few were ‘nuts’ —
but I was nuttier.)
 
People just want to be happy?  The big,
noble notions
exist, it sometimes seems, as ‘a caution’ — to ‘ennoble’ lives
 
with their ‘perspectives’.  Rembrandt, for example,
those terrific self-portraits — pathos, self-knowledge … the rest.
Dignity & failure — etcetera.  Yes,
 
but fifteen minutes later, he was having a banana. 
Or is that me? 
A rollmop, then.
 
Cath reads an old favourite, laughs occasionally,
reads me bits.  The fan churns,
noisily.  Tho we don’t notice: the night cooling
 
after a day of 42 & another of 37.  Cool tomorrow,
at 27?  24?  A small list of things to do builds.
My first week back at work. 
 
Write to Sal, draw my hand
or wrist-&-watch, stuff to edit, CDs to copy
for Michael.  I recommend to him
 
Floyd Jones: ‘Tore Your Playhouse Down’
how the song rolls so casually — solid, unfussed
the solos played on top of each other
 
a wonderful cacophony (Fred Below, Otis …)
The drawing — for Nick — illustration to something
he’ll print.  Sal —— after 20 years — to be
 
evicted from her flat.  A view I love.  She must, too.
Sydney.  Sydney as an idea.  Slessor, Cossington-
Smith.  Not that I care much about them: it is
 
Sal’s harbour view suggests them.
 At last someone wants to charge real rent.
The old owners must have died? — or sold up?
 
It will be weird if she moves somewhere I don’t know.
West, I guess.
 
                               A week later I have edited things,
Photocopied my arm — preparatory to drawing —
these are the easy things.  Not written to Sal.
 
Tho what’s to say?  You have to say something of course.
Very likely she is ready for change.  Regretting
the view she will lose — but impatient with the place
 
now the move is on.  She was always something
of a Futurist.  One pictures her beautiful, goggled head
hunched forward to the sights of a WWI Fokker,
 
or leaning low & forward on a 1930s motorbike.  Laurie jokes
that I should send the T-shirts to Les Murray,
they are so big.  On different sides of the planet
 
we smile at the idea of Les — wearing the Brainard
T-shirt, a graphic proclaiming a reading.  For Ted Berrigan,
for Joe Brainard & Anne Waldman.  ("Oh, boy!"
 
says Nancy on one, "a Poetry Reading!")  Laurie’s
new book is out.  Fingers bent,
curled over, relaxed, I draw my left hand, held
 
palm upward, & the wrist.  My plan is to get it right
then copy it quickly with a firmer pen
& add the watch-band.  Nick requires an image
 
— with which to feature a particular
bright red — against which the drawing will be
set.  (A poem I wrote years ago —
 
that Nick has found & likes.  I like it, too,
so why not?)    Weeks have gone past.  Unchanged, the world
continues — tho shifts occur, indeterminate.  The
 
one stability is a US stalled, awaiting the appointment
of the next incumbent.  Moves will begin
when he is sworn in — the slide, the counter-measures,
 
the moves of Russia, India, China, Europe.
 
 
Though it’s been non-stop ‘interesting times’,
most of it, in my life, has been going on elsewhere,
a pointy end far from here.  For me,
 
no military service, no economic disaster.
My luck runs out? 
Blues For The Girls, All Blues, Mary’s Blues —
 
names I consider
 
for a new book, ‘Mary’ being Mary Christie —
but it’s also an early Coltrane tune — & really
I would like it dedicated to Cath & Anna, the women
 
in my real life.  Mary,
an old friend — in India now — in Japan for
the last 7 years.  More.  I lived in her house
 
in Westbury Street.  The Westbury Street Poems —
was once a title I hoped to publish.
I’m sitting here in Cork — the bar, not the town.
 
(I should write to my Irish friends.)  Joyce was pleased to have
a painting of Cork, painted on cork, apparently.
Amused, I guess, at the finality & nominal closure
 
of the pun:  What’s that?  ‘Cork.’
I find most puns shit boring, but still more so
the declaredly learned — discoursing on their own ‘delight’
 
in them,
 
as if puns were naughty, & daring, & confirmed
their membership of some club — a kind of unofficial
High Culture Mensa.  I hate intellectuals going on about
 
Sport.  Why am I talking of this?  I don’t know.
 
So, here I sit in Cork, time running out, luck running out,
Thinking about titles — tho I can’t make up my mind, &
writing them down means I can forget again for a while —
 
& think about Art Criticism — write some at any rate.
That is what someone wants me to do.  And I’m ‘on to it’ —
I tell them.  (I’ve done the drawing, meanwhile, & sent it off —
 
my wrist & hand — looking not too deformed — tho not
resembling exactly mine — which could be really satisfying.
Like ‘Cork’.  My own hand by my own hand.  Is that it?)
 
The letter to Sal is written, posted.  I think it felt
too weird — shifty, dishonorable — to write here about
maybe writing — & then not get it done.  I tell her
 
about my picture of her as a Futurist.  The
close-helmeted figure, in goggles — coming from
a Lina Wertmuller film — tho which one?  In it
 
the joke Fascist — lantern-jawed — dumb machismo type —
speeds about, aerodynamic —
acting out his picture of himself as he does.
 
Tho who am I to talk?  (Not exactly lantern-jawed,
 
not exactly machismo — tho — like a Fascist — seemingly
a little down on intellectuals: When I hear the word "pun" 
I reach for my gun!  Yike!)
 
My father’s war — the second, ‘world’ war — was an odd one
Significant in his life — along the Some Came Running lines:
he was young, free (single, at least), & joined up
 
not to fight so much as to travel — given that
waiting to be called up meant permanent duties
in Australia, & call-up seemed inevitable.  Dad
 
joined, hoping to see the world.  He would have, too —
except he & his friend proved such a good shot
on the 22 pounder that the generals kept them home,
 
for permanent display.  (See that tree on that hill,
says one general to another.  I have a pair here
who can hit it first shot!  Bolton!  Nicholls!  Load up!)
 
(Or so I imagine.) 
Dad was stuck here
as his regiment — regiments — would ship out …
 
to New Guinea, Africa, the Middle East.  My father
 
took increasingly long vacations AWOL & was
regularly punished.  Why did you do this, Private Bolton?
Because I could.  I see.  From that period of his life,
 
a kind of paradisal time of boredom, fun, camaraderie,
he had endless stories, that I heard endless times
& can remember & would like to hear again,
 
hear my father tell them.  Tho he’s gone.  Time
having run out.  (Me, my
watch, & I.)
 
Cath will show up soon, any minute, & we’ll
cross the street & shop in the markets, buying
fruit & vegetables, bread — for the weekend & the Monday,
 
which is Australia Day & a public holiday.  Monday —
usually — when we shop.  (Public Holidays,
unfortunately, mean nothing to me — I don’t work Mondays,
 
& nobody cares about Australia Day — this is Australia!
Altho, increasingly, people seem to.  Well, count me out.
 
Whoa!  Close call.  The girl taking coffee outside
is nearly collected by a young guy on a skateboard going by.
Luckily she pauses on the doorstep just in time.)
 
Cath’s arrived. 
(Sal, I was going to say, liked my father,
& his stories.)  My time
 
would have been different — Vietnam.
 
(Which I am grateful to have missed.  Demonstrating against it
was bad enough — the real thing would have been awful.
My father told me — I remember — not to go if I was called up:
 
‘Disappear,’ he said.
                                                           But it didn’t eventuate.
It did for others.)
 
                                            Australia Day,
at Margaret & Crab’s.  We sit out on their
verandah, in the dusk & then the dark, talking,
 
catching up, watching the street lights & moonlight
thru the leaves, listening to parties up & down,
watching young people visit.  The dog, Molly,
 
excited & attentive, yapping occasionally,
at other times absorbed, silent. 
It’s hot, tho cool by now.  Marg’s hair,
 
cut shorter than usual — like a Cleopatra cut
but abbreviated, sharp.  It resembles the haircuts
of the girls in Kirchner & Heckel’s paintings — & Schmidt-Rottluff’s — so
 
severe & modern.
 
These models were the women Kirchner hung about with.
Girlfriends.  I saw a photo of one recently & was
Amazed at how modern the haircut seemed
 
Severe & sure, ‘Bauhaus’: the woman looked independent
& unfaked.  Though this was before WWI — before
the Bauhaus, the Tingle-Tangle Girls, Dada.
 
It is a shock to see in the photo the real life
the painting depicted — suddenly actual,
a moment — not bent to a purpose.
 
Some of the Berlin scenes are pretty good.
But it’s the scenes of bathing at the lake I like
& cabaret girls dancing — where Kirchner,
 
as well as being suckered by the women’s beauty,
depicts their friendship & humour: in the chorus line
there are always two women in conversation.
 
Crab points out the perfect sweetness & beauty,
& construction,
of a Little Walter solo behind Muddy. 
 
Etta James is dead.  I hadn’t realized.
 
Perfect in her own way, a few times.  An
unhappy life.
 
                             She will be remembered longer than me. 
Unless, in the library, in the Himalayas, in 2333,
some monk decides the poetry of Australia 300 years earlier
 
really was interesting — & allows himself a footnote. 
“Ken Bolton answered phones in an art gallery, ran a bookshop,
& wrote poems of wistful humour.”
 
I see it in a small hand on an index card —
“a provincial poet in the era
of Late High Capitalism —
 
not much regarded,”
 
I have to laugh.  What’s that great line
of Apollinaire’s,
about tossing your life off like a drink?
 
I finish my coffee up.  (I expect
this looks like decision.  Tho in fact it means
Time for work.  I go there.)
 


Train Tripping  
 
yellowed long grass, that looks
as it did on a trip 40 years ago
 
to Canberra: the soft
pale, gentle hair of an old labrador
 
(my thought at the time)
goes by
 
& I remember it
 
& I see that grass outside.
Now.
 
& the song I was singing —
‘Paint Your Mailbox Blue’ —
 
a song I never hear
& always approve
 
— is this a life? —
thinking
 
of Pam & Jane & Cath &
Pam’s question — as to what Cath
 
does alone on Bruny & my
explanation: fishing, hiking around,
 
dinner with Lorraine & Ian
& friends up in town
 
& Pam & Jane’s life in Blackheath:
what they do
 
what they might do, &
remembering, then, Coalcliff —
 
but that’s train trips.
 
Cath will be launching
her book in Hobart in a few weeks. 
 
The film of us all
young & graceful
 
(the way we never knew we were)
in 1979/1980  Pam, Micky, Sal —
 
Laurie & me, Tom, Barb
(Barbara Brooks)  I tell Pam
 
of Peter Sloterdijk (Critique
of Cynical Reason) — & of his
 
new book.  I tell her who
he was — who I think he was.

 She asks after the new Ron Padgett
How To Be Perfect — have
 
I read it?  No,
but I’m going to & I’ve had it
 
through my shop & sold it
I’ll get it again.  Pam talks of
 
Padgett’s Cendrars translations
 
I remember Kodak, a Padgett collection
of short Cendrars pieces
 
I associate it with the tugs
that bustled around below the window
 
of the flat in Glebe — Leichhardt Street — with names like
Idaho  Omaha  Wyoming  (did
 
they have those names? all of those exactly?) —
they moved barges laden with wood about,
 
the water a deep blue around them,
the wood brown or deep orange
 
the tugs, of some
uncertain but evocative era —
 
twenties thirties forties: the mercantile
bustle & energy Cendrars saw in America
 
(in one of those decades probably).
Kodak was A-4, roneoed, had a glossy black
 
cover, with the title in ‘modern’
1920s Hollywood art deco letters
 
a little suggestive of old Kodak
packaging.  All of it — cameras, kodak,
 
those fonts — that lettering — Cendrars — old now.
I am old, & Pam.  And Ron Padgett —
the American Express — is older,
Blaise Cendrars (one-armed, grizzled,
 
unshaven, rugged, a smoker, a drinker)
long, long dead.  Do they love him in France
 
much, now?  Blaise, George & Marie’s kid,
named after him.  (If this poem
 
is called ‘Train Trip’ it will match Pam’s
of that name — written on this same
 
journey.  How many years has Pam been
up here?  Two, three?  It seems
 
like a while ago I read that poem.  Called in fact
‘Train train’.
 
Maybe she wrote it soon after arriving?
 
She & Jane meaning to move again.
In the poem she passes Sasha’s grave — so I guess
 
I will, tho I won’t know
as it happens.  Mentally she argues with him
 
as she passes — as she used to when
he was alive.  I listen to two girls
 
discuss a boy who is “cute” — but “in a
good way.”  On the way up
 
a few nights back
I listened on & off for ages
 
to two girls & a boy.  I didn’t look to check & see —
but 15 or 16 I would guess.  “If you
 
got rid of me, then you could be with 
her — the sophistication & melodrama
 
of “be with her”, which her voice handles
so well, ‘scare quotes’ ghostly, or strongly,
 
around all the words.  She is pretty funny.
“Ghostly” of course is not an adverb,
 
I realise.  They adopt — adopted — vaguely
wheedling complaining tones much of the time
 
But only as a way of ceding him
some power — as the source of statements
 
— of fact, of conjecture — & jokes.
He makes jokes, too.
 
& some of his jokes are good: the girls both laugh
but really the power is with them,
 
friends, lazily running thru their repertoire
of savoir faire, of knowledge, of
 
feminine fiat.  I wonder how pretty
they & the boy are?  Better not to find out.
 
A young mother, carrying her daughter on her hip
says slowly, conversationally, “Stop crying,”
 
& the tiny sound stops.  Blacktown
station.  The train is very full, of very interesting
 
people.  I will change at Central, have
lunch in town — Greek restaurant? —
 
then down to
Bulli to see Kurt.
 
 
After getting off the train — Pam,
Jane — I have a typical traveller’s time
 
at Central. A kind of shuffle
that would be irritating if one weren’t prepared …
 
 
Was I prepared?  I was.
                                          Then I went
to Diethnes where once, for a few years
at least, I ate once a fortnight.  The middle
 
70s — a filial relationship to the owners,
 
Helen &
Nick, & — against my will — a rivalry, seemingly,
 
with the head waiter.  Decades later he owned the restaurant
& was overjoyed to see me
 
remembering me as a best friend or at least
(some realism here) a well-remembered,
 
much-liked former customer.  Did I try to set him
straight?  I may have.  Anyway
 
here I am.  I have successfully not bought
some new shoes on the way — wonderfully lairish
 
& glamorous, in that Dennis Hopper/American Friend
            manner
& order anchovies in oil & the small Greek salad
 
& a carafe of retsina.  Christ, I love that taste!
 
The place is nice still — generous.  There is
the boring bastard nearby explaining
 
how he can’t eat mushrooms.  Can’t those at
his table ‘take it on board’?  Obviously not — or
 
not to his satisfaction & at a neighbouring table
a big group do a lot of yelling, especially the girls
 
who gain the attention gratefully given to a cliché —
because everyone knows how to respond.   Bravo!
 
she yells, arms over her head, attractively, because one of    
           the heroes
(all in white business shirts, black pants)
           goes to the bar (!)
 
to order wine.  But I approve — of her & him
& get back to the weird head-spaces I’ve occupied
           in Sydney
 
many times over forty years, the
           last
thirty especially — when every visit has been
          a Return.
 
Actually, if I weren’t seeing Kurt
in just a few hours, I’d’ve ordered
 
The Diethnes Special (in
Helen & Nick’s time delicious lamb on the bone
 
& stuffed capsicum & maybe a
zucchini or two & the most fabulous pilaf).
 
But it is midday.  The
boring guy goes to the toilet & the two with him
 
earnestly discuss their divorce
& arrangements for the kids: quick, efficient thrusts,
           not much parried: they’re
 
not scoring points but communicating.  Who
is this guy then?  He’s not their father.
 
He’s like one of those second rate actors
the Americans love to promote late in their
           career
 
to head the office in a crime show,
his ordinariness his main suit.  This beige-souled
 
groper could outface any steady Senior Detective
— supposedly of New York, Chicago, Los Angeles etcetera —
 
their yellow teeth, yellow eyes, their yellow opinions
& stock phrases.  (Dud pearls
 
drop from this guy’s lips like
the print-out used to come to financial institutions,
 
trying always someone’s patience — “Let me
see that!” — rips extruded tape from the machine
 
reads numbers, stock prices falling or tumbling, or
holding even)
 
                                 (“Sell amber! Buy tin!”)
 
What future
does television have?
 
Have I seen its face?
 
The shuffle:
I ring Linda & Allan, say I won’t be arriving
           after all,
 
don’t be alarmed; ring Di & Michael
Are they in?  I’m between Blackheath & Bulli — briefly —
 
But, as they’re engaged, I explain, to their answering machine,
& promise to ring back.  Then I go & seek change
 
from various of the punters awaiting trains
who of course assume I’m begging
 
but get the correct change to make another call —
to no avail
 
& here I am.
 
Now I ring Kurt.  That is, next I ring
           him — that is my plan
 
& head on down to Bulli, in
           two minds about the shoes
 
                                 *
                            At Diethnes

The boring bastard — specializes
in unsurprising revelations (“I can’t eat
           Mushrooms — I can eat
mushroom sauce but I can’t eat mushrooms”)
           — & in revelations that things
taken as surprising
           aren’t so: Americans
landed on the moon — but they’ll
           never be able to do it again
unaided.  (Think of that.)  Most of the
           stupefied people around him
wilt
           or fill their glass.  I put
my pen thru his forehead,
           salute his dinner partners
& leave to catch my train.
 
 
(A single simple stabbing motion.)

• September Song
                 for John Jenkins & Pam Brown
 
                   I was …
I was born in the 70s
— no no — I was young in
the 70s, so the 80s still seem
new to me.  Most of you, I realise,
were born then, or later,
& of course I’m so old
I might conceivably
die — before the end of this lecture,
which would be funny (tho I do not
welcome it & I am not sure
from what perspective it could
really be funny.  From mine,
if you imagine the pluperfect
regarded from the future.  For those of you — are there any? — who
have no Latin,
that would be a little like bowling a ball, slowly,
& running quickly down the green
to see it ‘arrive’, to kiss the dark ball
at the other end.  Is that the ‘eight-ball’,
or is that in pool? — the dark ball
‘of death’, which would effectively
end the lecture, & my life —
you’d have forgotten about me after the lecture
either way.  And there is a phrase for that
& it’s not non modo sed etiam, one I loved
in my overdetermined way: “not only but also”.
&, forgotten, I can get some rest at last
(for which there is ‘something’, probably,
in Virgil).  I who am about to die
salute you: September 26th
two thousand & ten.  Drinks glass of water,
taps mike.
 
I look out the window as the light changes
& see we are crossing water — the lake
 
or inlet that was Otford — &, on the
shore opposite, the house & boatshed
 
where Alex & Penny lived & where Claire (née Chris),
& I, visited them — & slept in sleeping bags
 
with the fog, that penetrated their house,
around us — in 1951? 1972?  My once
 
best friends — with whom I never fell out
(they moved to England —
 
just as Gough got elected —
a kind of irony, then, they felt) who live
 
now in Tasmania, somewhere:
Claire will know
 
 
I remember, walking there, solo — so
how? why? drunk —
 
I’d drunk much of a bottle
of Marsala, thinking it might be
 
mescal.  (I had read & re-read
Under the Volcano.)
 
 
I remember — sober, surely —
rowing with Alex & Penny &
 
nee Christine across that lake.  Quite
a long way, to get home from dinner at a pub
 
(so maybe not so sober, after all)
before dark — bright, grey-white sky,
 
lowering cloud — & very blistered
hands.  I’d never rowed before,
 
young, healthy, embarked.
Tho, in my case certainly, knowing not very much
 
 
Claire & me — Alex & Penn’
 
 
Diethnes — the Balkan —
where I also ate very often,
 
 
introduced  by Penny & Alex.
 
The cook died face down
on the grill: that was the legend.
 
Could it be true?  You would
see him there as you looked thru the window
 
year after year, steam rising from the onions.
 
I quite liked him.
 
I was thrown out once
(face down in my food)
 
 
Anna, Lila
 
Sal
 
 
‘Omaha’ — the tugs —
 
now that name always makes me think
of the beach landing at Normandy,
 
where Americans died —
 
& of cargo pants & DC2s
(& a Brainard cartoon)
 
(I have no idea which —
when I return to the poem.)
 
Nick, who cooked at Diethnes
while his wife ran front-of-house,
 
began as a Chinese cook down in Haymarket somewhere
in the war years. 
 
Diethnes had very deep windowsills
on the interior of all its windows,
 
including the many false windows (which were murals
painted, to show simple scenes, window views, or maybe show shuttered windows.
 
Why didn’t I pay more attention?)  The sills
stemmed from the 6 o’clock closing era.
 
Drinkers, expelled from all the pubs, would come to the restaurant,
order a basic meal, & stand with their new, legal drink
 
balanced on one of these tiny ‘bars’, the place quite full.
(I think the windows showed schematic sea & sky.  I’m sure
 
one or two of them had a painted vase depicted
as ‘on’ the window sill.)
 
The new, young waiter — waiter-cum-cook —
took against me when I claimed not to have ordered moselle.
 
He’d opened it already & there must have been something said
when he brought it back.  I’d have ordered riesling — or hock, which you could
 
still get at the time.  He was very down on me, & remained so.
It was a surprise when I met him twenty years after
 
& his face was suddenly wreathed in smiles.  He’d forgotten.
 
Thank god.  When I next came his son was in charge. 
(Late in the 70s the restaurant
 
had moved across the road from where it used to be:
to it’s present site — underground.  History.)
 
 
Poem (What’s Best)
 
Actually, a
week into work — after
the holidays
 
                        (the
weekend
               . . .  &
Monday off) —
 
& finally
I am relaxed
 
happy even
 
                        at what?
tho that is what’s best
about it 
                — that funny
flower
            that
grows outside my window
for one
 
associated now
with a particular friend,
 
Cath beside me, reading,
writing,
             kids at home, in
the back room
watching a movie  
             (Anna  
                          Gabe)  
                                        — their
disputes so loud &
quickly resolved —
                                       (Hayley,)
(Alex
              — the neighbouring kid —
still a child
while the others are grown.
                                                               )
 
                                        The flower
is a yellow, creamy
white
              a bell
inside which is
a jam-red
stamen
 
              enough
to point up
the translucent white
surround. 
                     The shrub has
sometimes two or
three flowers —
usually one, or none —
and not always open.
 
Cool weather, after a week in the 40s
the breeze moving through the room
 
via the windows
                                 opened out
— into the yard,
the street —
 
The street light —
                                 moonlike,
(except that it is
always there — & like
a book design you
hardly notice)
 
(a streetlight
                           on the cover of a
book by Celine, in fact.
 
                                 That I
had once. 
                       Do I have it
still?)
 
              I think ‘moon-’
(rather than ‘street-light’) —
 
until we
go to sleep,
 
and then it
peers in
— too bright —
 
so unvarying it is
not the moon —
 
though I go to sleep.  No
mozzies tonight.  My little
new fan, secondhand, a
Hecla ("By Hecla it’s good!"
their slogan in the 60s).  It
runs  — silent. 
                        The lines,
of Cath’s — pages
of type,
held up in front of her —
 
they parallel the broader
black & white
of the top she wears —
 
bought in Italy,
knitted. 
 
                            My feet
are bare, uncovered,
on the bed, the
bottom sheet a
pale crème de menthe —
the top one a ‘scrawl’ of
white cotton — from
the days of heat
before — how it looks now.
 
Cath puts out her light —
just me now & the benevolent
streetlight coming thru the bamboo
 
darker cloud
massing near the moon,
the wind coming up
to rustle the bamboo
tinkle the distant wind chime in the kitchen
 
then I go — open or close
windows, drink a glass
of water —
look,
from the bed, for the streetlight,
the moon — will
one have supplanted
the other?
2.30                                               
for Alan Wearne, whom “at my back I always hear” 
Reading in the dust jacket I see James Schuyler
is 67. 
 
Retsina is my drink
sitting at my desk    2 am
 
the morning of the day to come
the cool change having arrived
 
after temperatures of 39 and 43.  I slept
early tonight.  I slept at work today — 
 
& at work last night.
I go there for the cool:
 
— It’s closed: there’s no work ‘on’ —
& use the computer.  This year
 
Rae will be fifty-one.
(Alan told me.)  I’ll be 42.
 
Other people’s years surprise me more.
I know my own. 
 
Though I forgot — thought I was forty
for quite some time.  I must
 
ring mum. 
 
(What for, to ask my age?  No,
to say hullo.)
 
All of this unhurried — I
sense no ticking. 
 
The poems of Schuyler catch time as movement, as
fluid, graceful, beautiful —
 
and quick. 
 
They don’t suggest much agency I guess.
I am not going to judge him.
 
My mother.  I wonder how
she is.  We are not close.
 
I have not seen her much since I was eleven.
Probably I love her anyway.  (Surprise, surprise.) 
 
She is light, & blonde, &  physically  maybe
not tenacious.  I don’t want her
 
to be ill.  She dresses in beige, & nougat,
whites —
 
I wonder if she is an Air sign?
 
I could go & find
one of the women’s magazines around the house
 
& see what sign
January is.
 
I want her to live forever. 
 
My dad is more substantial.  I don’t
want him to die either —
 
but because I see him more,
I can see it coming.  My body,
 
perhaps, is more like his.  There is
no basis in this. 
 
One time I sat behind her in the car. 
An extraordinary number of facial gestures
 
& things she did to her
face, with her hands,
 
were mine exactly. 
 
I hear Michael come down the hall
& out the front door.
 
This means he is standing, looking
across the road — where I see
 
only dark, an indistinct road sign, the sense of leaves,
& some gleam from a car.  I say
 
“Hullo Michael,”
in case he is there — & he comes round to my window,
 
naked, his body warm & brown
holding a towel & a glass of water.
 
He is nice.
 
We say some usual things, & he goes back to bed.  “Having a bit of a write?” he asks. 
 
I say, “Yep.
Nice when it comes.”
 
The expression theory of art.
 
No comment.  Or, that was a comment.
And comment enough. 
 
I am glad to be doing it. 
 
Michael’s mother
is ill.  And James Schuyler’s mother
 
died, in one of the later poems. 
I am
 
‘of that age’. 
I guess.  Though
 
I have always been interested in time.  The time 
is now — I look over my shoulder, at the
 
Public Service clock, stolen for me
by Gary Oliver all those years back — I just
 
put batteries in it this morning — it’s said nine
o’clock for months now — 2.30. 

 

“A Few Days                   
 
Are all we have.  So count them as they pass.
        They pass too quickly,”
says Jimmy Schuyler.
                                             Today began not so well,
but at first I think of Anna tonight humming at
        ten years of age
a Sonny Boy Williamson song — that she has
        picked up from me — I’m so proud ‘!’  Well, ‘amused’ —
I hum it too & we dance for a bit.  Earlier,
        Cath, Anna & I go out for coffee — something
Sweet — & meet, fortuitously, George & Carlo —
        George (Georgina) with her second son
at the coffee shop of tout
        le monde — ‘tout’,
anyway, of this part of the world.  Not like
        Rundle Street, where the action
really is.  King William Road — Hyde Park — is for the
        stiffer gentry — &,
for their rich children, a near-enough-to-home
        amenity.  Well, it
does for us.  Before that Anna & Cath played
        flute together.
Thinking back, I realize,
        the day started with a ride into town, the paper,
then the attempt to use the bromide machine, whose
        complexities, now, no one understands —
& nor did I.  Old technology.  A skill
        I had once, forgotten.
After that I came home, showered, calmed down
        & set to some final odds & ends —
a date with the printers, some time —
        in
the next few weeks — details of design: that I love.
        I worry: the imagery is
too American — tho it’s not exclusively — & I
        shuffle images around.
As I work I listen to Crab’s band,
        The Cocktail Hour they were called — or
more precisely Crab’s Cocktail Hour   circa  1985
        with its endless, demented patter between every
song, that reaches high points of cynicism,
        frankness, disinterested bile, disinterested
curiosity even — & surprised-by-joy discovery, where
        Crab & Arnold say things that surprise even them
& are amused.  As well, the band are at cross purposes
        never has the word “shutup” been so much used.  It
‘all works out for the best’ in a terrific finale
        where Crab makes a speech that parodies
an impromptu MC at a bingo party thanking
        all for coming & putting
the ‘best face on things’.  Nights at Lark & Tina's
        really were — to quote one of the band's
chosen preoccupations for the night —
        A Long Day’s Journey Into Night.
Really a long night working to dawn — rapport
        between band & audience
(like the love between Liz & Richard
        in Virginia Woolf) acknowledged finally with the
last two songs & the encore. 
        We knew
we’d lived another day &, en route, had seen some Real Life.
Nightclubs made me uncomfortable — they still do —
        I’m was lucky to be introduced
by Mary & Micky & Crab
        to that particular scene.  My friends in
Sydney & Melbourne never saw it.  And it was only that
        one club, that one band.  (Speedboat
was musically superior, yes, but was much less about values.
        Or they were more purely musically expressed? —
with the same personnel, the Cocktail Hour was a tour of duty,
        the whole experience.)  Anyway, I experience them again,
two or three times over, in the afternoon, in my room, down the
                                                back,
        gluing this, drawing that, looking
for useable images, noting corrections.  This magazine
        will be ready.  Cath comes home
with the Banana, who watches television, demands food,
        borrows a pencil for her homework, while Cath sits
reading on the lounge near her, calm.  Dinner, &
        then the flute thing.  The night is nearly over
because we’ve managed all on the same night for a change
        to be tired together
& hit the bed early — tho Gabe comes in, lateish,
        from the other house (his father’s).
But goes to bed, quickly.  Only I
        am up late, scribbling.  A letter to Pam
to write, maybe, a letter to another poet.  James
        Schuyler to read.  Crab to ring — to-
morrow.
        Mary I should ring or see more often.  And
Dave, whose daughter died.  I wrote — late enough —
        to say I’d visit, & haven’t still.
I live on the other side of what is only a very small city.
        Large enough to come between us.
I am going to ease myself
        into my usual state of anxiety.
Ah, equilibrium, you have found me!  Mildly
        Crazed, mildly happy — happier, really, than that.
I turn off the light.
 
 
 
(Monday) Hullo, Pam  
                                            
"and the arts shall march in the very van" — Saint-Simon
 
 
Skinny poem today? — why not,
      tho there's nothing in the tank,
bar some
 
      abstract ‘energy’. 
I am reading tonight
      with the enemy —
 
well,
      the heartless competition
& must read well, give
 
no quarter,
      seem to exist
among other criteria exactly.
 
      But, Pam, dull palookas, mostly —
no trouble.  But
      now, I must ‘get to work’:
 
 an essay for some artists
      describing their show — its necessity,
 beauty & weirdness
 
      absolute surprise, etcetera.
 They like the draft so far
      — they would —
 
& I do like the show
      so I haven't had
 to dissimulate too painfully.
 
      Sarah's stuff I know &
 Matt's — really
      I know them all
 
Except Scott.
      How long
have I been
 
      missing him — or seeing
only what is atypical
      so it slips from the memory?
 
And Christian Lock:
      I've stared at a few,
very hard —
 
      & liked them
& liked the problematic
      they seem to live with,
 
carelessly.  What-me-worry!  Carelessness, in-
      souciance,
their quality.  Four
 
      hundred dollars —
which I will take to DJ's, buy new shoes. 
      Shod another year.  (Five,
 
if I get them mended on schedule.)
 
         A firm basis on which
to march
         “in the very van”
 
                                           ha  ha
& write the skinny poem, for Pam
 
(ha ha) it wouldn't be about
         art reviews
 
— not that she's against them —
         art or art reviews —
but that I never talk about them
 
         with her concentration —
nor
         (even more to the point)
 
as if they're part of real life.
         The occasion 
of writing is.  The
 
         experience
of the art is.  So why?
         I'm moving further away from it
 
like it less often —
         realize
it's not my game, my irrelevance to it
 
         something like that,
or like those things —
         tho this is to stab at the problem,
 
without much care for accuracy. 
         Some I care about a lot:
I never required
 
         that I should count to the artists
(he said nobly)
         Nice, tho, when you did.
 
         But I write it less — with less
mission.  I like the stuff less often, too.
         My ideas were out of fashion
 
Ten years before I found them
         & then I developed them, a little,
with others equally unfashionable
 
         which made for a kind of rigour,
or the ‘feeling’ of it — & a fall-back position
         of a more forgiving, but
 
less approving, accommodation: good
         cop, bad cop.  Tho I think I avoided
the critic as Police.
 
         The artists began to seem less serious — or
the art ‘world’. 
         Some of the artists were, of course —
 
(serious)
 
         & ‘were’, on levels I wasn't
relaxed about, or attuned to, but came to see, finally.
         So, no art criticism.  For you, Pam. 
 
The everyday then?  Monday
         is our most everyday day
one we both have off.  So Cath & I
 
         shop, walk the dog, have lunch together
we boiled some artichokes for lunch — something
         we first did in Rome.  Pietro told us how. 
 
We caught the bus
         to the Pasadena Coles (or Big W?)
Did he actually say “You boil the shit out of them”?
 
He may have, his English was quite Australian.
 
         As a young music student in Rome
he was befriended by an Australian composer.
         Meale?  The owner of the only Schoenberg records
 
in the city
         & something of an inspiration, or model, for Pietro —
a model for bravery & isolation maybe —
 
fortitude, anyway, that Pietro evinced
         as a more or less black-balled practitioner —
after a university student-occupation.
 
         We took our shopping trolleys — the two-wheel
sort (one folds up & can
         go in the other). 
 
         Then we caught the bus home again. 
 
I walked the dog earlier,
         while Cath slept — as
she hadn't, properly, the night before.
 
         I read at intervals Bolano's book
The Savage Detectives — which I like: it's
         So shaggy-dog as a principle
 
yet, ‘in principle’,  so much more serious
         or solemn, a solemnity
it pokes fun at — the solemn dignity
 
         of Latin American Literature
the nobility, idealism, corruption, futility
         ineffable sweetness  etc etc
 
of its imaginary.  (A word
         that should be capitalized — but I can't bear
that ‘Theory’ should enter in, be
 
         allowed in, here. 
 
Tho in principle
         (what a principled poem!), you know, like
Let the discourses mingle…
 
         Let the flowers bloom,  etcetera
 
I sort of don't like a word with a limited life
         to crawl in, … presuming, I guess,
my poem will outlive it.  Fat chance?  May be. 
 
         The other days are ‘everyday’ — in the sense
that they are unvarying —
         but have less individuality about them:
 
I ride to work, have time to think & read or write,
         a bit,
before work.  Then I work — & ride home.
 
         Things happen.  Sure.  And I have the odd idea —
or plenty of ideas —
         because people think
 
& at work I'm alone most of the day, so my head
         is where I'm at.
The same head every day.  Monday
 
         I get off that loop.  I chopped wood a bit
today, which was fun &
         Moved washing around
 
In an attempt to get it dry.  A CIA man says
         on TV
the war in Iraq is lost.  Has
 
         been lost for some time
was never going to be won with so few troops deployed
         etcetera.  Which the world has known
 
for a few years now.  When did
         the CIA find out, I wonder?  A free & frank
disclosure from the CIA — or even Bush —
 
what a funny idea!  I don't want to talk this crap, either
         — here —
or use the word “crap” much, if it comes to that.
 
         Ah, The Purity Of Diction
 
         In English Verse — is that where I'm headed?
The day was clear, “beautiful” (in
         inverted commas, but really, too)
 
We were happy.  Cath swam, the dog barked
         (asked me to play with it, & I did —
she ran & hid for a second, then remembered
 
         she liked to be chased & came out)
& I chased her, cut the wood, read
         Bolano.  You?
 

 
Outdoor Pig-keeping, 1954 & My Other Books on Pigs  
 
Pig Farming. Methods Of 
was a book I wrote in 1945
tho what I knew then of
pig farming you may wonder.  It is
a human enough activity.
I mean ‘universal’ — did they have
pigs on Easter Island, the New Guinea
highlands, did the Maori?  Virgil
knew about pigs, tho I associate him, more,
with bees, my Latin education centering
on a limited number of texts —
bits of Caesar’s Gallic Wars
or Punic Wars (“Carthago delenda est”?)—
& not much else.  Virgil.  Ideas of
pig farming might be innate. (?)
Where do correct ideas come from?
“The head, boss.”  Pigs pretty much
know what they want (isn’t that
often thought to be the problem,
the thing held against them?),
give it to them.  “Long pig” was somehow
special dark knowledge when I was
a schoolboy, I mean the term.
A human dish.  (No one else ate it,
except the odd lion or tiger —
as a one-off: humans also
protect their own — better probably not
to eat them too often.)  But, to return
to the term, “long pig” implies knowledge
of “pig plain” sure enough.  It seemed
insulting, to me, back then — to the idea
of the human & humanity & I didn’t like
to utter it.  I remember once
someone telling me of an abandoned
hippy farm where they’d been producing
heroin.  The pigs were fed
on scraps & excrement
& were squealing.  Addicted.
Apparently the noise was horrible.  I did,
at some time, sleep near where a pig
— or pigs — squealed all night. I can’t remember
now whether it was simply very affecting
or whether it was specifically because it sounded
human.  It was loud, incessant & frightened.
I can’t remember where or when.  An
abattoir.  In 1945
I had not read Virgil.  I do know that.
It seems we’ve passed this way before.  In
‘another life’ I may have been a pig farmer:
I see me, late at night at a plain kitchen table
writing Pig Farming, Methods Of.  It’s
electric light — tho it could do with a stronger
bulb.  I write it in a child’s school exercise book.
My only daughter has died?  It’s hers, hardly used,
& I turn it round & start at the back? — or maybe
continue right on from where she left off.
She had been studying & had written amo, amas,
amat etc.  The vocabulary list begins with
“agricola” — farmer.  As I see it the farmer
does not become especially sentimental about
the exercise book.  He may have done, must
have done, at some time since his daughter’s death,
but now he writes.  Perhaps he writes with
extra care because it is her book.  Perhaps he writes
because it is her book.  He has not written
anything else before.  He writes now
because she is gone.  She was the future
& he was content to work to see her through —
to her adult life.  But now she is gone
he must make something else.  He is a widower.
I was brought up by my own father,
alone, me & my sister.  We kept dogs & cats
& pigeons, a horse.  No pigs.  Anyway,
there it is, & it has my name on it, 1945 — Pig Farming,
Methods Of. 
 
 
 
Some nights & days
 
I can hear
                 rain on the roof
                             scattered windy gusts
 
of it, till it becomes
                 more steady. 
                             This means I cannot go
 
& look at the moon —
                 which I saw
                             last night,
 
looking full,
                 as I rode home,
                             the same day I had read
 
in the Larkin biography
                 something about how, older,
                             you look at it & it means
 
much less than it did
                 but which
                             it still means  
 
to someone, somewhere.  To me
                 it can always look any of — great 
                             sharp, pitiless, hard, rocky,
 
soft — piercingly sad, charmingly —
                 butteredly — cheering & optimistic
                             sometimes at the same time
 
sometimes not — but the repertoire
                 of identifications comes up
                             regularly
 
none have ceased
                 to be available
                             or to take their turn.
 
Like a favourite record, or CD.
 
I wonder
                 if I am the first
                             to compare the moon to a CD.   Hm.
 
In a minute I will make a
                 cup of tea & banana sandwich.
 
                             The moon looks far better
 
than a CD, of course.  Another pioneering
                 phrase!  I am not so young that they
                             have, for me, much emotional impact — the sight
 
of them, I mean — like records have — tho that too
                 has begun to drain away, with the knowledge
                             they will disappear — Sand collapsing down
 
the neck of an hourglass.
 
                 —  As the time for vinyl
                             starts running out, the black disks
 
begin to look like old technology,
                             less like miracles. 
 
                                   Christ, what
a way to spell “miracles”!  (Fixes
                              mistake)
 
                        Well,
now I can go & look at the moon.  (The
                 rain has stopped.)  — Though,  I guess I won’t.
 
I once wrote a poem about
                 smoke?  cloud?  fog?
                             pressing against my windows
 
as it began to grow light: I don’t think
                 I was ever sure what the phenomenon was.
                             And I wrote the poem in stanzas of
 
three lines the second of each
                 being the second line of one of
                             the poems I had chosen randomly
 
from a poet I liked.  It was
                 a loopy procedure — a ‘mediating device’ —
                             thru which to apprehend the reality
 
outside, though I liked the result.  I remember
                 the room I wrote it in —
                             or the two rooms — the kitchen & lounge room —
 
in one of which I wrote it — the latter,
                 I’m sure.  “Just write great first lines — an
                             endless rolling, of smoke across my window”
 
was how it began.  I think.  First lines
                 never were my specialty.  Though one more
                             good line wouldn’t hurt — & why not
 
the first?  The newspaper TV program
                 across which is the pad I’m writing on
                             features the by-line photograph of a columnist —
 
taken from below, so he stares out
                 above one, over one’s head, with ‘far-seeing eyes’
                             the whacker — he must’ve done it deliberately
 
as no other columnist would, certainly
                 none of the women, & the guy across from him,
                             Errol Simper, seems simply concerned
 
to annihilate
                 the associations of his name (he looks
                             a Hollywood Nazi — grim, grim, grim). 
 
The other (the ‘idiot’)
                 is Phillip Adams. 
                             I read the column: it
 
is idiotic too — anything but visionary
                 or even thoughtful — about pirates!  I decide
                             to read the Simper.  From experience (I occasionally
 
do read him) I know it will be more densely argued.
                 (Again, the problem — the spur of the name.)  I wonder
                             what he says?  I read it — or begin — & realize
 
I did read it,
                 just a few minutes previously. 
 
                             The wind is blowing outside now
 
hard & rainless — a door or window
                 rattles occasionally, & a piece of tin makes that
                             ‘billowing’ sound.  The trees register the wind
 
constantly, as if, beyond the glass,
                 they are under water: shrubs the light from
                             this room catches bend & rock in a way
 
that seems ‘troubled’ — like autistic rocking — though
                 with plants we don’t mind we can enjoy
                             our attributions, or give in to them —
 
feel sorry for ourselves, fretful & worried
                 or simply safe to be indoors.  (That’s something
                             I did right — stayed inside!)  There is a letter
 
to Miriel to write, letters to others, too.  There is
                 the Journal, of this nut, Allen Ginsberg.  I tried
                             to ring Sal this morning — got Jane
 
instead — Pam & Jane’s number just below hers      
                 in my address book — I couldn’t tell what was
                             happening.  Luckily Jane knew my voice, so
 
we talked.  Then I rang Sal:
                 & talked to her answering machine. 
                             Pam rang earlier tonight.
 
                        One effect
 
                                         of working so full time is
                 that hours of work-time go past & I can
                             hardly remember them, even 15 minutes after
 
Instead, my life seems to consist only of those
                 moments ‘outside’ — so, recalling the last few days
                             I can remember the fact that I went to work —
 
& mostly writing these letters, & thinking while I write
                 them — brief moments at the coffee shop
                             before work or at lunch hour (half-hour) — &
 
drinks with Crab tonight.  Is this the Life Of The
                 Mind?
                             Is it, huh?
 
                                         Crab is told by
                 John McConchie “not to be Utopian” in response
                             to his complaint about ... his work situation (what
 
is it? — don't ask) as if to complain
                 signals complicity with something
                             worse than what one complains against.  Mc
 
Conchie / is / “Wrong Again”.   So the space between
                 writing to Becky, the calls to Pam, the letter to Pam,
                             Kurt’s arrival (I speak to his answering machine, too)
 
& this morning — where in 20 minutes at the coffee shop
                 I look at mail: poems sent (& stories)
                             & make my editor’s note on their envelopes “No,
                                                    merely” & “No, but
 
read again” — is telescoped: is my life being freezedried
                 by one in another Universe,
                             is this how you feel
 
as a coffee bean
                 becoming Instant Coffee? 
 
                             I am so drunk, from drinking with Crabby,
 
I decide
                 to stop writing. 
                             Now, I read the Robert Pincus-Witten
 
Review, a reprise of his 'time' at Artforum. 
                 — With different allegiances, with a different
                             version of his allegiances (only the names
 
have been changed), I would feel I was portrayed — I say Yes,
                 “in a way.  Yes.”  But, I dislike, or am already distanced
                             from, some of his evaluations — Yes, I am similarly
                                                     placed,
 
vis a vis similarly placed oppositions   (tho something is
                 forgotten . . .
                                                      etc  etc
 
                                                                  quibble  quibble)
 
Apparently I am not
                 Robert Pincus-Witten.
 
                             Surprise! —
 
                                                     Anyway, I don’t write to Miriel,
I write to Becky, or try to.  I am too tired.  TonightQueen of the Hills
for Sarah-Jane Norman
You would like it here, a wet dream of alpine anachronism. I 
can just imagine Tim in phenomenological paroxysms; the 
red of his hair like a real fox, not the local henna. All I do is 
walk up and down the mountain each day, while the 
“coolies” carry fridges. Sometimes a young drug dealer 
walks beside me whispering “fucky, fucky?” and rubbing his 
nipple. Schoolgirls also grab my hands and speak with such 
grandiloquent diction that I feel I’m in some Bollywood 
Sound of Music. I’ve learnt not to be so picky about fruit and 
eat bananas with skins that are almost black, though I still 
buy more than I eat and just watched the persimmons rot. 
Out my window are neo-gothic housing blocks with turrets 
and views of the valley. Up on The Mall you can see snow 
capped peaks, even the sublime now haunted by ecological 
horror. You’ve beaten me to the Katoomba equivalent and 
your mum will be spreading her Pakistani rugs on those 
floors. Residencies are also a bit of a durational 
performance, warped as colonialism and wood panelling. 
Let’s start a new genre romance sans Sahib. I would take you 
to the chai and sweets shop downstairs where we’d sit 
wrapped in fine pashminas: chapped lips, nose bleeds, but 
breathing like never before.
 


Shimla
for Jane Shadbolt
You have been my ghost lover, my erstwhile companion as I 
walk through the conifers; the ferns making me think of the 
Dandenongs writ large and the single gauge tracks a steam 
train ride I went on as a kid. Yes, I should be here waiting 
for you constructing pinhole cameras and experimenting 
with optical effects, if not spirit photography. I’m living out 
the mise en scene for a live stop-motion animation, a 
disconcerting syncopation making me glide up the hill. The 
“Boom Shiva” buses ply around blind corners, with women 
in saris spewing out the window. The monkeys have 
abscessed arses, but the langurs fly from branch to branch 
with aplomb. A stray dog takes a fancy to my crotch and I 
have to shoo it away. The campus is in a stone building 
haunted by European orphan girls at their sewing machines. 
All these nineteenth century institutions squirreled away in 
mountains — I can imagine Dario Argento really getting his 
rocks off. Or perhaps this is to be a romance; I’ll meet you at 
the station in my salwar suit, my scarf on backwards trailing 
behind. But, for now, I sit alone in The Park Café, slowly 
sipping masala chai and listening to the best collection of 
cassettes I’ve seen in decades. The Mahavishnu Orchestra or 
is it Jethro Tull? Both will make it on the soundtrack, or the 
mix tape’s hand-written insert.poetry of the bitter end

OňatikoHappy Valley:
A Lament for a landscape about to be mined
“The connectivity of the area will be disrupted by the 
presence of the mine, but will be restored across the two 
pits as the area revegetates. Overall the present vegetation 
has a high degree of naturalness. Those areas that are to 
be mined and rehabilitated will lose their naturalness for 
a long period of time.”
We stand on the divide.
Two catchments —
one to the north,
the other to the south.
The red marker is the edge of the road.
Here is where the pit will be.
A third of the valley will remain,
and the tussock.
The pond won’t be filled
but the larger, over the rise,
will make way for the road.
“The Happy Valley landscape character area is in a 
natural and unmodified state. It is well-defined visually, 
and appears as a distinctive sub-unit within the wider 
plateau landscape. It has a high natural character, 
amenity and intrinsic values.”
They have an eye for a suitable place.
Once they would have built an abbey here,
now they dig a pit for coal.
They did it to valleys in Wales
and in Yorkshire where
they fouled the waters of the River Aire
at Castleford.

But that was in the old world.
This has just begun;
it’s too innocent for spoiling.
There’s nothing here that knows it can happen.
     Rock and river
     leaves and sun
     have work to do
     and only know to do it.
There are the birds —
they have no song for apocalypse.
Ask any questions of them
and silence is their silencing reply.
“The ability to replace soils and restore a topographic 
profile similar to what is present now, will aid in re-
establishing the naturalness of this area.”

An older world would read the signs,
and reply with adventitious weeds
drought disrupted drainage dust
slips smells faults and
protected archeological sites,
but here?
It’s remote,
no sounds of pain will carry
to call help.
Perhaps it has a tutelary soul.
The glades of Greece had nymphs,
yet they’re now desert;
English woods had fairies,
and they’re gone;
Ireland too —
there’s only remnant left.
Is there something here that’s real
for defence?
Ask it,
ask this place
this suitable place,
ask the species —
the 23 birds
      3 lizards
snails and invertebrates
      1 bat
all the insects
rats opossums hares
       koura
the 80 dicot trees and shrubs
       72 dicot herbs
       29 sedges and rushes
       10 grasses
       8 orchids
       10 other monocots
the 23 ferns
       14 mosses
       13 lichens
and 28 liverworts
“Even 50% remaining is well above the threshold 
considered desirable for the conservation of biodiversity 
within an ecological district.”
Ask today,
while the sun shines;
be quiet,
and you will hear in silence:
the weta and the gecko,
all the birds, the leaves,
the sky-blue orchid by the creek
say:
       ‘We go with you to destruction,
       but the seed of life remains.
       You demand coherence,
       Time is our defence.’

I Like It When The Sun Doesn’t Shine
To love a place unworthy of love
in July
When it rains and the lightning strikes
in fog
in cold and wet the mud is cold wood wet
This is the road that curls between the houses
to the moors that brown the water
These are the people that smoke themselves to sleep
They only talk when the sun comes out they walk
This is the bush that grows around the houses
Where once was rock there’s rubbish of a century
composting plastics bits of glass car and clothing scraps almost organic
Here is the fire in this dead calm it smokes
Here’s the car it must be towed it’s saturated
The tap that dribbles now it’s full of grit the filter’s fucked
The house my house with grey mould in the cupboard
                             the blanket’s blotched
                             the window gone last storm
                                                      you can’t cross the creek
                                                      there’s rock on the road
Then the sun comes out
                            — it glows it grows it steams it dries —
                           [turn it off!
                             there’s a switch somewhere —
                             some little icon
                             to be touched by a mouse]Peter and the Wolf
This story directly involves a cat and a bird.
The cat’s name is Colignon, he’s been living with us
for a few years. The rest doesn’t matter so much
and will matter even less in time when
the difference between beginning and end
fogs up.  We had just moved
to the new house a couple months earlier
and the bird (a little dove) only enters the story
because it was young enough to permit itself
to be the target of Colignon’s sharp claws,
the cat with whom we learned in due time
of love at its most negligent and filial.
I never exactly liked poetry, much less
Manuel Bandeira and little birds
but settling scores is costly and has
been costly — whether it’s with the cat or the books
doesn’t matter: it is a road that, for now,
has no return. Layer after layer of forgotten dates
or dates that are about to be forgotten under
points of view of people whom we may or
may not like (same difference)
until, with our loads, we reach the small
and deep abyss of how and why one day
we went numb. To think there will always be
some dove crossing my neighborhood sky,
to think that there always will be new houses
with people in them who more or less
love each other and more or less love their neighbor.
And to think all kinds of things.
But what really stays with me is the knowledge
that that little bird was only the first thing
to die in that house so firmly grounded
and with such a handsome cat.

Itinerary
In the plane you want me to close the window
but, see, my hands are tied.
Of all things, this wind strikes your face
for this wind is above all the image
you chose for your dead daughter, from which
you still don’t know how to release yourself.
However, we know — and with some certainty —
that resurrection as we had conceived of it
is just an unlikely hypothetical. And so it may be necessary
to choose between patience and haste. And for now
you are the one responsible for differentiating one from the other.
At this point the stewardess is startled by the wind,
but she doesn’t know what to do either. See,
my hands are tied, she says, let me call
the captain. But the captain doesn’t come.
It resembles sadness but is less subtle because it doesn’t end
and so what we recognize as happiness
in some way proves itself atavic and discontinuous.
Does anyone want to change seats? You, it seems,
are distracted by a few of my remarks on
an Isabel Allende book having to do with something or other.
In this case tears are a minor detail.
Mine represent the closest I have ever gotten
to what my father calls disinterested love.
Yours is the clearest image I have ever had
of what we’ve come to know as — pardon the expression —
an open wound. The wind dishevels all of your long
hair and thoughts, as the plane in which we
are, crosses an ocean of descriptive certainties.

Everything I Have Is Yours
When I wrote Do you know the way
to San Jose, there were a few flourishes
in the arrangement that didn’t make the final cut
recorded by Dionne Warwick in 1968.
The most noteworthy of these was perhaps
a small break in the rhythm midway
through the song, further indicated by a
note change from three trumpets that were,
at that time, filling blank spaces.
Although quick, that break always reminded
me of when my father used to take me
to a bar half a mile from our house,
the chords of a piano I would never hear again.
Now, years later, when I play Do you
know the way to San Jose, I think
of my father. The song I wrote certainly
doesn’t tell of this, the suspicion both
fitting and unreasonable that keeps us apart
from our own. A damp old chill that,
as I was later to realize, from action to stall
lasts no more than a few seconds.

Pedro e o logro
Esta história envolve diretamente um gato
e um pássaro. O gato chama-se Colignon,
mora conosco há alguns anos. O resto
importa pouco ainda mais daqui a um tempo
quando a diferença entre início e fim
se esfumaçar. Tínhamos nos mudado
para a casa nova há menos de dois meses
e o pássaro (uma rolinha) só entra na história
porque fora jovem o suficiente para ter sido
alvejado pelas unhas afiadas do Colignon,
felino com quem aprendemos em tempo devido
o amor em seu registro mais negligente e filial.
Nunca gostei exatamente de poesia, muito
menos de Manuel Bandeira ou passarinhos
mas acertar as contas custa caro, tem custado
– seja na direção do gato seja na dos livros
não importa: trata-se de um caminho por ora
sem retorno. Camadas de datas esquecidas
ou por esquecer sob pontos de vista de gente
que podemos ou não gostar (dá no mesmo)
até chegarmos com o acúmulo ao pequeno e fundo
abismo do como e porquê um dia nos embrutecemos.
E pensar que haverá sempre rolinhas cruzando
o céu do meu bairro. E pensar que haverá
sempre casas novas de gente que mais ou menos
se ama e ama o próximo. E pensar tanta coisa.
Mas o que me impressiona mesmo é saber
que o passarinho foi apenas a primeira
coisa a morrer naquela casa nova bem
presa no chão e com um gato tão bonito.

No avião você quer que eu feche a janela,
mas, veja, as minhas mãos estão atadas.
Este vento atinge sobretudo seu rosto
porque este vento é sobretudo a imagem
que você escolheu da sua filha morta e
da qual você não sabe ainda como se desfazer.
No entanto sabemos – e com alguma segurança –
que a ressurreição como queríamos é apenas
uma hipótese distante. Daí que talvez seja preciso
escolher entre paciência e pressa. E por enquanto
é você a responsável por diferenciar uma da outra.
Neste instante a aeromoça se assusta com o vento,
mas também não sabe o que fazer. Veja,
minhas mãos estão atadas, diz ela, vou chamar
o comandante. E o comandante não vem.
Parece tristeza, mas é menos sutil porque não termina
e então aquilo que reconhecemos como felicidade
de alguma forma se mostra atávico e descontínuo.
Alguém quer trocar de lugar? Você, parece,
se distrai com alguns comentários meus sobre
o livro da Isabel Allende que fala disso e daquilo.
Nesse caso as lágrimas são mero detalhe.
As minhas representam o mais perto que já cheguei
do que meu pai chama de amor desinteressado.
As suas são a visão mais nítida que já tive daquilo
que conhecemos por – me perdoe a expressão –
ferida aberta. O vento desarranja todo o seu longo
cabelo e seus pensamentos, como o avião em que
estamos, atravessa um oceano de certezas descritivas.

Quando fiz Do you know the way
to San Jose, preparei algumas variantes
que acabaram ficando de fora da versão final,
gravada em 1968 por Dionne Warwick.
A mais importante delas talvez tenha sido
uma pequena quebra de andamento
mais ou menos na metade da música,
indicada sobretudo por uma mudança de nota
nos três trompetes que, naquele instante,
preenchiam os espaços em branco.
Isso, apesar de rápido, sempre me remetia
a um tempo em que meu pai me levava
ao bar a meio quilômetro da nossa casa.
As cordas de um piano que eu nunca mais
ouviria. Anos depois, toda vez que toco
Do you know the way to San Jose, penso
no meu pai. A música que fiz com certeza
não fala disso, a suspeita a um só tempo
oportuna e desacreditada que nos separa
dos nossos. Frio antigo e úmido que,
como depois percebi, da ação até a demora
não leva nem mesmo alguns segundos.

 Serapion
 
Like Murillo fallen from a ladder,
I have tumbled from my dream.
 
Pierced as surely as Sebastian,
eyes weary as a 7/11 @ 3am.
 
Then, after the catastrophe,
dawn: a waiter
 
@ a restaurant you can’t afford,
brings the cheque.
 
 
The Oversight Committee
  
Who was Ferris’ best friend?
The one handcuffed by ennui
while they gladhanded at the Cub's game
 
& one (or the other) zoning out
at the Chicago Institute of Modern Art
              like a bent copper on speed
cases to clear and the Chief getting jumpy.
 
That single face promenading
                          on La Grande Jatte
mashed up, superzooming into the Dane’s famous loon.
 
& so much depends
on just that moment when Dad’s cherry red 250
(clock wound back) jumps the chocks
reversing the wrong way
                          through the wall-to-ceiling glass
of a Frank Lloyd Wright garage.
 
Mr Speaker, I must interject, we had no oversight!
 
For the Stendahl syndrome on a sleet filled day
remembering the mad mazurka of a night
as chaotic as the valley Maccas after lockout,
a red sea of blood, booze, piss and blue paint.
 
& outside the grass is dying in the wind,
falling off a cliff of life
              like Callas’ last desperate hymn.
 


Gli Ultimi Zombi
                                   for Ezra
 
What it must be to be buried on an island
                                         of the dead like a character
in some Uwe Boll zombie rave up.
 
The back alleys stuffed to the ceiling
                                        with overpriced pepperoni pizzas
and the stench of fish soaking damp laundry.
 
On the Grand Canal the vaporetto lists
                                         a city park drunk stumbling
at every oversubscribed port of call.
 
Like cattle at the famous Roma sales
                                         the befuddled subjects adoringly
compliant servants to the tyranny of the viewfinder.
 


Ryanair from Rome 
 
you promised to read dante with four eyes.
was the ascent of woman really
                              jbt?
 
the colours fade but the spillage
of a holiday reminds me:
a poster for fronte del porto
postcards from tuscany gum for the plane.
 
there were mornings after nights
that i smoked too many cigarettes —
watched a hot air balloon rise over surrey,
              a freshly peeled kaleidoscopic mandarin.
it’s basket bright with dragon breath
above a frost dusted field.
 
still a child (a high schooler at graduation)
it segued over the horizon
in search of strawberries and champagne.
 
like breathe on a mirror
it’s departure leaves a question at the desk, asks:
could we really have been contenders?It’s here
 
Any minute now a pair of hands will crest the hill.
We’ll know, then,
when they’ve obscured the gloaming light.
Sheep eyes return to willow-wisps
and the barn owl’s call is really a child being eaten.
Turning a sudden corner, something small
and terrible is assuming a form
as when a sound, veined and fanged,
puts a cold and wet toe into the room.
Light follows, a long rectangle
from hallway to interior, where,
yellow, dust particles scatter indifferent to the confirmation.
Something which had been approaching.

 
Yard
 
Evening spider
             tiny emperor
Casts off on golden thread
over the field of grass.
Slowly
slowly the sky
the briery hedge and four dwarf shrubs
bruise black.
Shirts on the drying line harden
into nightshape.

 
The Day
 
Not
the sinking-stone worry
But the free memory of the day!
 
The pedal I push
is my foothold on morning,
beating the cannon, the creep
of a benign and faceless blank.
The words I mean to say
are running beside me rushing into the gutter. Others
have taken holiday to make villages
in the sand.
Come
Back. Words come back.
I want to intend,
to cleave the air with sure-foot.
Surely, wherever there is light,
people are growing their meanings.Agreement

Tür zum Nichts
(after Ivan Blatný)
 
The stillness so quiet here, decades pass
like spaceflight, naked and waiting.
I write down everything in notebooks ––
mind a little too blank sometimes,
listening to dust settle on the inner eye.
Once there were machines to keep watch,
now left to our own devices, like beasts
in fairytales –– metaphors of a child’s
wanting to be in the wrong, for the sake
of a punishment that proves all is as it
should be. Old man in his counting house,
keeping score, saying if you’re going
to beat your brains out you want to
do it with a clear conscience? Holding
a broken safety valve in the palm ––
at-the-end-of-the-mind, to communicate
telepathically with birds and mice.
Dimensions indicate width, depth, height.
Autumn, watching cut flowers die in
countless waiting room scenes with
crossword puzzles and annoyingly pre-
recorded faces, the medicated soft-shoe
shuffle of homonyms groping towards cure
in the white-walled confessional.
Deduced by methods not yet known,
garbage trucks undo the secret arrangement
of trash in the middle of the night.
Disturbances in ancient sedimentations.
Inert things grow more attentive,
TV antennae, bracken, barbed wire.
Ghosts of cosmonauts float in the sky.
 


Leon Paul Fargue
(for David Vichnar)
 
Morning coffee telekinesis –– inhaling that first dry cut
of grass, firemen in step, circling the park, glisten of sweat
in end-of-May weather. Another Copernican revolution
to scribble in books. Down in the station ––
the 8.49 northbound rattler. Cluny, heads clustered
under the awnings, a surface of botched light, impressionniste.
Cameras flash –– the grand old dame on her back
knees up, sighing, & God in lofty voice
shoos the picnickers from the deportation monument.
A kiosk, another coffee, vague wordparticles fission &
collide in the rivegauche of the brain tree.
The maculate daylight, lurching under cinema marquees,
a rat pissing in a blind alley, rue Saint Denis,
rough-legged, yellow-eyed, crotchless Pigalle.
Watching an undressed square of light
flicker on a wall. Afternoon, evening, the slide into entropy.
Quai Bourbon with bottled obscenities, talking
large into the night –– a flare beneath the river, sky
a frazzled windowpane. Lajeuneaméricaine, hiked skirts
below the bridge: Who’s there? A piece of graffiti
under lamplight says “failure makes possible.”
A face, footsteps in reverberating stutter:
this unended search to be satisfied –– hour-on-hour
circling the périphérique –– the same thing in the same place,
the grey tide, the discomfort of sleep.
 
 
Pictor Ignotus
(for David Malouf)
 
The conception is everything –– grown
     from a hostile mind like a city state
in a hot wilderness. Its curve and arc.
     Two men in the beginning performed
a simple act –– welding two girders
     together, then a third. A whole complex
of space –– Uffizi-garish, little
     Medicis volumising over it …
 
The procession of rooms –– the glopping
     monitors’ hum and buzz. Some primitive
Giotto’s Last Supper –– jungle-eyed,
     a caged figure mewling at its captors,
hook, tail, breast-mound and rude totemic line
     (“tantôt libre, tantôt rechercher”) ––
the miraculous Daughter of Fishes,
     fleshlipped, nightblue, shriving the horse-mackerel.
 
“Still glides the stream and shall forever glide.”
     Five thousand miles of platitude and not
one pale god to be seen. Nolan’s Burke, dead-
     eyed like some homicidal idiot,
stands sentry at the tomb of the unknown
     artist –– bark and red ochre, yellow,
white, a pair of sticks tied with possum gut
     to steer through subterranean weather.
 
Whoever said that art doesn’t conform
     to fact? A polaroid nude, the eye’s un-
bridled rut blacking-out a big money
     sunset, navy yards and warm chardonnay.
Or an artefact shaped from the stolen
     inner lives of appearances. These things
like maps of impending extinction: that
     procure such insurance against themselves.A line from Nick Cave 
Economics is boring. So 
 too are all those Star 
 Wars toys when / they’re 
 kept in the box. & boring
 
 is why even the live 
 bad-man black-dog bite 
 mix of Henry Kissinger 
 as he mounts his return 
 
 to Hollywood is now
 available in French for 
 free. How else to explain 
 the media visibility of 
 
 Chaos theory with its
 streaming versions of old
 cell phones being tossed
 into the trash? Beauty is 
 
 uncovered in the most 
 surprising of subjects — 
 the discovery of a new 
 food, a detailed snap-shot 
of online teen behavior —
but the duende is too fragile 
to survive the scraping off
of algae from those rocks 
 
 on which it lives. Pressure 
 to perform prevents proteins 
 from being made. Every 
 poem is the story of itself.
 
 
A line from Carl Gustav Jung
I need to finish 
 with a simple hook. 
 All I have left are 
 Efrem Zimbalist Jr. 
 
 & a jelly mold of 
 Machu Picchu. In all 
 disorder / a secret order.
 Rock, scissors, paper.
 
 
A line from Edna St. Vincent Millay
When rabbits die / they 
 give off subatomic 
 resonances that fluctuate 
 between String Theory 
 
 & casual rapper-chic. It’s
 a signature trait, constant
 across all rabbits in the uni-
 verse, & dubs the riddim
 
 up proper. Sometimes 
 a formula, a phrase remains
 when the rabbit has gone. In
 some vernacular versions
several phrases with a
favored rhythm may be
grouped together, formulae
identified by Gödel numbers,
words replaced with breathing
spaces.Then staple the envelope
shut. In oral verse-making
the display / means nothing. 
This is a typical score for a 10–15-minute piece by Marvo Men (click to enlarge).
Live improvisation at ConVersify Poetry Conference, Edinburgh 2011 (3:14): MP3Fugue
 
And then a sentence was erased
 
It wasn’t written on the scene that
There was a breeze
And a curtain,
All the numbers lying between them
                                aging along with them
 
Instead, a line was erased.
 
The way “Tuesday” has a meaning,
The way fingerprints on every storm door look familiar
Knocks around an ashtray
The letter’s demography was erased
 
That they had bought new cushions for the old chair
Was rumor confirmed
 
A blackboard could never be fully wiped black
 
And more new plans
A mundane pencil     with the square shapes it entails
         spoke in effaced words
 


Preparation
 
Still disc of a horror film
 
Someone stares at me from the third floor window
 
The wrapper is torn photo missing
             If everything else is set aside from midnight
                              This water hides
 
From every scratch
 
A cotton-stuffed crow
 
Covered with real feathers — a handful of sliced melon
            stares at me with their stone eyes
 
Two easy ropes make an effortless knot
 
 
I didn’t go anywhere last night 
 
I didn’t go anywhere last night
 
Medication; I am sick in the head
 
I slept last night doctor
my doctor slept last night in my head
I didn’t drink a drop
 
The artwork on the wall
 
Naked women and this Montreal blur sways to and fro nocturnal
in bright flames and purple, violet lights
 
The primitive artists
Up to my distaste their high heels
miniskirts and their fading away into shady motels
 
Insouciant white lines twelve-thirteen
scroll on waste paper
in the parking lot
 
Don’t do cocaine, I tell them —
Stare at the walls — the lewd curves of her waist
A bra is parking her car
A bra next to her
 
I dislike, saw my doctor yesterday
 
Sleep trouble!
 
I sleep for two hours
the night after, I sleep for two hours again
a night later, the stairs go down the fire exit
 
stairwell
 
the staircase in the back of my neck
 
trouble … doctor …
 
What brand of fag do you smoke anyway?
 
Anyway
 
I don’t see at all
 
I didn’t go anywhere last night
 
 
Magic Mushroom 
 
He said “shrooms”
 
Shrooms collected on our guilt from last night
 
A couch
Flees with our legs
A dawn-shaped Honda Accord leaves with our stomach
He gobbles sitting on the couch
 
A fountain under his neck
He keeps licking the chewing gum on its nipples —
Chewing, O how perfectly he shakes his jaws
while radio plays the street
 
Spiraling down to the edge of the belly button
and giggling, the radio
softly giggling from inside the couch
 
The night chuckles in our legs, stomach the fountain
 
We are without knottiness
 
 
Grid 
 
Lunatics give me suspicious looks
 
I shave my face, wear perfume
              and lunatics stare at me funny
 
A lonely cotton flakes about in the middle of the night
 
From this block to that —
Just a tiny piece, as though a ladder made of air
              in a ludo board
The psychopath who stepped on a snake and went south
 
Let’s talk about chemistry here! About that eerie sound he’d made —
 
Did the wind not pull my hair apart?
 
Here, we mean the motor that’s pumping mineral
Here, we thought about the Earth’s plates,
                                                      May be a seashore.
 
Did my shaved chick bring in this clean bathroom?
Did this shaved sink create the water tap?
 
When I put on perfume,
the lunatics can hear —
It’s raining,
All basin holes have spiraled to a halt
 


Tunnel 
 
The ball thrown from one hand has returned in the palms of many
 
A common plan in their faces
 
A vanished ion
 
Who is staring? There is no observer inside you
 
Rattled threads — one lip edge shoots inside the other —
 
The net flies after a flock of words
 
Leaves fall
 
More or else something leaves the cloud
 
 
Don’t mark
 
Green light on the handle
Yellow and red
 
Don’t mark
 
Let it sing
Let people gather uninvited
in your peptides,
And the hundred pigeons that engulf you —
 
A face has slowly rolled over to your next you,
And the face has not
 
The greasy pistons underneath sleep, the electron route
The comfy seat on top — the easy remark — “How come I want? I can only make a mess”
 
And my acids make me smile at it
Make love         put no name       use no word
After the circus
 
What sun will set here? Over sweet-wrappers and ticket stubs
littering back-lots where they upped stumps, over ground compacted
by slavish tread — here and back, and back and here — over the absent feet
of jeering laughing lost souls looking for a brighter boisterous light,
not this incomplete darkness, this half-light, evenfall, where you trip over
a tent peg and the fat clerk of your big toe turns black with morning.
Lingering amid the fairy lights’ candied glow hoisted on shooting galleries,
absorbed by laughing clowns, blind heads turning this way to that,
you watch noisome crowds, a-bye, long down gone, diminish and appear.
Mercilessly their hands feed the clowns, eyes on the main bet, the
big prize stuffed with cotton waste, the mechanics secreted away
under chipped paint colourful like the skin on the strongman’s arms
where an anchor drops into tides rising and falling muscled below.
You, slovenly kin of the carnival, watcher, gaper, groper, stay-at-home,
malingerer, do you feel the slow snarl of dismay, listening to the organ
grind out promises off-key, the tune familiar, run over effortlessly,
while you jump about amused, getting two bobs worth? You sit
beneath thick canvas, mesmerised by tumblers and contortionists,
by the mad jumping monkey dressed as Napoleon riding a mule’s back.
You listen to the three-fingered violinist fumble notes, a crippled crab
scuttle of her fingerboard burst with music, hollowed and thrown out.
You touch the hilt the sword-swallower offers and feel heartbeat on steel
slid cleanly from throat to chest. Needlessly you feel closer, as your muted
and caged dreams pound away. The retinue seems endless, well tried, clowns
falling out of the car’s doors, the boot, a tired hilarity, dashing the front rows
in buckets of confetti and water, fire jumping from the tip of a finger into air,
juggled amid knives, noise and dark. The bearded lady sings an aria, a rake
of a man walks over broken glass, suspends a dwarf from his testicles on chain,
made of silk, another slips skewers through cheek and tongue, his eyes zeroed
into horizon. You watch sequined tops stuffed with breasts, feathers tickling
so that the crowd gasps, wheezes and guffaws but you hold your breath, waiting
for some truth to sink in. Later, huddled between trailers, your drunk tongue
forces its way between words. The Chinese fortune-teller’s wet lips part,
and you’re left to draw on prophecies, the strange language of your future.
Behind it all the generator’s whirr and clatter and the crowd, laughing, belching,
heaving up clouds of sticky sweetness and smoke, sweat pouring out of light,
and the sun rising slowly over the now-empty lot where each thing remembered
slips away except the ring-master’s crooked beak, roman angles strung out in
limelight, and the steady gaze of the knife-thrower suspended mid-air of afterward,
a dim forgetting you press against as you trundle broken-toed up the road.
 
 
Lost soldier

The river was filled with bones
from the neighbourhood’s family pets.
All sorts of bones: dog, cat, mouse.
There was even the dusty rib cage
of Mr Perkins, that old nag
the Irish twins saved from the knackery
and kept in their loungeroom
on the tenth floor.
They used to bring Mr Perkins
down in the lift and ride him
along Seven Mile Beach.
No one remembered when
the bones started to collect.
Some say it was after the last rains.
No one can remember when
they were either. Sometimes
it almost seems ridiculous
that water could fall from the sky.
Mavis, the town’s one-time spinster,
claims to have the last wet season
on video, but Joey found out
that was just a lure. One afternoon,
we pushed that dingbat Timmy
down the bank into the bones.
You could hear his big clumsy feet
cracking like fireworks
as a white cloud drifted up
wherever he went shrieking about.
He came back with the twisted vertebrae
of what looked like a big brown snake
or black snake, we couldn’t tell which.
It reminded me of a book I’d read,
how during some war somewhere
they interrogated prisoners
by skinning them alive.
That riverbank made me think
there was a lost soldier in town
after a couple of answers.
I figured he lived under Brodie’s place,
in the basement where Brodie’s Mum
kept the dressmaker’s doll
and the family photos of the kid
that went missing.

Raven Books

two lovers wait in a car
going on the nod
while kissing each other.

Spring Broadcast
Carrying a television

two men send

back to its source.

The warmth of

The softness of her gesture.
Taking my two coins

Elegy
Yellow leaves stipple the front lawn.
My lungs bubble: my tobacco is stale.
A log implodes on a bed of coals.
*
The year grinds away; the edges burr.
I nod out: braiding syllables to snare the sun.
Wake shivering. This necktie of ashes.

These inertly predictable days ebb slowly.
They play out their miniature endings.
They are of one end. They arrive without you.Charles Dickens Weeps for His Last Child
 
Beyond the coach, the open reaches of the Thames summons
ravens, gulls, otters, and the Sussex docked at Gravesend.
 
Mothers fiddle with their baskets and bonnets, children herd
cattle and goats, undaunted by din, the rank, soggy earth.
 
Autumn with her rich unleaving of oak, elm and maple
measures my bleakness. For days the wind has refused to speak.
 
My youngest, Plorn, waits in a boarding house with his dog,
his armoury of rifles, revolvers, saddles and family portraits
 
which will decorate the saloon. But when the fiddler plays a shanty,
when the sails are unfurled, the anchor raised out of mud
 
that other world begins with its nautical discipline. So remote
from landfall or the idleness of London, strange things can happen.
 
My advice is to write furiously in the evenings as Wilkins Micawber
— while shooting seagulls you may become your own fiction.
 
I’m fascinated by the arc of falling stars, eclipses, the way words
permit the undertow of shipwreck, gambling, child mortality.
 
I grieve for this farewell, to which my self is tethered, as letters
tied to pieces of coal are flung aboard a home-bound craft;
 
the voyage south to Melbourne both searing and cold. How still
the ocean is, a perfect fleet of ships, the distance quite imaginary.
 
 
Beauty Tips
                         for my mother

What words to fill the day? How to resist sentiment,
balancing dream and the recklessly blue sky?
 
Spring arrives with its allegro swell of trees, pollen,
a novel open on the kitchen bench, breakfast aromas.
 
Outside, the garden languors in laundry, agapanthus,
our swimming pool in need of chlorine turns emerald green
 
with insect wings, serrated jacaranda. What colour is truth?
I dip the soft sable in powder to dust away speckles,
 
cover shadows on my face, and yesterday’s mascara.
Cleanse, tone, exfoliate. At all times, brush downwards.
 
I’ve disregarded my mother’s beauty tips, her lessons
in permanence or grace. Her body slow, involuntary;
 
her eyes widened by Parkinson’s, a fine tremor in the jaw
while the heart arranges, steady with belief and forgetting.
 
I take comfort in this. Mother, show me the other way back.
How the gravel is imprinted by the wind, by human steps.
Walk with me this evening, the sky crepuscular, rose-tinted,
the drifting scent of wild freesias like something strange,
 
half-known. You shuffle, sight weakened, wanting
to observe the fallen shingles, twigs, and the scarcity of birds.

not enough you’d think to split a church
but religion fuels the wildest feelings
 
some left the church when the organ came —
the first settler’s son and my relative Sam
even though his Liza was the first organist
 
it seemed as if God had personally decreed
that hymns should be sung line by line:
the devil was in the asthmatic sounds
from the newly installed pedal organ
 
they asked the Salvation Army to come
strange when their trumpets and drums
were louder and livelier than the organ
but passed by God I suppose like King David’s dancing

away from the dozing houses
at the top end of our street
the boys play a scary game
 
one of them curls into an upright car tyre

calls to his mates I’m ready
 
another boy launches the tyre
to whirl down the hill wobble
and fall over as the track levels
 
fearful yet yearning to belong

The house looks very sure.
It squats on the paper.
It must know what it is.
 
“What’s this dear?”
asks the woman in blue.
But surely she knows?
 
Unless she’s a circus person,
who lives in a Big Top,
not busy rehearsing today?
 
It can’t just be a house. 
It must be a trick question
Can it fly? Are its windows pretending?
Are they really wings?

I scowl towards his voice. He says the map
marks how far vision goes. If I could creep
 
up close I’d learn the journey. His technique
restricts me to a chair so he can track
 
how far I travel down the chart alone
before I pause. I grope in the third line –
 
my limit the next shape I recognize –
then stop. No way. I still believe my eyes
 
can hold a solar system, catch all lights,
deliver to the doctor alphabets
 
as small as atoms. But this world is smudge.
I’m huddled at the bottom of the page,
 
trying to hide my dark. Wherever I am,
I’ve bypassed every symbol I can name
 
and stumble at my vision’s borders
where letters are illegible as stars.
 
 
EYE TEST   
 
“Quite good at moon, especially when it’s full”
I boast by text message, as though the moon’s
a new phase in my history.
My friend has asked if I can see its shape
in the bright dusk. Which image does she want?
 A lump of rock? A leaping lunar hare?
 Face? Crescent?  A leech lifting
light from the sun? I can’t say “Zilch,”
or that the only Moon I’m certain of
is a sort of Braille, and as I can’t read
the sky at night, the moon is a guessed space
where I am free to put whatever.
I suppose I could blame the weather,
but I still hope to see the official moon
above rush hour. I respond
as though to an ophthalmologist,
with a box of silver lenses,                                 
whose job it is to clarify my dark
and gauge the exact colour of my blackness.from “Incognita,” Book One
Forget what I write          at sea the night makes stars
Graph the hollow          my pen’s untidy swell and slap
Of waves          aurora phosphorescence on the oars
My steaming head remembers nothing
 
Forget what I write           I just write
To abandon my nascent beauty           even I am amazed
By my enchanted senses
After blazing down through the unmarked heavens
By Canopus          my insatiate eyes           antelopes of the moon
 
Of course I am nothing          floating weightless
Obsidian waves rise & fall         cold troughs of salty darkness
Black sockets on the face of the wind
 
How cool it is down here          swarms of cuttlefish
Fly beneath          a shoal of silence echoes from the bay
 
I am momentarily submerged          there are no stars
No firmament bar a smudge of luminescence 
The dark sea suffocating
Light then stars and planets spluttered break again
Through aeons of nothing          I taste
 
Rise then catch the scent of oil          eucalyptus fumes and dirt
Radio static          a brilliant fire coralescent
City on the ridge of night
I hear tresses of flame aerate the silence          rustling multitudes
Naked furors mute but for their cry
 
How can I pass through this unmarked?
How can I endure this bleak horizon
At the limit of my courage          black water          black air
The roiling heavens’
Wrestle through the seething waves          the deep
 
I hear faint words when flung above          their signature below
An echo of my buoyancy
In ink           or what remains           in undertow.
 
 
The Latter Shall Prevail 
 
In the event of daylight
your body becomes sun, pestle sharp
dream peony
 
I crawl to you in russet green
my simple math
a chord kept by tender sluts
 
In the event of agreement
cantabile monarchs flicker abed, garden
spirals spruce
 
Colour to the laurel
I blink, the winged creatures gone
upon the laurel limb
 
In the event of renovation
chop down gums, sappy flesh
pale and grave
 
A wolf’s blue eye
possessed by human closure, bloody fur
stuck to my fingers
 
In the event of ecology
the enchantment of property shrieks
poppies, mere nature
 
Descends into decoration,
a pileup in winter, angelic weather
crenelating anonymous cathedrals
 
In the event of false sorrow
estranged but enchanting, cross & recross your mouth
your naked province of power
 
Two hands blow sistrum
courting a seminal fancy, most valuable lover
held to the light
 
In the event of chestnut, oak, boredom
the dead season swells into wolves,
salt, rooftops glistening
 
Light angled highlights
fault mysterious & private, each eclipse
equivalent to shit
 
In the event of technique
shards of water, obligatory guns
perfumed grace
 
I am happy to die for each shade of whiteness, witness
mortal lingering
in hedges, humans, horrible dogs
 
In the event of anticipation
empire’s lucid contour
embroiders over underworld
 
A tally clod by distant oxen
free fall forests
afternoon orange
 
In the event of conjecture
enormous hedgerows socket tomorrow
neon marrow lunar flavour
 
Only wolves’ golden eyes
yawl
acumble snow
 
In the event of darkness
uncommon sirens’ soothsaw poetics
know
Thumbprints calibrate night, &
betwixt a lightning or a carbon sky
the latter shall prevail.

And now I let you go. Signed, The Dwarf.
                                             —  John Ashbery
I’m presuming, I know (just as winter will
unite enemies in spring, betray soporific words
left a tiny bit unhingd &, all gilt, such paroxetine
somnolence weakly ornamented—I thought
error might better pass enclosd, your coercion
somewhat sluiced by a subigated rose, an ouevre’s
brocaded recitations, garlands left dishevelled
in the fog; my foliate despair (a locket) shows
(ingenious as mind-control ordaind by queer cherubs)
a Sun King smiling radiant while drawing
unself-conscious blancs from her morphine powderd
throne, an asthenic coterie (kept glad of work!)
laying about the cruel enclosure with studied
cartouchés, eyelids clasping inlaid silver birds.
 
So, the reason why I right up Verse, ills aside,
and carry charmd totes inside this bird of paradox,
informants gushing tedious and jocund, is, honey,
instrumental — the republic, enamelled & reductive,
its interiors’ consigned affiliations, slops of law
and capital’s bulbous, cordial seductions
grant lip service to this beguiling inheritance
(materialist, undetermin’d, in arrears) common sense
depositary and melamine; Wallpaper faces
unletterd & besmirchd by mismated possibility
drift across the onerous couch, a city wakes bedazzld
by the birth of a gildd, stirrupd fricatrice.

’cause we live like worms) & think to like it.Simple Haste
 
i take myself to be smarter than i look!
having said that this seems a time 
i needed a dressing down! next thing 
i know i’ve got a sun tan! & lazing  
under a capable hush my eardrum 
almost bursts from the effervescence!   
but i escape via the simple haste of  
a flannel car that i’d parked in my jacket 
pocket just in case of such an aerated
emergency! my jacket will not be easy
placated by this feverish abscondment  
though without a map i’m probably 
not meeting my jacket again as i  
continue hurtling around this roundabout!
 
 
Waking Fast.
 

1.
 
in my dream i was nowhere to be found
i took to waking fast    dull light
the morning is moody side down    i’m
breathing    fully awake    breakfast
coffee muddy side up    now i get to do
this & do that again!    blocks of colour
everywhere    monuments of tones
shades of light growing nice shadows
the depths are in focus    the weight
of each shadow deepening against
the sun    read    sneeze    jot some
notes    sitting quietly doing nothing
the prints of darkness settle in    it’s
evening! the rest of the world unfolds
 

2.
 
winter    the dawn has a lid on it    waking fast
the lid stays on    no Perrier! no Badoit! coffee low!
today i know the meaning of a cashless society!
got to roll with that!    the clouds come rolling in
like balls of snow    it’s 10:15 a.m. & the cloud’s
breaking up    great balls of light as the sun rolls
through    the edges circling the air    11:20 a.m.
the wind suddenly drops & rolls into a corner
cornered!    i’m cornered!    the afternoon rolls
in slowly    if this is what is called “being on a roll”
then it has another thing coming!    somewhere
in the shadows evening waits    what can be
known about evening?    as armfuls of night
ease in     & the emergency of dreams
 
 

3.
 
dawn    a rain that reigns all morning
having woken fast i’m watching the vast
drizzle of it    at ends to wonder what
could be wetter!    i’ll wash my hands of it!
read    sneeze    jot some notes    try
lunch!    peel an orange!    sitting quietly 
doing nothing my coffee goes cold
the shadows are laying low    stalled
in dampness    no sun to focus    this
douses that    muddy instances moody
side down    i remember sunshine i mumble
i remember I Remember!    i remember
yesterday! will i remember tomorrow?
what is evening? where is night? i ponder
 

4.
 
mid June    frozen in time!    early    weak sun
strong coffee    the answer to waking fast?
ponder the far off silhouette of lunch?    sneeze
read    watch the wind unfurl    the edges circling
the air    the whirl doesn’t spend a moment
away from its shadow    blocks of colour
shades of light    this tepid swirl is sunshine?
dissolves!    a quick sidestep & morning’s over
lunch dissolves!    could June dissolve?    fragments
of a reclining afternoon dissolve    do this jot
that    lost for words resolve to sit quietly
the simpering sunshine goes over the hill
without question i’m cornered by the matte tones
of night     waiting the availability of dawn
 
 
Big Dry
 
now that
global warming
is here
my pagophagia
is waning & i’m
polishing my oar
 
the snow drifts
change to sand
before my oar
dies of thirst
i must quickly
find some water
 
it would be
easy to order
in a dust storm
to clean the rocks
but right now
i must find water
 
then night settles
a grey mist
like sandpaper
rasps across
the crumbling grass
still no sign of water 
 
in the blue
clutter of memory
a distant
sound of dripping
is recalled
but no water
 
white piled up
orbs in the sky
bounce off the hills
with great friction
it seems without
need for water
 
in these fields
of hysteria i’d
swipe some music
from the very air
if it would lead
to water
 
the woods are darker
than the trees
maybe i should
smite some rocks
or bounce echoes
around a valley
 
sweating & glowing
with a ferric tinge
the search is 
thoughtful otherwise  
its dry elusive no
cloud in the sky
 
i moodily perplex
someday my oasis
will come & the sky
will shine blue
to the distance
a shimmering mirage
 
in the scheme
of things maybe
you can lead
an oar to water
but can you
make it drink!
 
 
(pagophagia: the compulsive eating of ice)
 
 
Whirlwind
 
a whirlwind of rough ablutions    that’s mud
in your eye!    awake to a sentence of rain
coffee    muddy side up    the day unfolds
i like the creases    dabs of moody light    
how much rain can pile up in one backyard
as the sky continues to let loose as if all 
the ropes of winter had completely unravelled 
across this patch of sky?    spring in the wings
lunch in the wings    morning on the wing
it’s Bastille Day & Perrier Fever is catching
the French doors too are open demustifying
the room    where’s the Quinine you ask
no Badoit?    et le soleil aussi?    as the rain
continues compiling notes    scribble scribble …Chopin thru it all 
 
Chopin on the piano, through it all
through the depths — except for the telephone conference
except for the overtures the girls make
except for their purposeful sextalk around men
without the usual hanky pankies used to spice up life
 
Chopin playing the change this aussie woman perfects after marriage
her seriousness in crossing the avenue with the infant
to the exact spot where the moon appeared directly above my scalp
 
Penumbral moon
 
Chopin on the piano — excludes the bikebaby’s racist “hello”
leaving a hundred and fifty or may be even seventy-five kilometers behind
 
behind a century and a half of civilization
giant aboriginal clam collections
although eluding their food habits
 
Chopin playing their love-sick dawn
their fantasia in D-minor
 


Bipolar Disorder 
 
Pour out from the head a little more — let out the infinitives
Chime like the orange kids on both sides of the road — admitting
You at the hospital front desk need more sleep and perhaps a little less shameful
Joke lets go dance Marimba across our misachievements
 
The world’s beauty and juices seem to outflow from the gracious torrent
She held, don’t you think? The world’s beauty and juices open up from time to
Time its birds and animals speak up their minds print everywhere
In Hajrat Solomon's palace floors that dazzle in the grace of their aluminum frames
Frames like torsos
 
I speak too — of the ones that return unopened from our stratosphere return
Like the soft spoiled sparrows that fly away never to alight on the other man’s shoulder
Other men go too crazy about automobiles count bills and analyze money and
Constantly honk while driving past the graveyard while getting us admitted at the 
hospital front desk
 


Brothel Owner’s Car park 
 
— another one of those hysteric babes
blood vomit swirling out of darkness
wets the entire freeway — suspended skylights
someone's seemingly earrings — babe laughs and giggles
then says — cold spring
and waterfall transforms into an entire drainage
 
A helper comes in staggering                  blood-drone buddy
but a passion in his facade
a variety of fifty cars sleeping in his garage and one of them fashions
switches on a stereo — windows lowered — as if the owner's
gone pissing somewhere in the corner where the blood-drone
lectures — this is a stealer’s den, look there
17 foot walls, but this is one stealer’s den
 
Looking on — a bird’s effortless wails
cawing and cooing suspended
in the wires drooping from street side posts
 
Proud of his Hilsa catch, fish and river shining
the plump small trader calls — hey, buddy
how’s life dousing you with colors?
 
I reply, busted! busted!!
A million ducklings fly away early in the morning
look below them green trees look
look you drug & dream addicts —
look at the wasteful, the unstoppable insect swarm
 
If your stomach likens a sun drawn at infancy
me filling the skeleton’s eye socket
The world wobbling at the blind man’s cane tip
 
Ms. Hysteria giggles again, says —
Snakes! great snakes!
The brothel owner wittily retorts —
Be careful then[1]
 


Sticky Poem 
 
We return alone — forlorn, solitary — me and
my drink buddies — lovers and citizens
 
Shoulders on both sides of us — like wings fanning out
Asphalt below our feet
 
and our ruffled flying hairs
 
We come down exactly as much as we rose — Newton’s apple
is on the corridors of Newtonian time
 
Our figures sticky
…. …. …. …. …. ….
He advised us to rub a little more — a bit more stroking
hinting that we probably scrub away the poet from history — and
the Brits, if possible
we can let the horse-saddle be intricate art
we can let elephants serve as Maharaja mounts
 
Well, the Maharaja had little knowledge though, this side of
the colony he knew little — or of its mass production of wealth
 
Erase those — those things, but then do you mean
this had been a classless state ?
So, nature could never make classes ? — those who defied her
to define art — can’t even come out always, naturally,
of its confines — their art colors expensive furniture —
men wear fine coat   bright leather boots
with tags sticking on the sole like
our pet poultry project plan
 
In the supermarket, they check a person’s bag
 
whose billion ancestors were killed in the name of rubber trade
 


Encrypted writings 
 
Internet encrypted
everything I write — a hut
paddy fields barren-ended
wetness in the air
like fishing out a colorful Kholshey from the stream
 
I write the flag of a celibate community while I dance —
don’t write the blood dripping
from the saline IV
 
I write the cold electrons — conceptual bits
write the bytes — a lesbian couple snaps from their kiss
in an elevator in Singapore
 
and then those who decrypt
for them I write the dog from this room
but I don’t write its hair[2]

‘aged famous rockers tour the world’
I explain to the homeless man outside our supermarket
by a tree which serves to hold shopping trolleys back
(some wander in high winds as steel renegades across traffic)
he wanted to know any news
so I spoke and pretended I didn’t remember him
stood downwind to avoid the stench of ancient unwashed denims
we loaded my groceries into the car boot together
while I talked and he listened as if we’d married
stayed in the same house for reasons of children and accounting
stopped any demands for obedience to each other’s rules
but I knew his name and how he liked ice cream
a little melted and yet some still firm
my feelings also thawed enough to take time
desserts and good conversation require a lull
but he tried to tell me we were fated to be together
as if we’d unwittingly signed up for a soppy romance movie
and soon his buddy whispered to him ‘he’d told him so’
they shambled away in late afternoon gold with leaves falling
I wondered for a few minutes what could’ve been if I’d chosen him
instead of the vampire with good map reading skills
who knew how to sneak into my room at night
to sit with his smile for a brain and wait
for my eyes to open then conditioning to polish my reaction
over and over again the same secret
known observer a fright – media man in leather without a pen
but he drew fantasies with perfect recall in black and white
so clean these bare stories in the wind and rain




girls soft as new grass
complicated as seeds
they slid
stories rolled
ideas from pages planted
cool shapes
sounds from sparkly speaker cloth on the radiogram
a remember in the background of their ignorance of fences 
while uncles uncurled turf 
for lawn
then the day one girl (or was it the other)? pinched
a new baby
through the bars of the playpen
the child cried a sudden squall
then boats of adults huddled to harbour
so she had to tell naughty twin about the Queen of Hearts
her version with a royal burden of resentments
given the task to love more than anyone else even if she was so ugly
how the failure of a storybook royal could teach them
impossible things existed
on the concrete steps where sun soaked
while fragments of know and silly or blur
                                                                         floated
each others thoughts
between them the way language turns
                                                                   into care
                                           into air





India — Early 20th Century and Other Tales
1
A painting of a cherub on an eyelash,
offered for sale in a pavilion near the jungle.
‘How rare,’ someone murmured.
The magnifying glass — dropped,
when an elephant crashed through
the canvas and toppled tent poles.
Where gin and tonics clinked,
art admirers then faced sharp
tusks inches from a glass.
Later, Mum told how she walked World War Two
through blackout city streets to her house,
a white line middle of the road in moonlight.
Hummed big band numbers and stepped
a suburban perforation marked on asphalt,
after-dance safety in a tune and paint.
She knew the words and recognised,
any time something could break from tame.
Told children, “Find a good way
home, my darlings.”
2
Invented rainy day stories golden with deeds
to ensure our parents’ lullaby.
‘Imagine,’ my sister said, ‘cut ourselves out,
two girls from a picture book. Walk around.’
A favourite has us both on a raft we lashed
with Dad’s ties and Mum’s aprons.
Remnants of our old life flapped about us,
while this clodhopper craft sped towards the sea.
In the washed night’s dilated eye something woke me,
my twin in her sleep, calling puppy-sad for parents.
The story sure to finish after a return in darkness,
bedraggled girls with scratches from the river bank.
Our trudge up the path towards orange-lit windows,
where warmth produced the cold idea we weren’t missed.
My twin tells me I remember things stung, too bluely,
‘Just add a lit fireplace to the room.’
She explains we arrived to warm cardigans,
roars of laughter and kisses, like the end of a war.


My DPhil thesis dissertation is entitled From Utopia to Paradise: Louis Zukofsky and the Legacy of Ezra Pound and deals extensively with Pound and Zukofsky, particularly regarding their late oeuvres. Much of my first long poem/collection, from The Mountain of California …, was written as I finished my dissertation, and many locales, themes, and figures from that work are also included in my collection. Likewise, the collection was completed in California during a reading and consideration of the two West Coast–based generations of American avant-gardist poets who followed Pound and Zukofsky, many of whom can be read clearly in the work. The || caesura break things allow the subdivided long poem to be further subdivided, hopefully encouraging all of its constituent elements to exist in various different ways at once.
I am currently working on three associated projects: R.T.A. Parker’s 99 Sonnets about Evil and The Trav’ller and the Defence of Heaven, which are both near completion, and Æsthetic Theory, which is spezzato. The first is an extended meditation on the work of Herman Melville, most particularly the Christlike and disastrous undertakings of Pierre in Pierre. The Sonnets attempt to address such problems in the light of a cultural and moral (perhaps specifically British) milieu much changed since the mid-nineteenth century. The Trav’ller and the Defence of Heaven is a long narrative science fiction poem and Æsthetic Theory is an essay at an ecstatic aesthetic autobiography.

I pick up poems. The hose is a poem. House, which cannot
be picked up, is not therefore not a poem. I mean
in the garden, putting aside for a moment the family
of damages, to redress the smell of the sea, carrying through
a parachute of spinach,
                                     assigning the fallen parsnip
with a redolence of foregone conclusions, the cycle of silverbeet
being a cycle of slime, whether or not there will be words
at the end of each to assess what beginning reckoned
its beginning in disintegration. Nothing words. I hear
in the surf, raging off the point in the onshore wind
that has been blowing forever since one, since lunch.
Hear that it will not be blowing, that it is not now,
that sometime there will be nothing more to pick up.
Grass, earth, spade. Cat greeting. Pick up the poem.





Meeting in a Field
After consent had been given, it was time to bid.
The land lay mute, a prize stretched rare for the fingernail.
But always too there might have been resistance,
remoteness, in the silence it maintained.
Unkillable parasites, joined over the yield,
shook and stammered, stamped and grumbled,
dressed in a sweat of crushed flowers.
It was as though they knew what they were doing, impassive
though the wind did its best to talk them out of it,
and the dirt prodded with their clenched toes
clung to a coarse shrub they dug out
with their spades. An intention to improve
haunted that stony plain; synaptic shadows
flickered in the nerves like dark lightning.
And the land did nothing, and the sun ran down
all redemption, all hope in revenge or relief.





Croak
The poet has lost his voice;
has lost it out of choice.
Wind, gavel and the snow,
just his voice had to go.
So, clattering about
on the town with a trout,
poet, already hoarse,
abandoned the course;
lost sight of old verses.
Became some other man
mumbling in the whorl
of professions, cities,
neglecting his curses
for fiduciary duties.
The thunder he might hurl
mellowed into a rusk.
Tired health with his girl,
the cellphone at dusk.
King Death will restore it.
Poet worrying the dark
for the old curses, words,
cannot now ignore it.
First faultingly, then stark,
a night-cry of birds,
voice repossesses him
at King Death’s whim.

In the Silence Museum, it is not the things that matter; the stones, the old statues, the buried things, the cultural collections, the historical emblems, the Clusters, the Art, or the Faces or the great places: it is the spaces, the especial spaces — the spaces between — where we tread. And we refuse all that human history, and stop between it. (We have no theory. We are alone.) It (The History etc) may not have happened, may not even be there.
We begin. (The rules have disappeared
In the Silent Museum of memories and Things, and desires: we calibrate the lacunae, the stretches, the enormous time distortions, the Shapes, and the Darkness between
Our steps are intricate, we connect, we scrutinize, and we stand. We take stock. What is all this darkness? 
There are dates, and clocks, and lovely dust, and faces of the dead. These are beautiful or terrible; but we are indifferent and avoid them.
Music is heard, but we Reject music, for music diverts truth from itself.
“A screaming comes across the sky. It has happened before, but this time …”
We pause. A chord is heard. It cuts. It cuts The Silence like a Japanese sword. It sharpens the silence.
But what is this my wounded heart my knee my this my bleak my light …?
Are we lost in The Museum? We have traveled long in Times fantastic the White Beards of the seas. But we have wept, wept and mapped, and fasted. (We are nearly Religious.
But we have no theories or conclusions. (Could the rules return?
But we are in the Silent Museum. We are gingerly, and step around The Things. We are in the spaces. The places of the spaces. (For we love these places. ((We calibrate. (((We summate. ((((We hesitate. (((((We stop

We begin again (again





again) (2)
We have agreed it is not only true or necessary to step around the Things, or to avoid the Spaces or the tremble of pulse and time that is the throb of light and of heat emerging even in these especial things in their special privileged places. We of these places and these Palaces have agreed. For, even in the very Very of the Silence Museum we now hear more clearly, and things more brightly and darkly enlight themselves: and indeed we move between, but in Our silent thought we are beginning to Be, again: for it is this, or partly thereof, that we have —
  But here we have pause (for who are we?).
  We have said that it is not the Things.
  But, whence cometh they in these charged brigades of wounded time? (Ambiguous undules). And waves. The waves keep arriving. And difficult and tough is God in those ancient bloody vats. So. So we circle.
  We circle in the dark where light falls softly as rain. We know we have not mastered the Silent Museum where Silent reigns and (it is said) (of the columns) (in the immense but deeply quiet Cathedral) that (perhaps) “tongue-less men placed them” (vast) … No! We have not mastered the Silence Museum where dusty silence reigns in great Red Brocades of lovely lace. Lace in such loops the Spider would envy. Warm and black. For we step now into the adyts, but there is no Wolf here. (And indeed there is an answering chuckle but we stiffen back to our rectitude).
  Russian music. Eggs. Clocks. Bells. Drops. Deep. 
  Ancient in ancient Agony our heart clocks beat but —
  But we pause, we have clearly forgotten. For if distant and closely far in his Huge Shuffle, when and where do we enter? We re-order ourselves.
  We read 100,000 books on Everything and then we partake in a great and surely decent repast. (Time and the River …).
  Again we move in a ballet lightness the coigns the coigns the columns between. The Columns are all about us. (We know and they know and they Are and they are speechless with speech.) He is here. We think and thus we move toward. Once we had the joy of animals all that “useless love.” We move. Ah! The Silent Museum is so endless. So Museum. So true. So yet. So —
  Difficult. The Wounds cannot be ignored. Perhaps I am on an Island. Why is not a question. We dance. We are between yet nearly in. (The sad mystery of the Yellow Music). We dance. We begin to emerge and take up positions. Some become Religion People. (The Black Music.) (The Blackness). Is it true?
  The things are precious and nearly true but how are they ordered? What makes. What.
  We caper nimbly in our immobility. (Chambered ladies). (Coyly we tour the Things and mutely quest which is and which is not. Ha!
  He is surely all here, all Everywhere, we think.




again) (3a)
It is not (we have convened and reconsidered these matters whatever they are) the things
in the Silence Museuum that matter, but the spaces …
…. but we are no longer sure. We used to be (what wonderful days we had by the
beaches and playing with our buckets and our sa — ….!! )
      But something was wrong. Some were beginning to believe in things.

But as we said, we were not sure any more. We knew or had heard that Terror was the 
Purest Emotion, but of that we were unclear. What did that mean?
And the spaces? And the species of spaces …?
But it was certainly … we knew of The Silence. And we. They. It. He. I. Matter.
The things, you see, and the Things we (and others) see
……………Here’s a little poem with bits missing we found. It might help us here:
That there thing, that is, the thing there —
The thing that was there,
Where I saw it, dark —
A coagule of wet,
Together, clinging things:
Like dead, and loving things —
Dead things caught in a hopeless,
But restless, and never ending
Parody of what looked —

In so far as you, could see:
Or could not see,
Were, as I began, wet, limp,
But together things, rapid, and, they, or it:
Rolled in the wind

 
    — and: so much exhaustion.

Terribly — it could not be
The slightest slightness —
Of its seeming wanting
To be the 
 
And the thing, the there thing,
Rolled, ridiculous, not even writhing:
Not even knowing,
And turning turning turning:
Being and not being,
Seeing and not seeing,
And not knowing that it didn’t see or be:
Yet —

And it drivels on. That thing is most certainly NOT our thing!
But of course it is all nonsense, but, well, it was done, once … and what isn’t nonsense? 
But the things, let’s get back to Things and to Silence: they said, in fact, of the things, 
that the Things weren’t things.
(We await your answer by Return.




again) (4)  
Return. (We apologize, except that we never apologize, for the “noise” (see below),
which we cannot remove, such noise, mingling and singing in our signals is the bane of
these importations 
……beyond this seemingly happy, contented and
teacup world, is a titanic, fly-besotted lorded and raging,
foul, chaotic, brute, brief, nasty, atom-smashing blood and boil-filled
godless and sneering, chaos: whose joy is to rip us into tatters
of nothings: we who are — those of us participant — we who are
strangely marooned:
generally the numbers
have been behaving lately, but I’m still terrible about.
you aren’t? what’s going on in the head of all the things?
What about reality and truth?
(Bother! These all “human” things keep attaching themselves and virilating our Spaces.
But to resume and recap, as we shall do: ‘As it has been apostrophized …
… It is not the things in the Silence Museum, but the spaces …
… but we are no longer sure.
We used to be, but then we became Clever, and The Questioners came.
We assembled into the House of Questions.
The Things, you see, they said, are not things, or are not things only. Yes? Yes, there are 
spaces betwixt the spaces which, somewhat, define the things. And reality is indeed there, 
but is as equally between as it is in, but … But the Gold? What? Oh yes! Yes there is gold. 
And gold is incomparable.
for example:
            cascade            opals
            in a cascade of roaring opals
But let us step and waltz with you. Think of being the things and wonder aloud that the
move between is surely energizes the fever inside the spaces. Think but don’t think. 
Dance …
Who do you think you are mate with all these long words! Get him off! Talk about real
things. What about all the suffering and all the economics and the ideas and what about
the people and Africa and all those things, you pseudo-intellectual crap face, eh? I’ll give from Book of Equanimity Verses

Beauty and the Beast.
For several weeks
the loveliest of fairytales
disfigured its creator.

Beside a dirt road
in Cambodia
the water bubbles with
decomposing bodies.
Only the living remain
haunted and restless.
They wait for thunder to roll
over the silent rice fields.

Five coloured balls dance
behind a silk curtain —
treasure for the hungry ghosts.
Look away, look away.
As the rain begins to fall
a black Labrador
is eating crab apples
in a neighbour’s back garden.
 

61.
You’ve run through
all your transformations
so many times
there’s nothing left to transform.
Just a half-empty
salt shaker
sitting on the table
of a midnight diner.

62.
The adept and the inept —
two tadpoles swimming
in the same pond.
When winter arrives
and ice forms
like white jade
I can’t help but wonder
where the frogs have gone.

63.
Of course you lose your life.
They paint the walls
after your departure,
place ancient artifacts
into cardboard boxes.
Someday, if you do return
it will be a different season
and you’ll enter by a different door.




Bracketcity
 
Behind the closed door
one finds
a premonition of this door
breached
 
although a door is free from the usual constraints
a room is not
so is reality
 
Reality, I have decided to cut it some slack
 
Just can’t bear this moaning undercurrent
sawing
ceaseless
 
I would pass through the winter
And winter would pass through me
 
It’s a deal
where everybody wins

Mr. Bean said — All realizations are interpretation of data acquired by your senses. Since, all senses are suspect, realizations attained through them are deemed uncertain, suspect.

Eventually it all boils down to comprehension
even if you spell it all
it bothers at spots
marooned and wise
memories trying to decrypt their inner memories
I have spilled enough to know
no memory is worth courting, hanging out with —
in a backyard sun
and then
there are memories that are
felled futures
 
a teacup
that never went back to China

Bracketcity, ignorant as I am, it took me 37 years to realize that you actually need an appropriate language of thought. And now I am dumbstruck by its implications, considering the empty graveyards where language blossoms, its coherent fences, colors, strictures, variable degrees of freedoms …
 
—
 
Mr. Bean said — life comes a full circle
 I am thinking — A circle is a denominator of my own loneliness
 permeating through society and landscape
 encompassing but leaving things alone to their own self
 
—
 
The veritable fences and their
rogue signifiers
colors lapping colors
sounds chastising sounds
obdurate values hardly recognizable in
lengthy satin suits, funny hats
it’s a fair basically
an all night affair
carriages and their defined horses
rein
car
nation
 
everything is a necessity down here
even this perverse deployment of inevitability
 
—
 
Mr. Bean said — Go easy on these thoughts
 as all they lead to is amassing
fear and paranoia
 
Bracketcity
 
my innards know — this testimony that
 the stone yields to the hammer —
 is a conspiracy
The stone yields to its own uncertainty
 and the hammer yields to its elemental metaphor
Oh I truly believe everything is alive
 including you, me, this poem, the stone,
 the hammer
It’s just that we don’t own a bulletin board
That floats.

Mr. Bean said — however futile it may be, the humane urge to define anything and everything is imperative, despite the irresolution. This process eventually leads you to accept the futility but not without relevant questions. These questions redefine what you essentially are.

Trappings are quite common in
 this landscape
 routinely evaluated
 serene
 hollow
 yet
 brimming with life
 trapped
And the trapper never asks for
 your ID
It’s not the destination
 but the framework of sustainable prose.
 Avid ears
 wet ideas
 ambivalent
 punctuated words that
 give shape to a cemetery
 lingering in the shadow of
 hallowed windows
This city
 will enable you to write
 these green faces
 percolating light through
 green eyes
 silent green words
 leaching down
 nourishing
 dead plants

And the decanter and the decanter’s metaphor and its vulnerability and its innerself sloshing at the hand’s approach, and the hand, its guarded manicure and the featureless hesitation traveling from the hand to the decanter and the sloshing innerself succumbing to the hand’s loneliness and its nowheredom and the etymology of the inner sloshing and its despotic truewhereness, mouth’s gullibility and …
Damn it Mr. Bean, it was never my ambition to write a memorable line, I just wanted to write a memorable pause.
 
 Mr. Bean said — It’s alright to feel cheated as this is the only emotion that truly is existential in principle. By the way, did you know that “morality” is a byproduct of the sense of being cheated.
 
Yet you float your elemental belongingness in unknown water, yet you acquire newer fears, yet you go searching for avoidable traps, yet you learn to love the arena where you have tasted your gore, bile, soliloquy, pride, helplessness, your continuum … time and again. Yet time and yet again …
 
Mr. Bean said — Epigenetics is the heritable changes that take place without altering the genetic sequence — your habits/surroundings may switch off/on certain genes by just methylating or demethylating them …
 
and my fears now know — I thought, so I became … yet time and yet again …
Oh how my fears inherit their fears …
 
—
 
It hurts ! This petulance
Mr. Bean repeats — wisdom is the art of unlearning the obvious …
Fucked up, I am so fucked up …
He says: abandon this drama, theatrics
How do I unlearn my nourishments
 my soul
 That undulates on a fulcrum of
Non & Yon
bugger you and bugger all, Mr. Bean

—
 
Mr. Bean said — Ignorance is the strongest force, beware.
Am I merely the interpretation of my own undiscovered coordinates
An imperfection conjoins the values of this sublingual weather
My only regret is that I am forged to remember
Oh I figured out — to forget is to attain freedom in its truest
 
Let me appreciate a bronze-flower a flesh-flower
 and their muted decorum
 striving to bury
 the immediate sense of necessity
 
Interpreting me through my follies
 Interpreting me through their follies

—
 
these streets you will walk again
 
Mr. Bean said — seasons change
so do 
street signs
 
a teardrop on a copper jacket
a teardrop on a copperhead
 
once everything had a season
now a season has it all
 
I know for sure
Even if I do not belong
my absence will hunt me out
 
my absence will hunt me down
 
—
 
Mr. Bean said — Ask questions, if you may, but never seek an answer — every answer is a trap. 
 
 
And then there are illusions
every illusion needs a face
a decapitated body does not exude transparency
It’s a slow winter
we talk more about
the nature of stories
appropriate for a winter like this
about coiled springs
emotions
a distant frozen harbor
dead images of dead ships
buoyed up to float
buoyed up to last
 
We wonder if transparency
is truly a reflection that beams with a certain sense of assurance
I don’t have much problem with my transparency then
 
It’s one gorgeous winter
for a springloader
in search of strategic structures
 
immortal faces 
 that came out to bask in
paltry sun
 

 
Silk
 
An April has touched me twice
dug its pencil-heel in my eyes
 
 
Today was a perfect spring day. Cloudless. Spring-buds on every tree, though closed. Two more days of this light and heat and springtune will swirl out of them.

A spring-molecule, speed — the third of a light, hits me, and my shadow, my unorbiting travels to you. Energy that is generated when the shadow returns to its original orbit will make this poem glow.
 
April 25th
 
I want to cleave my head in half and want to show you the void. My poetry and I, born from the same source, have traveled to two opposite poles.
 
A moth sits on the new lamp. It’s just April, where did the cocoon form? Will it live till June? They live only for two weeks! “Sabya” gets funny. Bring the book, bring the book. What’s the Family? Genus? Is it an early one? A new species? OMG, we are famous! A Swedish spring where the sun stays up late, even at 10 in the evening. A small hill outside my kitchen window. The old gnarled oaks, strapping birches. Sabya says — remember Bolpur in July? The sericulture farm? Crows flying, a feast in the air, silk-season. Cocoons, scales, bargaining. Where will the cocoons go? The handloom, spun-silk. Silk on lady’s bags, shirts, winter scarves.
— Sabya, am I a moth?
— What ! you don’t have faith in old Mr. Darwin any more?
— Seriously Sabya, am I a moth?
 
I do not walk together with my art. From a source we both are born and then the art travels its own way and I mine. There is nothing before or after. Just two different directions. Poetry follows its own urge and I my own, to live and recreate. What happens to the origin? Does it survive? What happens to the notes of creation? Does it get immersed in boiling water and turn into a bubble? No one remembers the note Sabya, no one understands its tongue. When you come back to the origin, what do you see? A void in the skin of water? A void? An emptiness? With every poem a recurrence? How many times do you have to come back to such sorrow? Pathos! Pathos!
 
The moth flew towards July, its
meanings towards November
and the notes of its moulting hormone
bubbled through water.
 
As if monoliths were hewn from empty people
transmitting a recurrence
As if recurrence was a lamentation and
we lost its meaning in our own emptiness.
 
Lost! for habit has its own way of
dealing with consciousness
and fear is an essential that molds habit.
Lost, for loss is a word that recurs without mercy.
 
We could identify our jerseys
only in the dialect of a broken mirror
and time became an evening wash
we put on our faces     and went to bed.
 
Think of a magic that is devoid of reality
A reality that’s emptied of magic
 
Think, what does it take — fear/habit/loss —
for our granaries to molt.
And heaving enormous diaphragms,
gleaming wings, the meanings of moth
fly into a surgical table.
 
 
About points and a pair of clean underwear
 
Problem is, a point is thinking about me
while I am trying to think about points
separately, one by one, without a line connecting line
any linear equations
and thus couldn’t dry my clothes
Well, not a problem though, you won’t want your dirty linen washed
in the pub
My father used to say — It’s imperative that one wears clean undergarments.
Dying in a dirty one could shame you to death.
I knew, a point is thinking about me
since I am thinking about points.
They have dug up the roads
heavy rains
heaping soil
flowing soil
mud beach
sewage river.
I can’t,
so the window weeps.
I wouldn’t have believed a few days ago
how believable incoherence could be
until we attempt to describe it in our limp language.
What color a point should carry —
Let the point’s infinitesimal smallness decide that
Here, coconut groves
ocean
an oblong moon
doesn’t exist
A green dot beside a
blue one
a distant purple dot
a smoking “Sabya”
a red dot
glowing
ebbing
NO LINES
 
      Does a point see me and other points
      this way?
 
You would think
step by step a picture is made,
a man.
By putting your chin on your palm
you build leisure
By putting yourself in leisure
you build reflections
a past
a future.
And a point thinks
how the sound of a bomb detonating
outside your window
would travel from your skin
to create a instant new past and future
Beside an ultra-violet dot
I lay my clothes, still smelling of scrub-soap
on grasses
where
I have lost
a teak forest
a bungalow
a water-well with bougainvillea
not in absent-mindedness
but in purposeful certainty.
Is regret the first true consciousness?
Is remorse the first sign of intellect?
My window would only reflect me
wet, broken
desperately in search of a tune to repair itself.
Does the point want to say —
“Sabya, Sabya — lines and melodies are unnecessary
as both want to communicate.”
I feel the need to urinate
I know in wet and cold visceral blood circulation increases.
Yet, I want to follow the melody to that
great and earthly motel
where in a white bathtub
flows a stream of yellow
in its true wholeness.
Is stream a line too with an extra dimension of fluidity?
Oh cerebrum! the right or the left
where do I put my stream?
Where does the stream become a stone?
The stone, that I am looking upon.
Me, the stone is looking at.
As I change my viewing angle
you change your color, texture.
I too change my color, texture
from your angle — isn’t it?
A changed me I will see you.
A changed you, you will see me.
I am “Sabya” and I am the stone.
But irrespective of everything
My underwear is vocal, pure and clean.
 


Art and Therapy
 
The therapist said —
Poetry is all about treatment
The morning dose of Prozac
And the related contemplation of multiple suicides
It’s always about what you don’t see
Using a song as filter or not
Doesn’t matter
It always is what you don’t see
Coming, going
Wandering under lampshades
On the bathroom tiles
And always reciprocating with what it doesn’t see
You open the innards of a road out
The unseen gutters and the brothels
Dingy curtains, plush pink sofas
Used syringes, the sudden gale
The uptown flower market
Banana and melon peels
And the rings of Saturn around your left ball
And they all are reciprocating with what they don’t see
 
see, the game of hide & seek
it’s essentially 3 games
hide
seek
hide and seek the essence of what shall remain hidden, including you
 
Do you matter?
Do I matter?
For record, I no longer see the therapist
And me
 
 
Art, society, therapy and mosquitoes
The therapist asked — what is art
But an organic
accessibility to intuition
a superfast feed-forward reaction leading to a non-value
before you can say — shit!
(the action is hidden for the time being)
alienation is what a performing artist does best
so, try define society
in terms of art and
bingo!
 
Gentlemen, you have successfully reached The VOID
It has been a long time
Since we watched TV together in a shallow room
Taking care not to drop blueberries on the couch
Meeting eyes on an instinctive basis
Mosquitoes: Anopheles, Aedis, Culex
Smile, grimace
And the loft had its fair share of spiders
Weaving, sitting idle, not a single mosquito in the web
A perpetually dark toilet
Water stains
I mean, see, although you have moved to a better house
3 bedrooms, living cum dining, 2 toilets and a kitchen
Can’t help miss the studio
It’s the miseries that bond people
Make society
You want to call the new house a home
Bring on the
Leaking shower
Switchboards that come out
when you literally pull the plug
And there you go
 
Alienation is what a performing artist does best
While truly pursuing a de-alienation
Without caring to know
How very similar it may look
The mirror image is always reversed
 
 
Poem written in Maithon
 
I have to return from wherever, crossing steep rocks, sinuous or low bridges, where the solitary haunts, and as I keep moving, a voice cautions —
Watch out before you go any further
 
It might be my own! I am forced to retreat to
where the secured meal awaits us
used clothing and its familiar scent await us
someone calls in all sorts of strange places
from behind or far ahead —
It’s about time we go back
 
But for it I would lose my way in the mountainhead piercing the forest
or I would have met other distracting waters
my limbs would have popped out of the calm shell
and blood’s graffiti would have splashed out on canvas
or I would have met my strangest desires all of a sudden
and figure out that they are made of flesh and flood
and don’t recognize me and I don’t either
I would have earnestly brooded over the left behind meadows
 
But in the end it doesn't turn out that way
I go ahead a little forward when it calls again —
Come let’s go now.[1]
 
 
Insane Cycles
Intercycle
Floor of a sleeping elevator
I come up listening with ears wide open in the cold
to a colder morgue room.
 
Alone I am made to sit before a strange painting —
this painting tells me of torqued horns
and a crazy kid who sits atop them
with hands thrown up in lifelong quietude.
 
and that woman, blood-stained all over
anchored on a rock
talking into a dark mirror
while dressing herself — that
woman
too.
 
In this weird room
the three of us side by side
hold on to the bridge and swing from it.
 
A city shrouded in light’s parenthesis
impeccably dark streets hold mobilities
that transport beyond their usual speed
with myself and that image
captured in the womb
continuing to sway and swing
random windchimes.
 
Likewise they evolve. And earn. Hit by spectral headlights
they dwindle each day. Each day they lose their way
into meaningless ramblings. Disintegrated neurones, illegible
cursings, drowned in the pungent odor of country liqueur
I latch on to the morgue’s blind walls. This describes how, one day
I entered tinsel town.

Outercycle
 
A camel line moves
with the animals grazing the hooves against sand
Behind them some people trod
Going on a ritual to sacrifice their children.
They stop before a mountain range
and then,
the first sacrificed body is dressed in my clothes
and with a certain immediacy
a fleet of planes take off
their bellies stuffed with complex equations and critical mass.
 
Upturned computer. A thin dark floats in its mystic air. A blackness descends the stairs — its hand and face — poxmarked all over, from each one of those spots unknown signs spring out to hit in the balconies and in bus-stands, behind the security walls, one man at a time.
 
Sitting deep inside the pit of darkness an old man —
from deep inside the leaf-sac an old man, trembles
and oozes fission-blood.
On nutty-brown palm a friend wobbles
Even as we speak he moves around,
digging into the ruins for broken pieces of days
he would like to look for
hoping to toss ’em above his head
when found 
 

Afterword
 
In the midst of this historical and present times, a new flutist walks into the painting. He squats and begins playing his unreadable melody as colors melt, a wild lasting percussion rises from the center of the forest. Dark pallbearers assemble from all around.
 
 
(Un)mapping a subject

“What winsome willows!” he bursts into laughter
spilling over on the sofa
He found grass crease along the curved lines on the map
 
Fossil-pegs with full-blown masts sailing
on the rocky valley
When was that      was that      when
The bird-ballet got over in the meanwhile
as he sank into molten melody
 
Abrupt, broken lines of grass
under thin plank
Snow never piles on the stony steps
Grass encrumbed in the fissures
His laughter-flu spreads into the entire herd
Tittering sheep
they lose balance falling constantly on their neighbors
 
Stripped fur
Anwar Shah, the herdsman, shows up in a new lungi
All of his wives and offsprings alongside
Business is just right
It’s just about the road
Servicing free    all purchases personal
Happy hawkers rinsed with smiles.

Never seen the Narmada
exploring its vowels now
 
Soft paneers of flesh
Rolling trucks stuffed with cotton
Command us — pick ’em up on our running nibs
 
Love lives next to the vowels
The mannered lady complains through her man
She needs a rice bowl             even here    at these heights
Turn it upside down
the convex urge to slide down
to an entire valley
ruled by a map
 
Everything finds its end
even the melody of string-bowed rivulets
South American Josep gave up the idea of collecting
Ganges water and moving back to the southern hemisphere
That won’t help him cross the Narmada
The expanse of its vowels
works as a metaphor for its own covered space

How far down from here we figured out the
dried flesh
a shirt hanging on bones
 
It made the tiger come to a halt
and then the snake
and then the 3D images
meticulously picked out
 
No reading but a game
behind the magnified lenses
A living third dimension
If you withdraw it, things vanish
from the Golden Fortress
from Heisenberg
A living dimension-three, believe me
Touch Kali’s feet and swear it wasn’t you
Water on the body of tea-vapor
Wet Darjeeling happy home
Sudden clouds fluttering near shawled peaks
Rampant breeze, before the storm stirs
I fold the map to put it back
and speak of darkness, of its advancement.

Anything works, even karate
As we lose the trail we think of Lothar, Mandrake’s best friend
Lothar, Arjuna’s younger sibling
As the landscape whitens, mountains shine
We find “Arjuna’s Chair”
hence Lothar
 
— Who was the first to make an egg stand?
— Who is credited with the Bengali proverb “Crocodile in water, tiger on land”?
— How is Hasnuhana related to snakes?
— What makes the city mouse differ from the country mouse?
— Who first equalled a herd with factory-men?
 
A language whirls, of endless construction and
co-operation, continuing to form
To fill out the space between them
a few Theodolites are planted
Students pour out with their Brunton compasses
and construction keeps varying itself, in shape size
body and landscape
change change change change     chains and reins and change again
Words of the green, of profundity
find their way into all this
 
Signs and legends add to the map[2]
 
 

Elegy for a survivor of the war on Afghanistan
All surgeons are related
to their patients
by blood.
The best surgeons work quickly
in the dark.
At eight o’clock the lights in the psych ward
flick off, cellphones and girlfriends
are taken away,
and the nurses turn to guards.
You lie still in the blackout,
waiting for a bombing raid.
You often ask
about the past.
The past is a piece of rough skin soldered
to the back of your head.
Hair is beginning to grow over it.
You slept through the surgery
and screamed only once,
just before you woke up.
Your comrades in the ward
screamed in sympathy.
Now, every night, the dream plays backwards
at exactly the right speed,
so that you can admire the hips
and the cheekbones of the women
as they fly slowly
out of their crater
back up to the market square,
and slip their clean dark hands back into their purses,
or back onto the bomb-shaped
loaves of bread,
onto quinces and mangoes
as smooth as freshly-skinned heads.





Walking to the Dendroglyphs on Christmas Eve
(a dream)
1
Jehovah is tired
of advertising himself.
He bounces in the backseat
between fluffy dice,
trickles down candles,
glistens in crypts,
services virgins
and mystics
like a bored stud bull.
Let’s give him a break
today. Let’s leave the kid
in peace.
2
We step off the track
and head uphill,
wrongfooting manuka
and stunted pine.
Condoms and beer cans
dangle from branches
like festive decorations.
Split pipi shells stare blindly
from terraced mud.
3
On the ridgetop karaka
have made a circle
as methodically as druids’, as witches’
stones. A bottle has broken and spread itself
like a picnic blanket.
4
We come closer. We see how
the trunks have been cut.
The cuts are called Tangirau, Te Whiro,
Hiku’leo: Gods that don’t often
advertise, at least not on this
empirical island.
5
We stand and watch, as shadows
link the cuts, fill
the gaps, between elbow
and jaw, spear
and star, long-handled club
and proudly symbolic
bird. You trace a wingspan, hear
a morepork call,
as the light turns grey with age.
6
At the end of the ridge,
in a carolling farmhouse,
Jehovah is being born,
but this is the grove
of unadvertised Gods,
the place where they went hunting
star and owl,
the place where they come hunting
us.
Somebody has written
WESTSIDE 4 EVA
beside Hiku’leo’s sharp-winged prey.

At the Door 
 
Bushfire serenades a river
a star spreads on the earth’s surface
flaring then extinguishing —
yellow flames mean a fire’s happy
the river and creeks carry sweet ash,
burnt-desolation revives a fire spirit
at night, water holds other worlds
galaxies of stars wheel in a river.
 
In this life you’re lucky if you get to be
a toy but in the garage there’s a steel horse
its mighty heart thumps, polished like forty-
thousand shiny dollar coins welded into
terrible beauty that goes breathing fire
every day and in a year pumps a tonne
and a half of lead into the atmosphere.
We own that beauty. An engine’s life is
 
important — hot and insane.
She’s uniformed and he’s nonplussed
her cream flesh pressing her tunic breathes —
long lunch they park by the river in seventh heaven
dense breathless pathways to explore —
undergrowth, sunbursts — bless — it’s shameful
how much pleasure can be had in a car —
the fire’s downtown. At night stars rush
 
their infinities of love, cool candles to look at
but hot as tongues each with one word,
stars are so far apart there’s no need, no hurry.
With daylight traffic come the humans.
Around here, the atoms are excited.

From Island Earth: New and Selected Poems (Brandl & Schlesinger, 2012).
 
 
Rapptown
A jingle woke and gee-up knew.
Who prime-numbered the village —
routed the countryside? a wolf sack
filled with of courses, perhapses, and maybe.
Power feeds the organ’s gaskets, postures,
lizard, plasma, shouting blue — schism —
people believe and behave. Where country
and town woe begone, the cars breathe fire.
There was relax and friend-hut, warmth
to the chilled the shelterer provided;
a gentle hand opened a door to the future
and the village? A nymph went wild — a guest’s
wheels — then the bull exploded, the creek
flooded, the shower screen was brilliantine.
 


 


Meaning
 
We lived in electricity’s future
exulted the daily bread benign Astroboy
mesmerised the workstation earned drudgery
kind of lonely I guess we became the first robot writers
Hello Kitty or some useful software to put me to sleep
make me one with the telephone: the mind-saving
Doctor Hardcore has the answer to our ills:
walk into vanishing lake, the fence posts are teeth
and the hills undulate like breasts, nurture the homesteads.
O dusk-powered frogs sing, the insects reach crescendo
give heart the blinding truth (sun and gum tree) harmony
transfixes the glory hallelujah clouds drift the livelong day
praise yet without the passions eternity is endless hygiene
and the earth and sky drift apart (far thunder), happens.

From Island Earth: New and Selected Poems (Brandl & Schlesinger, 2012).My poetic background is in the avant-garde tradition, having come to poetry through an MA in poetic practice at Royal Holloway, which has a decidedly experimental focus. In the years following my MA, I have fused my education in the experimental with an interest in making fragmented and new ‘versions’ of lyric and confessional voices within my work. In doing this, three of my biggest influences have been Frank O’Hara, Bernadette Mayer, and Alice Notley.
I’m really interested in the casual mixture of humor, pop-culture spirituality, performative ‘confession,’ and affect within O’Hara’s work, and all of these things certainly infiltrate my practice. Through my writing I try to foster a sense of intimacy and vulnerability, often using direct address and ruptured forms of the confessional mode. At the same time, I try to make these things strange or new through incorporating the violent language of the corporation, of globalization, or by placing such moments within the banality of the everyday. All of these tactics are surely O’Hara-isms of one kind or another.
I’ve also been influenced by the (mis)use of historic or archaic forms in Mayer’s work, particularly with regards to the sonnet form. My first book, a, is held together by a sonnet cycle which explores the sudden death of my girlfriend, and my exploration of the limitations and potentials of the sonnet form definitely allowed me to develop my writing. To this day I’ve an unhealthy attachment to the ten-syllable line. I’m also really interested in Mayer’s interpretation of the traditional use of the sonnet as a relatively private or intimate space in which to express romantic/sexual love in order to investigate what such themes might sound like if we shrug off sentimentality and archaic forms of expression whilst retaining the formal and thematic elements of the sonnet form; TV and fisting replacing flowers and trees as love’s language.
Finally, and more recently, Alice Notley’s poetics has been a huge influence on my writing. At the level of the book or ‘whole’ project I’m very interested in Notley’s tendency to work in large conceptual projects which merge historical interests, research and language with autobiographical materials. I have recently completed a book length manuscript, SHE!, which attempts to do just that: it’s at once an ethnographic investigation into the cultural history of the lesbian as a public figure — mostly looked at through the language and imagery of lesbian pulp fiction from the 1950s and ’60s — and a form of documentation of events in my own life over three turbulent years, reflecting on the various ways in which bodies take shape and are shaped, and at times become public property with which to mark the boundaries of hegemonic space.
I’m currently working on a project entitled souvenir, which I began as part of my residency at the V&A museum, London, earlier this year. The aim of the project is to create a series of texts which treat small moments in time and domestic objects as museum artifacts. In this project I am also trying to deal with my poetic legacy, attempting to create interesting forms of lyric and confessional voices. I am also working on a series of text installations and found objects created from fragments of the poems, designed for domestic spaces.

Bold Lines Pushing Up 
 
We were talking about magma pushing boldly out of the earth,
it was bursting through the trees, it bloomed for a while,
cooled to a clear line of mountain descending
like a cinnamon brush-stroke.
 
I was thinking: my life could be a drowning seed
and you are the waters of the ocean,
or you’re a spun cotton twister on the surface of the ocean,
an elemental song, ephemeral as dance.
 
Then: that particular kind of sadness,
a forest’s edge
struggling against a canyon’s stomach,
struggling into a conversation
loaded with consonants, slim wakes
of rocky smoke, hot wind’s creek
flooding daylight.
 
I was thinking of an open, or a sadness
becoming itself, still growing, still
without a body
(an expectation crying from the gulf)
(‘           ’ drowning in a void)
 
(now: headlights burn into my thoughts and I lose them).
 
I was thinking of how little I say, and of how much we say to one another:
the pace of an escarpment against a river;
a river threading between the forest and the night.
We say ‘forest’
but what we mean to say,
of the trees and their swaying black hole, is swept up in the wind.
What we say is windy as vowels.
 
As if this gets us anywhere.
 
I was searching for a beginning without you.
I’d wandered back to the canyon’s tawny yawning,
the waterfalls tumbling down silently
between its teeth.
You turned those waterfalls into icicles,
curtains of water frozen into spears
and thrown across the vast lungs of the ocean.
 
Then: chocolate rock. Then: late sky, glowing.
The breathing, the translucent, volcanic sap
which overwhelmed me like a surging wave, like an accord,
those intimate contours.
An icy crystal spinning quickly. A word.
An edge of light.
We always wrote of ‘late sky’
and ‘late summer’
as if, at their ends, the days and the seasons revealed themselves
or made clear their intentions,
as if we, like the terrible stretch of that great valley,
were frozen in search of silence.
I remember thinking: our saying its name protects us from it.
We spoke in order to begin,
rivets of wood and wind in the rock.
 
I pulled light’s soft blanket over us,
its leafy-wet membrane stained
by the booming capital of a continent.
Towers burst from the pampas and forests swarmed
while a mouth’s shallow soil
crumbled into murderous drops.
Our roots reached blindly,
wrenching into sharp crucifixes. They caught the ‘we,’
let it dangle fantastically
over the velocity of a dark-skinned trench.Joaquim Mondal’s Poetry

You better speak, since you have come this far
like the empty sigh on a bum’s manuscript or
the whispers about someone’s failed marriage, as far as you’ve
piled up passive resistance: look no culture they have just cash, fast cash
look they drink liquor with rice with those ill-dressed damsels
I copy in the language of the tongue
in the neurons of a tape recorder, is there a Buddhist shaman inside sodium?
his violet robe has worn off, right after immigration check
a temple had asked for some donation
large empty canvas, I first apply some discolored white acrylic on the panel
then from the thick brush with a sudden gush of monastic air
rolls an empty street’s mid-day preparation
 
April in the flesh

To Romania’s Jenica or any of those prostitutes from Eastern Europe
 
I didn’t ask which country
As the conversation elongates I get a sense of the artery’s bruises.
It hurts you to see any road, any cloth or paper turn red
As pigeons push through soft October in the park, I can see
in the breeze black patches
in the seat of eyes attuned to unsleeping
Our riverine mother coast.
 
Characters from the book have turned into statues 
that this steel rain wets
A secret journal tells me that.
As the silhouette of nakedness wets
a wing pulsed by touch
Salty and ashen air.
 
Stepping out of the house to see the hackneyed foam-wrapped stores
float, continuous two-way traffic into the root cellar, I return
a side-turned flight touches huddling boobs
Fluorescence from the sex-shop angling across the window
A bird made from a plain knife
On the bedside table

What do we write with
in these naked neuron receptors      acid
camera and x-rays!
1 or 2 letters from apparently engrossed cities
The narrative or uninformation
muted with eyes closed
in the crevices between rusty iron piles and the imaginary line
divorcing suicide from a rose
The man who tore away from the teeming Saturday cross-streets
hand in hand with a hooker —
I call him writing.
 
A summer mid-day prepares itself
as it slowly turns pages of a yellowed book, a dog cooling off in the swamp
A new couple moaning behind holidaying closed doors
Opium color on a shalik’s plume, darkness dense wet walls
 
Where does he go in this otherland of no-identity?[1]

How much can these troubled hands mean to earthly body?
Winter strangulates marmoreal youth
I would never wish that its meat slacken
eyes from sweatdrops turn salty
In this wronged jungle the city tightens
around throat and nerve, vomiting blood
If language dies, to absent thoughts and poets
will imagery drift
to the temporary park      an empty bench
 
Is not for any of us

I am not going to write about sunyata. I have hidden intimate hollers in my torn creases. Then I’ll place the rebel secrets in a terrorized season. Even the walks in the garden hide weaponry. In the dawn of evenings, a darkness cannot sleep, densifying raindrops feel like rice grains, and is that why this harvest-fair is a kind of hunger?[2]

Let someone else speak of time, of patience and apprehension from mired rhyme scrape out these burnt bright nights. Whose nest fills your head? Of the mail pile? Who would you like to read where? Your language has snapped. Burdened with history. Devoid of fiction, of intersections. In this pure winterless jatismar country dark fields open, hidden thorns and the cards of fog, and from this unfriendly wet who is it that has deserted us leaving unsealed the pout of past century, some ambitious comrade, a detached photo lyrical, suddenly a piano vines up to my ear a four quartet[3]

Those words, I’d like to sit beside. Critters from inside the grave-pit. Botched phrases make the salt of a silent tongue. It needs more scribbling. But why me? Where did I error? In my abdominal fat? On the fogged street? In the broken line of the river? In exchange these transformers, structuralist dreamers stand up amongst my angst-ridden and in order to fiercely grapple on to some hard thing, this metal pen I found, with clenched teeth and a pressured palm some firm writing calls upon
 

22
 
There is a jungle inside. A walker’s path and its clutter of broken picnic bottles. I don’t ask you to come barefeet, neither to clean out this trash, not an effort nor participation no acceptance or rejection, no sad sigh trends suspended in a philosophical paradox, just a proposition for a quiet pause leaning against these errored signs
 

23
 
If one could hide wound and incompetence behind these lines and letters. I put my hand on the bleak throb and pray for more strength. I say you need to know antiquity better of words to put them to proper use, since the evolution of the metal age, men haven’t forgotten it. Wound or incompetence is actually an animal kind. Have all signs of life. And dying?
 

26
 
I have arrived on the bright shore of an island. Noise didn’t let me feel the un-depths of its affection. Call these processions an act of crying. I know how faces sink and how around the rough edges of our community-skin spreads a chromium of fear.[4]

Not static flaccidity, but a womanly walk along the fruit-market. As the last sabado metro leaves, the discotheque/shelter — from these options I pick my old neighborhood. The way I step into is never homeward bound. Little homes arrested in language's temporary cauldron. Roads unrivaled, stonewashed with no asphalt. Floats in the one across the museum, music of a lesser taste, luring men into video parlors. Painting, music, letters italicized, all gravitate towards their country of origin. But what is country? Old songs? Eyes moist from the hearings? Our headcount of realities never taut with that. Who keeps the count? Wet feelings, vapor and coffin in front of dark chocolate doors. A different road rebounds from each one. Wetness hangs in the air.

A face for each moment
Newer instants only mildly tagged. With olden faces.
Secretly awake
unmindful untidy in creases and cleavages
Marks without much expression

Once I’ve seen the entire presence turn to stone. Words carving into iron and stone, and minerals into the words, immobility is sculpture. At the end of back-breaking labor, in the sun’s pile a BOW bulls-eye the city-center. Head down, I walk. Winter’s usual security tucked into my pocket. When no one’s there, god is. If is? I see with the softness of a bird’s eye, were the promises have erred? Why do we get out?
 

45
 
Grace in our words,
but I suffer to celebrate
At the blunt end of feelings, this country
We move towards languagelessness
Writers on the bench trying to better best best your outdated narrative
Here is mercy
For how long can life live box-bound? 
 
 




Differentiation

Risk = Possibility X Consequence
 
I may not be able to meet him at 6 PM
Possibility = 5; Consequence = 2
Therefore, Risk = 5 X 2 = 10
 
During monsoon, next year, the Damodar could send its tide into their home
Possibility = 2; Consequence = 5
Risk = 2 X 5 = 10
 
Relativity is born from the difference between the two 10s
 
The unknown bird doesn’t call from its wooden cage
Between the concepts a balcony ran endlessly
Planning does not have to contradict promise
Manners play, of certain fruits and pets
Its natural that many possibilities would
Keep a safe mathematical distance from their outcomes
Protracting light n’ shade cover my early life
And with calculated risk can see my vanity
Is made temporary by the unit of conventional time — a tool of evolution
 
Ancient eyes losing affection
A clan of colored eagles fixeted on Mahua
Call on the barmen in white uniform
Place a cocktail order
All of this carry enough proof
 
That the northern and southern limits of nostalgia are gradually fading
As differentiation embeds itself into some research subject
Of volatility, vanity, feelings and promise
Waiting for the Arabian night to get over
As frequency and wavelength maintain a kind of relativism
In their continuing symbiosis[1]
 


A Gothic Recipe
As he told me, “You don’t have to have too many elements in a film, but whatever you do, must be all right elements, the expressive ones.” Simple-sounding advice, which nevertheless touched upon one of the fundamental principles of art — economy of expression.
Many would keep their words now
It’s relatively easier with all negation withdrawn
Time’s unit, too, could lead to a limitless search
as we familiarize in private
A relentless retiree might spend all his rest looking up a word
 
Deconstruction is literally destruction
unless a certain constructive talent rises from the simmer
 
Talent — unitless, relative, immeasurable, an idea that pertains to easily charmed warm-
blooded mammals
 
who are then, the immoderate influential
servility of clannish beings, a derogatory address
 
I don’t like the mild light, the natter
Take off the artificial completely
Let the tattoo on your back touch the neon flame
That body is rhetorical and clockless
looking for its own history
 


Those Letters 
 
Thank you for your letter. Because of the large volume of mail I receive, I am unable to write personal responses. Nevertheless, know that I read and save every letter, with the hope of one day being able to give each the proper response it deserves.
 
Until that day,
 Most sincerely,
There is no “heart” anywhere in my carefully saved letters
“Mind” is a different thing, as we know
I nurture the idea of the birth
of an expectant subconscious
In reality there cannot be a proper personal response to any question —
But a question represents its inquirer
 
Let’s hope some letter will arrive
whose proper response is known
and that it rests in my archive will be mentioned in reply
And upon never quite receiving that desired letter
that day I might think — with each receipt is born
a saga of a certain loneliness
 
Letters and knives have been bound by a historic relationship
Elegy or anniversary celebrations — are both acts of escapism
A written note of promise is a common desire
 
Fables written by the lovely twinning of pictures
with such unwritten letters
transport our youth to a crucial juncture
where rejection becomes the usual course
and one’s belief in a parallel galaxy turns out
easy and acceptable
 
Letters written on colored paper come in white
envelopes and vice versa
My conscious letters have a single recipient, a thousand subscribers
privately construing a distinctly different tale
in every word-pair
while others look for amazement
to light up their solitary wordly lives
 
 
While listening to the church organ
 
Not sure if I’m perplexed or pleasantly illusioned
when I listen to the church organ
— But you are an atheist!
Perhaps, Sunday morning’s confession
sex sins of someone knelt down before polished mahogany
makes me tired at times — I believe in gradual modulation
— What about those birthdays then?
Why no one puts out the candles now!
Shadowy hatred in real deep
deep in D-sharp
— Do you feel any presence in the margins, in the nodes?
I see helixes in their lips, enchanted strings
and their complex mathematical shenanigans
— Can she comprehend you?
Of course, I eat ice cream on the beach
— Does that mean you like the sea, openness?
Blue is the color, whose wavelength defines my atheism
Vibration is often a confession from which
many gods and church singers are born
So we all love the gradual modulation
 
And some love blue.
 

 
Midway: A Requiem
after Chris Jordan’s photographs
 
Friend or flow              	bird brain
Container carcass joy not joined the
Thrump of dead sea gyser       	you?
Notepad limerick bean so
Nurdle up sea goo catastrophe yo
Strophed to death and damn proud of it
Like an oatmeal bowl the size of
Texas tea on the trolley and
Surplus in the bank so
Rank smelling soft tissues gone
Theatre of the synthetic core
Dreams torn open and they repealed that hmm?
They did            notaries and no publics voted
Mongst rockeries garden gnomes and
The humpback swallowing six parts
Plastic to one part plankton
The birds’ hollow bones —
What’s inside them? Ideas of
Flight and Amelia Earhart seas
See? All the way to midway y’all
 
 
They were container ships in their bodies
Throat singing Aleutians or cosmic
Volcano crops asking wherefore
Stoppst thou chain and fractionates
Even water enclosed bottles bad?
No bottles to cap all the surface of
Lids and lighters	 unhand me loon!
The beach bends and shines elastic
In forensic light follicles and fume
Giant flame we melt the earth
And vacuum form its goo into
Better planets yo
Ochery? No
More ochery still
The colour drained from
Our faces in space
Mirror mirror on the water wall
Who sank us sank a seed in sound
 
 
Doffed at port or spilt
From rivers’ foul mouths
Out of the sea he came!
Turtle shell waxed and honed
To hump another planet over
The ridge’s loud bassoon
No ingredients? No problem
We’ll mold something sport or
Cambrian pool nurdles crop
Genetic nurdles sowed for corn
He was tyrannous strong
Opened one bottle
After another
Tossed lids
To lightning realms
Scoffed at wastes
Found other plants to his taste
 
 
Then nightingale harvests the
Low trough between waves
Pacifics of rage to bear the costs
Of voyage for the goop we spilt
Milking time a space for
Something not solid not liquid
Drops his name in a hat and
Wins millions don’t want it?
Toss it
Flame can’t burn
Sun don’t degrade
Lips it off like
Hey albatross fuck you!
So it ate the food it ne’er had ate
cap / cap / lighter / pen / cap / lighter / cap
Came to our hollo for
Food or play
And paid the debts we’d
Raised our roofs for
 
 
It’d been nicer just to have shot them
Slow cough and choke gag leach
Chemical starve or gizzard burst
No sweet bird did follow hollow
Coracle or foam
The links that bind
The links that break
No sweet bird
Painted that sea
Found itself a nest
Of plastics bodied forth
 
 
There is no climate
Or element
Without one or more
Capsized and damn
Proud of it
Paint poured down the sink
It’s what their parents fed them
They didn’t know
Sweet bird diving
Into a sea that was no sea
Petroleum and a Texas
Twice the size of the Pacific
 
 
It just took off
Like witch’s oils
Burnt green sea
Was a war / then a dump
Some in dreams assuréd were
Come back to haunt to haunt it still
Landfill planet for lease what’s next?
Sea fill
Put it in a baggie yo
Zip-lock minds at full distraction
And every tongue          through utter drought
Was withered at its root
 
 
Sweet bird
Cargo hold
Seems we needed
Bodies to keep things in
Or hide them
Container ships to flight we flew
Out over denizen seas
Caprice? The colour was
What mattered
Micro or polymer
Clack of coin n’est pas?
Eureka from the
Tub of goo
Oil oil toil and trouble
Maintenant?
A fountain of feathers
And coloured forms gathered
On sands 3,000 miles
From here
Here?
A region of forms
Going under
Dollar by dollar
Dense and desired
 
 
Sweet bird
Can’t train you
Can’t train ourselves
A speck
A mist
A shape
Same thing
We just bolt
What we find
Then pass it on
To our children
I see a sea at sunset sold
Fly fishing on TV
Gravol and hangovers
Pretends it’s estrogen funk
Strip flake flame
Keep ochre dawn bilge
Sweet bird
I see a sea of resins soft
 
 
Must it always be a lament?
Cawed on the gravel and was gone
Omnivorous or just a plastivore
I want to be happy too	          malleable
Islanded and shored up on my own
No man an island who cares yo?
No bird neither
No woman no home
Sweet bird
Canary mines or corpuscular cave at sea
 
 “It’s Hard to Explain What You Really Like about Rick Perry Anymore”
 
It’s hard to explain what you really like about poetry anymore.
When I was 17, no I was 25, but 24 or 5 was my poetry 17,
I spoke with John Ashbery about getting poetry out there
And he said let’s keep it our secret, but I think there are 2 Ashberies,
2 of me too, because who likes poetry? Let me explain.
Someone once said I don’t like poetry but I like what you do.
Poetry that is poetry is corn. I know that Ashbery really likes poetry
But underneath it all he knows better. That’s why you like what he does.
He has to hate poetry to like poetry. But owning up to that would make him
The teen I will always be. Some truths are inconvenient. But Ashbery can
Conveniently undermine and trump and qualify and digress from the truth
As it sails over. These things are not supposed to happen yet they do.
Stretching the truth if not overriding it pops the language qua language
Out of poetry, through the theater, and into the hyper definition of your
Weird heart. But Ashbery may not be the greatest poet of the last third
Of the last century. John A. said it was James Schuyler and I believe HIM.
If Ashbery and Schuyler are the two great late twentieth century poets
It is through diametrically opposite though similarly motivated strategies.
Ashbery like a great yet understated Abstract Expressionist painter
Marks shifting frames in alternating objective and subjective authenticities
Wearing one another’s nametags. In other words, he avoids the bull of
So-called poetry by avoiding breaking the plane of real poetry, by being
Strong enough to resist meaning anything outside poetry.
He does not take the bait. Or if he bites he keeps masking the taste,
Spitting it out, getting other stomachs, whatever it takes to mix spookily
Comic cosmic metaphors. But Schuyler does something different.
He takes objects and grinds them into film, I mean like Stan Brakhage,
And “Moth Light” has been on YouTube for years now. Ashbery
Marvels at how Schuyler is not only good but means something,
But only able to do that by “Freely Espousing,” by lapping language
Against itself within its diminutive super bowl: “a commingling sky”
“Cast[ing] the blackest shadow” from the Adam’s rib of “a semi-tropic
Night” that also is “the easily torn, untrembling banana leaf.” In a sense,
“Freely Espousing” is a Kenneth Koch meat in the
Sandwich of another poem-essay, the point spilling out of its eyes is that
“Freely Espousing” lists “marriages of the atmosphere” such as
“Oh it is inescapable kiss” “and tickle” and “Quebec … Steubenville
Is better?” and “the sinuous beauty of words like allergy/the tonic
Resonance of/pill when used as in / “she is a pill.” And yet the euphoria
Of the freely espoused doth bespeak the Schuyler poetry persona,
The truth consistent with that constantly put in his own humbly
Self-topping way. So he’s not that different than Ashbery
Though stagecraft is important too. Schuyler speaking through
Himself is like the “couple who / when they fold each other up / well,
Thrill. That’s their story.” Against this backdrop, using this moth
Light stuff, stuff of thing (thing from the Old English for “coming
Together”) light, Schuyler tells stories of lost stories. “Cultural
Treasures” “have an origin” that the cultured “cannot contemplate
Without horror” (Benjamin). “Back,” within Schuyler’s
“The Payne Whitney Poems” suite paradoxically recalls
These forgotten origins in Benjamin-like mode: “from the Frick. … /
It was nice / to see the masterpieces again, / covered with the striker’s
Blood. / What’s with art anyway, that / we give it such precedence? /
I love the painting that’s for sure. / What I really loved today
Was New York, its streets have / men selling flowers and hot dogs
In them.” “Back” values the street life of New York above that
City’s “masterpieces.” You can just see the “hot dogs” in “flowers”
Seeming more of the day yet somehow more like art. “Back”
Also demonstrates relationships amongst beauty and
The relatively poor and the seemingly uncultured. Ultimately, however,
Juxtaposing Walter Benjamin magnifies for me a slight but huge
Distinction between how to view redemption. For Christians,
And Schuyler during his last years was an Episcopalian,
The messiah has already come and his return will merely restore
Some kind of order and balance. However, for Jews such as Benjamin
And the teen, pre-poet, late sixties, and now and again me,
The messiah “brush[es] history against the grain.” The two messiahs,
Even if the same damn messiah, couldn’t be more different. Oddly,
If only in this respect, Judaism becomes diametrically more radical.
We see this in how Schuyler’s “A Few Days” perpetually prefigures
Death a-coming to end the poem, the death of the poet’s mother
Anticipating the poet’s premonitions of his own imminent death.
Thus the poem is in several ways a perfect story in accord with
How Benjamin’s “The Storyteller” describes one. For Benjamin,
Stories have been replaced by information, data and literate knowledge,
They supplant worldly experiences craftspeople and travelers
Tell like a comingling sky for storytelling likes loose causal
Connections and the proximity of death but modern life demands
Taking strict causality seriously. Modernity puts death behind a hospital curtain
But “A Few Days” see through it, doggedly, with one of Schuyler’s
Most paradigmatic and personal moves, describing plants and vegetation
And other natural subjects like the weather with enthusiastic and reverential
Albeit at times whimsical attention. Schuyler affirms experience and, further,
Death is not usually far from the most forefront in “A Few Days” and
Its musing. Like Frank O’Hara Schuyler’s “A Few Days”
Uses death doubly, to sharpen all that it relates, true,
But also with the greatest specificity. Death becomes a counter to life
Necessary in the linking of its most unrelated its constituents, and
“A Few Days” does the hard work of integrating death within and to
Loosely associated Benjaminesque storytelling components in a long
Poem whereas “The Day Lady Died” shocks us with death’s sudden
Aptness, eating up by first putting it in a sandwich that is all that is
And was and will be everything near and dear to the poem’s speaker.
Both “A Few Days” and “The Day Lady Died” respond to the impersonal
And seemingly objective public space discussed by the early Schuyler
Muse/influence (and subject within “A Few Days”) W. H. Auden
In his “Musée des Beaux Arts” and elsewhere wherein we are
Shown to be depressingly cold to a hot cool of death. “Musée des
Beaux Arts” comments on our excruciating need for Schuyler’s
Benjaminian storytelling mode. Within terms set by this flaky mini-essay,
“A Few Days” immaculately, wonderfully, even magically awaits a death
That if perhaps a part of a welcome, irrefutable order, nonetheless, 
This order made accessible through the partial inaccessibility ofThe Nail I
Where I am — generic architecture
like a barn or a bach but
neither of those things.
Feral fennel clots the air with ammonia
and the usual marks are everywhere —
burnt stumps and discarded branches,
their currency clattering at the night-window.

I’ve planned a list of the things I will steal:
a Crown Lynn cup and saucer,
an ashtray printed with Foxton: the Foxy Town,
and a remote control like the one I lost.
But I won’t. I will leave this place
cleaner than when I arrived.

If I could get things right on a small scale,
if I could lay the right things
at the feet of the wooden women
who circle the ladder to heaven.
Or reign Foveaux’s rusty breath
to skirt these hingeless doors.
But my vision is divided like a horse’s
and my pockets hurt from the fists
I’ve shoved in them.
Round back the mutton birders are dumping buckets
of bodies in the kitchen sink,
the ovens and deep fryers gearing up a notch.
We prepare ourselves by mumbling a song
taught to us this morning
half naïve native, half colonial huckster
sung to a Beatles tune.
Standing on the grass, I let a nail
pushed from rusted metal
pierce the sole of my shoe.




We’re All Here Buried 

Alive under fifteen feet of pure white snow,
my plan for survival is to slowly eat my floral cotton dress.
I will do it remembering summer and the heady days
of edible garden flowers when everyone was mad
for poached pears and crumbled Stilton;
when it was the thing to bring the most expensive savvy and call it plonk.
Everything pre-earthquake, everyone walking on tip-toes
over the rumpled rug of our own fault
lines. The wee earnest man from St John’s
did a number on my sister — she forked out
hundreds for a survival kit
with free plastic carry case,
tablets that promised to turn the future putrid waters
into evian, dried biscuits that would feed the army
and a silver jacket that if nothing else, would prove
to the others who’s boss.
Letters are bunging up the letter box.
No one has taken down their Christmas lights.
The aborted pine browns to rust 
in the backyard, embarrassed to be so dead.





Takaka
I think of the moth I rescued from the candle
and how I cupped it carefully in my hands
so as not to frighten it.
How I turned it out into the night
and how sorry I was to see the beginnings of a fine rain.
I don’t know when I lost the fear of things
smaller than my hands.
There was a time, when we would return 
each earth worm to the brown turf
rather than see them strand themselves
like tiny sea slugs on the pavement.
It made for a long walk home to a house
with no power or phone and one candle that burned.
What is it to rescue something from one death
only to propel it to the next?
I apologize for my hands, the way they look and
the gestures they make. One day I will take the palmist’s advice
and return to my green witch roots,
dig my hands into the soil and grow trees from saplings.
On the main road in Takaka, I let go of your daughter’s hand.
It was so small and slippery like a baby bird.
She ran out onto the street and the driver of the car
who slammed on his brakes screamed,
‘What kind of a mother are you?’
We went to a café and drank our water in silence.
Your daughter tipped the sugar from its bowl,
and slowly pushed the granules into shapes on the table.




I grew up reading Japanese, French, Spanish, and North American (not English) poetry, writing in isolation until I met Eleni Sikelianos, Carla Harryman, and Kevin Killian on September 28, 1993, at Carla Harryman’s Poets’ Theatre in San Francisco — and this changed everything. I moved to the USA because I wanted to be in a community of poets and artists, and it was in San Francisco (and later New York) that I met the poets with whom I feel the greatest affinity — the closest being Lisa Jarnot and Eleni S.
My writing has models in cartoons, music, film, montage, and painting as much as in poetry. My original poems (as they said about Pound) are often translations — and my translations are often original poems. Collage, detournement, Flarf, lyric, translation, conceptual, homophonic, and plagiarized moments often happen in the same poem — the pleasure (hopefully) lies in the mess and the mix. (“Are you supposed to write only one kind of poetry? I don’t think so” — Bernadette Mayer.) I want surprise, play, passion, and engagement with the quotidian, and I reject the idea that I am teaching anybody anything. I hope to write open, happy, clear, immediate, political, personal, complex, inclusive, serious, lasting poems that testify to both the pleasures and horrors of being an international, utopian artist in an exciting, beautiful, hideous world.
Jean-Michel Basquiat’s mix of text, figurative and abstract work, John Zorn’s energy and clearly differentiated projects, and Lee Perry’s dancing and mooing cows have all been important influences — as much as Bernadette Mayer, Issa, Mark E. Smith, Clark Coolidge, John Betjeman, Gertrude Stein, Alice Notley, Kenneth Koch, Hiromi Ito, Joe Ceravolo, P. G. Wodehouse, Mac Wellman, Joanne Kyger, and Wallace Stevens — not to mention, nowadays, UK contemporaries such as Richard Parker, Amy De’Ath, Jonty Tiplady, Sophie Robinson, Holly Pester, and Jeff Hilson. Poetry is a conversation among equals, be they 2,600 or twenty-six years old.
English poetry is suddenly in the happy state of being wide and generous enough to feel confident in its ability to draw upon art, music, the emotions, beauty, surrealism, language writing, comedy, the diverse strands of the New American Poetry, and, even (after a long time being banned by an academy which valorizes overwrought language and intellectual showing off) some kind of recognizable, erotic, and enjoyable LIFE. This is the happy and generous environment in which we find ourselves — at last! It has been a long time coming.
 


Horace
the innumerable years
full of nobbers
& the transitory habits of murkin
are forming the roaring Bospherous
Syrtes’ self-made minge of spinach
& Upton-on-Severn
Edgar & Johnny
clink to the raiders’ spunk
more splendid than the Starkeys’
thin pamphlets & halitosis
on the neck of
translations
you know how no cincture of ropes
worry about you now I long to regurgitate
Bern stars and the sailor’s
KY, the seeps of whingers wax
shall worm to no other women, I —
more runched against than runching

Petrarch #120
I write to assure you that I have not yet felt   from whom I & all the world await   her final bites
Women who imitate birds
Women who assume knowledge in men when there are none
Women who are searching for some sense in the journey when they meet which may or may not happen
Women    unseen     may produce the same effect
Women who favor soap
Women who speak to animals in order to have sex
Women who remember the name of 9 to 13 sided shapes
Women who sleep and women who do not
Women nameless to the nearest twitter
Women whose love folds the hole in the stone
Women in Durer
Women adrift in an organ of something’s lightless glare   doubt-dried  & dreamless
Women who exist versus those in whose Laura     possibly      don’t
Women whose ovaries contain pearls    cars    broken off syllables      existence & great books

(from Petrarch, Barque 2011)

for — as all — for & for Koto & Yuki
When I was alive I would type like this  the three fingers of the right hand
And the two of the left   or hold a pear   thus  or
Take the skin off a cucumber with a device in the right hand and the pleasure
Of the white flesh and transparent seeds in a kitchen   for example
Forever cloudless   when I was dead    I was alive      it is a wind
Because this is the fashion   & the season is
In me     more than ever       & if heavier on the right-hand  spine side   
From excessive dancing in an empty room
Uncountable like     clouds from above     & I have seen them      here as a reporter
Unremarked upon   in human life   in the nose   in the eyes     Ha! — a Dad hand
Held in the man      when I was alive  
Let it be said it is enough to be in love  
With a daughter light      of whom there is but one     in this small poem
Of which there was but one    & to hold it all going              in this small room   & yet remarkable

(from Petrarch, Barque 2011)

Crayoned large enough to impress upon the world & the need to jump off it
at the edge of the eye where the cornea meets the A13
this hand is a wing and the other moving in front of the candle too thus painted
on the inside of Essex    is a bat or a bird
where music fears the ground of the strip malls of Romford & Barking  
& the light off the Cortinas & breast tops
touch the edges of the Thames Delta
in the detective novel      naked among warm summer leaves boys & goth girls
lovely to be fucking great for a while
lovely as patchouli oil on a woman called Lora from Birmingham
wearing white lipstick in markets & knowing the prices of the grapes & the melons
holding black orange pale blue & pink plastic products made in Hong Kong & not failing in conversation
reading Marx in the park & touching his cock
for all humanity beneath the shade of the trees
when we were French & were irresistible
when we wrote slogans about the necessity of roughage the sexual imperative & blowing
when we were doing this men in polyester in the Caribbean
& men in polyester in the shitty peninsular states between guessing & knowing
& men smarter than us in mixed fiber suits in lovely buildings
going about their business kept on going
without our illuminating the insides of unmanageable buildings
without sanction or knowledge fucking the destruction of workers’ collectives or non-competitive contact sports
without loving the money behind which they lay hidden
barking worked     in the way that a dialect caresses a language
& the tanks do not accept it
& the pixies & the fairies & elves then come in
& their little eyes rolling
& the confusion of police dogs
their shining fur
lovely for an instant
to both bite & be bitten

Petrarch #366
The boys are singing to drive away the noxious birds
Before women it is useful to practice on statues
& now I am here to tell you all that I have discovered
That living is one of the best things — there where I ripped it
That her eyes couldn’t have been more beautiful — I just thought they were
Driving my utopian car over the dystopian roads
I go over and look at myself
& look surprised
Because living is one of the best things     I go over
I stand there listening to the sunshine burning the grass
My horn a crumpled dream
Earthlings! Comrades! Adios!
Work out your salvation with diligence
As if all things were still possible

red sky cast offs

just a flick, a screwed off lid
of a jar saved from recycling
remaining now as a piece of sound — one
bracketed indication of rain
not as it is but as it is collected
on a wave-like surface made of tin
the ding of a machine, a bird scuffles
just a chick, now a honk
but not a goose (what would it be
doing up there?) then more scuffling
an animal hard to imagine
puppet-like — a day when it dims
“to make up for yesterday”
so you sweat inside a plastic jacket
but need it for the rain and
a siren cuts through it
to remind you of something
the previous bracket of life, twenty-five
minutes ago, unlocking the door
and coming around the side
the moving weight of cars, not
hostile but not altogether
friendly either (what if you had
an engine beneath you?) their
pleasurable version of floating
around, sleep in your eye, a radio
still as a drum, porous, agreeable
and annoying, a day: a gallery
or a tram, why not both? damp
salty surfaces and people hanging
their jackets up, sighing as if the weather
were a newspaper, dangerous day,
singing, ebullient outside, teeth
gritted against the weather, “the first
wave” as musicians fold over pillows
and go back to sleep, toast
from wood-like, two-day-old
bread: put what you don’t eat
in the compost, remember
the slighter changes in depth or pressure —
now a gull, yesterday a magpie
city birds, a teaspoon against
porcelain, a brush with the day, so far

Do not lick lid
 Experience is the lazy equivalent they don’t teach you,
or won’t. How the squished model plane gets renovated
or reading becomes a metaphor for artful youth:
a failed beehive, the days not spent
lustrously combing backyards for lost farthings,
unopened cans of Kalgoorlie Bitter,
 
A thinned down set of golf clubs, the coastal
variety. Wound down the window to yell something.
Anything. That’s what tamed zebras are for,
riding around on — look, there’s one with its casing removed,
ecstatic rus in urbe, sullen roadkill. We greet each other
with mild complaints about the city we live in.
 
 
Pigeon Politics
Having an opinion on it
The crust of what was there before
becomes more rock-like and in places, one can see them
The weekend paper falls apart like meat
 
Downhill skiers arrive and disappear
in shining suits, while by the fireplace
the chef and Matt Preston
serve up perfect agedashi tofu forever
in open mockery of the dialectic

Albania
Back in our day there wasn’t anyone who didn’t know Albania
who didn’t know it was the bright light of European Socialism
or that the other bright light was us. Back then
from Beijing to Tirana, we could all sing
A bosom friend afar brings distance near …  It wasn’t till much later that
I learned these words were by Wang Bo of the Tang
He died a long time ago and was never in Tirana.
I doubt he’d ever heard of the place, much less that it was very, very small.
A pal of ours named Wei Guo once said to us rather cryptically: all
Albania is just like the little upstart kingdom of Yelang.
I remember, I swear: it was the summer of ’74.
We had just turned 12 and thought what he’d said outrageously reactionary.
 
 
Spring Days
I live by myself in Beijing’s Tiantongyuan East Section 3
apartment complex on the first floor in a unit with a large lanai
the apartment belongs to my girlfriend, Ms. “Chrysanthemum” Wang
she used to share the place with me, but now
she doesn’t. She moved further into town, just two stops from Xidan
but still comes round on weekends to gripe and clean
until the middle of the night, when she’ll suddenly recall our sex life
Ah, love in the Nuclear Age! Spring days grow long, and the foliage is lush . . .
I admit that at first I liked giving oral sex
but lately I just like getting it: oral sex had its day but now it’s dead and gone
I’ve squirreled it away in far off Tehran
where there’s oil underground, the women veil their faces
and an entire nation is scrambling to build the bomb
 
 
When We Eat We Never Talk About Sex
Xiao Yang said
it’s not that I don’t want to
but that I never get the chance
when she finished speaking
she turned
and looked out the window
where it was still raining
it was actually only drizzling
but it hadn’t stopped for three days and nights
well then
I said
unless you have an objection
let’s talk about sex
orgasms for instance
Xiao Yang kept looking out the window
beyond which
the rain obscured the distant buildings
like a curtain
you mean my orgasms?
she said
I haven’t seen one of those in a long, long time
like some cat that’s run off and never came back
then
she stopped
I knew there was something
more she wanted to say
but in the end
she didn’t say it

 
  
Sunlight’s Dotted Line
the pace of the snapshot is bovine/ black dogs bend an ear the whole a.m.
a solitary someone at the rim of the world is gleaning something
nearby summits/ structure without rhyme or reason
lilies sing the spring presumptive/ coral tree blossoms sicken abreast
women refurbish their skin on sandy beaches/ a plumped up oil drum
we on sunlight’s dotted line
hold open our palms/ to read a word you cannot see the end of
practice focusing on facing the sea/ facing off a score of smiles
practice your haiku by ear
slope of saw-tooth grass/ bevy of ringdoves
floating conversation/ beer
later, from his pocket, he fumbles up a lump of ice
subliming as vapor
and warm time
thus she’s like a flight of driftwood/ arriving at the stern
rain/ when it falls
they merge, become one/ to help the briny waves turn the page
 
 
His Days Go by the Way Her Years
he smells like bottled root beer
her pie in the sky allays his hunger and his days go by the way her years
he is a lonely plural
her door-latch is sour or sore
the au contraire of plentiful is he
(won’t they help her build her Tower of Basil?)
she hairs his chest he heartens her sweetheart
one day every living soul will turn to soil
he ocean fleets a vessel
she mountain passes a night
Wednesday likes the rain
by rain were they woven into angelfish
eyes unfolded into riddles
yet he steals beneath her iron skin
and leaning on the chair-back of time
gradually invents a kind of knock
the more he is the sun the more she is the moon
 
 
A Blind Date Makes Him Dilapidate
The backdrop was a salty crisp deep green. Their gloom wells into one accord. Some
 cherries turn to glass.
Her right arm smacks of soda cracker. Proliferating fingerprints pule in the air.
Now that Spring’s propped up and filled to bursting \ they’re plump in the middle of their 
first blind date \ he clasps a clap of thunder in his hand \ she closes her eyes like a vacant
 space \ someone is playing music \ someone is carrying a caramel latté \ someone is
 delivering the night \ he deftly pinches up a purplish white thunderprint \ she’s come to
 feel that solitude’s so beautiful so savory \ that she decides to prolong him in his
 dilapidated state
 
 
Her Perspire-y Left Hand Was Semi-Colon-y
That was the 7th day／she was savoring her morning meal on the edge of the islet＼
             the sun was    growly／naupaka
shrubs were like a line of slipshod quotation marks and brackets＼her perspire-y left
             hand was semi-colon-y
the eyes of those certified ㊣ spotted deer no matter how you put it are love are 
             warm and genial seas＼so ease
             -ily／wrung dry
crisp time like apple strudel／people are forever cutting the sheep from the cattle 
everybody needs a Sleeping Beauty and a pug
just like a harbor needs a boat／a hot spring a boiled egg
the prison warden hands out cuffs and locks
coral loiters in the place from whence it came waiting for the ocean to come back
her skin soaks into a kind of solar black＼the sky is looking-glass blue／thatch screw 
              pine a deaf and dumb green
＼every one of the □ □／could find themselves sluiced by the □ □ □ into a 
            watermelon frappe of a summer season
midday over／the □ □ fairly often become fertile
in／the fingerprint of the wind she stumbles on 3 salt＼clumps
her absent-minded look is the Grotto of Guanyin after it grows dark

 
 Attitude 
when shit happens
it only seems to bother us for a day or two
in the morning we wash away our tears
and go tripping out the door
where the sun hangs upon our every word
the very grass lies prostrate at our feet
ten years later
we wind up recalling it with no small pleasure
for the fact is misery can be a remedy
and goes down well with wine
just the thing
to sweeten and enrich a life
when you lose a friend
it’s pretty much the same I guess
everybody nods so knowingly
then makes a quick departure
we’re all so tactful
we let the dead bury the dead

Mutual Recognition
I dreamt you came to see me
you let your hair grow out
and were wearing an orange checkered shirt
and levis cut off at the knees
a perfectly awful outfit that just wasn’t you
nor was the face you wore your own
or the body
you sat quietly for awhile
then got up and left
neither of us said a word
you never once looked back

Smoke, Caution
Haven’t said a word in three days. Haven’t had a smoke.
Saw six movies.
Cape No. 7 wasn’t so good.
All About Women wasn’t so bad. But these Hong Kong directors rather love telling stories 
              from a Beijing Rocks perspective. If the song Kuai Lun-mei sang had been 
              punk …
Punk’d be better off dead.
I even finished watching Ip Man. Very proper and correct. Very soap-operish.
Saw Brokeback Mountain and Lust, Caution for the second time.
A little sentimental conversation can be good now and then.
The sun is so beautiful today. But I gotta go to a godamn meeting.
“Temper, temper!” Y gently urges me.

 
 
I Still Can’t Get My Head Around Why

time and again
my flesh goes out the door without me
to do whatever it damn-well pleases
like getting hot and heavy
in a bathroom stall with some joker
I wouldn’t as a rule give the time of day to
before I break down into a jagging fit
while the real me is left stranded in some absurdly public forum
going on and on about god-knows-what
in some trivial dispute with a horde of characters
who aren’t even there

at other times I find
my flesh possessed
by someone else’s
as if I had become another person
and I’m the perfect model of decorum
as courteous and deferential as a guest

Vase

there must be stallions
that long to return to antiquity
just as certain people grow nostalgic at the mention of silent films
just as certain fresh-cut flowers
wish they were air-dried
and destined for a vase
a vase like that one
white and round and perfectly at peace
though all it does is gather dust
dust so soft and gentle you are moved

Flowers

flowers
are not my forte
no, the thing I have a gift for
is picturing for you a day in spring
of putting an edge on your seasonal regrets

but flowers?
I was never any good with flowers

 Punishing Saddam
The TV is reporting the news
we’re in the middle of dinner
look … that man
turning to see the noose
being placed around his throat
by a guy in a ski mask
the man is clad in a dark suit          but it’s a scene from a slaughterhouse
not the sort of thing you’d expect to run into in your living room
everyone stops what they’re doing           waits
that ain’t granny’s handwork
what ministry came up with that barbaric looking rope?
thick enough to hogtie a god
it’s Saddam they’re hanging           the Lion of Babylon
the neighbors have known him for years
ever since he moved into the TV set
in that remote-control cell they kept him in
his daughters use to come to see him now and then
his beard grown wild and long
shaking his fist in court
suddenly the video is cut off          as if the off-screen
hangman had felt a twinge of compassion
his punishment would not have been so cruel if he hadn’t been so cruel himself
the whole world hears the sound
of a lumberjack felling a tree
no one’s come forth to officially confirm what we’ve seen
we lay down our chopsticks           wait
somewhere in the world a mighty tree has fallen
felled by a storm
the kind they know about in the forests up north
where the snow is now falling
the station cuts to a commercial for cosmetics
they broadcast this stuff for everyone to see
we return to our meal
tell the kids            go do your homework
if you sit there all day            it’ll ruin your eyes
 
 
from Notes

when the city began to rise
the old well sank back
into the dark earth
just like my mother’s mother in her declining years
she had less and less to say
finally fell silent

 
 Doubles
I cannot express it; but surely you and everybody have a notion that there is or should be an existence of yours beyond you. What were the use of my creation, if I were entirely contained here?           — Catherine Earnshaw in Wuthering Heights 

1  
My late good friend was a twinless twin.
 
Didn’t know till the age of eleven, when
on a visit to distant acquaintances
they hadn’t seen since he was born,
his mother was asked,
 
“Where’s the other one?”
 
It was only then she turned to him:
“We never told you …”
 
At sixty-one
he wrote to me, “It shocks me still.
Perhaps he lived and I have died.
Maybe somewhere he writes the book
I talk about, is happily married,
a steadfast father.”
 
                                Stuck with the work
of moving house after years in place,
 
he added, with characteristic smirk
 
“This rather Borges-like fantasy
is not unconsoling. The bugger can do
 
the packing for me.”

I read in the news of twins who died
aged 92, within mere hours
 
of each other and from the same cause;
decades of life spent side by side,
 
brothers in fact and then by choice:
Franciscan friars, rejected by
 
the military for their sight:
one’s bad left eye, the other’s right.
 
Their dad, a doctor, had prayed for a boy
but “the Lord fooled him and sent two.”
 
One was a talker, the other quiet,
but neither would say who was born first,
 
their feat of sameness tended like
the monastic garden they laboured at,
 
the little things that made it count:
the Hours they must have known by rote,
 
the Rule to which they gave their will,
private in life, now singled out.

Also the ones whose names were mere
repeats of babies lost before,
 
(replacement child we call it now):
Vincent van Gogh reading the tomb
 
that bore his name and own birthdate
one year before; Stendhal, or Beyle,
 
of several hundred pseudonyms
as if to self-proliferate
 
could make a man original
could banish repetition,
 
arriving as they did upon
a stage already set for them
 
to improvise: Thank God You’re Here.

Or those who entered on the heels
 
of a mother’s death, whether at birth
or its aftermath, over whom
 
a father’s loss and fancy loom
the “second Mary”: Mary Shelley
 
in St Pancras cemetery
spelling the words on her mother’s tomb
 
while still a child, later the same place,
willow-shaded,
      she’d lie with Shelley
 
body-double, never fully descended
from the womb.

Where do we end             and where begin?
 
You talk of strangeness in our skin
the difference       and the interface
 
tenuous, but all there is
tangled past distinguishing:
 
“till death,” we say, Bist du bei mir
the tenor sings
(if you’re with me …)
 
you wrap me round to stem the shock
that sets my body shivering
 
my father in the hospital
unmoving now
     except for hands
 
lifted my wrist and said, “A vein
the same as mine,”
then let it drop.
 
Twice he mistook me for a nurse –
“You’re so much like my daughter.”
 
His wife of more than twenty years
slept on a makeshift bed beside
 
him in the ward and had to call
every time he tugged the drips
 
and bags and oxygen away,
so many nigglers at his flesh.
 
She felt as if a phantom limb.
He could not tell the nurse his name.
 
Where do we end           and where begin?Sweetness such as flesh
comes out of the horn of William Wellington
It is the sound of pain, made
in the dark of tombs.
But it is golden as peace
as the fire we shared together mornings,
together,
Pink lights around us.
 
But it’s more than that
The rock and roll of to-
day shared with
                                sent
that man made
five thousand years ago a gold
helmet (his) with the black
and white saints of
              Washington Street.
 
Roxbury rocks
right as the ears
which could cure a
                 man
of his despair
dropped as he is in
the dead hole of
    hungry mothers
he removes the bars
and re-erects an
axe to cut through
the walls we build
   in ever higher
tiers around ourselves.  Therefore our
throats he cleans out
your ears telling
    me nights in the past
that it would be a good day
 
              Tonight
the sound is;  fills my
throat with certain
therapy for your pain,
with the greatest ease, undone
the bars of prison
               So long they
surround him.  Only
this instant are
we both walking
avenues of
poplar trees in
              the Sportsman
Bar, shooting big game into the
              arena of space.

Biri
Xi Chuan handed me a biri
the same biri he used to smoke ten years ago
biris aren’t Mores
but they have the same basic flavor
the sexiness of the lower classes
poets smoke biri
and imagine they’re getting a taste of the slums
actually           we’re living on embassy row
beyond the window carpets of green grass          blue-green peacocks pacing
huge black crows
interrupt the endless cackle of our roundtable talk
we feel ashamed            it’s not just that the writing is insipid
or that some are using Hindi            others Thai
Chinese or Bengali
or been debating religion      and the question of the nation-state
so many questions endlessly translated
just like the biri that get smoked by folks from different classes
who place them between their lips, take a pull, hold it in
finally blow it out
ring after ring of depoliticized local flavor

 The Husband of a Younger Cousin on My Father’s Side
… took us sightseeing in the rain and then wined and dined us at a greasy spoon called “Famous Sichuan Fare,” where we were regaled with a “certified authentic” Ma Po Tofu that was absolutely drenched with salt. All the while he rattled on about the day’s fluctuations in the stock market index and was continually on the phone with my cousin, who was holding down the fort on the trading room floor. She’s a physician at a prestigious hospital of Chinese medicine but had elected to take an indefinite sick leave.
“Teahouses? Are there any left? Who’s got time for tea?”
We finally stumbled on one near the Du Fu “Thatched Cottage” Museum with an open court flanked on four sides by corridors with tiled-eaves, under which were set high-backed bamboo chairs and rectangular tables. We sat down at once to enjoy our tea, but my cousin’s husband, who couldn’t stop fidgeting, began holding forth on the ins and outs of stock market trading and market economics. (Did I mention he’s pursuing a degree in jurisprudence?) As if the sermon weren’t annoying enough, he suddenly began affecting the accent of one of those expatriate Americans who has studied some Chinese but can’t tell one tone from another. I guess he thought that if he sounded like a foreigner the foreigner who was with us could finally understand what he was saying. Or perhaps he was simply venting a subconscious loathing for my “fixation with tradition” (that, in this regard, I am too much like a foreigner?).
Not unpredictably, when we tried to get the check, he turned beet red, whipped out his wallet, and slapped the money on the table.
Later, at the Ming Qing Teahouse, when we met up with the poet Zhai Yongming, who was cracking sunflower seeds and savoring an elegant black tea made with Chinese dates, dragon eye fruit, and “petal of rose,” it was just as if the sky had cleared and we could finally see the sun.
The Secret History of Secrets
 
 You would like to feel
 a dreaming mind makes 
 all this, and, you’re part of it, 
 you are a dream, and shot
 through with deep joy
 knowing that all you see, 
 hear, taste, touch and smell 
 passes through you, floods
 the greater mind, that 
 dreams all, a mind 
 curious about all that is
 each moment coming to be,
 as if this were the first time 
 the world could be truly 
 seen, as a stream flowing 
 both ways at once, though 
 appearing so still none 
 could say for sure 
 it moved at all. Perhaps 
 all is always rushing 
 the same way, and at the 
 same rate, the rocks, sand,
 banks, trees on the banks,
 the days, months, years,
 cascading, one into another,
 taking up and dropping forms, 
 the way a favorite actress 
 goes from role to role. Once 
 she was a fighter pilot 
 in a space opera.
 Later, a detective
 amid a murder spree.
 But you remember how, 
 stranded on a planet, once, 
 she looked up lost into 
 the deep of sky.

 Touch each of your open
 eyes with a forefinger, now, 
 feel a breeze sweeping 
 across a glacier; afterwards 
 you will begin to truly see
 exactly what you’ve been 
 awaiting your whole life: 
 an upside down Christmas! 
 Trees hang root end up 
 from the rafters; slowly turning 
 as bodies weave through the tops, 
 gongs ring out, a weird music 
 wells from beyond a sheet 
 the smell of the pine 
 is delightful and eerie, in 
 this tribute to whoever lay 
 beneath the last pine lid 
 ever sanded smooth in this 
 abandoned car garage
 once a coffin factory;
 a dangling, Cabbalistic 
 wilderness, each branch
 is a stage in the arc of 
 divine energy pouring
 down in deep seeps in this
 apparent art-space 
 where a woman’s voice 
 elaborates a single syllable 
 that wraps around and
 through the trees …
 
                  *
 
 … a film is playing: a dividing 
 line on a highway races by; 
 yellow stripes disappear 
 under the front of the 
 questing car. Headlights 
 flash across briars and 
 a spit of winter grass like 
 a wind that exalts our spirits 
 at the merging of the high 
 branches with the stones 
 on the stream’s bottom and
 the clouds, the drifting leaves,
 the shadow of the one who 
 is filming, caught in the flow, 
 as if we are always a split second 
 ahead of our own thought, 
 so that the past is right “there,”
 lived again in the ripple. 
 An early morning, long ago,
 a corral, a man walks the horse 
 towards you, you have never 
 seen a real horse, the man
 says the horse is old 
 and gentle; to you, he is 
 huge and magnificent. The
 horse is breathing steam. 
 You reach up and touch the 
 bristle and quiver of his neck.
 The sun has barely come up.
 You feel him seeing you.
 Then you are lifted up, 
 set in the saddle, the 
 shudder of the hoofs 
 rises up through you, 
 smell of leather and hay; the 
 dawn is chilly, but your pulse 
 kept your blood rushing.
 Warmth flows into you 
 from the sun, from the 
 great beast that bears you,
 and fear, and delight, as 
 the head dips, and grazes.
 In the stillness the fields
 rush out and away.

 Maybe a novel will come in
 the mail, a good read, a small 
 pleasure, a modest sublimity 
 that has moved many more 
 than once, that holds a truth 
 only shown those who suffer 
 to such a degree, those whose 
 mania will not let them sleep,
 whose anxieties keep them 
 apart, constantly sick from 
 medication. Say what will 
 distract that man from the dark
 roadside abyss he stands by. 
 The day has been delayed. 
 That great surge of light is 
 falling, must be, on some 
 other planet today, what 
 a surprise, don’t you think, 
 for those craters of ice or lava 
 or gravel from meteors, all
 that lifeless matter that spins 
 around with us, whatever 
 turns around us as we 
 turn around, each of us 
 in our resurrection bodies, 
 or blindfolded in a room,
 headphones full of white noise
 heads picking up images sent 
 a considerable distance by 
 someone concentrating 
 on a picture, scientifically 
 proving us gifted “receivers.”
 
 An emerald-colored hot tub.
 
 A hotel in Vienna.
 
 The whirls look delightful.
 
 Those in the hot tub say 
 
 a child has been born; his 
 name is something like “Sigil.”

 There’s no real way, 
 an authority assures me 
 to locate an event in time 
 or in space. There is only 
 before and after, only here 
 and there, there is only 
 a point when, wide awake, 
 its like you came home 
 after many years and found, 
 much to your delight, the old 
 kinship system had kept 
 a classification for you, like 
 that tangle of bare branches
 that is a horizon with light 
 flying across it towards 
 the kind of defeat rarely 
 ever heard of, because it is 
 followed by so great a joy.
 
              *
 
 It could be: to follow 
 is to foretell, to bring 
 about the return of what 
 nonetheless has never yet 
 been, which means,  un-
 derstanding is now open, 
 has been pried wide, by 
 an interrelated run of 
 thoughts that might 
 otherwise compose 
 an experimental film, but 
 in this instance, is simply 
 the denial of life, real life, 
 the one about which you’ve 
 never written, regarding 
 which are no witnesses, 
 concerning which, no 
 direct utterance has 
 ever been pronounced, 
 from which no sensation 
 arises, about which, 
 all memories mislead, 
 for which, love is elusive, 
 the life behind or within 
 or that enfolds the life said 
 to be known, that betrays 
 its presence so that the 
 empirical is unreal. What 
 seemed baseless is now 
 the foundation of all that is.
 
                    *
 
 You have touched the sun 
 and found it to be cool. You 
 took it down from the sky, 
 the light hung there. On 
 a winter field you spread 
 the sun before you like it was 
 no more than a ground-cloth of 
 celestial origin, and you 
 lay on it, and felt warmth 
 from within the winter earth itself.
 Without closing your eyes
 you began dreaming.

 Say more, astro-physicist,
 about where all is 
 
 will be, will be
 until the sun 
 
 bursts forth in its final 
 shape: a cat’s eye, 
 
 overlapping
 loops of grey 
 
 and violet, newer 
 stars still intact, 
 
 scattered, 
 far off, aghast.
 
               *
 
 Until then, only
 the sweep of sound
 
 comes close, just there, 
 past the drizzle of the infinite.
 
                *
 
 Until then, may we not lack what Jesus 
 says the poor have, 
 
 their wealth, their abundance
 which refutes what the 
 
 philosophers 
 call “bare life.” 
 
 The beatitude commands 
 us to ask what it is 
 
 the poor 
 have. 
 
 and to be, 
 following them,
 
 “poor in 
 spirit.”
 
                 *
 
 The road, the houses, will 
 come back, they will 
 
 return from their journey
 as the sky lightens.
 
                  *
 
 Else all’s just a chemical stain in the brain, 
 above and behind the ear …
 
                  *
 
 Else only the state is divine,
 the state that bequeaths 
 
 all selfhood, and can 
 withhold or rescind it 
 
 in brute displays of its 
 fathomless nature.
 
           *
 
 Else generations 
 later you find you 
 
 are a Jew, and not, as 
 was believed, a Lutheran.
 
           *
 
 A Jew, but in a place with no
 more predators 
 
 in the ecosystem, where 
 one can safely drift
 
 across a field and attend
 a bonfire in the forest at night.
 
                  *
 
 (Else I seem as I truly am,
 a chanteuse in need of a CAT scan.)
 
                   *
 
 Like a wet tree 
 that turns an unruly 
 
 red above low, 
 violet leaves
 
 and the trunk 
 turns darker than 
 
 the earth from 
 which it erupts.
 
1. Survivor’s account (genre painting)
Past the Andreevsky Market,
 During the Blockade, there walked a man.
 Suddenly: an impossible vision:
 The smell of soup, specter of soup!
 Two sturdy broads
 Pouring soup into dishes;
 People drink, throw themselves upon it,
 Staring into own eyes.
 Suddenly the militia shows up —
 Knocks dishes from hands,
 Fires into the air:
 People, you are eating human meat!
 Hee-uman meat!
 Broke the broads’ puffy hands,
 Led ’em off to the firing squad;
 They walked away and softly moaned,
 And from their eyes wolf paws
 Scrabbled at air.
 The man was too late to enjoy a bit.
 Bird pecks from ground — all the worse for it.
 And he set off, stepping across the dead,
 Or around them, like puddles.
 
2. Nature-Morte
A twilight of rubbish splashes into the window.
 The boy hunches up: he has no patience.
 The boy checks the boiling pot, its gurgling sounds:
 What do we have today? We have a cat!
 When she asked, he said “Rabbit.”
 When she ate, he laughed. Wildly, madly.
 He died soon. And you on the air
 Sketch with the charcoal nature-morte (yes, indeed!)
 A candle, a fragment of carpenter’s glue,
 A bread ration, a handful of lentils.
 Rembrandt! I want to live; I want to pray.
 Even if turning into ice, into salt, into stone.
 

3. Displaced landscape. Stairway, yard, church. (paper, charcoal, raven’s blood) 
No longer even a brother or a father —
 They were leading a shadow,
 Pressing the muzzle right into his cross.
 Shaking just like a hanging bare bulb,
 From the wind through the floorboards.
Behind this damp blue paint is yellow, and then green;
 Don’t scrape through to the other side — it’s pointless.
 There’s just stucco and hell fumes.
 Here, chomp on this, a pinkish-potato color.
 My very own bone — there’s nothing else for you. Blockade!
 What have you devoured? Tell me:
 Blue rime-frost from the stones,
 Worms, horse-muzzle,
 Cat tail?
 By barrels of human hands, clumps of hair,
 Nourished. By ravens, stars, smoke,
 By wood, like a carpenter moth,
 By iron, like rust.
 And in the yard they slaughtered a man without a knife
 Just like just that.
 From the wound, smoking, poured a voice.
 It sang about mustard seed and breadcrumb,
 About blood’s soul.
 Beneath weak northern lights
 The sky worked its jaws.
 Blockade devoured 
 The soul, like the trapped wolf its paw,
 Like the fish a worm,
 Like bottomless wisdom words …
 Return to us all those who’ve been taken away
 In a wobbly truck’s bed,
 Ringing, like frozen lumber.
 
 Good Friday. Empty, hungry church.
 The deacon’s voice has dried up; he’s nearly lifeless.
 Resounding shades bring out the holy shroud —
 The priest shakes his head:
 “Now I see the light, I comprehend —
 You rose from death in sickness;
 You cannot recover. Death to you all.”
 My blood’s turned to ice wine,
 Ouroboros has bitten through his tail.
 Teeth scattered across the sky
 In place of cruel stars.
 
 
ПОРТРЕТ БЛОКАДЫ
ЧЕРЕЗ ЖАНР, НАТЮРМОРТ И ПЕЙЗАЖ
1. Рассказ очевидца (жанр) 
Мимо Андреевского рынка
 Шел в блокаду человек.
 Вдруг — невероятное виденье:
 Запах супа, супа привиденье!
 Две крепкие бабы
 В тарелки суп наливают,
 Люди пьют, припадают,
 Глядя себе в зрачки.
 Вдруг милиция —
 Из рук тарелки выбивает,
 В воздух стреляет:
 Люди, вы едите человечину!
 Человетчину!
 Бабам пухлые руки заломили,
 На расстрел повели,
 Они шли и тихо выли,
 И из глаз их волчьи лапы
 Воздух рыли.
 Не успел насладиться прохожий.
 Птица клюет с земли — ей же хуже.
 И пошел, перешагивая чрез мертвых
 Или их обходя, как лужи.
 
2. Натюрморт
Помойные сумерки плещут в окошко.
 Юноша горбится нетерпеливо,
 В кастрюлю взглядывая суетливо...
 В ней булькает кошка!
 Ты пришла, он сказал — “кролик,”
 Ты поела, он хохочет так дико.
 Вскоре он умер. Ты по воздуху тихо
 Чертишь углем натюр (о поистине!) морт.
 Свеча, обломок столярного клея,
 Пайка хлеба, горсть чечевицы.
 Рембрандт! Как хочется жить и молиться.
 Пусть леденея, пусть костенея.
 
3. Смещенный пейзаж. Лестница, двор, церковь.
 (бумага, уголь, воронья кровь)
Уже не брата и не отца —
 Тень вели,
 В крестец подталкивая дулом.
 Так же болталась голая лампочка,
 Из подпола дуло.
За этой сырой синей краской — желтая, за ней зеленая,
 До пустоты не скреби, не надо,
 Там штукатурка и испарения ада.
 На, жри, картофельный розовый цвет.
 Больше у тебя ничего нет, кость моя, блокада!
 Что ты жрала? Расскажи мне:
 Иней с каменьев синий,
 Червей, лошадиную морду,
 Кошачий хвост.
 Бочками человечьих рук, пучками волос
 Питалась. Воробьями, звездами, дымом,
 Деревом, как древоточец,
 Железом, как ржавь.
 А во дворе человека зарезали без ножа
 Запросто просто.
 Из раны, дымясь, вытекал голос.
 Он пел о горчичном зерне и крошечке хлеба,
 О душе крови.
 Под слабым северным сияньем
 Желваками ходило небо.
 Блокада жрала
 Душу, как волк свою лапу в капкане,
 Как рыба червяка,
 Как бездонная мудрость слова ...
 О, верни всех увезенных в даль
 В кузове дряблого грузовика,
 Звенящих, как вымерзшие дрова.
 
 Великая пятница. Пустая голодная церковь.
 У дьякона высох голос, он почти неживой,
 Тени гулко выносят плащаницу —
 Священник раскачивает головой:
 “О, теперь я прозрел, я понял —
 Ты очнулся от смерти больной,
 Тебе не поправиться, погибель всем вам.”
 Кровь моя стала льдяным вином,
 Уробор прокусил свой хвост.(incorporating a poem by John Ashbery)
No comfort in the dead wind
And its loud philosophizing;
The glumly repeated eyelets
Tease me with hushed reproach,
And snores of my friends and lovers
Tell me “last night was just that.”
Ah, solitary night! Except for my goofball
Baby next to me — no snoring there, not yet,
But that won’t matter amid the irregular
Screams tomorrow morning. It’s weird how upsetting
Extreme calm can be; it won’t let you think:
The rumpus of natural silence, the frenzy
Of immobility, not like last night
When the woods burbled, and fire crackled
That is now still as a still photograph.
I still have to undress. What is goofball
Thinking — dreaming that his absent-minded Mama
Is humping his cradle? Surely something close to home.
I used to stare at that photograph for signs
But they pointed only to what had been, not to
Getting out of my lovely bed next morning, when the bells
Sing of the amusement park’s opening, or my going down
To redistribute my joy, even pretending to take
My schoolbook seriously, which I can barely see
Through my tears; also zipping up my mother’s back,
Waiting for the unknown person who will take me away.
Beloved Goofball! You fill in my voids.
You’d better like this place, with its firs and fish,
Not like my Manhattan where the only landscape’s in the sky
(And in worn municipal parks): before I was twenty
I never saw a redbud with its leafless purple flowers,
All that stuff out there adds up; you have to think,
Out there is better than the dream in your head,
Than the dreamers in the ministry of fear;
But don’t forget that we are a vulnerable lot
With death by slaughter, fire, or frost hanging over us,
About whom judgments will be made at high tables
To no doubt become our only trace.Retributions 
Between his hands the butcher encompasses the cow’s 
             immeasurable arch.
 
At his back, in the garden wild oats have broken out  
             climbing plants have
             mounted the trellises.
 
The spout of the cracked cement fountain 
             lies open to the
             horizontal thirst of 
             the heavens.
 
The butcher stepped through an entrance door in all his 
              visibility he tempts appetite, 
              in the empty space.
 
 It was the cow’s slaughter the location of the slashes before the 
              whiteness of a door,
              opened.
 
 Now it has fallen, has been heard: the butcher’s hands  
             whirl above the table like 
              meandering white 
              chalk giving shape to 
              another cow another lamp 
              inward, inaccessible.
 
 In the garden in cap and gown magistrates converse 
              with ladies in bonnets the 
              table set. 
 
 And beyond in the paddocks the yellow stream of 
              the wheat field flows
              by again again flows by.
 
 The silent cow is calm between its hooves the 
              sickle at one with
              the growth flourishing
              in the fields.
 
 It chews chews just in front of the arbor the ladies
              are chewing as evening
              falls. 
 
 The cow in the fields pisses quietly ladies and
              gentlemen fall asleep in
              wicker easy chairs.
 
 With one sound the sickle flew with one sound rooks 
              flew a door shut 
              cowbells stopped
              silenced.
 
 Night traverses the closed doors the striking of a
              sheep’s small bell in
              dreams the decisive
              strike of a scalpel, shatters
              the empty space.
 
 The city fell silent its verdict is night.

 Alone in the fields the cow plots the placidity 
              of immeasurable 
              domes freshly sown
              winter fields 
              fields of August 
              grains.
 
 And the butcher is present stays present as he
              gazes at the cow,
              immeasurable.
 
 In the night his hands affix with chalk against the 
              night the generic 
              shape of cow its 
              vault size.
 
 We will see at dawn one more time the stream of the
              slaughterhouse in the 
              irrigation ditches.
 
 One more time the cities sealing themselves off in their
              domes their gardens the
              visibility of their doors.
 
 Take heed, take heed: from the sheepfold flowed the shape
              of the cups hunger begins
              wine begins on the
              walls the shadow’s other
              side begins the apogee
              of breeze among the poppies
              splashes the walls.
 
Las Retribuciones
El carnicero abarca entre sus manos el arco 
             inconmensurable de la
             res. 
Detrás, en el jardín estalló la avena loca las 
              plantas trepadoras 
              subieron los varasetos.
 
 El surtidor de la fuente resquebrajada de 
              cemento se abre a la 
              sed horizontal de los
             cielos.
 
 Traspasó el carnicero una puerta de entrada 
              ensaya en toda su visibilidad 
              la apetencia, en los vanos.
 
 Era el destrozo de la vaca la ubicación de los 
              tajos delante de la blancura 
              de una puerta, abierta.
 
 Ya cayó, se ha escuchado: las manos del 
              carnicero giran sobre la 
              mesa como meandros de 
              tiza blanca configurando 
              otra res otra lámpara de 
              adentro, inaccesible.
 
 En el jardín de toga y birrete los magistrados 
              conversan con señoras 
              de cofia la mesa puesta.
 
 Y más allá en los prados el riachuelo amarillo 
              del trigal pasa de nuevo 
              pasa de nuevo.

 La vaca muda se tranquiliza entre sus pezuñas 
              la hoz en consonancia 
              con el crecimiento en 
              los prados.
 
 Ella mastica mastica delante del cenador 
              mastican las señoras 
              a la caída de la tarde.
 
 La vaca en los prados orina quietamente 
              damas y caballeros 
              dormitan en las butacas 
              de mimbre.
 
 Voló la hoz al unísono volaron los grajos 
              al unísono se cerró una 
              puerta enmudecieron 
              los cencerros.
 
 La noche recorre las puertas cerradas el 
              golpe de una esquila 
              el golpe cierto en los 
              sueños de un bisturí, 
              quiebra los vanos.
 
 Enmudeció la ciudad la noche es su veredicto.
 
 Sola en los campos urde la vaca mansedumbres 
              de cúpulas inabarcables 
              campos de invierno 
              recién sembrados 
              campos de la mies 
              de agosto.
 
 Y está presente sigue presente el carnicero en 
              la contemplación de 
              la vaca, inabarcable.
 
 Sus manos en la noche fijan con tiza contra la 
              noche la forma genérica 
              de la res su tamaño de
              bóveda. 
 
 Veremos a la madrugada una vez más el riachuelo 
              del matadero a las acequias.
 
 Una vez más las ciudades encerrándose en sus 
              cúpulas sus jardines su 
              visibilidad de puertas.
 
 Tocad, tocad: del aprisco manó la forma de las 
              copas se inicia el hambre 
              se inicia el vino en las 
              paredes se inicia el revés 
              de la sombra el apogeo de 
              la brisa entre las amapolas 
              salpica las paredes.
Peter Boyle has translated three poems from Cuban poet José Kozer’s 1988 collection Carece de causa (“No known cause” or “It lacks a cause”), which Boyle describes in his accompanying essay as a work that signals increased complexity, strangeness, and difficulty in the poet’s work. 
Translator’s essayObject: A group composition to be distributed in time and space &
Rationale: “there are things to do together and things to do by ourselves”
Players: nine poets gathered in a workshop reading Is Music
Melody: Cantus Firmus: a motif, a melodic pattern or refrain line, over which changes occur:
“to un-name the beasts throw out the name of money”
 “to rise and speak a green remonstrance”
 “to stain within the definition of silence”
 “to join a diversified assembly”
 “the voice alone is company but not enough”
 “you were waiting alone in the room for the train”
 “bitter search and ironic chatter it began where the other had left off”
 
Harmony: “an additive structure of new vocabulary”
Eye: “there is an eye demand … one of the functions of this unresting cadence is to defeat the silent reading eye”
Line: “a relatively long line that moves by a continuously recurring but not repeating cadence” & Length: a roving poem of 12–16 lines
Openings: “the poem must contain a perceptible pattern of openings, composed silences”
Analogy: “the model ought not to be the ecstatically still saint, but the moved dancer … & thus I am drawn to the poem as a woven scarf with many openings through which light enters”
Theme: to speak against “falling silent” (Celan): “… there can be no doubt. The question is how the poem is to be returned to enacted speech.” & “there will have to be responsibility to a community which, in part, the poet has helped come into existence”
Goal: “the goal still remains transformation”

 
Seeds Sown for John Taggart
To un-name the beasts throw out 
the name of money
 
the man of power
to stain within
 
the definition, the definition
of silence
 
the man of power
that rests
 
you were waiting alone
in the room for the train
 
the definition
the proposition through silence
 
the man of power
that rests
 
the man of power
 
/ Lincoln Greenhaw
 
 
 
You were the you waiting alone in the room
for the train. Look how plurality has made you
 
inside of you. Your space is new;
 
never seen this you before. You
joined a diversified assembly of skin,
 
called it room.

The voice alone is company but not enough
and you must stop it being quite so poorly-conceived
to un-name the beasts throw out the name of money
without the anchor of company, of money the voice
alone the voice is not quite enough but money
to un- the name the throwing of the anchor, the beasts
you must, to quite to stop their poor-conceiving accompany
their voice, company if it’s alone if it’s a beast if alone
but not quite alone, if it’s money but not company an anchor
thrown quite like a beast to pasture and if you money
the quiet voice it’s company enough, if you un- the beast you
stop it, the beast, being un- and conceived poorly the voice
alone the voice is quite enough it must you quiet you
must the voice you anchor, un-company un-moneyed

you are waiting alone in the room for the train 
and the waltzing silence of one star’s light
to rise and speak with a green remonstrance
 
to speak of earth in the silence of stars
is to wait alone in a darkened room to wait
for the waltz to rise and speak out of light
 
(to speak in green tones)
 
when the voice alone is company but not enough
you wait in silence to waltz as a rise to speak
with a green remonstrance
 
 alone the train,      a waltz
 
/ Joanna Doxey
 
 
 
the voice alone is company but not enough
you were waiting alone in the room for the train
 
waiting alone for you the voice in the room
waiting for you alone in the room in the train
 
the voice alone in the train waiting alone
is not company enough for you alone in the room
it began where the other had left off
 
waiting for you alone in the train where the other
in the room had left off but not enough
you were waiting for the voice it began
 
the voice waiting alone for you it began
in the room where the other had left
you alone in the train but not room enough
 
/ Anamika Dugger
 
 
 
The voice alone                                    is company but not enough
 
to dispel            the silence of ringing and breath and beat
 
or tide and full eclipse                        the silence of disappearing
 
 
 
platforms and snow            just starting to stain the concrete
 
dark gray            to stain within the definition                 of silence.
 
The moon follows in bright silence                        bound to revolve
 
 
 
and reflect like my eyes                        in panes            or your eyes
 
when we rise and speak or strain            within the definition
 
of silence.            The voice alone company                   but not
 
 
 
enough to stir of silence                        oceans                 or sooth the ringing
 
 one voice doesn’t mask. I saw my breath when Earth hid
 
 its moon you were waiting alone in the room for the train.

/ Rachel Linnea Brown
 
 
 
the name alone       a record of money
 
 money the stain of beasts
 
 
 it began where the other had left off
 
 bitter search            ironic chatter            the voice

 you were waiting alone in the room for the train
 
 the train being not enough            unnamed the beasts
 
 of money            set down the bank
 
 
 
 there is an eye demand       a green remonstrance
 
 to stain within       definition of silence
 
 a room where the other left off
 
 
 
 voice alone is company enough       but to join
 
 a diversified assembly       to join a room

 Come Chat 
I know why I regard your foot,
it holds up your body, and your body holds me up.
 
Since something is wrong with my body,
dead “but” it rocks itself
in a wicker cage and falls into a trance
and whispers: prickly pear, thorns of roses, death
woven with words repeated every morning
in order to learn a foreign tongue well.
 
Come chat, the foot, the toenail, the heel,
dirty, of course, black from the dust
that always lingers on the floor. Tell me
about prickly pear, rose petals, tendons,
which keep you always on the alert.
 
I do not fear a foreign tongue
will touch you in other ways than I do
and name more tenderly. Come chat, yes, now
I must begin these talks,
repeat verses almost Biblical:
prickly pear cut his feet,
thorns of roses deepened the wounds.
 
 

 
 
 
Little Night Boat 
Two quick coffees on a shifty boat
no sun out yet, but it’s starting.
 
The city in spite of everything is inside the skull,
if you took it out — it would sink whole.
 
Between your temples are the outskirts,
maybe even the lonely little houses in the middle of nowhere.
 
I have the city center and the shopping district, roundabouts
and all the tram loops, the station too.
 
We can exchange, with much fond regard —
tree for street, grass for rails, tram for greenwood.
 
I can allow you a landing at the city hall square
just keep saying anything, a lot and loud.
 
 

 
 


 
Sir Ressentiment
I am on an island of birds
king of reeds and sand, the essence
I sample from strolls in the park
like a Zen monk whose
master tore off his arm and the arm
began to live on its own,
you know the story?
 
Wooden is the ring of bells
but hearing doesn’t concern me
the crane that I know is for construction.
I rise up high
and bore tunnels
I sleep in a cocoon like a purebred
silkworm.
 
I am the king of the birds
on a suburban island,
the sound of hammering boards
my music,
lime mixed with cement
my paintings.
 

 
 


 
Foreground — Dark Take
Arctic enough this afternoon,
mysteries are wanted, but it’s peeling potatoes.
Need to cook, even mysteries need cooking up.
 
Thirst is only a merry-go-round, chicken
a mystery of flesh. Catch me tenderly in the act
with a knife poised over the trash can.
Sometimes I can cry. Monsters come
near our house and clench their teeth.
 
Very feminine this clenching.
Very like dancing this walking.
 

 
 
 
No Dreams at  All
 
You don’t like waterfalls, 
so I’ve written nothing on waterfalls.
 
I talk freely of pain, control myself
lighting a match. On the field boys play
ball, drops of hormones harmonize
with rain, every second boy has a scratched thigh,
a bicep. By the river grass is burning.
 
Neighbors have no eyelids, they don’t sleep, since
we organize brawls, dirty pans we wash at night,
night is the time for purification, though the idiot downstairs
would like morning to come. Stick it in her ass,
let the streets be blessed, if something should be.
 
I am useless, when it comes to good relations
with the neighbors. But you are a rainbow and a screen —
take shots at me, if you want to. On Gdansk Street
we are marine and have beaches. Sand
from the hallway you carry out in pails. I was going
to talk of pain, but I connect it with a spring,
a trickle of sweat, a pack of young pups
laughing in the street. You laugh, on this beach
there’s no shell that could contain us both.
 
You had some premonition, some kind of blizzard pushed you
against the wall? Something bent, broke? I always hear
piano solos, a plump butcher’s daughter plays them.
The same bars on black keys, making the same
slip of the fingers, every day. You fret over these landscapes
you dance in the kitchen making coffee, I have no more strands
to string together to make a dark veil, I kiss you
in the evening, while you play patience. Nobody
gags me, nobody whips me. Spring
you hear in muffled breaths, still stunted,
balled up in a fist.

 
 
 
Sweetheart
to Łukasz
I have a hammock, but you don’t feel like it.
I redden my bruise, in my palate I have a hole.
 
I want to rock myself back and forth on cold mornings,
but the night is longer than all winters.
 
A uniform from high school molders in the attic,
I smoked grass in it, seeds in the pockets
will certainly sprout.
 
The night is longer than
any other autumn — does it matter
if a sprouting seed hurts?
 
I have a name but I should have been nameless,
easier to breathe, shorter paths,
even for a while forgetting about names,
 
names are heavier than each snowfall.
 
Absolution
Who’s ashamed for having written about God?
God no longer has that letter: he tears up our requests.
Penetrates our diaries and kindly erases
confessions dictated by youth and naïve faith.
 
He could be more tenacious — L. says about God.
Let him be rather more like us — what a foolish human dream.
Quietly enters the room and wraps me up.
The body’s full of thorns. The sweat thick and sweet.
 

 
 
 
Glimmer
Here in the middle of nowhere the last bus
is the last light. The sky rarely clears up
but even then it’s not obvious why
the moon doesn’t reflect on the wet grass.
In the darkness roads disappear last whispers
hide away in their burrows.
If you want to go you can go. If you lie down
you’ll be amazed how quickly you’ll find yourself
where you had set out to be.
 

 
 
 
Relief
 
Why exactly did they choose you? You don’t know,
thinking in the dark. You go to the small window:
everything is in order and you’re inside that order
as if judging it from each place. You don’t know
 
if darkness is still working and how it orders things.
Many actions inside you many unfinished stories.
One is especially painful like a movement against everyone.
A small window: eyes lifting silver lines off the ground.
 

 
 
 
From the Start
These days I see more. 
Some people even ask
me: What do you see there
that I can’t see.
It’s started to wear me out
staring straight into what
some people can’t even
get into their minds. God
 
is my witness that when
at last I explain how matters stand
they say pleasantly,
You could be wrong about it.
A few more came by, but they
don’t ask me anything. They want
me to hand over my eyes.
 
 
Perhaps that sort of bliss lost its hold on me.
 

 
 


 
Night
A poem
from the start closes you up in itself.
It doesn’t want
you to look around to search
for other words
from other poems.
 
You sit on the corner of the stone
folded
like a sheet of paper.
Helpless agreeing
you don’t breathe. The poem
doesn’t allow it.
 
On the stone you cannot
wriggle use
a bed a clock a map
or all the rest
of the imagination.
 
A poem
has its own imagination.
It built it for itself in you
and then closed
to release itself.
 
 
You have to wait
on the corner of the stone
where sometimes a light flashes
the golden dust of hope.
 
In the end a poem
will open itself. The stone
lets you go: a sheet of paper
that begins to breathe.
 

 
 
 
Celan
Celan cries out once more. He wakes up again 
beside a ditch full of mouths.
 
Celan — a word that becomes the body
of an old man.
 
A river that flows
two currents
in one bed.
 

 
 


 
Song
You will be alone.
Surrounded by ocean.
You won’t even be given
a glimpse of a ship.
 
On the waves your every
breath will be
like setting a baby
into a crib.
 
And like so many
others before you
who met their end
in the depths where it lay
 
at that moment you gasp
and, do what you may,
you watch the baby
swimming away.
 

 
 


 
Chronicle
When I see soft and broken
boys when they meet in the evenings
and become whole and tough, I think again of
the same stories that want
to have their five minutes in each body.
 

 
 


 
The Trees
Between us come the dead. And we
imagine that they don’t forget
about us. We say: Aha, they came back,
they missed us. All the while they came
between us as between the trees.
 

 
 
 
Either/Or
My friend leaves today for Copenhagen
where the author of Either/Or won great fame
 
for eight months he’ll be washing dishes
and then to London he’ll make his way
 
it should have been summer
but the rain came down and it’s over goodbye
 
two blinds boys were playing in the park
and one shouted to the other: you dummy don’t gape
 

 
 
 
 
A Door 
Hidden under the tree where we shouldn’t be
We get a nod from those who run past laughing.
 
At the top of the tree, over and over someone slams a door.
I’m watching my foot that drinks from a mud puddle.
 
Some children’s clothes get sopping wet on the line.
We’re waiting for the sky to be smeared with more legible patterns.
 
 

 
 
 
 
Editorial Office 
Off they go arm in arm, while I am held only by this text
indifferent to the rest, I see letters even on the windows.
They go down in my notes, the words pressed close
together while at the same time I try to write
them out with correct spelling, each by itself.
 
 

 
 
 
 
Private History
“It doesn’t hurt,” she says in her sleep. I know she says this
to me. Then she goes back to the place that fear
 
showed her. A cat and a pigeon a moment ago:
pursuit and escape. A flower swallowed in silence
 
fingers write in the air the first few letters
of the day: It doesn’t hurt. “It’s going to hurt,” I say.
 
 

 
 
 
 
The Public
Why these poems about death?
I bite into a pear.
 
Bitter. In the broken flesh
a peerless white artist
 
makes me laugh with his
lively movements.
 
 

 
 
 
 
Region
Blood of the swamp brims over and fatigues the surroundings
pulling out from underground a pack of lies and sour moods.
 
People here are tough. If you punch one
you can break off a piece of an arm. But you can’t hurt them.
 
Though when the lord of flies pointed his finger there
they began to shake and jump through the windows.
 
Blood of the swamp pours into the houses. It put out the stove
and reminded people that their place can move.
 
You need to run away: the moon comes up
and calls to itself those who don’t believe in their own strength.
 
Running way is not the same as rejection.
Running away involves longing. The solemn moment, returning somewhere.
 
The strongest go through “a great range of mountains.”
Their hope is unfounded. That’s why it doesn’t exclude anyone.
 
The dry eye of the song can see movement in every valley.
The swamp never moves backward. The song of those who run away is wild, unhappy.
 
 

 
 
 
Political Observation 

If he were buried 
underground
he would start the bugs’ party.
 
Leave someone by his bed
who will whisper in his ear: “I will destroy you.”
He will recover.
 
He doesn’t believe
that which limits your freedom
after a while may become
part of it.
 
along the shore of the sounding sea walked the soldier Ay Bee See. He had a main directing thought about nuts. He walked and whispered a song. It was evening. The soldier Ay Bee See, approaching a pitiful, unlit by the inhabitant fishermen fisherman’s hut, where fishermen lived, provided they were not out navigating the sounding, black, caspian, or essentially even the mediterranean or, which is one and the same, adriatic sea, but were ashore, that’s when they lived there. They the fishermen were five in number. They intently ate soup with fish. Their names were Andrey, Bandrey, Bendrey, Gandrey, and Kudedrey. They all had daughters. Their names were Lialya, Talya, Balya, Kialya, and Salya. The daughters had all gotten married. It was evening. The soldier Ay Bee See did not stop by the home of these garden-patch minders. He did not knock on their home door. He walked deep in his thought, the main directing him thought about nuts. The soldier Ay Bee See did not notice their fisherman’s house. Not their nets, not their rigging, not their daughters, not their soup. Even though he felt cold and night was falling all the same, he still walked past them. So much was he engulfed by his main directing thought about nuts. It was evening still. Ay Bee See walked, almost ran and spoke his nut song. Let us imagine, that is let us mentally hear, this song. Does it follow from the song’s being called nut song that nuts must feature proudly in it. Yes, in this case it follows. It is far from being so always, but in this case it follows. Here it is, this song. The soldier Ay Bee See sang about the difference in the shells of the walnut and the brazil nut. Here’s what he sang.
The shell of the walnut 
 is tender to look at.
 The shell of the brazil nut
 is savage to look at.
 The former shell is clean,
 firm, lush, and lean.  
 The latter shell is a simple one,
 it’s like a tailless swan. 
 Why this difference, goodness gracious,
 those in the know are horribly pugnacious.
 I like the walnut before and after,
 its body carries a certain laughter.
 Its shell is mighty fine
 but thinking about it is a waste of time.
 The brazil nut has color,
 maybe the color is its brother.
 Yet where its dawn gets its start,
 no one can say either forward or backward.
 Why this difference, goodness gracious,
 those in the know are horribly pugnacious.
 This is all that I could say
 about their shell that ends with an A.
Here, as if in answer to this song, blazed up the candle-lit, previously unlit, window of the fisherman’s house whose light had gone out entirely and forever. The fisherman Andrey, Bandrey, Bendrey, and Gandrey rapped his fist on the window and shouted to the soldier Ay Bee See: Officer officer, do you take the world’s offer, sir? But the fisherman Kudedrey with self-reliance cooked and went on eating his fisherman’s soup. It was evening, although also night was falling. But what could Ay Bee See say in reply when he didn’t hear the question. He was already very far away from them. And then he suddenly, but not unexpectedly, turned into a father and … and right away sang a new song. The father sang. The mother listened. The father sang but the mother listened. The father sang and the mother listened. And what was she listening to? 
I walked a    long the    ci   ty    streets,
I looked for     my son    e   verywhere,
but I cou   ldn’t   find him a  nywhere,
even among      the     sea side     cliffs.
Then I    walked in    to the    fo    rest,
then I     ran     to      wards      the sea.
Where    are you,      where     O      my
son, I cried        a round       me         sa
dly. My son     an       swered       here I
am, may        be I     ’m enti   rely here,
then I       looked a      round my    self,
my son who          lly    disa    ppeared.
All the     birds put       up      a     howl,
coo ed      the     wild     ani             mal.
Cry       and cry       and cry      and cry,
the fo    rest cuc    kooed to   them  all.… вдоль берега шумного моря шел солдат Аз Буки Веди. У него была основная руководящая мысль про орехи. Он шел и шептал песню. Был вечер. Солдат Аз Буки Веди, подходя к жалкому, не освещенному рыбаками, живущими в нем, рыбачьему домику, в котором жили рыбаки, в том случае, когда они не находились в плавании в шумном, черном, каспийском, по существу даже в средиземном, или что то же самое, адриатическом море, а находились на берегу, то тогда они жили в нем. Их рыбаков было пять человек. Они пристально ели суп с рыбой. Их звали: Андрей, Бандрей, Бендрей, Гандрей, и Кудедрей. У них у всех были дочери. Их звали: Ляля, Таля, Баля, Каля и Саля. Они все вышли замуж. Был вечер. Солдат Аз Буки Веди не зашел в дом к этим огородникам. Он не постучал к ним в дом. Он шел погруженный в свою мысль, основную им руководящую мысль об орехах. Солдат Аз Буки Веди не заметил их рыбачьего дома. Ни их сетей, ни их снастей, ни их дочерей, ни их супа. Хотя он и продрог и все равно надвигалась ночь, но он прошел мимо. Настолько он был охвачен своей основной руководящей мыслью об орехах. Был еще вечер. Аз Буки Веди шел, почти бежал и говорил ореховую песню. Представим себе, то есть мысленно услышим, эту песню. Следует ли из того, что песня названа ореховой, что в ней и должны рисоваться орехи. Да, в данном случае, следует. Далеко не всегда это бывает так, но в данном случае следует. Вот она эта песня. Солдат Аз Буки Веди пел о разнице скорлуп грецкого и американского ореха. Вот что он пел.
У грецкого ореха скорлупа 
 Имеет нежный вид. 
 У американского ореха скорлупа 
 Имеет дикий вид. 
 Первая скорлупа прочна, 
 Ясна, сочна,точна. 
 Вторая скорлупа проста, 
 Она как лебедь без хвоста, 
 Откуда эта разница берется, 
 Кто знает тот дерется. 
 Мне грецкий нравится орех, 
 Ведь в нем есть смех. 
 Его скорлупа прекрасна, 
 Но мысль о ней напрасна. 
 Есть у американского ореха цвет, 
 Может быть этот цвет ему брат. 
 Но где начинается его рассвет, 
 Не сказать никому ни вперед ни назад. 
 Откуда эта разница берется, 
 Кто знает, тот дерется. 
 Вот и все что я мог и спел 
 Об их скорлупе кончающейся на эл.
Тут, как бы в ответ на эту песню, вспыхнуло освещенное свечой, ранее не освещенное, окно потухшего совсем, навсегда рыбацкого домика. Рыбак Андрей, Бандрей, Бендрей и Гандрей постучал в окно и крикнул солдату Аз Буки Веди: - Ротный командир, любишь ли мир? А рыбак Кудедрей самостоятельно варил и продолжал есть свой рыбацкий суп. Был вечер, хотя и надвигалась ночь. Но что мог ответить Аз Буки Веди, когда он не слышал вопроса. Он был уже очень далеко то них. И тогда он внезапно, но не неожиданно, превратился в отца и ... и сразу спел новую песню. Отец пел. Мать слушала. Отец пел, а мать слушала. Отец пел и мать слушала. Что же она слушала?
Я по у   ли    цам      ходил. 
 Сына я      везде        искал 
 Но нигде его  не       находил, 
 даже средь    прибрежных скал. 
 Я         потом  пошел      в ле сок, 
 побежал     на   брег  морской. 
 Где ты,     где ты    мой  сынок, 
 я кричал    вокруг      с тоской. 
 Сын      мне      отвечал        ау, 
 может быть      я вовсе     здесь, 
 я тогда      вокруг        взглянул, 
 сын мой      растворился       весь. 
 Тут завыли          птицы         все 
 и заворковал                     зверек. 
 Плачьте, плачьте         плачьте все My partner and I were hunting cougars in
Colorado’s Book Cliffs. Our hounds treed
a cat at dusk, but some were baying near
a cave. I leaned into cave and struck match
right in face of a bear. Though supposedly
hibernating, big bear and her cub were not.
Big one walloped me, nearly breaking my
shoulder. Groggy, I saw bear poke head between
my legs. I moved fast. The hounds said the cat
was still treed, so I unholstered my .22
revolver and began firing. I had to empty the
handgun at lion before it crashed to earth.                                            The

                     (a drop?)If God is willing, this
is the coming to another land,
1962, is the landing on a shore
I have never been before —
 
days and hours that come out of the mud
up and track my room, in on the windows
I can’t see out of now, as I come to fog
or from one clearing — to hell with that one
 
now — toward another one I haven’t
found. Of where I live. Time,
it is November 1962, time
done with the Army and again back
 
time ordinary and my own. And the place
I know, of Kansas, home, not
possible to know anymore, I have come
here to Massachusetts, back
 
beginnings back. And on this Thanksgiving
day another year
if there are no thanks to give
it is again to be alive
 
and yes, to go on. The rest
of myself: the plain and where
the trees still are thick,
stretching inland how far
 
I do not know, only to go
there and find.
It is past being certain
of home, of any where, until I find it,
or we would not have come here
in November and nothing
warm or human or to settle.
Only to ride the earth in front of us
 
to Earth.
 
                        This is the day set aside
for public harvest’s
gratitude,
                       giving back of all the energies of devotion
for an instant equal
to the energies gathered
of earth’s sustenance given
                                                     or what was attended
watching the slow shift of season
knowledge    thankful for to have gathered
before the shift — not so slow and more like a
sudden awareness come on too late —
                                                                       before cold winter
for a day to play the ant for the grasshopper, all in each of us
and together
 
                            Today I would fast or at most
just eat what is in the house without going out:
brown rice and vegetables, wine
                            repealing the urge to stuffing
everywhere around me
                                               people for days in the markets
loading up their carts

                                       keep not by thanks away
                                       but quantity of food
the
          cold?    our cold?    I do not know
what we eat and drink so much to keep away, or shift from
possession to possession to keep attendance from
 
but a feared vacuity
never filled

It is all sunlight today, and clarity
of air and leaf sound and the slightest movement
in the trees toward the bay —
                                                        an attitude of reaching out
to learn,
                 what for
to be thankful for
                                       a feeling in the words
that we are not lost to them

taste on top of taste
a natural residue of uneasiness in the mouth
a thickening in the mucous membrane
crackers and hard brown Mexican sugar

and red wine
 
                             Would I be thankful for
the thankfulness?
                                     it asks me now
 
I had thought earlier, sitting on the porch
before I began to write,
                                                what accumulations
of attentions I have as harvest today,
                                                                         swells of my bodily pulsings

Don Juan, the Yaqui
Man of Knowledge
says there are four natural enemies the man of knowledge
must challenge and defeat
to be a man of knowledge:
                                                    fear
                                                    clarity
                                                    power
                                                    old age (which no one defeats
                                                                     but only drives away
                                                                                                           for a time
 
The smell of roast beef
swirls in from the backyard,
                                                    of Sunday afternoons as a child
and this autumn clarity
                                           not Thanksgiving’s cooking
 
And old thankfulness
and Ford Maddox Ford thought memory
was genius,
                        or said it was, in his own
elephantine luggage
 
I cannot predict
the moments of the shifts
 
playfulness, fear (that taste
in mouth, as if an ever edge
to counter on, speed up on, counter
                                                                    with
clarity (have I ever had
long enough
                          — or power,
to fear?

only one moment of to know
(come again and again,

change
                   in quickness and
                   in willingness
 
the leap up of the red red cactus spine
into the sunlight
                                 lit edge lines as of snake skin
                                 or the penis
 
all this trembling on the edge of expectation
all the imagined necessary qualifications
                            for whom?
reading the writing showing through from the other side of this page

                            lines,

                            connections,

                            no fear in that

and the green of the wine bottle and of the reflection
from my shirt —
                                 carrying the weight of
all their differences
in a word, green?
 
puts me to the test to continue
and not rise up in irritation and anger with myself

(they were laughing, too, in mock
disgust at the ball caught in the net)
                                                                   stretching
out my arms in an embrace
to the walnut tree
                                  laughed at myself, feeling the joy
of going downstairs to pee

                        for the strength to endure
                        the uncertainties

All this poem

 — Ed Dorn
I have walked off the road
into the green wheat
ripe-high — only the railroad
full of a mile of boxcars
stands, is dark, does not move, dark
as high noon I came down this road
the first time, and turned off toward it,
it was
Pawnee Station
is almost deserted now —
 
Mrs. Masten told me she used to drive Dr. Masten
this far, by car, in 1910,
 
and he went on into the country on calls
by team, wagon
 
for the impossible roads of spring.
 
This road walked off of
was the first paved south
 
to the coal mines, Pittsburgh, Kansas,
what were once the socialist counties of Kansas —
 
goes nowhere now but its paved circle back
where it came from, off the new highway
 
Concrete, where the roads are all still
dirt,
 
and the mines are all
played out.
Summer, ripeness, and the harvest
almost time — And the plateaus
and increments of history, memory, cohere
in here, stepped out into to see,
this field, slashed
by a still railroad
and roads —
                                       Enter it
                       by whatever side door, door
                       at all,
                                       and go freely
                                       to that far end
 
                                       where the trees
                                       stand thick
                                       and moving in the wind.
 
 
— 21–28 Aug 63Things near at hand
The old ladies lie down under the frost: truly, they are sleeping. 
All morning they were taking out the indoor plants in deep winter
              they thrust their hands 
              into the earth they spoke
              of a forest wheat that 
              cleanses the stomach
              of horses (they spoke,
              softly) we are women of
              wheat and ablutions they
              won’t be able to diminish us; 
              the two birds that on
              meeting were suspended
              a few moments in the sky, 
              they need us.
 
 We are, after all, women of ablutions: of no stature.
 
 They dug, two flowerbeds in a cross: they speak, laying down conditions.
              Without our hands in
              the garden-beds nothing
              will germinate again no one
              will see our pastures in
              the depths of the wells whoever
              goes down will have their
              clothes soaked in the scarlet 
              must secreted by the
              mushrooms’ disease; they  
              will drown.
 
 Since they stand forth, burning phosphorus: our children.
 
 Enormous, in their rocking chairs: and among them I hear someone
              name the fires in the sky
              (the sea sparkle’s
              disorientation
              in the waters is now
              purple) the whistling 
              of three grebe, 
              frightening.
 
 We stood up, I’m small.
 
 They take their buckets woodwork brushes, they are going to
              trim the tree in the
              backyard: we’d laugh;     
              they’re not going to 
              come and settle in
              our house they won’t
              nest in the two aspen in
              the patio nothing will
              gnaw their immemorial leaves
              and from the catkins will
              burst forth the spark
              paper fodder on the
              wet-nurse’s breasts.
 
 They whistle shrilly, let them whistle: I hear, on the roof
              against the patio’s red floor
              buckets moving 
              large new pans
              fermentations.
 
 I hear, cow dung falling: I withdraw among the men their
              enormous hands sunk
              in their aprons, obedient;
              they’ve become intoxicated,
              they bury their fists in 
              their pockets looking at
              the tides looking at the 
              shimmer of sea sparkle
              on the patio tiles
              (I celebrate, density) (I
              celebrate the swarm of
              fireflies that have come
              out of the mildew) moths
              nested in their large
              winter coats.
 
 The candle, in their eyes: a gnat (birds) in the pockets of their
              agave overcoats.
 
 Wearing a toga, with a hood: they look, where to dig. Under the
              frost, the thick scrub of
              flowering begonias makes
              us drowsy from my
              tunic a mushroom
              sprouts (I hear) (flower
              of the breeze, a shrill
              whistle) the eaves
              blooming the
              shoot of the old
              women on the cornice.
 
Proximidades 
Las ancianas se recuestan bajo la escarcha: en 
              verdad, duermen.
 
 Toda la mañana estuvieron sacando las plantas de 
              interior hincaban en pleno 
              invierno las manos en la 
              tierra hablaron de un trigo
              forestal que limpia el 
              estómago de las caballerías 
              (hablaron, en voz baja) 
              somos mujeres de trigo 
              y ablución no nos podrán 
              mermar; las dos aves que 
              al cruzarse estuvieron 
              suspensas en alto unos
             instantes, nos necesitan.
 
 Pues somos de ablución, mujeres: sin estatura.
 
 Cavaron, dos arriates en cruz: hablan, estipulando. Nada 
              volverá a germinar sin nuestras 
              manos en los canteros del 
              jardín nadie verá nuestros 
              pastizales en el fondo de 
              los aljibes quienes 
              desciendan se empaparán 
              las ropas con el mosto 
              escarlata que segrega la 
              enfermedad de los hongos; 
              y se verán anegados.
 
 Puesto que son de evidencia, fósforo: hijos nuestros.
 
 Enormes, en sus mecedoras: y yo entre ellos oigo nombrar 
              los fuegos de la altura 
              (púrpura es ahora la 
              desorientación de la 
              noctiluca en los mares)
              el graznido de las tres 
              somormujas, amedrenta.
 
 Nos pusimos de pie, soy pequeño.
 
 Sacan sus baldes cepillos de carpintería, talarán el árbol 
              del traspatio: reíamos; no 
              vendrán a posarse en nuestra 
              casa no anidarán en los dos 
              tiemblos del patio nada roerá 
              sus hojas inmemoriales y de 
              los amentos surgirá la astilla 
              el papel el forraje en los 
              pechos de la nodriza.
 
 Graznen, que graznen: oigo, sobre la teja contra los 
              suelos rojos del patio un 
              trasiego de cubos pailas 
              nuevas fermentaciones.
 
 Oigo, caer la boñiga: me recojo entre los hombres sus 
              manazas hundidas en los 
              delantales, obedientes; se 
              han embriagado, hunden 
              los puños en los bolsillos 
              mirando las mareas mirando 
              cabrillear las noctilucas
             en las losas del patio 
              (júbilo, lo tupido) (júbilo, 
              el enjambre de luciérnagas 
              que salió del moho) las 
              polillas anidaron en sus 
             grandes abrigos de invierno.
 
 La candela, en sus ojos: jején (pájaros) en los bolsillos 
              de sus abrigos de henequén.
 
 Togados, de capirote: miran, cavar. Bajo la escarcha, 
              la tupida maleza de las 
              begonias en flor nos 
              adormila de mis túnicas 
              brota la seta (escucho)
             (la flor del aire, grazna)
              en flor los aleros el 
              vástago de las ancianas 
              en la cornisa.
Peter Boyle has translated three poems from Cuban poet José Kozer’s 1988 collection Carece de causa (“No known cause” or “It lacks a cause”), which Boyle describes in his accompanying essay as a work that signals increased complexity, strangeness, and difficulty in the poet’s work.

Carp 1 
1.
At the sight of a carp the girls say ah 
at the sight of carp that didn’t get far.
At the sight of a cat of a cow because now it’s not the girls
saying can’t you hear it, when the milk spills?
 
Sight spills upon sight, we look with sight,
sight presents the moon, ah, if only the moon
were the sight, not a lost penny. I’m not
yet a penny that you lose, not
 
the sight you’ll ask for.
I’m the moon that fell asleep in the pond,
I’m the carp that in absolute silence
the moon swallows, that’s your absolute sight.
 

2.
I’m a sight swallowed by a carp.
At the sight of a carp I don’t know what you ask.
I’m an instrument lurking in a pond,
I would prefer you not to live, I’d prefer that
 
you ask for five special gold pennies,
which I won’t have saved since I’m a fisherman
who eats catches as long as the carp live,
and when he catches nothing he tells the cow,
 
which has no why to lend him, since it
doesn’t give itself the milk the tomcat lives on
because even in a pond there isn’t enough moon
to feed a carp with a tomcat on its head.
 

 
 
 
Carp 2 
1.
I want to protect you, keep the absolute sight,
so I have something to gild you with when you apologize.
Sight works in mysterious ways, there is no silence
that your Unknown will disturb. Darkness
 
stirs the tree branches, a hand bears
weight it can’t swallow. Together with a hair
your comb tore out, you drown in principle
all August long, darkness has
 
many names so that if you ask for it
all September would sleep, so let us operate
with names of other names, let us laugh at the looks
of other people, which we’re going to wear from now on.
 

2.
Keep to yourself, don’t be too much
of a treat, be a sample until
I’ve received Communion, putting my body
at the disposal of one or another
 
 
change. I lost your somehow, your
what for. With you I am constantly, I’m
I don’t know, with you I’ve lost the whole of
my after all if only. However, zero damage
 
is out of the question here, so forgive me,
when I could still experience you I was too much
in tears over mine, and then I only bore
my fate like a dog its collar, let someone put it on.
 

 
 
1. The Polish title is Mazowszanka, a popular brand of mineral water.Escape
After so many hours spent in the room,
One wonders what the room will do.
Whether speech or action will be first,
And whether the weather will be first
To begin.
Such long inaction is unnatural.
But why should it happen to you, when
Outside, the street has silver cars,
All unoccupied, equipped and ready
For departure? Even the kitchens
Are ready with pans, and the dishes for something
Heretofore unplanned. The people who pass
Whisper and stare, then say, “house.”
Why not accept the waiting and forego
The known? After all,
Occupancy is only a matter of making up
One’s mind. The silver cars are square
And the room is long.
Interruption would be different in a car.
It would come on the road, like trees and fern.
Like the flowers whose names have been learned.
Or sandwiches made in layers; the friction
Would be brief and quickly swallowed.
Not people. Not the stranger with the listening
Heart, or the girl without a mind. Not
Person. The encroachment would be barely
Visible. It would happen on a side road,
A detour, or a highway cut by mistake.
You would wipe it off like the windshield
And be ready for the next advance.
After all, this house is old.
How many people come creeping,
After the spider, upstairs. Some with bags
And some with baskets, and all going nowhere. They
Only want to settle under the roof like pigeons;
Quarter their young and prepare for the future.
But you are different. You have watched
The vanishing of the separate ghosts. You have seen,
Over the bannister, the disappearance
Even of those who tried to remain.
You should not wait for the walls
To speak. Go into the bathroom,
Turn on the faucett, and swim into the street.

[c. 1945]
[Typescript of this poem]

The Inhabitants
Early night and the evening bus
Passing with a new wreath around
Its straggled head. The push cart
Halts and fifty pineapple eyes stare
Into the invalid light. We move
Like people in an opera on this street,
Arranged and decked, our arms
Progress against the dark, unconscious
Symbols of the hour we have left,
The escape we have planned and made.
The subway. Seated within
The nocturnal car, we expand; grow
Gracious in this self-conscious night.
Unnatural botanists, we observe
The stations as flora, more curious
So far underground. We select
The rarest, the one we years ago
Have seen inside a dream, and known
That here the trowel must sink,
The root be cut. And we ascend.
Memory of past cities. Cities
More beautiful in a poem. Fallen
And wept for, the warrior cities.
Even the silent ones, who are
Known only for the trouble
They have borne, the tormented ones.
Yet what can surpass the adventure
Of this city, crossed by water, beyond
A river. The only city whose lover
Is the bridge …
The grey cat enters the broken gate.
The ball hits the wall, and children
Run, side by side, down the walk. 
The twilight games of the very young.
Somewhere a curtain moves and a pattern
Of lace falls from a room. Boulevarded
By space, every sound is of a thousand
Voices crying, and each one
Saying the other is false.
And the riverboat saying, return.
Someone is following us. Experienced
In apprehension we look back.
Relief turns the green face white,
For we have seen our familiar fear
In the long coat with the tearful
Lapel, the perpetual ghost under
The lamplight. We call out.
His answer could be affirmation,
Or even sorrow changed into a leaf,
For we are allowed to enter our house.

Multiplicity

   i
         An opposing force nestles closer
         — to the four square of its joint
               the nimbus divides at an unfaded seam


         and the naughts are shuffled at the table
                                and rapidly the wheedling gems
         appear and disappear from an unsteady table —;
                                — this superstition —
         the oathing — (winter in society) is felt by the hard folk
         and they scatter —
         and read their palm — the oathing catches up    under the nimbus
they part —
                             eliminate the intoxication of force — and the mincing 
suggestions cast by the opposing force     weep at solemnity horse on the 
platform    his thrust —
                             yet they are freed of the nimbus and opposition
they are like larvae — they are under the glass at first — and they proceed
with exemplary caution over newly paved roads    under the spy glass
                         like Hannibal; and again as the wheels of a traveller 
              reactions are diverse    not being under the nimbus —
                                             being Latinate perhaps —.
This was worth breathing into — translated not bloody —
afternoon under new palms and rivers    imagination agitated and warm—;

   ii
yet verbal complications — (bestial desiring) — Jove or his discontent
                       Zodiacal origins —
                                                         Soul mosquito Soul
                       memory of the oathing —.
It was a shawl on that table                         that hair piece the rhythm
       of the forehead    classic moans
                         interrupted the blink    the mellow square
             memory and her hireling —;
                                                   the same supperless complications
gods who multiply; wench who lifted her eyes —; what passes on the tile’s
belly (the mantle and) — perhaps Allah.
Regard the wheel
                         dark blue   maraudering.
                                   iii
                Not being under the nimbus    of earthen of metal
                          terrace levelled beams crossed; folk who
                offer early and late    zero numbers
                          sneeze in late autumn    the random
 
                                                       chalk sketch
                primi pensieri:
                                               that man coming up the hill
                        attitudini:
                                               it grows later as he climbs
                                           the multiplicity of early
                                                                                 of late


                                   iv
                         landscape’s script and nimbus
                                                                        natural and mimetic
                                serene yearning
                          early and late
 
                                               Dejection and the Ode.


Typescript of two early poems by Guest
LINEbreak: Barbara Guest in conversation with Charles Bernstein A Glass
The table looking ’cross the valley
silences from us
the two seated there into the view;
the green ridge overrides
the crests lined behind it as
completely as the wave sway
of their hands’ meanings
as words mouthed like fish breathing
somewhere and something else
the next sea. 
Depending on the wind
you can now and then hear a voice
from some invisible distance
one as long as this tide of ridges
seems
counterpoint the two meeting.
Temperature changes the carry
of sound   it is air after all   our words.
Rephrased and added to through leaves   over peaks
the trajectoried cast of shadow’s chills and heats …
The two are calm but angry   or is it us
counter with neither   that trusts our way of
seeing   as always   when if
the whole mountain is in the picture,   we are not.
Our voices, a wind. Calm nor anger no more
than a green.
And air in the ear of atmosphere a message
finally back is silent
a cyclone erase and polish of our sea’s
surfaces into a glass of sky.

of the truck cab make this business
not tourism    though what we’ve seen
all morning no screen but the world
itself could take on and even a peep
through don’t-look-fingers would fill theaters
Every space to sit    on top of the load
is occupied by its farmers looking instead
to market not the mountains the one lane
thousand foot drop off  over the pass way
you do business    even in the face
of another truck’s sudden rounding the corner
 
You don’t speak the language you do
speak with common eyes    that face we
let speak all at once as one    recognition
No one has to
repeat that silence’s sound    The cost of business
is something more than the experience
 
than the view. More
like the women who appear with warm bread
out of nowhere when a landslide moments ahead
closes the road
or like the thought of having to eat
our words for fear.
 
 
 
Case
A someone else I anticipate seeing
my mess       has stopped coming       a guest respect
that brought me to order
                                                   now it’s just
the way it is      where I leave everything
alone       bum ahead or break off to never
coming or coming back to 
                                                        some pile in the floor
that’s now the texture      the ground     of stepping
over      as if       no body       is there
nor here 
                 I no longer                
                 habeas corpus
                                                    nor produce the body.

                           brings                              the table
        my guest brings me clearing off the table
The clearing in the presence of my enemy 
In my disorder I am my enemy          the guest
                                of    my company 
Someone I anticipate seeing the mess
I would clear away     for has stopped coming
        Look     The clearing has stopped coming 
object  aim  purpose  beneficiary  all  
        those are for     stop dropping by and fall
…
to the floor:      In this case
guests never arriving starve the host
so he carves them 
out of himself he eats them with nothing
to prepare for
The jury must decide if the guests are souls 
or un-embodied ambulations of will,
death’s transmigrating finishes of list
or fluctuating fields of presence at 
a formal dress vacuum
event excited to fluorescence as a ghost
or one’s own 
perspective parallaxed
to the point it gets to oneRorschach
It’s only coffee, as you can see, 
spilt on the table. So ostentatious 
in its attempt to imitate the classic test, 
in which just about anything can be seen 
if anyone bothered to look. 
Its casual tributaries, its seeming estuaries, 
form a map that’s more evident 
than the few words spoken this morning, 
which may — with coffee’s aftertaste —
say enough to make you raise your eyebrows,
shrug your shoulders, stare into space, and move on —
even into the unknown — before the spill on the table
assumes, in your eyes,
the shape of a brain or a spider.
 

 
 
 
 
Crossword 
Federico (remember) had been dead three days
if the Italian correspondent could be trusted.
And still we couldn’t think of the word: down,
with six letters — and Ludmila.
Not long after (remember), Massina, she died too,
which only confirmed my belief: he was a sappy
director. And we could have won
a toaster, and a deluxe edition of The Idiot. The Dostoyevsky
I’ll get over. I saw the film. But the toaster. Hard to say
that was a loss. In fact
we didn’t even enter. Hard to say
we just ran out of words. Come
 

 
 
 
From the Book of Kings
 
He sent messengers, and she came unto him, and he lay with her.
1.
Beautiful is the wife of my neighbor 
though I’ve never seen her on the roof
when among white satellite dishes
she washes her knees in rainwater
and shows her neck like a harlot to the sun.
Sitting certainly at a kitchen table
in the foreign language cities of the West,
she doesn’t say prayers at the temples
to men in tall military boots.
I will send him to the army — to the front,
I will give him a ticket to the cinema — to The Cruise.[1] Today I want 
neither bull nor monkey nor my neighbor’s things,
which are his. Only we will take each other.
The body of the poem doesn’t sin. We are without fault:
who among us will cast the first stone?
Which tablet will be broken? Will someone shroud the second
in white, like an unseeing eye,
like a sheet?
 
2.
 
Beautiful is the wife of my neighbor,
beautiful the school of fish around her ankles
when she wades barefoot in the streams and these
flow through pipes to drains
and drain covers in the middle of town.
To meet in the body of waste, but don’t worry,
we are not going to sink. The water is kind to us,
the Dead Sea tries to keep us afloat without effort
on its flat surface like the window
of a fish shop, where in secret we switched
places and playfully arrange ourselves
in illegal configuration, among
reflecting streetlights and traffic signals
of blurred colors. I care not for the rain,
for the meaning of this downpour and the mafia,
it doesn’t matter where it is today. Rain,
if my nostrils don’t deceive me,
smells of you suddenly, I am wet with you.
We will give him a king’s name.

Your practical, economical and vile face, Yankeeland, is, is, is today’s black commercial poetry, today’s black commercial poetry and the horrible, hyperborean beauty of business for business’ sake; a great, spiritual zephyr crowns your skyscrapers, hazy stars sing in the nude above their meteorological surfaces, they sing in the nude winking those blue eyes, blue, blue, blue and the moon, the moon comes with the golden slipper of twilight, revealing its leg to the sun, revealing its leg to the sun, revealing its leg to the sun or the epigram, the pornographic-melancholic anecdote of the florid leagues of men on the couch of the eternal towers, eternal like the dreams of the tombs; Yankeeland, your great ways of being, Yankeeland, Yankeeland, they constitute, they constitute and they are an aesthetic interpretation of the world, for having come in projections, in volitions, in sensations beyond the immediate, the appearance of things and the human voice …

This annotated approach to “Trem Neul” details the twelve texts most important to the constitution of the poem. Each text is introduced as it corresponds to a particular line or fragment of the poem, and many return again and again throughout “Trem Neul.” W. L. Williams’s First Lessons in Maori is a useful example of the annotative style. Williams’s language primer is the third text to feature in “Trem Neul,” so it is cited as “3 W. L. Williams, First Lessons in Maori, 7th ed., 1923, 83.” Joyce draws from First Lessons in Maori over and over in the right-hand column of the poem.
It is important to note that the line numbers used in this annotated version of “Trem Neul” do not correspond to the line numbers of the poem, where the block stanzas are much more condensed than the right-hand columns. For the purposes of this text, it was convenient that each numbered line should read across the two sections of the page such that line 1 reads, “Your life issues out of time much        Come here.” Numbering the lines in this way proved more effective for identifying literary sources, but it does not acknowledge the two diverse styles of the text. Not every line of the poem will be accounted for by this annotative approach the poem. This is a select bibliography and it does not begin to account for “Trem Neul,” nor should it. The intention in presenting a list of sources for “Trem Neul” is to encourage a clearer understanding of Joyce’s poetic process, of the intertextual nature of his recent poetry, and the manner in which these poems exceed the sum of their parts. — Niamh O’Mahony











Editorial note: These  two poems drawn from Trevor Joyce’s private archive were written during  the near twenty-year lull in Joyce’s publishing history lasting from  the late seventies to the early nineties. They are important as evidence  of Joyce’s activity during this period and of the poet’s compositional  process.
“The  End of Orpheus” was written in 1983 and has never appeared in print.  Joyce was reading R. M. Rilke’s “Orpheus. Eurydice. Hermes” translated  by Rika Lesser while writing this poem, and Rilke is one of a number of  European poets important to Joyce’s oeuvre. The  second poem beginning “On September 27th” was written between 1976 and  1978 and first appeared in print appended to the “Pentahedron &  others (1966–76)” section of the collected (2001).  Along with the addition of the title, “Passages,” to the poem, there  are a number of significant differences between the wording and form of  the manuscript and print editions. The short opening lines in block  capitals of the manuscript version are converted to an italicized prose  style in the later edition. Changes to wording in the collected text  include the insertion of “in the year of Our Lord” before “1177,” while  “Rome’s primacy” becomes “the primacy of Rome” and “His personal  physician” becomes “The Pontiff’s personal physician.” The hordes of Gog  and Magog in the second section are “ravening” rather than “ravenous,”  and the speaker’s alienation from “the rich zone of virtue and of power”  is emphasized through the addition of “But, here” to “these little  labyrinthine | streets.” Finally, the ten lines that conclude the poem  in the manuscript edition are broken into two in the print edition with  two sets of five lines. 

There’s a well-known line of filiation that one can draw from Pound and Williams to Oppen, Creeley, and from them to John Taggart. Literary historians and critics will continue to discuss the influence of various forms of Objectivism upon Taggart’s poetry. As well as other influences and other poets and artists. But what captivates me about Taggart’s poetry is simply the example of poetry it offers. By that I mean not only its trimness — its intense attention to form — but its awareness on the page of poetry as a made thing. The physicality of language, its materiality, is rendered in its delicate phrasing, in its musicality. To speak of his twentieth-century poetic lineage is necessary, but that recognition also misses the fact that his poetry is in the great lyric tradition of poetry, which in modern English goes back to the Elizabethan tradition, a tradition that valued the purity of the lyric voice over and above the autobiographical self-posturing of the poet. Too much contemporary American poetry exists in the prosaic service of attempting to make a celebrity out of the minor happenings of the poet in ways that show little regard for poetry. John Taggart’s poetry does just the opposite: it is a poetry in which the speaker’s voice achieves a chastened, even classical, lyricism. In John Taggart’s poetry you will not find a celebration of John Taggart; you will find a celebration of lyric poetry in which John Taggart’s voice is unmistakable.
 
 
from “Landscape with Light” 
Fictions of the one you love
 (“Vertigo”)
 
 Not   the life      dreamt of
 but the one found while living it—
 terrors & fears,
 the past plunging down     like a bottomless nightmare—
 it’s all real.
 
 The troubling dreams, the troubling fictions are real.
 The fictions of the ones you love are real—
 like a painting whose artifice outshines
 the subject of the painting.
 
 The white domed church overlooking the blue bay,
 the cemetery obelisks next to the thin, blood-orange gladiolas,
 & the mysterious woman fading       into a forest dusk
 
 are radiant with strange meanings.
 Haze of desire over
 every object of desire:
 
 fear of paradise,
 fear from panic.
 
 The tragedy of never ever knowing
 
 
 
 
Time lapse
(“Grey Gardens”) 
Whether you can tell from this distance     what
 the house was before it was
 consumed by wildness, by rampant
 
 greenery is only partly the point. Its grand dreams have aged,
 the ravage,  evident to the eye.
 
 Devoured by whispers      what remains
 remains grey-shingled & silver shadowed.
 
 Green leaves whisper ruin, vines whisper ruin; boughs whisper ruin…
 
 Whispers of things not allowed. Of things someone
 thought was said.
 
 The present’s the movie of the past, a dialogue of disembodied voices,
 each talking to the other, over the other, a polyphonic contestation of desire
 undiminished by time.
 
 The rooms     the lonely rooms       echo with them.
 
 The ocean—a thin ribbon of blue—contends in its own element
 with a never-ending susurration.
 
 From the outside, you can barely see the faces through the window screens.
 
From the interior—the dim, decrepit interior—the long windows are full of leaves & light. 
 
 
 
Not even a dream
(“Deliverance”)
Riverwater rushes downstream           whitewater over blackrock, over
 ragged  rockcleft     past lean-to, boulder-slabs on the riverbank—
 frenzy of fast water meeting riverrock,
 the force of it a cry in the heart       carrying itself beyond
 the echoes of other cries      echoes fainter in the churning.
 Part of the green, fog-shrouded, humid wilderness,
 part of the night sky—a full moon cloud-ringed in darkness—
                                                                                                                 the river
 wholly takes itself as itself, insensate to suffering.
 
 Flowing past the rusted-out car-hulls sinking into river banks,
 the little white clapboard church &
 the grave-yard being emptied of its graves     the river
 is deathlessly complete
 passionless in its turbulence      so flat in its final afterfalls serenity
 the trees half down in it
 
 
 
White days, interruption
(“One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest”) 
                                                        The horizon of all possibilities
returns as the muffled terror of institutions—
 gleaming waxed floors
 long corridors & locked rooms
 stretch into interminable futures
 
 wherein whiteness is the administration of days
which
will not suffer a whit of deviation
or allow more than a rectangle of sky—
 
The wind blows in squalls
and between clouds & clouds
words shrivel the will
 
but if one were to say that words        could be prayers
if one were to say that words could be love      or tokens of love
if one were to say that words could grieve
 
then the wind that blows in squalls might be the sound of elegies
through the pines
                                           & the fog at dusk could be said to be settling back
on the green forests & the black mountains,
                                                                                    hushed & hushing
a syllabic quietness
demanding nothingA Distillate
Small facial bones pointing at. 
Here rests the kingdom of this world.
The infiltration of trees increases, it overtakes the camp,
Behind which the sun fades, chaffs and
All of that sees us.
Most clearly.
 
The monk’s blue jeans whisper in the light
Windward, when the voice implodes
Over the plain, the one we are thinking about now
Without us, as if anything took place,
Had its time and could exist
In our form.
 
Nothing exists in our form.
The blue jeans are silent about it, the plain is thinking about it,
Time sees it. Here in this place moves
The infiltration, the bones scatter down the steps,
Which lead upward.
Thirty-three.
 

 
 
 
Description of a Human Figure 
A figure strung blindly 
Along a malarial river,
Channeled in a ditch toward
Stagnant water, where it fades out like mud.
 
A hearth of rather loud bones,
A rice paddle, paper made directly
From the source of experience with no participation
Of the subject or object of its reflection.
 
A road paved across a plain
Cuts through the wood in which it will find nothing
But the sawing of the cicadas and the dust
It was not made of, there being no such need.
 
A colony of ponds, a house on palings,
An awning protecting a place to live in.
The road that leads nowhere.
Its goal shines on it from there.
 
Nothing Further
A total drowning, a shallow dip, legs barely
Sticking out, limbs barely exposed and everything that is
Allegedly in place grows moist and changes
Shape. In the touch there is no dryness, though it doesn’t get wet
At first, not a particle is left
That could pierce the wooden leg or the table top with its
Beating; it is dry only on the outside where an empty cement bag
 
Is rolled up; in the corner of the yard — a patch of mold on the peeling
Plaster. Decomposition in the heat, a feeling like a scrap,
The light picked clean off the bone. No coming back, because what’s next
To stand, then, as if at the crossroads, next to somebody, next to a wreck,
But in the distance of half-closed eyes, clearly hearing something like
A swelling stream, in non-separation, through somehow
Stay and always go, here, in the square, a molted rhombus
 
Of grass, in this flattening, in a state of non-matter, a transitory
Murmur, in the tingling marrow and in the arborized circle
Of buildings, not houses, amidst the hum of swallowed scales
And the rustle of shadows where nothing reaches the summit, in the falling
And the fall, leaving with non-contact, in a strained intention
Of staying, with no opinion on any case. A pit left
By the lightning — yes, to stay there until the ensuing of ceasing, in the atrial
 
Fibrillation and a nervous movement, yes, now, then and some time later to have
Only later and right away. Always later, always not now, maybe
Some time later, not like this, like somebody else wants it, right now and
Immediately. Hurdy-gurdy, drums and trumpet. Spawn and scratch.
Sounds filed down, imprinted dates, a postage stamp idyll,
A wedding card, the melody of a wedding march. And then
A stray desert, a moth on a white wall, and then a blind wall.
 

 
 
 
Fullness of Faults
The tip topples, the meadow flows out of horizon’s knot, nobody
Is fuller of being than shadows accumulated in buckets — that’s the way it goes,
It rubs against the wall, the eye’s grater weaves from the upper edge down, thereby thinning
The given fragment. Do not drill any further, the skeleton of light
In the tunnel will be like metal bars at its end; the hand’s empty flare will soon
Induce many lips to pout, the parings and the strands of hair will mix
 
In one cauldron, cement and sand will stiffen into a preburial mask,
Faced with this we will achieve an ideal cast of the given moment
We will find out together how long each one of us has till the end
Of Autumn, for the thresholds of departure already begin to snow
Into rutted measly vanishing, at the door straps are hanging dead bridles
Of meticulous work, ditches evaporating from wet nests, dry stars screeching
 
Up on poles more room hatches, and there will be enough swoosh
In every meantime of distance celebration, and yet meager is
This world for such obvious and populous perdition within one filing
Of the vibrating swirl, in the fishponds the granaries of fraying veils get ready
To have their tails shredded by wishes of another happy year, the steady tread toward
The increasingly known gait into gravity — this memorable
 
Fullness of faults. I am being drawn there by the rusted sledge ruts, into the hilarious buzz
Of portioned out pleasures on mud-stained corridors of scars, baked in
Bruises of wood grains pulped into the panel they will lay you on, the pleated ropes
They will lift you down all the way to the first handful of dust. You, ghostly
Stretch of the road, may you fast become shorter, nothing remains that could
Last in a blind hole. Defeat yourself. Bury ourselves — we must do without.
 
[Jump]
Night yelps Day burns
Maybe later
Some kind of later whence
Under a heavy eyelid
 
On a bone-chilled beach
A delicious afternoon
Ready for the road
The wave waits
 
Yelps Goes deep to the heart
Catches itself sorts itself out
Drags itself whence
 
Braided bones seaweed
A diesel engine purrs The heart
On jump rope

Yesterday a Tuesday Today is 
Tuesday outside as in David

word from an equal

to write Carved months
the oculist will tear out
 
with an eyedropper? Station after station
the winter crossed the river
A tributary swallows on the forum
 
Introduction
 
Unmechanical is an ongoing collaboration that began in 2011. The project began with our accidentally simultaneous but disconnectedly individual revisitations of Ritwik Ghatak’s seminal film (Ajantrik/Unmechanical) with the same name. As the collaboration began, of film analysis and poetry, we were both excited and challenged by the virtual non-presence of such texts as our trammeled research crossed epistemes, languages, and countries. With a much studied film at hand, Madhuja’s focus has been on identifying new angles to the narrative, handling of the landscape metaphor, establishing unknown points of view that flush with the eccentricity themes at play, questioning the teller’s persona etc. Aryanil, following the analyses, attempts to extend some of these ideas on tangential planes — applying them to relatedly multiepistemological contexts that include automotive technology, the aesthetics of intersections, art and film theory, poetics and personal philosophy in an internal combustion of sorts, sometimes applying Oppenian writing strategies to subtexts by Carl Jung — someone who had profoundly influenced the artistic mold of Ritwik Ghatak.
 

Ajantrik: A film synopsis
 
The plot, based on a well known short story by Subodh Ghosh, revolves around a slightly eccentric drifter Bimal and his pre–World War Chevy jalopy Jagaddal. Bimal, a private taxi driver in a hill town in eastern India, is often teased by his passengers and fellow drivers about his beat-up car. He, however, treats his car like a human, a friend, and offers thick skin to such scum, and at times, is infuriated by the harsh comments. On one occasion he drives a newly married couple to a bungalow. The youthful bride attracts his attention. Soon Bimal learns that she has eloped with her man and is carrying pricy jewelry. Taking pity on the deserted “bride,” robbed of her jewelry as her man deceives her, Bimal drives her to the nearest railway station and buys her a ticket. Romantic hope begins to soar but the woman leaves quietly. An utterly dejected Bimal kicks Jagaddal. In no time the old wheeler begins to create trouble but Bimal pulls a handsome amount of money and decides to repair it against the advice of the mechanic. Roaringly the machine comes back to life but fails to meet the steep physical challenge lying ahead in the hilly roads. The engine stalls, once for all. A despirited Bimal decides to sell it off as scrap iron.
 
 
 
 

Endlessly, endlessly,
The definition of mortality
 
The image of the engine
 
That stops.
We cannot live on that
— George Oppen 

[y]ou may call my protagonist, Bimal, a lunatic, a child, or a tribal. At one level, they are all the same. They all react to lifeless things almost passionately. This is an ancient, archetypal reaction.

an archetype is a kind of readiness a river
learns to acquire as it blooms
the skill to erode    to deposit    to acknowledge
objectively the petaloid being connected
at the origin of  collected  self
a series of mirrors of different kinds

stack like envelops impregnated parchments
of little suspense a plethora  so to speak
detach the petals       bring them to a close inspection

By using, Campbell (see ‘Manabsamaj, Amader Aitijhya — o — Amader Prochesta’ [Civil Society, Our Traditions and Efforts]) Ghatak builds the plot of Ajantrik by using archetypal motifs. He insists that there are “two types of minds,” the “tough-minded,” who are “inert and reactionary”; and as opposed to this the “tender-minded” who are the “progressive impulse.” While suggesting that these two face each other in human history, Ghatak elaborates on how this is worked out in the film. He writes, while Bimal is an archetype, Bulki the madman, is his “absurd extension”;  and the tribal Oraon, are his “sublime extreme.” According to Ghatak, Piyari Singh, who is Bimal’s opponent is “tough-minded” while Bimal remains “tender-minded.” My note comments on how these structures of oppositions are worked out through the sound track, and how the sound track possibly narrates themes of loneliness, separation, journey, and madness.

I was once told about structures of opposition
in an early architecture class
about how civilizations of binary taste and value
of archetypal motifs of fine discord
have preferred to grow on both sides of rivers
and avenues
loathing the other with the progressive impulse
of  a lunatic
 
that a whole character can embody a part of another
that there can be an almost archetypal
ancient tough-minded reaction
to the orifice of a tender mind
from which oozes a sublime fluid of absurd density
forms our cosmic law of fragmentation
that can both dissect and reverse parts of us
onto ourselves
making our faces turn inert and reactionary
as they passionately retort to lifeless things
 
lifeless inanimate objects      lumps of iron  lets say
a jalopy  to be precise
that obscures its ability to hide along with
the grime and goo of memory
many faces and expressions of human history
that films with their  larger-than-life habit training
fondly tend to record these themes of
loneliness
separation
journey
and madness
apt with the soundtrack of an afternoon’s amphitheatre
where we sit-and-draw
a day  like ourselves
talkative and sonorous
and
unsoundly refulgent

In the first instance, Bimal and his car move through a massive desolate landscape. The extreme long shots and the composition where Bimal and the car have decentred locations, situate the plot of the film. After a while, Bimal realises that Jaggadal is thirsty. Therefore, he goes to fetch some water. An extreme long shot taken from the other side of the river shows Bimal filling a can. However, the effect sound is way too louder than what the actual noise can possibly be. This is further heighten when Bimal pours water into Jaggadal’s radiator (mouth) and Ghatak uses the sound of a person gulping down water. The close-up of Bimal’s face shows that he is deeply content, and is intensely involved with this machine. Sometimes wayward cows and Bimal’s off-tune singing disturb the eerie silence of the barren lands. Jaggadal (his car) apparently does not ‘like’ the song and screeches. Bimal takes out his napkin and covers the head light, or the Jaggadal’s eyes (!) Then he shouts even louder, “Kaalo meyer …” [a song dedicated to Goddess Kali]. In terms of plot development, nothing particular happens in this sequence. Nevertheless, the extreme long shots of the landscape, some cows, and the deployment of sound-silence establish the theme of the film. To use Kumar Sahani’s words (Filmfare, 1976),
[a]fter demonstrating the romantic extension of a character’s sentiments into nature, Ritwik Ghatak immediately counterpoints it with his distinctive 180 [degree] panoramics on empty landscapes. Nature, in the end, is grandly indifferent to human joy or sorrow.

Bimal appears like an archetypical outsider, moving with zest on the fringes.  Moreover, as Bimal moves around the place, Ghatak produces a montage of images of the working people and the factory lines, which are caught in the context of industry, modernity, and work. A rhythmic sound pattern produces dance like moments with man (and woman) and machine. Caught in the times of war, Ghatak comments on the patterns of modernity. According to Subrata Bandyopadhyay (“Indian Cinema,” 1977/1978),
Ajantrik remains a rich experience of a study of a basically agrarian society moving towards industrialization. It has been handled with great deal of tenderness and humour, arising out of the artistic exaggeration of humanizing the machine …. It was possible for Ritwik to get away with this seeming unreality, by placing it in the background of tribal areas, with their child-like primitive myths. 

In another sequence towards the end, after Jaggadal refuses to move as it were, and in fact, starts moving backwards; furious and disappointed Bimal caught on the thin line between the imaginary and symbolic pushes Jaggadal to the extremes. Suddenly, the landscape resonates with a sound of a trumpet. The camera seems to pan over the sound (Ghatak’s infuriating pans are an integral part of his style). Then with gusto, a snakelike, powerful and charming trumpet enters the frame. The Oraon have arrived. The tribal dance is a beautiful play of sound, image, and rhythm. This supposedly excessively long sequence ends with the tribal almost overtaking Jaggadal, and thereby producing strange juxtapositioning of the primitive and the modern. While Ghatak had made a documentary on the Oraon, this sequence seemingly uses various kinds of images to present such dualities.

The theme of ‘madness’ becomes a powerful tool to examine structures of modernity. The location, uses of vast landscapes and Bimal’s free movement within this space, show the ways in which ‘madness’ appears acceptable within certain frameworks; and in fact, blends with the ‘sublime’ as we see Bimal becoming a part of the tribe, gulping down his pain in the dark. In the last sequence, when Jaggadal is torn apart and sold of as scrap iron, we see Jaggadal ‘bleed’ and make disturbing, uncanny noise. As a counter point, we see Bulki, the madman, who has forgotten his junk bowl and is happy with the new one. Having earlier abused Jaggadal as ‘lohar bachcha’ [fucking iron], Bimal now tells her ‘don’t go with hard feelings’ and stares with longing as Jaggadal’s body is carried away in parts. Suddenly we hear a horn blowing. Then, we see a child playing with it. Here with the striking last shots, Ghatak connects the sublime with madness, un-nurtured childlike behavior and the primordial.

I can’t tell if the absence of a rear view mirror

on a road not signposted by history in any way
coronates the wreath with freedom unrestraint and eternity
a society that wants to live only in today
obsessively tossing and turning the toy
of its paltry past right at the tip its nosy presence
grappling onto it          in a bid to make it a part
of its present continuous  
 
our démodé rider moves through it
with its beetle eyes wide open
never caring to notice if nature surrounds in grayscale
or in Geva Color
if it was wet or wry
the vehicle wobbles its way through to progress
 
I can’t tell if this spiral monotony   this change of coordinates
is in search of some future vector
whose sense is a direction that cannot be foretold
we aren’t going to be even curious to know
if progress has anything to do
with moving forward or backward
we’ll watch morning’s fog above the white picket fence
as if the does came here losing the  forest trail
all young  and childless
wetskin and quiet
dwindling through the mist of unspokenness
to reveal to us that life lives on      so do they
beyond the contrapment of all rear view mirrors
direct and frontal
making room for the car to be part of its play
part of its nebula
through which the car moves not knowing
about its own disappearance
like the writer of this tale
who his story loses
into the silver voice of another teller
where it shines

Ritwik Ghatak: A short life sketch
 
Apart from being a stalwart of an Indian cinema of social realism, Ritwik Ghatak, is perhaps one of the most truly original filmmakers with no cinematic predecessors. As Satyajit Ray, had once famously said, “For him Hollywood might not have existed at all.” All of his films were made in black and white with privately arranged paltry funds often struggling at the distributor's end. His maiden feature got to the theaters a quarter century after it was made. Major films include Nagarik (The Citizen, 1953), Ajantrik (The Unmechanical,1957–8), Bari Thekey Paliye (Running Away From Home, 1959), Meghey Dhaka Tara (The Cloud-Capped Star, 1960), Komal Gandhar (Soft Note on a Sharp Scale, 1961), Subarnarekha (The Golden Line, 1962), Titas Ekti Nadir Naam (A River Named Titaas, 1973), and Jukti Takko Aar Gappo (Reasons, Arguments and Tales, 1974). He was a noted writer of short fiction, cine commentaries and essays. An incurable alcoholic, Ghatak succumbed to his addiction amidst unstoppable misery and negligence in 1976.When can I move from this room
the landscape with yellow birds on my wall
to leave this dust and cold illumination?
… no matter how long I warm with my hands
 
To look at all I am again
the beginnings    the awareness    the wild myths out of vision:
the Kansas that I am    my meaning stretched toward that center earth —
because I do not struggle there to sink into the rocks
to know my footsteps    to step into them …
because I am tired
because I hate the dead illumined reason to combat Cambridge
the change of worlds    the sudden past for friendship
 
There are too many summers full of Kansas in my heat —
whatever fresh blood to spurt my hands into fever and reality
is there across sun and brick pavement looking west toward Wichita
And whatever I am it is to communicate
to rummage in the endless heat at my wrist and eyes
to never cease to tell —
yes, Tu Fu and rock n roll, to hand across the summer
to tell the roots of worth in every humanity
to call out    to play the green ghost fires into the rock
that no one will ever forget
that no one will ever move down this sweating corridor
caked in the dust of any man’s intelligence
 
I want to sing to grant sincerity
to carve as no cold stone statues by the frozen ditches
Wisdom, my pockets are full toward all men
and these few teeth to bite for all
out of the cold
                             o generosity
the dead center
 
 
A SONG OF AUTUMN
 
A dog disappears
across a small lake.
It waits for me.
It goes where I want to go.
Begins to wake up the flowers.
So leave us alone.
Because no freedom can choose
between faces and
hours as destroyed as moving,
or cold water in the
sun. I can go out
now and measure
the flies that swing around trees
like doctors around a woman
full of bars and beauties
you could never make free;
Not even if the
flowers turn to moss and
loose sensations for their stems.
Ceravolo’s poems strike one as intensely personal, despite their modernist strategies. Many are gentle, intimate, about love, sex, family, weather, sadness, change, together with a sense of the cosmic forces that weave through and around all of these. Their riskiness in terms of language makes their success all the greater. His titles, which are like no one else’s, suggest some of the marvelous, difficult-to-pin-down qualities of the poetry: “The Green Lake Is Awake,” “Fill and Illumined,” “Passivation,” “Wild Provoke of the Endurance Sky.”
I think a part of his strength as a poet may derive from his other life as an engineer (or else relate to that part of him which is related to being an engineer). Despite the presence of so much feeling in his poetry, there is also a kind of rigor — coupled with a modesty, a tentativeness akin to Keats’s “negative capability” — which ensures: no sloppiness, no dishonesty. How about this for a beginning:
There’s nothing to love in this
rice Spring.
(“Warmth”)
Or:
I can’t live blossoming drunk
(“The Book of Wild Flowers”)
Here is a recent poem, one of eight printed in Big Sky 9:
ANNUAL PARALLAX
 
The sun is in the sky
and it is bright.
The signs are bright
and soon there is something
to shine. Until the flower
coming out of the soil.
There is something dark
in this bright sun.
It is not my feeling toward
you; the universe; or feelings
of Spring.

Ceravolo’s more recent poems, those that I’ve seen, are less severely dislocated syntactically and grammatically than his very early ones. But the marvelous childlike directness and wonder — he is the Master of the Quietly Blunt Question — are still there. The voice goes wherever it goes, by whatever it is led, by logic or not. The poems should be set to music if they haven’t been already; his major mode is pure, if distinctly modern, song. They should also be collected again, it’s more than high time. Because it’s a pleasure to copy them, and because they should be read above all, here are two more from his O’Hara Award–winning book.
PASSION FOR THE SKY
 
You are near me. The night
is rectilinear and light
in the new lipstick
on your mouth and on the colored
flowers. The irises are blue.
As far as I look we are across. A
boat crosses by. There is no monkey in me
left: sleep. There is something
sold, lemons. Corn is whizzing from the
ground. You are sleeping
and day starts its lipstick.
Where do we go from here?
Blue irises.

DATA
To indicate is to
turn off   in a world
away from ease.
Rotating in a mean format of oxygen.
First make and then
made all alone until
the end of a blank.
The smoke opens up and out
comes a word
in a new storage of love.
Turning off or
turning on the calcareous bases
we find our selves in
are set there by IT.
Divine and more
divine each day, no control,
but in another world.I think tonight I am beginning to understand some impulses
That a friend of mine Joe Ceravolo seems to have been having
And which others have certainly had
Which makes no difference
But which might make him seem terribly silly for a while
And which if I’m right I’m beginning to feel myself
About now and therefore sympathize with
It’s a cheap sympathy when you have to come about it like this
But who cares
Listen, Joe Ceravolo
You’re OKA few years ago I was having beers with a couple of friends. Most of our conversation centered itself around poems and books that had stayed with us, or surprised us in ways we couldn’t have imagined. Someone would offer up a title and a discussion, tangent, poem, or line would follow. I remember how quiet they went when one of them mentioned John Taggart’s Pastorelles. How they just looked at one another and slowly smiled.
A month or so later I started reading Pastorelles, and I understood that quiet.
I was struck by so many things. The repetition that created a multiplicity and exactness simultaneously, the subtlety and boldness of the slash, a similarity in the landscape of the rural Pennsylvania I grew up in, and a lived feeling in the poems. In “Pastorelle 7” Taggart writes,
the problem is not finding a rock there are
 many
 
 the problem is not turning
 into a rock
 
 the problem is a problem of how
 far how far can I throw myself and how far can I
throw myself again[1]
I can’t imagine anyone who writes poems not understanding that struggle. That exactness. I can’t imagine anyone alive who wouldn’t understand that struggle. That multiplicity.
For a number of years I had wanted to attempt a series of poems that would consist of a box of words that potentially could be read in any direction. It was daunting, and so it stayed as something to try later. When I read “Pastorelle 7” I decided to “throw myself again” at/into the idea. I came to see through Taggart’s poetry what my earlier thinking was missing, and that was a living conversation. The active conversation that happened as I read and thought towards my own writing reminded me of Peter Gizzi’s “A Panic That Can Still Come Upon Me”:
It was an effort
if I wanted to go all over a word
and live inside its name, so be it.[2]
The poems in Pastorelles do more than just evoke or create people, places, and time. The poems allow us to dwell and participate, to “live inside” the people, places, and times through our reading and writing.

Note: “For/After Again” is a revisiting of the five footnotes in “For/After” while rereading Pastorelles. “For/After” originally appeared in Little Red Leaves 5.
