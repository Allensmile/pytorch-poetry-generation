the cheap dropped ceiling 
         jumped like a pot-lid boiling 
when our upstairs neighbor 
      chased his girl that winter. 
             falling out of 

summer's skimpy tops 
    she'd want our phone. her plush lips 
creased. not exactly blonde, 
       but luteous, we thought, 
                     pleased the right word 

was there for that shade 
       of slightly slutty mermaid. 
wincing, we'd hear him punch 
      along the floor on crutch- 
               es, a giant 

bat trying to mince 
         a mayfly. sex and violence 
you called them blondie with 
         dagwood on crystal meth, 
               i'd tell our friends 

over dinners stewed 
       in noise. even his truck cowed. 
black, smoked glass, outsized wheels 
       flaunted like chrome knuckles 
                we shrank from, ducked, 

afraid we'd find her 
         later, knocking at our door. 
some nights we waited through 
      like captured prey. to you 
               i'd turn in bed, 

saying the furtive
         words against your back, i love 
... you'd stroke my hair, or hip, 
         all our years the same flip 
                  crack, i do, too.


for my people everywhere singing their slave songs 
     repeatedly their dirges and their ditties and their blues 
     and jubilees, praying their prayers nightly to an 
     unknown god, bending their knees humbly to an 
     unseen power

for my people lending their strength to the years, to the 
    gone years and the now years and the maybe years, 
    washing ironing cooking scrubbing sewing mending 
    hoeing plowing digging planting pruning patching
    dragging along never gaining never reaping never 
    knowing and never understanding

for my playmates in the clay and dust and sand of alabama
    backyards playing baptizing and preaching and doctor 
    and jail and soldier and school and mama and cooking 
    and playhouse and concert and store and hair and
    miss choomby and company

for the cramped bewildered years we went to school to learn 
    to know the reasons why and the answers to and the 
    people who and the places where and the days when, in 
    memory of the bitter hours when we discovered we 
    were black and poor and small and different and nobody 
    cared and nobody wondered and nobody understood

for the boys and girls who grew in spite of these things to 
    be man and woman, to laugh and dance and sing and 
    play and drink their wine and religion and success, to 
    marry their playmates and bear children and then die
    of consumption and anemia and lynching

for my people thronging th street in chicago and lenox 
    avenue in new york and rampart street in new 
    orleans, lost disinherited dispossessed and happy 
    people filling the cabarets and taverns and other 
    people's pockets and needing bread and shoes and milk and
    land and money and something--something all our own

for my people walking blindly spreading joy, losing time 
     being lazy, sleeping when hungry, shouting when 
     burdened, drinking when hopeless, tied, and shackled 
     and tangled among ourselves by the unseen creatures 
     who tower over us omnisciently and laugh

for my people blundering and groping and floundering in 
     the dark of churches and schools and clubs 
     and societies, associations and councils and committees and 
     conventions, distressed and disturbed and deceived and 
     devoured by money-hungry glory-craving leeches, 
     preyed on by facile force of state and fad and novelty, by 
     false prophet and holy believer

for my people standing staring trying to fashion a better way
    from confusion, from hypocrisy and misunderstanding, 
    trying to fashion a world that will hold all the people, 
    all the faces, all the adams and eves and their countless generations

let a new earth rise. let another world be born. let a 
    bloody peace be written in the sky. let a second 
    generation full of courage issue forth let a people 
    loving freedom come to growth. let a beauty full of 
    healing and a strength of final clenching be the pulsing 
    in our spirits and our blood. let the martial songs 
    be written, let the dirges disappear. let a race of men now 
    rise and take control.


below the gardens and the darkening pines 
the living water sinks among the stones, 
sinking yet foaming till the snowy tones 
merge with the fog drawn landward in dim lines. 
the cloud dissolves among the flowering vines, 
and now the definite mountain-side disowns 
the fluid world, the immeasurable zones. 
then white oblivion swallows all designs. 

but still the rich confusion of the sea, 
unceasing voice, sombre and solacing, 
rises through veils of silence past the trees 
in restless repetition bound, yet free, 
wave after wave in deluge fresh releasing 
an ancient speech, hushed in tremendous ease.


after reading ash wednesday 
she looked once at the baked beans   
and fled. luncheonless, poor girl,   
she observed a kind of poetic lent-- 
and i had thought i liked poetry   
better than she did. 

i do. but to me its most endearing 
quality is its unsuitableness 
and, conversely, the chief wonder in heaven   
whither i also am sometimes transported   
is the kind of baggage i bring with me. 

surely there is no more exquisite jointure   
in the anatomy of life than that at which   
poetry dovetails with the inevitable meal   
and mrs. b. sits murmuring of avocados. 



when all my five and country senses see, 
the fingers will forget green thumbs and mark   
how, through the halfmoon's vegetable eye,   
husk of young stars and handfull zodiac, 
love in the frost is pared and wintered by, 
the whispering ears will watch love drummed away   
down breeze and shell to a discordant beach,   
and, lashed to syllables, the lynx tongue cry   
that her fond wounds are mended bitterly.   
my nostrils see her breath burn like a bush. 

my one and noble heart has witnesses 
in all love's countries, that will grope awake 
and when blind sleep drops on the spying senses,   
the heart is sensual, though five eyes break. 



not that the pines were darker there,   
nor mid-may dogwood brighter there,   
nor swifts more swift in summer air 
    it was my own country, 

having its thunderclap of spring,   
its long midsummer ripening,   
its corn hoar-stiff at harvesting, 
    almost like any country, 

yet being mine its face, its speech,   
its hills bent low within my reach,   
its river birch and upland beech 
    were mine, of my own country. 

now the dark waters at the bow 
fold back, like earth against the plow   
foam brightens like the dogwood now 
    at home, in my own country. 



love is more thicker than forget
more thinner than recall
more seldom than a wave is wet
more frequent than to fail

it is most mad and moonly
and less it shall unbe
than all the sea which only
is deeper than the sea

love is less always than to win
less never than alive
less bigger than the least begin
less littler than forgive

it is most sane and sunly
and more it cannot die
than all the sky which only
is higher than the sky


a equals x, says mister one.   
a equals b, says mister two.   
a equals nothing under the sun   
but a, says mister three. a few   
applaud some wipe their eyes   
some linger in the shade to see   
one and two in neat disguise   
decapitating mister three. 

this age is not entirely bad. 
it's bad enough, god knows, but you   
should know elizabethans had   
sweeneys and mrs. porters too.   
the past goes down and disappears,   
the present stumbles home to bed,   
the future stretches out in years 
that no one knows, and you'll be dead.


plurality is all. i walk among the restaurants,   
the theatres, the grocery stores i ride the cars 
and hear of mrs. bedford's teeth and albuquerque,   
strikes unsettled, someone's simply marvelous date,   
news of the german jews, the baseball scores,   
storetalk and whoretalk, talk of wars. i turn   
the pages of a thousand books to read 
the names of buddha, malthus, walker evans, stendhal, andr gide, 
ouspenski note the terms obscurantism,   
factorize, fagaceous, endocarp descend   
the nervous stairs to hear the broken ends   
of songs that float through city air. 
in osnabrck and ogden, on the passamaquoddy bay,   
in ahmednagar, waco neb., in santa f, 
propelled by zeros, zinc, and zephyrs, always i'm pursued 
by thoughts of what i am, authority, remembrance, food, 
the letter on the mezzanine, the unemployed, dogs' lonely faces, pianos and decay. 

plurality is all. i sympathize, but cannot grieve 
too long for those who wear their dialectics on their sleeves.   
the pattern's one i sometimes rather like there's really nothing wrong 
with it for some. but i should add it doesn't wear for long,   
before i push the elevator bell and quickly leave.


even on easter sunday   
when the church was a 

jungle of lilies and   
ferns fat uncle paul 

who loved his liquor   
so would pound away 

with both fists on the   
stone pulpit shouting 

sin sin sin and the   
fiery fires of hell 

and i cried all after- 
noon the first time i 

heard what they did to   
jesus it was something 

the children shouldn't   
know about till they 

were older but the new   
maid told me and both 

of us cried a lot and so   
mother got another one 

right away & she sent   
away miss richardson 

who came all the way   
from england because 

she kept telling how   
her fianc mr. bowles- 

lyon died suddenly of   
a heart attack he just 

said one day at lunch   
i'm afraid i'm not well 

and the next thing they   
knew he was sliding un- 

der the table. easter   
was nice the eggs were 

silly but the big lilies   
were wonderful & when 

uncle paul got so fat   
from drinking that he 

couldn't squeeze into   
the pulpit anymore & 

had to preach from the   
floor there was an el- 

ders' meeting and they   
said they would have 

the pulpit rebuilt but   
uncle paul said no it 

was the lord's manifest   
will and he would pass 

his remaining years in   
sacred studies i liked 

thanksgiving better be- 
cause that was the day 

father took us down to   
the mills but easter i 

liked next best and the   
rabbits died because we 

fed them beet tops and   
the lamb pulled up the 

grass by the roots and   
was sold to mr. page the 

butcher i asked uncle   
robert what were sacred 

studies he said he was   
not really sure but he 

guessed they came in a   
bottle and mother sent 

me away from the table   
when i wouldn't eat my 

lamb chops that was   
ridiculous she said it 

wasn't the lamb of god   
it was just caesar an- 

dromache nibbles but i   
couldn't i just couldn't 

& the year of the strike   
we didn't go to church 

at all on easter because   
they said it wasn't safe 

down town so instead we   
had prayers in the library 

and then right in the mid- 
dle the telephone rang it 

was mr. shupstead at the   
mill they had had to use 

tear gas father made a   
special prayer right a- 

way for god's protection   
& mercy and then he sent 

us out to the farm with   
mother we stayed a week 

and missed school but it   
rained a lot and i broke 

the bathroom mirror and   
had to learn a long psalm.


if we could get the hang of it entirely 
   it would take too long 
all we know is the splash of words in passing   
   and falling twigs of song, 
and when we try to eavesdrop on the great   
   presences it is rarely 
that by a stroke of luck we can appropriate   
   even a phrase entirely. 

if we could find our happiness entirely 
   in somebody else's arms 
we should not fear the spears of the spring nor the city's 
   yammering fire alarms 
but, as it is, the spears each year go through 
   our flesh and almost hourly   
bell or siren banishes the blue   
   eyes of love entirely. 

and if the world were black or white entirely 
   and all the charts were plain 
instead of a mad weir of tigerish waters, 
   a prism of delight and pain, 
we might be surer where we wished to go   
   or again we might be merely 
bored but in brute reality there is no 
road that is right entirely.


anyone lived in a pretty how town 
with up so floating many bells down 
spring summer autumn winter 
he sang his didn't he danced his did. 

women and menboth little and small 
cared for anyone not at all 
they sowed their isn't they reaped their same 
sun moon stars rain 

children guessedbut only a few 
and down they forgot as up they grew 
autumn winter spring summer 
that noone loved him more by more 

when by now and tree by leaf 
she laughed his joy she cried his grief 
bird by snow and stir by still 
anyone's any was all to her 

someones married their everyones 
laughed their cryings and did their dance 
sleep wake hope and thenthey 
said their nevers they slept their dream 

stars rain sun moon 
and only the snow can begin to explain 
how children are apt to forget to remember 
with up so floating many bells down 

one day anyone died i guess 
and noone stooped to kiss his face 
busy folk buried them side by side 
little by little and was by was 

all by all and deep by deep 
and more by more they dream their sleep 
noone and anyone earth by april 
wish by spirit and if by yes. 

women and menboth dong and ding 
summer autumn winter spring 
reaped their sowing and went their came 
sun moon stars rain


not knowing in what season this again 
not knowing when again the arms outyearning   
nor the flung smile in eyes not knowing when 

not sure beyond all doubt of full return   
not sure of time now nor the film's reversal   
this all done opposite, the waif regathered 

like our lost parents in the blinded song 
we bag in hand with wandering steps and slow   
through suburbs take our solitary way 

not that all clouds are garrisoned and stung   
not that horizons loom with coppered legions   
not that the year is dark with weird condition 

all who parted in all days looked back 
saw the white face, the waving. and saw the sea   
not knowing in what season this again 

for well they knew, the parters in all evenings   
druid and roman and the rocked phoenician   
the blood flows one imposed way, and no other


to hurt the negro and avoid the jew 
is the curriculum. in mid-september 
the entering boys, identified by hats, 
wander in a maze of mannered brick
      where boxwood and magnolia brood
      and columns with imperious stance
      like rows of ante-bellum girls
         eye them, outlanders.

in whited cells, on lawns equipped for peace, 
under the arch, and lofty banister,
equals shake hands, unequals blankly pass
the exemplary weather whispers, quiet, quiet 
      and visitors on tiptoe leave
      for the raw north, the unfinished west, 
      as the young, detecting an advantage, 
         practice a face.

where, on their separate hill, the colleges, 
like manor houses of an older law,
gaze down embankments on a land in fee, 
the deans, dry spinsters over family plate,
      ring out the english name like coin, 
      humor the snob and lure the lout. 
      within the precincts of this world
         poise is a club.

but on the neighboring range, misty and high, 
the past is absolute some luckless race 
dull with inbreeding and conformity
wears out its heart, and comes barefoot and bad
      for charity or jail. the scholar
      sanctions their obsolete disease
      the gentleman revolts with shame
         at his ancestor.

and the true nobleman, once a democrat, 
sleeps on his private mountain. he was one
whose thought was shapely and whose dream was broad 
this school he held his art and epitaph.
      but now it takes from him his name,
      falls open like a dishonest look,
      and shows us, rotted and endowed,
         its senile pleasure.


it is not bad.  let them play. 
let the guns bark and the bombing-plane 
speak his prodigious blasphemies. 
it is not bad, it is high time, 
stark violence is still the sire of all the world's values. 

what but the wolf's tooth whittled so fine 
the fleet limbs of the antelope? 
what but fear winged the birds, and hunger 
jewelled with such eyes the great goshawk's head? 
violence has been the sire of all the world's values. 

who would remember helen's face 
lacking the terrible halo of spears? 
who formed christ but herod and caesar, 
the cruel and bloody victories of caesar? 
violence, the bloody sire of all the world's values. 

never weep, let them play, 
old violence is not too old to beget new values.


you humble in. it's just as you remember 
the sallow walls, formica counter top, 

the circular argument of time beneath 
fluorescent flickering--doubt, faith, and doubt. 

she knows you've been to see the gilded girl 
who's always promising and walking out 

with someone else. she knew that you'd return, 
with nothing in your pockets but your fists. 

why do you resist? when will you learn 
that this is what your weary dreams are of-- 

succumbing to her unconditional love?


the world is full of loss bring, wind, my love,
         my home is where we make our meeting-place,
         and love whatever i shall touch and read
         within that face.

lift, wind, my exile from my eyes
         peace to look, life to listen and confess,
         freedom to find to find to find
         that nakedness.


your landscape sickens with a dry disease 
even in may, virginia, and your sweet pines 
like frenchmen runted in a hundred wars 
are of a child's height in these battlefields.

for wilson sowed his teeth where generals prayed 
--high-sounding lafayette and sick-eyed lee--
the loud elizabethan crashed your swamps 
like elephants and the subtle indian fell.

is it for love, you ancient-minded towns, 
that on the tidy grass of your great graves 
and on your roads and riverways serene 
between the corn with green flags in a row,

wheat amorous as hair and hills like breasts 
each generation, ignorant of the last, 
mumbling in sheds, embarrassed to salute, 
comes back to choke on etiquette of hate?

you manufacture history like jute--
labor is cheap, virginia, for high deeds, 
but in your british dream of reputation
the black man is your conscience and your cost.

here on the plains perfect for civil war 
the clapboard city like a weak mirage 
of order rises from the sand to house 
these thousands and the paranoid monroe

the sunrise gun rasps in the throat of heaven 
the lungs of dawn are heavy and corrupt
we hawk and spit our flag walks through the air 
breathing hysteria thickly in each face.

through the long school of day, absent in heart, 
distant in every thought but self we tread, 
wheeling in blocks like large expensive toys 
that never understand except through fun.

to steal aside as aimlessly as curs
is our desire to stare at corporals
as sceptically as boys not to believe
the misty-eyed letter and the cheap snapshot.

to cross the unnatural frontier of your name 
is our free dream, virginia, and beyond, 
white and unpatriotic in our beds,
to rise from sleep like driftwood out of surf.

but stricter than parole is this same wall
and these green clothes, a secret on the fields, 
in towns betray us to the arresting touch 
of lady-wardens, good and evil wives.

and far and fabulous is the word outside
like europe when the midnight liners sailed, 
leaving a wake of ermine on the tide
where rubies drowned and eyes were softly drunk.

still we abhor your news and every voice 
except the personal enemy's, and songs
that pumped by the great central heart of love 
on tides of energy at evening come.

instinctively to break your compact law 
box within box, virginia, and throw down 
the dangerous bright habits of pure form 
we struggle hideously and cry for fear.

and like a very tired whore who stands 
wrapped in the sensual crimson of her art 
high in the tired doorway of a street 
and beckons half-concealed the passerby,

the sun, virginia, on your western stairs 
pauses and smiles away between the trees, 
motioning the soldier overhill to town 
to his determined hungry burst of joy.


some one who hears the bugle neigh will know   
how cold it is when sentries die by starlight. 

but none who love to hear the hammering drum   
will look, when the betrayer 
laughs in the desert like a broken monument,   
ringing his tongue in the red bell of his head,   
gesturing like a flag. 

the air that quivered after the earthquake   
when god died like a thief 
still plays the ancient forums like pianos   
the treacherous wind, lover of the demented,   
will harp forever in the haunted temples. 

what speeches do the birds make 
with their beaks, to the desolate dead? 
and yet we love those carsick amphitheaters,   
nor hear our messenger come home from hell   
with hands shot full of blood. 

no one who loves the fleering fife will feel   
the light of morning stab his flesh, 
but some who hear the trumpet's raving, in the ruined sky, 
will dread the burnished helmet of the sun,   
whose anger goes before the king.


ink-black, but moving independently   
across the black and white parquet of print,   
the ant cancels the author out. the page,   
translated to itself, bears hair-like legs   
disturbing the fine hairs of its fiber. 
these are the feet of summer, pillaging meaning,   
destroying alexandria. sunlight is silence   
laying waste all languages, until, thinly,   
the fictional dialogue begins again   
the page goes on telling another story. 




what's geography? what difference what mountain   
it is? in the intimacy of this altitude   
its discolored snowfields overhang half the world. 

on a knife rim edge-up into whirlpools of sky,   
feet are no anchor. gravity sucks at the mind   
spinning the blood-weighted body head downward. 

the mountain that had become a known profile   
on the day's horizon is a gesture of earth   
swinging us above falling spaces, above   
a map of the world. disturber of the unseen,   
provoker of the gusts in which we bend   
struggling against destruction gaping eastward. 
the wind fails. the breath held. the illusion of death.   
the resisting shoulder unopposed lurches   
west in innocent still air, as steep, as deep. 



rotting in the wet gray air 
the railroad depot stands deserted under   
still green trees. in the fields 
cold begins an end. 

there were other too-long-postponed departures.   
they left, finally, because of well water   
gone rank, the smell of fungus, the chill   
of rain in chimneys. 

the spot is abandoned even in memory. 
they knew, locking doors upon empty houses,   
to leave without regret is to lose 
title to one home forever. 



why should the devil get all the good tunes,   
the booze and the neon and saturday night,   
the swaying in darkness, the lovers like spoons?   
why should the devil get all the good tunes?   
does he hum them to while away sad afternoons   
and the long, lonesome sundays? or sing them for spite?   
why should the devil get all the good tunes,   
the booze and the neon and saturday night?


for marian
before you, i was living on an island 
and all around the seas of that lonely coast 
cast up their imitation jewels, cast 
their fables and enigmas, questioning, sly. 
i never solved them, or ever even heard, 
being perfect in innocence unconscious of self 
such ignorance of history was all my wealth-- 
a geographer sleeping in the shadow of virgins. 

but though my maps were made of private countries 
i was a foreigner in all of them after you had come, 
for when you spoke, it was with a human tongue 
and never understood by my land-locked gentry. 
then did the sun shake down a million bells 
and birds bloom on bough in wildest song 
phlegmatic hills went shivering with flame 
the chestnut trees were manic at their deepest boles 

it is little strange that nature was riven in her frame 
at this second creation, known to every lover-- 
how we are shaped and shape ourselves in the desires of the other 
within the tolerance of human change. 
out of the spring's innocence this revolution, 
created on a kiss, announced the second season, 
the summer of private history, of growth, through whose sweet sessions 
the trees lift toward the sun, each leaf a revelation. 

our bodies, coupled in the moonlight's album, 
proclaimed our love against the outlaw times 
whose signature was written in the burning towns. 
your face against the night was my medallion. 
your coming forth aroused unlikely trumpets 
in the once-tame heart. they heralded your worth 
who are my lodestar, my bright and ultimate north, 
marrying all points of my personal compass. 

this is the love that now invents my fear 
which nuzzles me like a puppy each violent day. 
it is poor comfort that the mind comes, saying 
what is one slim girl to the peoples' wars? 
still, my dice are loaded having had such luck, 
having your love, my life would still be whole 
though i should die tomorrow. i have lived it all. 
--and love is never love, that cannot give love up.


baton rouge, 
these are savannas bluer than your dreams 
where other loves are fashioned to older music, 
and the romantic in his light boat
puts out among flamingos and water moccasins 
looking for the river that went by last year.

even the angels wear confederate uniforms
and when the magnolia blooms and the honeysuckle, 
golden lovers, brighter than the moon,
read catullus in the flaring light
of the burning negro in the open eye of midnight.

and the traveller, moving in the hot swamps,
where every human sympathy sends up the temperature, 
comes of a sudden on the hidden glacier,
whose motives are blonder than hitler's choir boys.

here is the ambiguous tenderness of 'gators 
trumpeting their loves along a hundred miles 
of rivers writhing under trees like myths--
and human existence pursues the last, 
the simple and desperate life of the senses. 
since love survives only as ironic legend--
response to situations no longer present--
men lacking dignity are seized by pride, 
which is the easy upper-class infection.

the masters are at home in this merciless climate
but deep in the caves of their minds some animal memory 
warns of the fate of the mammoth at the end of the ice-age 
as sleeping children a toy, they hug the last, fatal error,
but their eyes are awake and their dreams shake as with palsy.

over birmingham where the blast furnace flowers 
and beyond the piney woods in cotton country, 
continually puzzling the pale aristocrats,
the sun burns equally white man and black.

the labor which they do makes more and more
their brotherhood condition for their whole existence 
they mint their own light, and their fusing fires 
will melt at last these centuries of ice.

this is a nightmare nimble in the big house, 
where sleepers are wakeful, cuddling their terror, 
in the empty acres of their rich beds, dreaming
of bones in museums, where the black boys yawn.


it was my thirtieth year to heaven 
woke to my hearing from harbour and neighbour wood   
      and the mussel pooled and the heron 
                  priested shore 
            the morning beckon 
with water praying and call of seagull and rook 
and the knock of sailing boats on the net webbed wall   
            myself to set foot 
                  that second 
      in the still sleeping town and set forth. 

      my birthday began with the water- 
birds and the birds of the winged trees flying my name   
      above the farms and the white horses 
                  and i rose   
            in rainy autumn 
and walked abroad in a shower of all my days. 
high tide and the heron dived when i took the road 
            over the border 
                  and the gates 
      of the town closed as the town awoke. 

      a springful of larks in a rolling 
cloud and the roadside bushes brimming with whistling   
      blackbirds and the sun of october 
                  summery 
            on the hill's shoulder, 
here were fond climates and sweet singers suddenly   
come in the morning where i wandered and listened   
            to the rain wringing 
                  wind blow cold 
      in the wood faraway under me. 

      pale rain over the dwindling harbour 
and over the sea wet church the size of a snail   
      with its horns through mist and the castle   
                  brown as owls 
            but all the gardens 
of spring and summer were blooming in the tall tales   
beyond the border and under the lark full cloud.   
            there could i marvel 
                  my birthday 
      away but the weather turned around. 

      it turned away from the blithe country 
and down the other air and the blue altered sky   
      streamed again a wonder of summer 
                  with apples 
            pears and red currants 
and i saw in the turning so clearly a child's 
forgotten mornings when he walked with his mother   
            through the parables 
                  of sun light 
      and the legends of the green chapels 

      and the twice told fields of infancy 
that his tears burned my cheeks and his heart moved in mine.   
      these were the woods the river and sea 
                  where a boy 
            in the listening 
summertime of the dead whispered the truth of his joy   
to the trees and the stones and the fish in the tide. 
            and the mystery 
                  sang alive 
      still in the water and singingbirds. 

      and there could i marvel my birthday 
away but the weather turned around. and the true   
      joy of the long dead child sang burning 
                  in the sun. 
            it was my thirtieth 
year to heaven stood there then in the summer noon   
though the town below lay leaved with october blood.   
            o may my heart's truth 
                  still be sung 
      on this high hill in a year's turning.


into this net of leaves, green as old glass   
that the sun fondles, trembling like images 

in water, this live net, swung overhead 
from branch to branch, what swam? the spider's thread 

is less passive, where it appears to float 
like a bright hair clinging to the wind's coat. 

hot at work, history neither schemes nor grieves   
here where the soaking dead are last year's leaves, 

and over them slung, meshed with sun, a net   
no creature wove, none frantically tried to fret. 

the huge weight of time without its sting   
hangs in that greenly cradling woof. a wing 

has caught there, held. held. but not to stay,   
we know, who, how slowly, walk away.


passing the american graveyard, for my birthday
the crosses stuttering, white on tropical green,
the years' quick focus of faces i do not remember . . .

the palm trees stalking like deliberate giants
for my birthday, and all the hot adolescent memories
seen through a screen of water . . .

for my birthday thrust into the adult and actual
expected to perform the action, not to ponder
the reality beyond the fact,
the man standing upright in the dream.



at two thousand feet the sea wrinkles like an old man's hand. 
closer, in a monotone of peristalsis,
its fugue-like swells create and recreate
one image in an idiot concentration.

from horizon to horizon, this desert
with the eye athirst for something stable 
when off to southeast-ward--
it was a plane all right, or had been,
a shipside fighter, her pontoons floated her. 
smashed like a match-case, no one could be sure 
if it were ours or had been one of theirs.

that's all there was. a thousand miles anywhere 
there was only the north ocean, the poleward pallor, 
like a desolation of spirit, lonelier than god. 
what did it mean? they thought of night fleets 
in the ghostly boreal dark or maybe
toy cardboard silhouettes in the bleak limbo of noon 
the salvos wink in bloom at twenty miles, 
the pause, the roar like a night freight
and the near misses building their faery forests.

where were these giants? the sea offered
a single clue, a symbol no explanation.
northward the fog banks thickened and on all horizons 
as if jealous of giving up secured positions
the night stirred angrily like an old suspicion.


europe 
as regarded from a great distance
impersonal the aim
where giant movements tend 
each man appears the same 
friend vanishes from friend.

in the long path of lead 
that changes place like light 
no shape of hand or head 
means anything tonight.

only the common will
for which explosion spoke 
and stiff on field and hill 
the dark blood of the folk.


for the ghost of johann sebastian bach
he was born to wonder about numbers.

he balanced fives against tens
and made them sleep together
and love each other.

he took sixes and sevens
and set them wrangling and fighting
over raw bones.

he woke up twos and fours
out of baby sleep
and touched them back to sleep.

he mananged eights and nines,
gave them prophet beards,
marched them into mists and mountains.

he added all the numbers he knew,
multiplied them by new-found numbers
and called it a prayer of numbers.

for each of a million cipher silences
he dug up a mate number
for a candle light in the dark.

he knew love numbers, luck numbers,
how the sea and the stars
are made and held by numbers.

he died from the wonder of numbering.
he said good-by as if good-by is a number.


a striped blouse in a clearing by bazille   
is, you may say, a patroness of boughs   
too queenly kind toward nature to be kin.   
but ceremony never did conceal, 
save to the silly eye, which all allows, 
how much we are the woods we wander in. 

let her be some sabrina fresh from stream, 
lucent as shallows slowed by wading sun, 
bedded on fern, the flowers' cynosure 
then nymph and wood must nod and strive to dream   
that she is airy earth, the trees, undone, 
must ape her languor natural and pure. 

ho-hum. i am for wit and wakefulness,   
and love this feigning lady by bazille.   
what's lightly hid is deepest understood,   
and when with social smile and formal dress   
she teaches leaves to curtsey and quadrille,   
i think there are most tigers in the wood.


we came so trustingly, for love, but these   
lowlands, flatlands, near beneath the sea   
point with their cautionary bones of sand   
to exorcize, submerge us we stay free   
only as mermaids glittering in the waves   
mermaids of the imagination, young   
a spring ago, who know our loveliness   
banished, like fireflies at winter's breath,   
because none saw these vines about our necks   
we placed in welcome once, but now as wreath   
against the scalpel cold still cold creeps in   
to grow like ivy over our chilling bodies   
into our blood. now in our diamond dress   
we wive only the sequins of the sea.   
the lowlands have rejected us. they lie   
athwart the whispering waters like a scar   
on a mirage of glass the dooming land,   
where nothing can take root but frost, has won.   
and what of warmth and what of joy? they are   
sequestered elsewhere, southward, where the sun   
speaks. for all our mermaid vigilance   
and balance, all goes under underneath   
the land's gray wave we falter and fall back   
to hibernate within the caves of death. 



robed in dungeon black, in mourning   
for themselves they pass, repace   
the dark linoleum corridors 
of humid wards, sure in the grace 

of self-denial. blown by duty,   
jet sails borne by a high wind, 
only the face and hands creep through   
the shapeless clothing, to remind 

one that a woman lives within 
the wrappings of this strange cocoon.   
her hands reach from these veils of death   
to harvest a child from the raw womb. 

the metal scales of paradox 
tip here then there. what can the nun   
think of the butchery of birth, 
mastery of the flesh, this one 

vigorous mystery? rude life 
from the volcano rolls and pours,   
tragic, regenerate, wild. sad, 
the unborn wait behind closed doors. 



 

people who have no children can be hard 
attain a mail of ice and insolence 
need not pause in the fire, and in no sense 
hesitate in the hurricane to guard. 
and when wide world is bitten and bewarred 
they perish purely, waving their spirits hence 
without a trace of grace or of offense 
to laugh or fail, diffident, wonder-starred. 
while through a throttling dark we others hear 
the little lifting helplessness, the queer 
whimper-whine whose unridiculous 
lost softness softly makes a trap for us. 
and makes a curse. and makes a sugar of 
the malocclusions, the inconditions of love. 

 

what shall i give my children? who are poor, 
who are adjudged the leastwise of the land, 
who are my sweetest lepers, who demand 
no velvet and no velvety velour 
but who have begged me for a brisk contour, 
crying that they are quasi, contraband 
because unfinished, graven by a hand 
less than angelic, admirable or sure. 
my hand is stuffed with mode, design, device. 
but i lack access to my proper stone. 
and plenitude of plan shall not suffice 
nor grief nor love shall be enough alone 
to ratify my little halves who bear 
across an autumn freezing everywhere. 

 

and shall i prime my children, pray, to pray? 
mites, come invade most frugal vestibules 
spectered with crusts of penitents' renewals 
and all hysterics arrogant for a day. 
instruct yourselves here is no devil to pay. 
children, confine your lights in jellied rules 
resemble graves be metaphysical mules. 
learn lord will not distort nor leave the fray. 
behind the scurryings of your neat motif 
i shall wait, if you wish revise the psalm 
if that should frighten you sew up belief 
if that should tear turn, singularly calm 
at forehead and at fingers rather wise, 
holding the bandage ready for your eyes. 



i 

the students, lost in raucousness,   
caught as by the elder breughel's eye,   
we sit in the college store 
over sandwiches and coffee, wondering.   
she answers eagerly the place was fine   
sometimes the winds grew very cold,   
the snows so deep and wide she lost   
sight of people. yes, she was well   
satisfied with her work, expected-- 
while the quarry's owner was away-- 
to do another year of it. 


             ii 

she is hammering. i hear 
the steady sound inside our dry,   
noisy days. sparks fly the mind,   
so taken, mighty for a moment,   
becomes quarry and sculptor both,   
something caught like love and war   
in this golden mesh and daring   
caught that flings like sparks girls   
and boys, flagrant cities prompt   
to daring's will, love and war   
its burly seconds. 


             iii 

i see again three kids we passed,   
three kids lounging at the edge 
of a forsaken quarry like something   
they had built in its sleepy pool 
they found the whiteness of their bodies, 
the excitement like parian marble. 


             iv 

such the waters we find ourselves 
in. we sit in the college store absorbed   
in food and talk. eagerness seizes us   
like love that leaves its best sailors   
in the mighty waves, love the word 
for hook whose catching, and the struggle   
there, is one great musical clash 
of minds--each wave a passion and a mind-- 
a possessed, tumultuous monument   
that would be free. 


             v 

                                           we strain forward 
as to some fabulous story. incandescence   
springs from her, the hammer of remembrance   
fresh, the young woman, bulky graceful body,   
face shining, who sculptured all winter 
alone near the source of her rock, 
digging down into the difficult rock 

the young woman who lost a day once,   
talked to her cat, and when the mirror 
of her art became too clear, when dreaming   
seemed too big for night alone, took long 
walks back to people, back to speech, 
and time 
             the woman, who at last-- 
i do not use live models--sculptured fish-- 
i remember long lonely holidays at shores   
when the spray alone defined green shapes   
approaching--has just seen her eyes 
still gleam with the gleam of it, 
blink like the making of many 
a take a great catch. 


             vi 

                                                   april, we say, 
is the time for fish, for reaching   
in its sea-like waftings one 
of earth's original conclusions 
like the leftover gill slits 
the singing student told us about 
in this very spot just two days ago . . . 

we are in the middle of a great catch,   
there collected as from her year-long   
lonely rock, the thrashing, clean- 
scaled, clear-lit shad in the net.


it sat between my husband and my children.   
a place was set for it--a plate of greens.   
it had been there i had seen it 
but not somehow--but this was like a dream-- 
not seen it so that i knew i saw it. 
it was as if i could not know i saw it 
because i had never once in all my life 
not seen it. it was an eland. 
an eland that is why the children 
would ask my husband, for a joke, at christmas   
father, is it donner? he would say, no, blitzen.   
it had been there always. now we put silver   
at its place at meals, fed it the same food   
we ourselves ate, and said nothing. many times   
when it breathed heavily when it had tried   
a long useless time to speak and reached to me   
so that i touched it--of a different size   
and order of being, like the live hard side   
of a horse's neck when you pat the horse-- 
and looked with its great melting tearless eyes   
fringed with a few coarse wire-like lashes   
into my eyes, and whispered to me 
so that my eyes turned backward in their sockets   
and they said nothing-- 
                                 many times   
i have known, when they said nothing,   
that it did not exist. if they had heard 
they could not have been silent. and yet they heard   
heard many times what i have spoken 
when it could no longer speak, but only breathe-- 
when i could no longer speak, but only breathe.   

and, after some years, the others came 
and took it from me--it was ill, they told me-- 
and cured it, they wrote me my whole city 
sent me cards lilac-branches, mourning 
as i had mourned-- 
                         and i was standing 
by a grave in flowers, by dyed rolls of turf, 
and a canvas marquee the last brown of earth.   

it is over.          
it is over so long that i begin to think 
that it did not exist, that i have never-- 
and my son says, one morning, from the paper 
an eland. look, an eland   
                                        --it was so. 

today, in a german dictionary, i saw elend 
and the heart in my breast turned over, it was-- 

it was a word one translates wretched. 

it is as if someone remembered saying 
this is an antimacassar that i grew from seed, 
and this were true.   
                                   and, truly, 
one could not wish for anything more strange-- 
for anything more. and yet it wasn't interesting .  .  . 
--it was worse than impossible, it was a joke. 

and yet when it was, i was-- 
even to think that i once thought 
that i could see it to feel the sweat 
like needles at my hair-roots, i am blind 

--it was not even a joke, not even a joke. 
yet how can i believe it? or believe that i 
owned it, a husband, children? is my voice the voice 
of that skin of being--of what owns, is owned 
in honor or dishonor, that is borne and bears-- 
or of that raw thing, the being inside it   
that has neither a wife, a husband, nor a child 
but goes at last as naked from this world   
as it was born into it-- 

and the eland comes and grazes on its grave.   

                                                     this is senseless? 
shall i make sense or shall i tell the truth? 
choose either--i cannot do both. 

i tell myself that. and yet it is not so,   
and what i say afterwards will not be so   
to be at all is to be wrong. 
                                                 being is being old 
and saying, almost comfortably, across a table   
from-- 
             from what i don't know-- 
                                                           in a voice 
rich with a kind of longing satisfaction   
to own an eland that's what i call life


return 

the taste is strong as ever, 
figs and cheese and wine. 
i recall each savor 
the taste is strong as ever, 
even if it will never 
be quite so fresh again. 
the taste is strong as ever, 
figs and cheese and wine.

two sides of one coin

metamorphosis 

why does transformation 
sneak up on us so? 
in life, not just narration, 
why does transformation 
creep up--yes, in slow motion, 
inexorably, though? 
why does transformation

no more savage art filleting a deft pressure along the 
       backbone

from tail fan to the red gills fighting mystery with a 
       honed blade

through the small bones salt and scales on face and 
       hands the greek god,

as well, found flesh unmysterious, but in anger and
      disappointment--

seagull cries, your music, are all about you apollonian 
       but hungrier nature is hungry

the brave fish dies the birds swoop for the insides in no
      lovelier spirals.


i have a perfect life. it isn't much,   
 but it's enough for me. it keeps me alive   
 and happy in a vague way no disappointments   
 on the near horizon, no pangs of doubt   
 looking forward in anticipation, looking back   
 in satisfaction at the conclusion of each day.   
 i heed the promptings of my inner voice,   
 and what i hear is comforting, full of reassurance   
 for my own powers and innate superiority--the fake   
 security of someone in the grip of a delusion,   
 in denial, climbing ever taller towers   
 like a tiny tyrant looking on his little kingdom   
 with a secret smile, while all the while 

 time lies in wait. and what feels ample now   
 turns colorless and cold, and what seems beautiful 
 and strong becomes an object of indifference   
 reaching out to no one, as later middle age   
 turns old, and the strength is gone.   
 right now the moments yield to me sweet   
 feelings of contentment, but the human   
 dies, and what i take for granted bears a name 
 to be forgotten soon, as the things i know   
 turn into unfamiliar faces   
 in a strange room, leaving merely   
 a blank space, like a hole left in the wake   
 of a perfect life, which closes over.


the number of corners in the soul can't
compare with the universe's dimensions folded
neatly into swans. in the soul's
space, one word on a thousand pieces
of paper the size of cookie fortunes falls
from the heavens. at last, the oracular
answer, you cry, pawing at the scraps that twirl
like seed-pod helicopters. alas, the window
to your soul needs a good scrubbing, so
the letters doodle into indecipherables just
like every answer that has rained
down through history, and you realize, in
your little smog of thought that death
will simply be the cessation of asking, a thousand
cranes unfolding themselves and returning to the trees.


chile,  

a month before his dinner with the visiting spanish lawyer, 
he had set out for the purpose of geologizing, 
and rode back over the ridge of the chilecauquen 
with a huge jute bag of living shells 
from the sandy flats at the coast, and with another, 
as full, of dead barnacles scraped from the rock. 
a few months forward from that dinner 
--on the island of san pedro, where the beagle was anchored 
awaiting him--he would be sneaking up on a fox 
of a kind very rare and donking it stoutly 
on the head with my geological hammer. the fox, 
he'll write, is now in the zoological society. 
so what does he think, when the spanish lawyer expresses a disbelief 
that the king of england would be so loco as to bother 
to ship to this sensible, orderly country a man 
to pick up beetles and lizards, and to break stones? 
no, the whiff of something off --like suspect meat--attends 
eccentric stunts like these. i do not like it 
if one of us were to go and do such things in england, 
do not you think the king of england would very shortly 
command us to leave his shores? renous, 
another student of bugs and rocks, from germany, 
is also there at dinner, and he mentions then 
that once, in a house in san fernando, he'd been discovered 
contemplating the transformation of caterpillars to butterflies. 
he couldn't deny it there they were, 
the writhing green proof, in an open box 
the padres and the governor consulted, and agreed 
it must be some heresy--and so renous was arrested. 
darwin can only shake his head in a quiet bemusement 
as his guests converse. those inchling creatures 
crawling over their chopped-up foliage, heads as blunt 
as thimbled thumbs . . . heretical? how 
could anybody believe that the innocent jumble 
in the baskets and flasks of a naturalist is dangerous? 

 

and lillian colton--the woman in owatonna, 
minnesota who for forty years has avidly collected 
the seeds of that state and, with them poking them 
into place with toothpicks and gluing them down, 
has portraitured american presidents, 
movie stars, country musicians, rock and roll legends, 
scientific and religious leaders including mother teresa 
--what suspiciousness might seize the spanish lawyer 
if he saw her on her rounds? what edgy wariness 
would grip him if he chanced on nellie staves, 
at  perhaps the most famous adirondack trapper, 
out in the summer to harvest shell-shaped fungus 
off the dead trees of those shaded, spinous hills? 
--she'll work for twenty hours straight on one, 
with the point of an old school compass, stippling it 
into the scene of a great alert-eyed ram 
or a sunrise, watching as the fungus's own interior, 
brown juices dye the image into permanence. 
who would these represent, for the spanish lawyer, what 
forbidden other?--a girl in the corner, walling her attention 
away from her sisters' strident hip-hop, by reading 
a fanciful tale of witches? a girl on a dancer pole 
at sturgis, strobing her tits for the boys in a quick -- 
semaphore of fuck-the-work-week revelry? surely 
not. surely these are no threat to his world. and yet 
for nothing more than positing a newly ordered 
sky map, giordano bruno was led in chains 
from his cell in the roman prison of castel san'angelo, there 
where he'd spent eight years as the inquisition hammered 
at his ideas and his calm resolve. it was february th, 
 he was tied to an iron stake a wedge 
was stuffed in his mouth, to prevent any final 
utterance of blasphemy and he was burned alive. 
the leg skin bubbled off of his body like a christmas pig's. 
it turns out that a redone sky implies 
a redone god--and a god is intolerant of this, 
a god is jealous of any counter claim to the pedigree 
of his cosmos. yes, but . . . surely not 
this mushroom picker? not this boy who simply speaks 
to invisible friends as he wanders around the alleys? 
oh but that would depend on the given spanish lawyer 
of that given day and circumstance. in ghent, 
a cock was put on trial and sentenced to death 
for repeatedly disturbing the peace of the lord's day, 
sunday. it had been warned so now 
it was just, to lead this beast to a chopping block 
--restoring the sanctified order. 

 

kansas,  

ah, for a witty transition from cock 
to my neighbors suzette and edie--lesbians, now 
in love with each other for over a decade and wanting 
only to declare their love in a marriage vow, 
like anyone, as edie says. not that 
my schoolboy humor would find favor 
in their reading life . . . although we get along 
some shared affinity enables the church 
of the gay girls and the orthodox congregation of guy 
to coexist with an amiability. still, i've witnessed 
other people pass them by with the slitted, 
ophidian stare of xenophobia. suzette and edie 
--are they the new apostasy? are they our own 
anne hutchinson? in  she was found guilty, 
after a two-day trial, of heresy--of being a woman 
not fitt for our society. with will, she had embraced 
doctrinal misinterpretations, some of them blasphemus, others 
erroneus and all unsafe, and of the devill of hell, 
and she was excommunicated from massachusetts bay colony 
evermore. her actual crime?--a claim 
the holy spirit illumines the heart of every true believer 
without the need of a minister intervening. 
for this, she was harried into the wilds 
--it was called a hiving-out--and set at the mercy of wolf 
and of winter, and it were death to return. her other 
actual crime?--that after a pregnancy, she had been delivered 
of thirtie monstrus births or therabowts at once, 
some of them bigger, some lessr, some of one shape, 
some of an other, few of any perfect shape, none at all of them 
of human shape--which perhaps is what you'd expect 
from a woman of nimble witt and active spirit and verie 
voluble tonggue. at the republican convention, 
it was, indeed, the voluble tongue that edie always flapped 
so saucily and too, i'd guess, her rainbow-hue 
we're already bedded . . . why not wedded? t-shirt 
that on her side led inevitably to the violence. 
a surly officer suggested that she move. she pointed out 
how she was already in the caged-off square 
allowed for free-speech protest, and had no intention 
of leaving. there were gestures they exchanged. . . and then 
a stun gun's , volts were suddenly alive inside her, 
just enough to crumple her into helplessness so that, 
when the panic began, she was trampled by friends and police 
alike. a lung was crushed, and when i visited 
three weeks later, her skin was still a nightmare 
turkish rug of bruise. for a moment, i saw in the air 
around her the first disabling gust of snow in the woods 
at the border of massachusetts bay in . to be fair, 
i should add that the confrontational officer doing crowd control 
went home with his head little more 
than a pocket of blood and neural damage. do not, 
i warn you, ever lightly cross a wiccan bowler. 

 

terms i haven't yet used, from my pile of notes 
separatist, sedition, dogma. finally, though, when those clouds 
of abstraction open up, it's always one specific 
ordinary rainy day, in chicago, in . i'm thirteen, 
squeaky-voiced, and with an adam's apple popping 
from my thin throat like a doorknob--while my father is large, 
he fought the neighbor's crazy german shepherd 
to a standstill once, and behind him are generations of him, 
solemn and knowing. we're standing there 
in front of the house, in a dim autumnal downpour, 
and it wouldn't look to anyone else like an even match, 
my scrawny shouts, his thousands of years of righteousness 
and yet, in emotional terms, i have the upper hand. 
i won't believe in his god. i won't believe 
in any god, in any synagogue, in any mumbo jumbo 
or rabbinical teetotum, and i'm screaming this 
and screaming this and screaming this, until i see 
the rain become his face, and for the only time 
except his mother's funeral on a similar day 
of wet and chill in a shivering mix, 
my father cries in front of me. 
and god, if he's there, must write my name down 
on a list that he'll turn over to his deputies on earth 
--his spanish lawyers. 
there are many terms for this, 
but only one rain. now it's falling, grayish twill, 
on a hill along the coast of the chonos archipelago islands. 
. a mound of seals in the distance, huddled together, 
asleep they appeared to be of a loving disposition 
but even pigs would be ashamed of their dirt, 
which is picked at by the turkey-buzzards. terns, 
gulls, black-necked swans. a deposit of sandstone. 
four great snowy cones of the local volcanoes. 
he couldn't be happier. he has computed the number of eggs 
in a tenth-of-an-inch of a sea-slug's potent slime, 
he has suggested how a great volume might be written, 
describing one of these beds of sea-weed. the otter. 
the spunky chilean mouse. he has read 
a most interesting discussion on the history 
of the common potato. he couldn't be more mesmerized 
in the grand salons of paris than here, in the rain, 
with his sodden insect net. and who 
would complain? he isn't any rooster. he isn't 
going to rudely wake anyone from a long sound sleep. 



this is a poem about the great ships that wandered 
                   the oceans 
and groaned sometimes in deep voices, grumbling about fog 
                   and submerged peaks, 
but usually they sliced the pages of tropical seas 
                   in silence, 
divided by height, category, and class, just like our communities 
                   and hotels. 
beneath the deck poor emigrants played cards, and no one 
                   won 
while on the highest deck claudel gazed at ys and her hair 
                   glowed. 

and toasts were raised to a safe trip, to coming 
                   times, 
toasts were raised, alsatian wine and champagne 
                   from france's finest vineyards, 
some days were static, windless, when only the light seeped       
                   steadily, 
days when nothing happened but the horizon, which traveled   
                   with the ship, 
days of emptiness and boredom, playing solitaire, repeating   
                   the latest news, 
who'd been seen with whom in a tropical night's shade, embracing   
                   beneath a peach-colored moon. 

but filthy stokers tirelessly tossed coal into open   
                   flaming mouths 
and everything that is now already existed then, but 
                  in condensed form. 
our days already existed and our hearts baked 
                   in the blazing stove, 
and the moment when i met you may also have existed, 
                  and my mistrust 
brittle as a faience plate, and my faith, no less frail   
                  and capricious, 
and my searches for the final answer, my   
                disappointments and discoveries. 
      
great ships some sunk suddenly, arousing consciences   
                and fear, 
gaining deathless fame, becoming stars 
                of special bulletins. 
others went peacefully, waned without a word in provincial   
                ports, in dockyards, 
beneath a coat of rust, a ruddy fur of rust, a slipcover of rust, 
                and waited 
for the final transformation, the last judgment of souls and 
                objects, 
they wait as patiently as chess players in luxembourg garden 
                nudging pieces a fraction of an inch or so.


this happened long ago, before the onset 
of universal genetic correctness. 

boys and girls would stand naked before mirrors 
studying the defects of their structure. 

nose too long, ears like burdocks, 
sunken chin just like a mongoloid. 

breasts too small, too large, lopsided shoulders, 
penis too short, hips too broad or else too narrow. 

and just an inch or two taller 

such was the house they inhabited for life. 

hiding, feigning, concealing defects. 

but somehow they still had to find a partner. 

following incomprehensible tastes--airy creatures 
paired with potbellies, skin and bones enamored of salt pork. 

they had a saying then even monsters 
have their mates. so perhaps they learned to tolerate their partners' 
flaws, trusting that theirs would be forgiven in turn. 

now every genetic error meets with such 
disgust that crowds might spit on them and stone them. 

as happened in the city of k., where the town council 
voted to exile a girl 

so thickset and squat 
that no stylish dress could ever suit her, 

but let's not yearn for the days of prenormalization. 
just think of the torments, the anxieties, the sweat, 
the wiles needed to entice, in spite of all. 


          translated by clare cavanagh


years later, the water still drips-- 
there's no one to tighten the valve. 
it courses through old pipes 
down to the septic tank. 

next morning in the cellar 
i start the motor with a stick.   
it shakes and rumbles, and chirps-- 
the switch is broken is all.   

at night the water arrives 
illegally, undergroundly, 
to the very grave where 
last spring parsley sprouted, 

and at the foot, beside it, 
feral sorrel darkens 
tastily and tartly 
like clandestine sex. 

the motor lifts the spirits 
and returns the night's deductions. 
it's morning, i hum softly-- 
a stranger will replace me.   

in the cellar a stream of light   
rinses the window grate, 
it pulses, strikes the meter-- 
i catch my rhythm on the stairs. 

and for memory's sake i hum-- 
as i pass the septic tank-- 
a fluid, underground song 
about sorrel and a stranger.


in the back of the charm-box, in a sack, the baby    
canines and incisors are mostly chaff,   
by now, split kernels and acicular down, no   
whole utensils left half   
an adz half a shovel, in its broken   
handle a marrow well of the will   
to dig and bite. and the enamel hems   
are sharp as shell-tools, and the colors go from   
salt, to bone, to pee on snow, to   
sun on pond-ice embedded with twigs   
and chipped-off skate-blade. one cuspid   
is like the tail of an ivory chough   
on my grandmother's what-not in a gravure on my mother's   
bureau in my father's house in my head,   
i think it's our daughter's, but the dime hermes   
mingled the deciduals of our girl and boy, safe-   
keeping them together with the note that says   
dear toth farry, plees giv me   
a bag of moany. i pore over the shards,   
a skeleton-lover--but who could throw out   
these short pints of osseus breastmilk,   
or the wisdom, with its charnel underside,   
and its dome, smooth and experienced,   
ground in anger, rinsed in silver   
when the mouth waters. from above, its knurls   
are a cusp-ring of mountain tops   
around an amber crevasse, where in high   
summer the summit wildflowers open   
for a day--crown buttercup, alpine flames,   
shooting-star, rosy fairy lantern,   
cream sacs, sugar scoop.


when the sun and moon were in quadrature, when   
the garden had become a wilderness and the clock refused to strike 

when the old year died and the sand walked into 
the sea with the neap tide 

when you had been too long away and your old snowblue footprints 
clotted and hesitated in the clay

when the worry of this undone song unsung so long 
so loud my head i went inside and under to let the flood run free


you that i loved all my life long, 
you are not the one. 
you that i followed, my line or path or way, 
that i followed singing, and you 
earth and air of the world the way went through, 
and you who stood around it so it could be 
the way, you forests and cities, 
you deer and opossums struck by the lonely hunter 
and left decaying, you paralyzed obese ones 
who sat on a falling porch in a deep green holler 
and observed me, your bald dog barking, 
as i stumbled past in a hurry along my line, 
you are not the one. but you 
are the one, you that i loved all my life long, 
you i still love so in my dying mind 
i grasp me loving you when we are gone. 
you are the one, you path or way or line 
that winds beside the house where she and i live on, 
still longing though long gone 
for the health of all forests and cities, 
and one day to visit them, 
one day be rich and free enough to go and see 
the restricted wonders of the earth. 
and you are the one, old ladies fated from birth 
to ugliness, obesity and dearth, 
who sat beside my path 
one day as i flashed by. and you are the one, 
all tumble-down shacks in disregarded hills 
and animals the car on the road kills 
and leaves stinking in the sun.


featherweight lawn chair, cooler for a footrest,
and me a squatter on the landlord's dock
where baitstealers teased a thousand times a day
until rowdy boats and summer scared them deep.
day and night i snoozed on the porch
beneath a filthy orbit of fanblades
to the opera of my neighbors fighting
and reconciling in the glow of stolen wattage.

i saw them swimming once. maybe naked,
judging from their skittish talk, but the water
smeared their bodies' pale particulars.
it was just me and the tickfaw river.
me with the taste of a tin can in my mouth,
feeling no pain, lighting a cigarette backwards,
the tickfaw tricking me closer and closer
with echoes and music out of nowhere.

is it funny that i was too lit to notice
twenty-five orange yards of extension cord
stretching from my outlet, over the driveway shells,
to feed the hungry plug of their deep freezer?
mother would have pitched a fit if she discovered
the stash of whiskey in the woodpile,
and my father wasn't laughing
if he looked down from his company of stars.


something has to give. 
we stand above it all. 
below, the buildings' tall 
but tiny narrative. 

the water's always near, 
you say. and so are you, 
for now. it has to do. 
there's little left to fear. 

a wind so cold, one might 
forget that winter's gone. 
the city lights are on 
for us, to us, tonight.


i know i promised to stop 
talking about her, 
but i was talking to myself. 
the truth is, she's a child 
who stopped growing, 
so i've always allowed her 
to tag along, and when she brings 
her melancholy close to me 
i comfort her. naturally 
you're curious you want to know 
how she became a gnarled branch 
veiled in diminutive blooms. 
but i've told you all i know. 
i was sure she had secrets, 
but she had no secrets. 
i had to tell her mine.


whenever i touch the cairn 
marking the summit 
of one of my parents, 
touch the top stone, 
an animal caution comes over me, 
sinew and muscle like the brook's, 
a sudden shivering 
green-brown flame. 
soon they will be constellations, 
and i a small tower of stones.

 because benvenuto in my native tongue
 means welcome, write
  
 here lies an artist who did not
 recoil from residence on earth -- but,
 truly named, welcomed it.
  
 but i mis-spoke not wife. servant model mother
 of my child, also now dead.
  
                    
  
 in prison, immured in the black pit where the pope
 once fed benedetto da foiano less and less each day
 until god's will, not the pope's own hand, killed him, --
  
 where outside my door each day the castellan
 repeated that darkness will teach me i am
 a counterfeit bat, and he a real one, --
  
 blackness, silence so unremitted
 i knew i had survived another day only by the malignant
 welcome singsong of his triumphant voice, --
  
 benvenuto is a counterfeit bat, and i a real one, --
  
 where god had not found me worthy of seeing the sun
 even in a dream, i asked the god of nature
 what unexpiated act the suffocation of my senses, such
  
 suffering, served to expiate.
  
 this was my first prison.
  
                    
  
 for the two murders i had committed, -- their just,
 free but necessary cause
  
 revenge, however imperfect the justice --
  
 two successive popes recognized the necessity
 and pardoned me. absolved me.
  
 because my fame as a maker in gold and silver
  
 preceded me, though i was hardly more
 than an apprentice, when pope clement came into
  
 possession of the second largest diamond in the world
  
 he summoned me from florence to rome -- called me
 into his presence to serve him. to crown the resplendent
  
 glittering vestment covering his surplice, he wanted
  
 a golden clasp big and round as a small
 plate, with god the father in half-relief above the diamond
  
 and cherubs, arms raised, below. hurry, he said,
  
 finish it quickly, so that i may enjoy its
 use a little while.
  
 pope clement, unlike the great i now serve, was
  
 an excellent, subtle
 connoisseur he approved my design.
  
 each week he summoned me into the presence
  
 two or three times, eager to inspect my progress.
 then cecchino, my brother, two years younger than i
  
 and still beardless, died --
  
 was killed, as he tried to avenge the unjust killing of
 a comrade by the ruthless guard of the bargello.
  
 thus was stolen from him the chance to incise
  
 his presence into the hard, careless surface of the world.
 the fool who killed him
  
 in what justice must call self-defense
  
 later proved his nature by
 boasting of it.
  
 his boasting enraged, maddened me. in this
  
 great grief the pope rebuked me you act as if
 grief can change death.
  
 sleepless, eatless, by day i worked at the pope's
  
 absorbing golden button -- and by night, hypnotized
 as a jealous lover, i watched and followed
  
 the fatuous creature who murdered my brother.
  
 at last, overcoming my repugnance to an enterprise
 not-quite-praiseworthy, i decided
  
 to end my torment. my dagger entered the juncture
  
 of the nape-bone and the neck
 so deep into the bone
  
 with all my strength i could not pull it out.
  
 i ran to the palace of duke alessandro -- for those who
 pursued me knew me. the pope's natural son,
  
 later he became duke of florence, before his murder
  
 by his own cousin lorenzino, whose too-familiar
 intimacies and pretensions to power
  
 he not only indulged but openly mocked.
  
 alessandro told me to stay indoors
 for eight days. for eight days i stayed indoors, working
  
 at the jewel the pope had set his heart on.
  
 for eight days the pope failed
 to summon me. then his chamberlain, saying that all was
  
 well if i minded my work and kept silent, ushered me
  
 into the presence. the pope cast so menacing
 a glance toward me i trembled.
  
 examining my work, his countenance cleared,
  
 saying that i had accomplished a vast amount
 in a short time. then he said, now that you are
  
 cured, benvenuto -- change your life.
  
 i promised that i would.  soon after this, i opened
 a fine shop, my first and finished the jewel.
  
                    
  
 as the knife descended forgive me, o god of
 nature, but thus you have arranged it, --
  
 to my fevered mind
 each moment was infinite, and mine.
  
                    
  
 late one night, in farewell, michelangelo
 turning to me said, benvenuto,
  
 you deliver yourself into their hands.
  
                    
  
 here i leapt   here i leapt   here i leapt   here i leapt
 the shrilling cricket in the shrilling summer evening
  
 sings as did my father in the sweet years
  
 he served the pleasure of the lords of florence
 as a piper, in the consort of pipers.
  
 imagine my father, no longer young, married, still
  
 childless, an engineer who designs bridges and
 battlements for the duke, but whose
  
 first love is music -- the flute. he joined
  
 the duke's consort of pipers. now his nights
 often are spent not bending over charts and plans
  
 but dazzled at the court of lorenzo, called the magnificent --
  
 the same lorenzo who once plucked michelangelo, still
 a boy, from among the horde of the merely-talented
  
 bending to copy the masters in the ducal palace.
  
 lorenzo, with his father's consent, adopted
 the boy fed him at his own table.
  
 imagine, tonight, the brief concert is over --
  
 the consort of pipers respectable, honorable
 amateurs small merchants, a banker, a scholar
  
 mingle, slightly awed, with an ambassador, a cardinal . . .
  
 suddenly lorenzo is at my father's ear he stood
 not six inches from me.
  
 not six inches from my father's ear lorenzo
  
 in a low voice as he begins to move through
 the crowd followed by his son piero
  
 as now my father must struggle to follow
  
 tells my father he has painfully and increasingly
 remarked that the flute has led my father to neglect
  
 his fine engineering talent and therefore my
  
 father will understand why piero and the duke
 must dismiss him from the consort of pipers.
  
 lorenzo, entering the private apartments, was gone.
  
 in later years, my father repeated to his
 children he stood not six inches from me.
  
 it is a lie. it is a lie that the medici and you and i
  
 stand on the same earth. what the sane eye
 saw, was a lie --
  
 two things alone cross the illimitable distance
  
 between the great and the rest of
 us, who serve them --
  
 a knife and art.
  
                    
  
 the emblem of florence is the lion therefore
 lions, caged but restless and living, centuries ago
  
 began to announce to the piazza della signoria
  
 this is the fearsome seat of the free
 government of the republic of florence.
  
 duke cosimo, hating the noise and smell, had them
  
 moved behind the palace. for years, i had known
 the old man who fed and tended the lions, --
  
 one day he humbly asked me if i could make a ring
  
 unlike all others for his daughter's wedding.
 i said yes, of course but, as payment for its
  
 rarity, i wanted him to drug the strongest lion
  
 asleep, so that i could
 examine, for my art, his body.
  
 he said he knew no art of drugging such poison
  
 could kill the creature a week later,
 in fury he said yes.
  
 the animal was numbed but not
  
 sleeping he tried to raise
 his great head, as i lay lengthwise against his warm body
  
 the head fell back. my head
  
 nestling behind his, each arm, outstretched, slowly
 descending along each leg, at last with both hands i
  
 pulled back the fur and touched a claw.
  
 this creature whose claw waking could kill me, --
 . . . i wore its skin.
  
                    
  
 after the medici were returned from eighteen years'
 banishment, placed over us again not by the will
  
 of florentines, but by a spanish army --
  
 my father, though during the republic he regained
 his position as piper, ever loyal to the medici
  
 wrote a poem celebrating his party's victory
  
 and prophesying the imminent
 advent of a medici pope. then julius ii died
  
 cardinal de' medici, against expectation, was elected
  
 the new pope wrote my father that he must
 come to rome and serve him.
  
 my father had no will to travel. then jacopo
  
 salviati, in power because married to a medici,
 took from my father his place at the duke's new court
  
 took from him his profit, his hope, his will.
  
 thus began that slow extinguishment
 of hope, the self 's obsequies for the self
  
 at which effacement i felt not only a helpless
  
 witness, but
 cause, author.
  
 he said i was his heart.
  
 i had asked to be his heart
 before i knew what i was asking.
  
 against his mania to make me a musician
  
 at fifteen i put myself to the goldsmith's trade
 without money
  
 or position, he now could not oppose this.
  
 help the boy -- for his father is poor
 rang in my ears as i began to sell
  
 the first trinkets i had made. later, to escape
  
 the plague then raging, he made me
 quickly leave florence when i returned,
  
 he, my sister, her husband and child, were dead.
  
 these events, many occurring before my birth, i
 see because my father described them
  
 often and with outrage.
  
 to be a child is to see things and not
 know them then you know them.
  
                    
  
 despite the malicious
 stars, decisive at my birth despite their
  
 sufficient instrument, the hand within me that moves
  
 against me in the utter darkness of my first prison
 god granted me vision
  
 surrounded by my stinks, an angel, his beauty
  
 austere, not wanton, graciously
 showed me a room in half-light crowded with the dead
  
 postures blunted as if all promise of change
  
 was lost, the dead
 walked up and down and back and forth
  
 as if the promise of change
  
 fleeing had stolen the light.
 then, on the wall, there was a square of light.
  
 careless of blindness i turned my eyes
  
 to the full sun. i did not care
 to look on anything again but this. the sun
  
 withering and quickening without distinction
  
 then bulged out the boss
 expanded the calm body of the dead christ
  
 formed itself from the same
  
 substance as the sun. still on the cross,
 he was the same substance as the sun.
  
                    
  
 the bait the duke laid
 was perseus. perseus
  
 standing before the piazza della signoria.
  
 my statue's audience and theater, michelangelo's
 david donatello's
  
 judith with the head of holofernes . . .
  
 here the school of florence, swaggering, says
 to the world eat.
  
 only bandinelli's odious hercules and cacus
  
 reminds one that when one walks
 streets on earth one steps in shit.
  
 duke cosimo desired, he said, a statue of perseus
  
 triumphant, after intricate trials able
 at last to raise high
  
 medusa's mutilated head -- he imagined,
  
 perhaps, decapitation of the fickle
 rabble of republican florence . . .
  
 i conceived the hero's gesture as more generous --
  
 kill the thing that looked
 upon makes us stone.
  
 soon enough, on my great bronze bust of the great
  
 duke, i placed -- staring out from his chest --
 medusa, her head not yet cut, living.
  
                    
  
 remember, benvenuto, you cannot bring your
 great gifts to light by your strength alone
  
 you show your greatness only through
  
 the opportunities we give you
 hold your tongue     i will drown you in gold
  
                    
  
 as we stared down at the vast square, at
 david, at judith -- then at hercules and cacus
  
 approved and placed there by cosimo himself --
  
 from high on the fortress lookout of the palace,
 against whose severe faade so many
  
 human promises had been so cunningly
  
 or indifferently crushed, i told the duke that i
 cannot make his statue. my brief return from france
  
 was designed only to provide for the future of
  
 my sister and six nieces, now without husband
 or father. the king of france alone had saved me
  
 from the pope's dungeon -- not any lord of italy
  
 at this, the duke looked at me
 sharply, but said nothing.
  
 all rome knew that though i had disproved
  
 the theft that was pretext for my arrest, pope paul
 still kept me imprisoned, out of spite --
  
 vengeance of his malignant son pier luigi, now
  
 assassinated by his own retainers.
 one night at dinner, the king's emissary gave the pope
  
 gossip so delicious that out of merriment, and about to vomit
  
 from indulgence, he agreed
 to free me. i owed king francis
  
 my art, my service. the same stipend he once paid
  
 leonardo, he now paid me along with a house in paris.
 this house was, in truth, a castle . . .
  
 i omitted, of course, quarrels with the king's
  
 mistress, demon who taunted me for the slowness
 of my work, out of her petty hatred of art itself
  
 omitted her insistence to the king that i
  
 am insolent and by example teach
 insolence to others. omitted that i overheard the king
  
 joke with her lieutenant --
  
 kill him, if you can find me
 his equal in art.
  
 before the school of florence i had only been able,
  
 young, to show myself as goldsmith
 and jeweler not yet as sculptor.
  
 duke cosimo then announced that all the king of france
  
 had given me, he would surpass boasting,
 he beckoned me to follow him past the public
  
 common galleries, into the private apartments . . .
  
 dutiful abashed puppet, i followed i knew
 i would remain and make his statue.
  
                    
  
 in the mirror of art, you who are familiar with the rituals of
 decorum and bloodshed before which you are
  
 silence and submission
  
 while within stone
 the mind writhes
  
 contemplate, as if a refrain were wisdom, the glistening
  
 intrication
 of bronze and will and circumstance in the mirror of art.
  
                    
  
 bandinelli for months insinuated in the duke's ear
 perseus never would be finished --
  
 i lacked the art, he said, to move from the small
  
 wax model the duke rightly praised, to lifesize
 bronze whose secrets tormented even donatello.
  
 so eighteen months after work began, duke cosimo grew
  
 tired, and withdrew his subsidy. lattanzo gorini,
 spider-handed and gnat-voiced, refusing to hand over
  
 payment said, why do you not finish?
  
 then bandinelli hissed sodomite at
 me -- after my enumeration, to the court's
  
 amusement, of the sins against art and sense
  
 committed by his hercules and cacus, recital
 designed to kill either him or his authority . . .
  
 the duke, at the ugly word, frowned
  
 and turned away. i replied that the sculptor of 
 hercules and cacus must be a madman to think that i
  
 presumed to understand the art that jove in heaven
  
 used on ganymede, art nobly practiced here on earth
 by so many emperors and kings. my saucy speech
  
 ended my poor wick does not dare to burn so high
  
 duke and court broke into laughter. thus was
 born my resolve to murder bandinelli.
  
                    
  
 i'd hurl the creature to hell. in despair at what must
 follow -- the duke's rage, abandonment of my
  
 never-to-be-born perseus -- i cast
  
 myself away for lost with a hundred crowns
 and a swift horse, i resolved first to bid
  
 farewell to my natural son, put to wet-nurse in fiesole
  
 then to descend to san domenico, where bandinelli
 returned each evening. then, after blood, france.
  
 reaching fiesole, i saw the boy
  
 was in good health his wet-nurse
 was my old familiar, old gossip, now
  
 married to one of my workmen. the boy
  
 clung to me wonderful in a two-year-old, in
 grief he flailed his arms when at last
  
 in the thick half-dusk
  
 i began to disengage myself. entering the square
 of san domenico on one side, i saw my prey
  
 arriving on the other. enraged that he still
  
 drew breath, when i reached him
 i saw he was unarmed. he rode a small sorry
  
 mule. a wheezing donkey carried a ten-year-old
  
 boy at his side. in my sudden presence, his face
 went white. i nodded my head and rode past.
  
                    
  
 i had a vision of bandinelli surrounded
 by the heaped-up works of his hand.
  
 not one thing that he had made
  
 did i want to have made.
 from somewhere within his body
  
 like a thread
  
 he spun the piles surrounding him. then he
 tried to pull away, to release the thread i saw
  
 the thread was a leash.
  
 he tried and tried to cut it.
 at this, in my vision i said out-loud --
  
 my art is my revenge.
  
                    
  
 when i returned to florence from fiesole, after
 three days news was brought to me that my little boy
  
 was smothered by his wet-nurse
  
 turning over on him as they both slept.
 his panic, as i left his arms raised, in panic.
  
                    
  
 from the great unchosen narration you will soon
 be released
  
 benvenuto cellini
  
 dirtied by blood and earth
 but now
  
 you have again taught yourself to disappear
  
 moving wax from arm
 to thigh
  
 you have again taught yourself to disappear
  
 here where each soul is its
 orbit spinning
  
 sweetly around the center of itself
  
 at the edge of its eye the great
 design of virtue
  
 here your medusa and your perseus are twins
  
 his triumphant body still furious with purpose
 but his face abstracted absorbed in
  
 contemplation as she is
  
 abstracted absorbed
 though blood still spurts from her neck
  
 defeated by a mirror
  
 as in concentration you move wax
 from thigh to arm
  
 under your hand it grows
  
                    
  
 the idyll began when the duke reached me a goldsmith's
 hammer, with which i struck the goldsmith's
  
 chisel he held and so the little statues were
  
 disengaged from earth and rust. bronze
 antiquities, newly found near arezzo, they lacked
  
 either head or hands or feet. impatient for my
  
 presence, the duke insisted that i join him each evening
 at his new pastime, playing artisan -- leaving orders
  
 for my free admittance to his rooms, day or night.
  
 his four boys, when the duke's eyes were turned,
 hovered around me, teasing. one night
  
 i begged them to hold their peace.
  
 the boldest replied, that we can't do i said
 what one cannot do is required of no one.
  
 so have your will faced with their sons'
  
 delight in this new principle, the duke and duchess
 smiling accused me of a taste for chaos . . . 
  
 at last the four figures wrought for the four
  
 facets of the pedestal beneath perseus
 were finished. i brought them one evening to the duke,
  
 arranging them on his worktable in a row --
  
 figures, postures from scenes that the eye cannot
 entirely decipher, story haunting the eye with its
  
 resonance, unseen ground that explains nothing . . . 
  
 the duke appeared, then immediately
 retreated reappearing, in his right hand
  
 he held a pear slip. this is for your garden, the garden of
  
 your house. i began, do you mean, but he cut me off
 saying, yes, benvenuto garden and house now are yours.
  
 thus i received what earlier was only lent me.
  
 i thanked him and his duchess then both
 took seats before my figures.
  
 for two hours talk was of their beauty, --
  
 the duchess insisted they were too exquisite
 to be wasted down there
  
 in the piazza i must place them in her apartments.
  
 no argument from intention or design
 unconvinced her.
  
 so i waited till the next day -- entering the private
  
 chambers at the hour the duke and duchess
 each afternoon went riding, i carried the statues
  
 down and soldered them with lead into their niches.
  
 returning, how angry the duchess became the duke
 abandoned his workshop. i went there no more.
  
                    
  
 the old inertia of earth that hates the new
 as from a rim i watched
  
 rose from the ground, legion --
  
 truceless ministers of the great unerasable
 zero, eager to annihilate lineament and light,
  
 waited, pent, against the horizon --
  
 some great force massive, stubborn, multiform as
 earth, fury whose single name is legion, -- 
  
 wanted my perseus not to exist --
  
 and i must
 defeat them.
  
 then my trembling assistants woke me.
  
 they said all my work
 was spoiled.
  
 perseus was spoiled. he lay buried in earth
  
 wreathed in fragile earthenware veins from the furnace
 above, veins through which he still
  
 waited to be filled with burning metal.
  
 the metal was curdled. as i slept, sick,
 the bronze had been allowed to cake, to curdle.
  
 feverish, made sick by my exertions for
  
 days, for months, i slept while those charged
 with evenly feeding the furnace that i had so well
  
 prepared, larked --
  
 i thought, unwitting ministers of the gorgon
 medusa herself. the furnace choked with caking, curdling
  
 metal that no art known to man could
  
 uncurdle, must be utterly dismantled -- all
 who made it agreed this must destroy
  
 the fragile, thirsty mould of perseus beneath.
  
 but perseus was not more strong
 than medusa, but more clever -- if he ever
  
 was to exist as idea, he must first exist as matter --
  
 all my old inborn
 daring returned,
  
 furious to reverse
  
 the unjust triumphs of the world's mere
 arrangements of power, that seemingly on earth
  
 cannot be reversed. first, i surveyed my forces --
  
 seven guilty workmen, timid, sullen,
 resentful a groom two maids a cook.
  
 i harassed these skeptical troops into battle --
  
 two hands were sent to fetch from the butcher
 capretta a load of young oak, --
  
 in bronze furnaces the only woods you use
  
 are slow-burning alder, willow, pine now i needed
 oak and its fierce heat. as the oak
  
 was fed log by log into the fire, how the cake began
  
 to stir, to glow and sparkle. now
 from the increased
  
 combustion of the furnace, a conflagration
  
 shot up from the roof two windows
 burst into flame i saw the violent storm
  
 filling the sky fan the flames.
  
 all the while with pokers and iron rods
 we stirred and stirred the channels--
  
 the metal, bubbling, refused to flow.
  
 i sent for all my pewter plates, dishes, porringers --
 the cook and maids brought some two hundred.
  
 piece by piece, i had them thrown
  
 into the turgid mass. as i watched the metal for
 movement, the cap of the furnace
  
 exploded -- bronze welling over on all sides.
  
 i had the plugs pulled, the mouths of the mould
 opened in perfect liquefaction
  
 the veins of perseus filled . . .
  
 days later, when the bronze had cooled, when the clay
 sheath had been with great care removed, i found
  
 what was dead brought to life again.
  
                    
  
 now, my second
 prison. it began soon after perseus was unveiled
  
 to acclaim -- great acclaim. perhaps i grew
  
 too glorious. perseus, whose birth consumed
 nine years, found stuck to his pedestal
  
 sonnets celebrating the master's hand that made him . . .
  
 on the day of unveiling, duke cosimo stationed himself
 at a window just above the entrance to the palace
  
 there, half-hidden, he listened for hours to the crowd's
  
 wonder. he sent his attendant sforza to say
 my reward 
  
 soon would astonish me.
  
 ten days passed. at last sforza appeared and asked
 what price i placed on my statue.
  
 i was indeed astonished it is not my custom,
  
 i replied, to set a price for my work, as if
 he were a merchant and i a mere tradesman.
  
 then, at risk of the duke's severe displeasure, i was
  
 warned i must set a price infuriated, i said
 ten thousand golden crowns.
  
 cities and great palaces are built with ten thousand
  
 golden crowns, the duke
 two days later flung at me in anger.
  
 many men can build cities and palaces,
  
 i replied, but not one can make
 a second perseus.
  
 bandinelli, consulted by the duke, reluctantly
  
 concluded that the statue was worth
 sixteen thousand.
  
 the duke replied that for two farthings
  
 perseus could go to the scrap heap that would
 resolve our differences.
  
 at last, the settlement was thirty-five hundred, one
  
 hundred a month. soon after, charges were brought
 against me, for sodomy --
  
 i escaped florence as far as scarperia, but there
  
 the duke's soldiers caught me and in chains
 brought me back.
  
 i confessed. if i had not, i could have been made
  
 to serve as a slave in the duke's galleys for life.
 the duke listened behind a screen as i was made
  
 publicly to confess, in full court . . . punishment
  
 was four years imprisonment. without the duke's
 concurrence, of course, no charges could have been
  
 lodged, no public humiliation arranged
  
 to silence the insolent. the first cosimo, founder of medici
 power, all his life protected donatello -- whose
  
 affections and bliss were found in ganymede.
  
 after imprisonment one month, cosimo
 finally commuted my sentence to house arrest.
  
 there his magnanimity allowed me to complete
  
 my christ of the whitest marble
 set upon a cross of the blackest.
  
 now, my christ sits still packed in a crate
  
 in the duke's new chapel my bust of the duke
 is exiled to elba, there to frighten in open air
  
 slaves peering out from his passing galleys.
  
 now, after the duchess and two of their sons
 died of fever within two months, cosimo
  
 grows stranger he murdered sforza
  
 by running him through with a spear --
 he does not own
  
 his mind or will.
  
 when i ask release from his service, he says
 that he cannot, that he soon
  
 will have need of me for great projects no
  
 commissions come. catherine de' medici, regent of
 the young french king, petitioned that i be allowed
  
 to enter her service. he said i had no will now to work.
  
 in prison i wrote my sonnet addressed
 to fortune -- fortune,  you sow
  
 you turned from me because ganymede
  
 also is my joy . . . o god of nature, author
 of my nature,
  
 where does your son jesus forbid it?
  
 when i was five, one night my father
 woke me. he pulled me to the basement, making me
  
 stare into the oak fire and see what he just had seen.
  
 there a little lizard was sporting
 at the core of the intensest flames.
  
 my father boxed me on the ears, then kissed me --
  
 saying that i must remember this night --
 my dear little boy, the lizard you see
  
 is a salamander, a creature that lives
  
 at the heart of fire. you and i are blessed no other
 soul now living has been allowed to see it.
  
                    
  
 i am too old to fight to leave florence --
  
 here, young, this goldsmith and jeweler
 began to imagine that
  
 severity, that chastity of style
  
 certain remnants of the ancient world
 left my hand hungry to emulate --
  
 equilibrium of ferocious, contradictory
  
 forces equilibrium whose balance or poise is their
 tension, and does not efface them, --
  
 as if the surface of each thing
  
 arranged within the frame, the surface of each
 body the eye must circle
  
 gives up to the eye its vibration, its nature.
  
 two or three times, perhaps,-- you
 say where, -- i have achieved it.
  
                    
  
 see, in my great bronze bust of the great
 duke, embedded in the right epaulette like a trophy
 an open-mouthed
 face part lion part man part goat, with an iron
 bar jammed in its lower jaw
  
 rising resistlessly across its mouth.
  
 see, in vasari's clumsy portrait of me, as i float
 above the right shoulder of the duke, the same face.
  
                    
  
 as if your hand fumbling to reach inside
 reached inside
  
 as if light falling on the surface
 fell on what made the surface
  
 as if there were no scarcity of sun
 on the sun
  
  
  
                               iii
  
 i covered my arm with orchid juice.
  
 with my hatchet i split a mangrove stick
 from a tree, and sharpened it.
  
 i covered the killing stick with orchid juice.
  
 we were camping at marunga island
 looking for oysters. this woman i was about to kill
  
 at last separated herself from the others
  
 to hunt lilies. she walked into the swamp, then
 got cold, and lay down on sandy ground.
  
 after i hit her between the eyes with my hatchet
  
 she kicked, but couldn't
 raise up.
  
 with my thumb over the end of the killing stick
  
 i jabbed her mount of venus until her skin pushed
 back up to her navel. her large intestine
  
 protruded as though it were red calico.
  
 with my thumb over the end of the killing stick
 each time she inhaled
  
 i pushed my arm
  
 in a little. when she exhaled, i stopped. little by little
 i got my hand
  
 inside her. finally i touched her heart.
  
 once you reach what is
 inside it is outside. i pushed the killing stick
  
 into her heart.
  
 the spirit that belonged to that dead woman
 went into my heart then.
  
 i felt it go in.
  
 i pulled my arm
 out. i covered my arm with orchid juice.
  
 next i broke a nest of green ants
  
 off a tree, and watched the live ants
 bite her skin until her skin moved by itself
  
 downward from her navel and covered her bones.
  
 then i took some dry mud and put my sweat
 and her blood in the dry mud
  
 and warmed it over a fire. six or eight times
  
 i put the blood and sweat and mud
 inside her uterus until there was no trace of her
  
 wound or what i had done.
  
 i was careful none of her pubic hair was left
 inside her vagina for her husband to feel.
  
 her large intestine stuck out several feet.
  
 when i shook some green ants on it, a little
 went in. i shook some more. all of it went in.
  
 when i whirled the killing stick with her heart's blood
  
 over her head, her head
 moved. when i whirled it some more, she moved
  
 more. the third time i whirled the killing stick
  
 she gasped for breath. she blew some breath
 out of her mouth, and was all right.
  
 i said, you go eat some lilies. she
  
 got up. i said, you will live
 two days. one day you will be happy. the next, sick.
  
 she ate some lilies. she walked around, then
  
 came back and slept. when laughing and talking women
 woke her she gathered her lilies and returned to camp.
  
 the next day she walked around and played,
  
 talked and made fun, gathering with others oysters
 and lilies. she brought into camp what she
  
 gathered. that night she lay down and died.
  
 even the gods cannot
 end death. in this universe anybody can kill anybody
  
 with a stick. what the gods gave me
  
 is their gift, the power to bury within each
 creature the hour it ceases.
  
 everyone knows i have powers but not such power.
  
 if they knew i would be so famous
 they would kill me.
  
 i tell you because your tongue is stone.
  
 if the gods ever give you words, one night in
 sleep you will wake to find me above you.
  
                    
  
 after sex & metaphysics, --
 . . . what?
  
 what you have made.
  
                    
  
 infinite the forms, finite
 tonight as i find again in the mirror the familiar appeaseless
  
 eater's face
  
 ignorant of cause or source or end
 in silence he repeats
  
 eater, become food
  
 all life exists at the expense of other life
 because you have eaten and eat as eat you must
  
 eater, become food
  
 unlike the burning stars
 burning merely to be
  
 then i ask him how to become food
  
 in silence he repeats that others have
 other fates, but that i must fashion out of the corruptible
  
 body a new body good to eat a thousand years
  
 then i tell the eater's face that within me is no
 sustenance, on my famished
  
 plate centuries have been served me and still i am famished
  
 he smirks, and in silence repeats that all life exists
 at the expense of other life
  
 you must fashion out of the corruptible
 body a new body good to eat a thousand years
  
 because you have eaten and eat as eat you must
 ignorant of cause or source or end
  
                    
  
 drugged to sleep by repetition of the diurnal
 round, the monotonous sorrow of the finite,
  
 within       i am awake
  
 repairing in dirt the frayed immaculate thread
 forced by being to watch the birth of suns
  
                    
  
 this is the end of the third hour of the night.



people, don't ask me again where my shoes are.
the valley i walked through was frozen to me
as i was to it. my heavy hide, my zinc
talisman--i'm fine, people. don't stare
at my feet. and don't flash the sign of the cross
in my face. i carry the blue cross card--
card among cards, card of my number
and gold seal. so shall ye know i am of
the system, in the beast's belly and up
to here, people, with your pity.

people, what is wrong with you? i don't care
what the sign on your door says. i will go
to another door. i will knock and rattle
and if you won't, then surely someone, somewhere,
will put a pancake in my hand.

you people of the rhetorical huh? you lords and ladies
of the blooming stump, i bend over you, taste you,
keep an eye on you, dream for you the beginning
of what you may one day dream an end to.

the new century peeled me bone-bare
like a first song inside a warbler--that bird, people,             
who knows not to go where the sky's stopped.
keep this in mind. do you think
the fox won't find your nest? that
the egg of you will endure the famine?

you, you people born of moons with no
mother-planets, you who are back-lit,
who have no fathers in heaven, hear now
the bruise-knuckled knock of me. i am returned.

from your alley. from your car up on blocks.
from the battered, graffitied railcars that uncouple
and move out into the studded green lightning.

dare you trust any longer the chained-up dogs of hell
not to bust free? or that because your youth's
been ransacked, nothing more will be asked of you?
if a bloody foot's dragged across your coiffed lawn--
do not confuse me with dawn.

now people, about the shoes the shoes
have no doubt entered the sea
and are by now walking the ramparts of atlantis.
i may be a false prophet, but god bless me, at least
i have something to say. i lay myself down
in a pencil of night--no chiseled tip yet,
but the marks already forming in the lead.


sleepless 
 in the cold dark, 
i look 
 through the closed dim 
 door be- 
fore me, which be- 
 comes an 
 abyss into 
 which my 
 memories have 
 fallen 
 past laughter or 
horror, 
 passion or hard 
work--my 
 memories of 
 our past 
laughter, horror, 
 passion, 
 hard work. an ache 
of be- 
 ing. an ache of 
being, 
 over love. an 
 ache of 
being over 
 love. like 
projections on 
 the screen 
 of the heavy 
window 
curtains, flashing 
lights of 
 a slow-scraping 
 after- 
midnight snowplow 
 for a 
 moment pulse in 
 this room.


they won't attack us here in the indian graveyard. 
i love that moment. and i love the moment 
when i climb into your warm you-smelling 
bed-dent after you've risen. and sunflowers, 
once a whole field and i almost crashed, 
the next year all pumpkins crop rotation, 
i love you. dividing words between syl- 
lables dachshunds what am i but the inter- 
section of these loves? i spend  dollars on a cd 
of some guy with  different guitars in his shack 
with lots of tape delays and loops, a good buy 
mexican animal crackers but only to be identified 
by what you love is a malformation just as 
embryonic chickens grow very strange in zero 
gravity. i hate those experiments on animals, 
varnished bats, blinded rabbits, cows 
with windows in their flanks but obviously 
i'm fascinated. perhaps it was my early exposure 
to frankenstein. i love frankenstein arrgh, 
he replies to everything, fire particularly 
sets him off, something the villagers quickly 
pick up. fucking villagers. all their shouting's 
making conversation impossible and now 
there's grit in my lettuce which i hate 
but kinda like in clams as one bespeaks 
poor hygiene and the other the sea. 
i hate what we're doing to the sea, 
dragging huge chains across the bottom, 
bleaching reefs. either you're a rubber 
gasoline salesman or like me, you'd like 
to duct tape the vice president's mouth 
to the exhaust pipe of an suv and i hate 
feeling like that. i would rather concentrate 
on the rapidity of your ideograms, how 
only a biochemical or two keeps me 
from becoming the world's biggest lightning bug.


so one day when the azalea bush was firing 
away and the japanese maple was roaring i 
came into the kitchen full of daylight and 
turned on my son's sony sliding over the 
lacquered floor in my stocking feet for it was 
time to rattle the canisters and see what 
sugar and barley have come to and how bolero 
sounds after all these years and if i'm loyal 
still and when did i have a waist that thin? 
and if my style was too nostalgic and where 
were you when i was burning alive, nightingale?   


port-au-prince
girl on a heap of street sweepings high
as a pyre, laid on snarled wire & dented rim.
girl set down among the wrung-out hides.
a girl who was coming from church. it is late
sunday afternoon. was it a seizure? is it 
destiny or bad luck we should fear? weak heart 
or swerving taxi? in tet bef by the dirty ocean
thousands crush past her without pausing
at the shrine of her spayed limbs brilliance
like the flesh of lilies sprouting from the pummeled cane.
is it possible to be lighthearted, hours later? 
days? to forget the yellow dress? 
i am waiting for her mother to find her, still
wearing one white spotless glove where is the other?, 
my idle taxi level with her unbruised arm,
her fingers just curling like petals of a fallen flower
and how did it end? let someone have gathered her up
before the stars assembled coldly overhead
her dress brighter than gold, crocus, the yolk of an egg
her face covered like the bride of a god let them
have found her & borne her though the traffic's clamor
veiled with a stranger's handkerchief.


crow school 
is basic and 
short as a rule-- 
just the rudiments 
of quid pro crow 
for most students. 
then each lives out 
his unenlightened 
span, adding his 
bit of blight 
to the collected 
history of pushing out 
the sweeter species 
briefly swaggering the 
swagger of his 
aggravating ancestors 
down my street. 
and every time 
i like him 
when we meet.


each escape 
involved some art, 
some hokum, and 
at least a brief 
incomprehensible 
exchange between 
the man and metal 
during which the 
chains were not 
so much broken 
as he and they 
blended. at the 
end of each such   
mix he had to 
extract himself. it 
was the hardest 
part to get right 
routinely breaking 
back into the   
same houdini.


when i dare at last to imagine hunger,
see farmer wandering his parched fields
knowing nothing to do, finally, but sleep
the day out in the barn's long shadow,
dreaming of the family dog he drove
deep into a neighboring county
and abandoned by the side of the road.
weeks later a boy finds it in a ditch--
timid and gimp, a halo of gnats
festering between its swollen testicles
and wormy flanks--and he coaxes it
into some pines, tethers it with a tentstake
and a chain as the late summer light
spirals and drapes over the branches,
a mirage the dog slavers and snaps at.
consider the boy's amusement
as he imagines the animal jerking the light
down and the ruckus of bells that clang
and catapult from the treetop belfries,
the canopy rent like a piata, spilling licorice
and circus peanuts, coins and fluttering dollar bills.
the real possibilities are beyond him.
the dog as a parable of pain or loss.
hunger as some small iridescent thing at work
inside the animal, hovering around its heart
the way a lone dragonfly skirts the dry pond crater,
dismantling the day--light unstitched
from dust, dust unbuckled from air.
by now, the dog's given up, and the boy
watches its tongue loll in the pine needles,
the heave and fall of its stomach, its eyes
following birdflight in and out of the shade.
restless for something he cannot name,
he imagines the music he might make
if he thumped the dog's belly like a drum.
imagines its eyes are the color of iron.
imagines the unimaginable and does it,
the tire tool and the belly unwilling instruments,
and the dog's caterwaul is not like music
at all and when night comes the cricketsong
dulcifies nothing, the dog's body
is just a body, is not paltry, is not glorified.
what hunger is this that haunts the boy,
that haunts the man sleeping in the shade?
watch as the dragonfly dips into his open mouth
and keeps going, a blur between bone and sinew,
a wet thread collapsing soft caverns of flesh,
gone to where his body is a field
honed by sleeves of sunlight,
to where the boy ceases to be and the man wakes.
he knows what flits through him now
keeps the time with its thrumming,
carrying him away from himself
into himself, to where the dog roves in the shadows--
ravenous, luminous--its tail bobbing
in the heat, a winnowing sliver of light.


i'm here, one fat cherry
               blossom blooming like a clod,
  
 one sad groat glazing, a needle puling thread,
               so what, so sue me. these days what else to do but leer
  
 at any boy with just the right hairline. hey i say,
               that's one tasty piece of nature. tart darkling,
  
 if i could i'd gin, i'd bargain, i'd take a little troll
               this moolit night, let you radish me awhile,
  
 let you gag and confound me. how much i've struggled
               with despicing you, always your false poppets, relentless
  
 distances. yet plea-bargaining and lack of conversation
               continue to make me
  
 your faithful indefile. i'm lonely. i've turned
               all rage to rag, all pratfalls fast to fatfalls for you,
  
 my farmer in the dwell. so struggle, strife,
               so strew me, to bell with these clucking mediocrities,
  
 these anxieties over such beings thirty, still smitten
               with this heaven never meant for, never heard from.
  
 you've said we're each pockmarked like a golf course
               with what can't be said of us, bred in us,
  
 isn't our tasty piece of nature. but i tell you
               i've stars, i've true blue depths, have learned to use
  
 the loo, the crew, the whole slough of pill-popping
               devices without you, your intelligent and pitiless graze.
  
 everyone knows love is just a euphemism
               for you've failed me anyway. so screw me.
  
 bartering yam, regardless of want i'm nothing
               without scope, hope, nothing
  
 without your possibility. so let's laugh
               like the thieves we are together, the sieves
  
 you, my janus gate, my sigmund fraud,
               my crawling, crack-crazed street sprawled out,
  
 revisible, spell-bound.
               hello, joy. i'm thirsty. i'm pasty rectum.
  
 in your absence i've learned to fill myself
               with starts. here's my paters. here's my blue.
  
 i just wanted to write again and say
               how much i've failed you.



i'm in a plane that will not be flown into a building.
it's a saab , seats , has two engines with propellers
is why i think of beanies, those hats that would spin
a young head into the clouds. the plane is red and loud
inside like it must be loud in the heart, red like fire
and fire engines and the woman two seats up and to the right
resembles one of the widows i saw on tv after the towers
came down. it's her hair that i recognize, the fecundity of it
and the color and its obedience to an ideal, the shape
it was asked several hours ago to hold and has held, a kind
of wave that begins at the forehead and repeats with slight
variations all the way to the tips, as if she were water
and a pebble had been continuously dropped into the mouth
of her existence. we are eighteen thousand feet over america.
people are typing at their laps, blowing across the fog of coffee,
sleeping with their heads on the windows, on the pattern
of green fields and brown fields, streams and gas stations
and swimming pools, blue dots of aquamarine that suggest
we've domesticated the mirage. we had to kill someone,
i believe, when the metal bones burned and the top
fell through the bottom and a cloud made of dust and memos
and skin muscled across manhattan. i remember feeling
i could finally touch a rifle, that some murders
are an illumination of ethics, that they act as a word,
a motion the brain requires for which there is
no syllable, no breath. the moment the planes had stopped,
when we were afraid of the sky, there was a pause
when we could have been perfectly american,
could have spent infinity dollars and thrown a million
bodies at finding the few, lasering our revenge
into a kind of love, the blood-hunger kept exact
and more convincing for its precision, an expression
of our belief that proximity is never the measure of guilt.
we've lived in the sky again for some years and today
on my lap these pictures from iraq, naked bodies
stacked into a pyramid of ha-ha and the articles
about broomsticks up the ass and the limbs of children
turned into stubble, we are punch-drunk and getting even
with the sand, with the map, with oil, with ourselves
i think listening to the guys behind me. there's a problem
in alpena with an inventory control system, some switches
are being counted twice, switches for what i don't know--
switches of humor, of faith--but the men are musical
in their jargon, both likely born in new delhi
and probably americans now, which is what the flesh
of this country has been, a grafted pulse, an inventory
of the world, and just as the idea of embrace
moves chemically into my blood, and i'm warmed
as if i've just taken a drink, a voice announces
we've begun our descent, and then i sense the falling.


because i gazed out the window at birds
doing backflips when the subject turned
to diamonds, because my eyes glazed over
with the slightly sleepy sheen your cake will wear,

never let it be said that i'd rather be
firing arrows at heart-shaped dartboards
or in a cave composing polyglot puns.
i crave, i long for transforming love

as surely as leaves need water and mouths seek bread.
but i also fear the colder changes
that lie in wait and threaten to turn
moons of honey to pools of molasses,

broad front porches to narrow back gardens,
and tight rings of friendship to flimsy things
that break when a gold band brightly implies
leave early, go home, become one with the one

the world has told you to tend and treasure
above all others. you love, and that's good
you are loved, that's superb you will vanish
and reap some happy rewards. but look at the birds.


the park admits the wind,
the petals lift and scatter

like versions of myself i was on the verge
of becoming and ten years on

and ten blocks down i still can't tell
whether this dispersal resembles

a fist unclenching or waving goodbye.
but the petals scatter faster,

seeking the rose, the cigarette vendor,
and at least i've got by pumping heart

some rules of conduct refuse to choose
between turning pages and turning heads

though the stubborn dine alone. get over
getting over darks clouds don't fade

but drift with ever deeper colors.
give up on rooted happiness

the stolid trees on fire and sweet reprieve
a poor park but my own will follow.

there is still a chance the empty gazebo
will draw crowds from the greater world.

and meanwhile, meanwhile's far from nothing
the humming moment, the rustle of cherry trees.


egg-white house, old

ache in the rafters, 

small as a button but

yearning for zero

a sparrow parts the chimney 

and veers for my face.

i wanted my nevers

again, my immaculate

touch-down to the durable

granite of love too

heavy to move this

gift, implacable

bird's-eye sorrow

reared from the original

fairy tale's page--

i don't like it. i offered

no signature, my nature

altered, and i'm over

my hurricane. rocking

room to room, this bird

threatens my gravity, 

threaded through like a pearl

from the evening's stem.

didn't i break all

eighty-eight bones

of my compass, my wingspan

spun from my awkwardness?

this bird returns 

to the shell with monstrous

wings, wings clumsy as shovels

in a fist of dirt. it's covered

with ashes, sloughing off

cloud--caught

in my hair, brown

tumor bulged upside

down on the floor

to meet the applause

this blessing's too

unwieldy. but open

one door, one terrible

goodbye, hello--the sparrow 

flings like a shout for the trees.



    the blue hole summer fair, set up and spread out like a butterfly pinned down on paper. twin bright-lit wings, identically shaped and fenced and sized. 

    this side holds the waffled-tin and oven-hot huts of the home arts booths and contests, the hay-sweet display-cages for the -h livestock, the streamer-hung display-stages where girl-beauties twirl and try for queen. there's rosette-luster and -lusting, and the marching band wearing a hole in sousa. and pursed gaggles and clutches of feather-white neighbor-women, eyeballing us like we're pig's feet in a jar. 
                         i wonder does her boy talk chinese? 
                                           you ever seen that kind of black-headed? 
                                                             blue shine all in it like a crow.  

    this other wing the one i'm back-sneaking, side-slipping, turnstiling into dips and slopes down to low-lying marsh-mire whiffs of pluff-mud stink and live gnat-pack poison, carnie-cots and -trailers camped on ooze. they've got rickety rides, and tent-shows with stains, and rackety bare-bulbed stalls of hoop-la game ring-a-coke and rebel yell and shoot the gook down. stand here, on this smutch-spot don't these mirrors show you strange? 

    crowds are gathering. yonder there and down, the yolk-glow of a tent is drawing men on and in the way a car-crash does, or a cockfight sure enough, or neon. the ticket-boy's getting mobbed at the fly of the door. 
         no sign in sight, except for the x of the dixie-flag ironed across his t-shirt. 
         i am bone-broke but falling into line. 
         the men upwind of me are leaking chaw-spit and pennies. 
         that, plus the eye-hunger spreading like a rumor through the swarm. 
         the rib-skinny doorkeeper's hollering bet now, bout's bout startin 
         over his shoulder, a ropy yellow light. 
         also circles of white tobacco-smoke, and bleacher-rows of cooncalling men who know my daddy. 
         --and there he is, up in front with some tall man, iron-arming two black-chested boys toward the ring.


while the man is away    
telling his wife    
about the red-corseted woman,    
the woman waits    
on the queen-sized bed.    
you'd expect her quiet    
in the fist of a copper    
statue. half her face,    
a shade of golden meringue,    
the other half, the dark    
of cattails. her mouth even--    
too straight, as if she doubted    
her made decision, the way    
women do. in her hands,    
a yellow letter creased,    
like her hunched back.    
her dress limp on a green chair.    
in front, a man's satchel    
and briefcase. on a dresser,    
a hat with a ceylon    
feather. that is all    
the artist left us with,    
knowing we would turn    
the woman's stone into ours,    
a thirst for the self    
in everything--even    
in the sweet chinks    
of mandarin.


naked for twenty-four of our last thirty-six   
hours together, and i mean museum-quality, sex-   
shop, god-riddling naked, sapping gold   
light from the windows of her hundred-year-old   
baltimore dorm, we were hungry for selling   
points, like a couple in a showroom. compelling   
arguments were made to close the deal   
and children were discussed. i kissed her from heel   
to head in a shower without water   
then with. nude, she read me a letter as a waiter   
would his specials, and i couldn't keep   
my eyes off smooth shoulders, belly, pelvis,   
deep olive skin all a balm against sleep.   
it was from her sexy grandmother in dieppe   
and sverine translated, both of us   
somehow drawn to this third party in a tidal   
sort of way, her lunar candor, her antipodal   
ease with words and the world. we were difficult,   
sverine and i, a beautiful strain, a cult   
of two. even eating, we made lots of noise.   
even resting in bed, watching the trees,   
our lighter breathing, our limb-shifting, sheet-   
rustling, even our dreaming had fight.   
her heart was exceptionally loud--not with love,   
but with knowing. knowing what to be afraid of.


the loneliest days,    
damp and indistinct,    
sea and land a haze.    
    
and purple fog horns    
blossomed over tides--    
bruises being born    
    
in silence, so slow,    
so out there, around,    
above and below.    
    
in such hurts of sound    
the known world became    
neither flat nor round.    
    
the steaming tea pot    
was all we fathomed    
of   is  and   is not .    
    
the hours were hallways    
with doors at the ends    
opened into days    
    
fading into night    
and the scattering    
particles of light.    
    
nothing was done then.    
nothing was ever    
done. then it was done.


for what i did   
and did not do   
and do without   
in my old age   
rue, not rage   
against that night   
we go into,   
sets me straight   
on what to do   
before i die--   
sit in the shade,   
look at the sky   



sheets entangle him   
naked on his bed   
like a toppled mast   
slack sails bedeck   
at sea, no ballast   
for that even keel   
he cannot keep-- 
no steering wheel   
as he falls asleep


the stars are   
although i do not sing   
about them--   
the sky and the trees   
are indifferent   
to whom they please   
the rose is unmoved   
by my nose   
and the garland in your hair   
although your eyes be lakes, dies   

why sigh for a star   
better bay at the moon   
better bay at the moon . . .   
oh moon, moon, moon


september was when it began.
locusts dying in the fields our dogs
silent, moving like shadows on a wall
and strange worms crawling flies of a kind
we had never seen before huge vineyard moths
badgers and snakes, abandoning
their holes in the field the fruit gone rotten
queer fungi sprouting the fields and woods
covered with spiderwebs black vapors
rising from the earth - all these,
and more began that fall. ravens flew round
the hospital in pairs. where there was water,
we could hear the sound of beating clothes
all through the night. we could not count
all the miscarriages, the quarrels, the jealousies.
and one day in a field i saw
a swarm of frogs, swollen and hideous,
hundreds upon hundreds, sitting on each other,
huddled together, silent, ominous,
and heard the sound of rushing wind.


legato con amore in un volume ci che per l'universo si squaderna . . .
if what began look far and wide will end   
this lava globe huddle and freeze, its core   
brittle with cold, or pulled too near its friend   
pop once like one gun in a long-drawn war,   
and the stars sputter one by one, the night   
so empty judging empty's out of date 
space and time gone, then only, height on height,   
mind that impelled those currents and that freight,   
mind that after five days see those days   
regions all tropic one day, one all ice   
whistled man from the sea-moss, saw him raise   
the blundering forepaw, blink from shaggy eyes-- 
if image, likeness in the ox-yoke brow   
long out of focus, focused mind to mind-- 
ah what unspeakable two and two allows   
that silence huddle and all eyes go blind? 
our ups and downs--there that remembered makes   
memory which is the single mind. how sweet   
carmine stars of the maple fumed in rakes   
at  such and such a street. 
a thing to keep in mind. yes and keep yet   
when the vile essence violescence lies.   
once in winter by the richening sill   
quiet, the fireplace tiny in our eyes-- 
i mention this there's more. the almighty will   
aeons late stumble on it with surprise.


every night, we couldn't sleep. 
our upstairs neighbors had to keep 
dropping something down the hall-- 
a barbell or a bowling ball, 

and from the window by the bed, 
echoing inside my head, 
alley cats expended breath 
in arias of love and death. 

dawn again, across the street, 
jackhammers began to beat 
like hangovers, and you would frown-- 
that well-built house, why tear it down? 

noon, the radiator grill 
groaned, gave off a lesser chill 
so that we could take off our coats. 
the pipes coughed to clear their throats. 

our nerves were frayed like ravelled sleeves, 
we cherished each our minor griefs 
to keep them warm until the night, 
when it was time again to fight 

but we were young, did not need much 
to make us laugh instead, and touch, 
and could not hear ourselves above 
the arias of death and love.


mon semblable, mon frre
 
our epoch takes a voluptuous satisfaction   
in that perspective of the action 
which pictures us inhabiting the end 
of everything with death for only friend. 

not that we love death, 
not truly, not the fluttering breath, 
the obscene shudder of the finished act--   
what the doe feels when the ultimate fact   
tears at her bowels with its jaws. 

our taste is for the opulent pause 
before the end comes. if the end is certain   
all of us are players at the final curtain   
all of us, silence for a time deferred,   
find time before us for one sad last word.   
victim, rebel, convert, stoic-- 
every role but the heroic-- 
we turn our tragic faces to the stalls 
to wince our moment till the curtain falls. 

 
a world ends when its metaphor has died. 

an age becomes an age, all else beside, 
when sensuous poets in their pride invent   
emblems for the soul's consent 
that speak the meanings men will never know   
but man-imagined images can show 
it perishes when those images, though seen,   
no longer mean. 

 
a world was ended when the womb   
where girl held god became the tomb   
where god lies buried in a man   
botticelli's image neither speaks nor can   
to our kind. his star-guided stranger   
teaches no longer, by the child, the manger,   
the meaning of the beckoning skies. 

sophocles, when his reverent actors rise   
to play the king with bleeding eyes, 
no longer shows us on the stage advance   
god's purpose in the terrible fatality of chance. 

no woman living, when the girl and swan 
embrace in verses, feels upon 
her breast the awful thunder of that breast 
where god, made beast, is by the blood confessed. 

empty as conch shell by the waters cast   
the metaphor still sounds but cannot tell,   
and we, like parasite crabs, put on the shell   
and drag it at the sea's edge up and down. 

this is the destiny we say we own. 

 
but are we sure 
the age that dies upon its metaphor 
among these roman heads, these mediaeval towers,   
is ours?-- 
or ours the ending of that story? 
the meanings in a man that quarry 
images from blinded eyes 
and white birds and the turning skies 
to make a world of were not spent with these   
abandoned presences. 

the journey of our history has not ceased   
earth turns us still toward the rising east,   
the metaphor still struggles in the stone,   
the allegory of the flesh and bone   
still stares into the summer grass 
that is its glass, 
the ignorant blood 
still knocks at silence to be understood. 

poets, deserted by the world before,   
turn round into the actual air   
invent the age invent the metaphor 



the skin ripples over my body like moon-wooed water,
rearing to escape me. where could it find another
animal as naked as the one it hates to cover?
once it told me what was happening outside,
who was attacking, who caressing, and what the air
was doing to feed or freeze me. now i wake up
dark at night, in a textureless ocean of ignorance,
or fruit bites back and water bruises like a stone.
it's jealousy, because i look for other tools to know
with, and other armor, better girded to my wish.
so let it lie, turn off the clues or try to leave
sewn on me seamless like those painful shirts
the body-hating saints wore, the sheath of hell
is pierced to my darkness nonetheless what traitors
labor in my face, what hints they smuggle through
its arching guard but even in the night it jails,
with nothing but its lies and silences to feed upon,
the jail itself can make a scenery, sing prison songs,
and set off fireworks to praise a homemade day.


we had a city also. hand in hand 
wandered happy as travellers our own land.   
murmured in turn the hearsay of each stone   
or, where a legend faltered, lived our own.   
the far-seen obelisk my father set 
pinning two roads forever where they met   
waved us in wandering circles, turned our tread   
where once morass engulfed that passionate head. 

cornice rose in ranges, rose so high 
it saw no sky, that forum, but noon sky.   
marble shone like shallows columns too   
streamed with cool light as rocks in breakers do. 

o marble many-colored as reach of thought,   
tones so recollected and so distraught.   
golden like swimmers when the august shore   
brightens their folklore poses more and more.   
or grey with silver moon's whirling spell   
over the breathless olives we knew well   
ivory as shoulders there that summer-dressed   
curve to come shyly naked, then find rest   
the tresses love dishevelled leaning dazed   
and grateful. or the wayward stone that blazed   
as cheeks do. or as eyes half-lowered flare.   
violet as veins are, love knows where.   
fine coral as the shy and wild tonguetip,   
undersea coral, rich as inner lip. 

there was a stone to build on 
                                              friezes ran 
in strong chorales that where they closed began   
and statues each a wrung or ringing phrase   
in the soul's passionate cadence of her days. 

o stone so matched and massive, worked so well,   
who could believe it when the first brick fell?   
who could imagine the unlucky word 
would darken to the worldwide sigh we heard?   
how our eyes wrenched together and held fast   
each face tightening to a chalky cast 
so poor a copy of one hour before. 
who could believe the gloom, the funnelled roar   
of cornice falling, forum falling, all 
falling? or dream it fallen? not a wall 
with eaves to route the rain. the rivers swelled   
till roads groped in lakebottom. nothing held   
clean edge or corner. caking, the black flood   
left every luminous room tunnels of mud. 
earth shook the columns walked, in midair clashed,   
and the steep stone exploded as it crashed. 

soon the barbarian swarmed like locusts blown   
between the flood and spasm of our stone.   
grunted to tug their huts and marble sties   
where friezes broke like foam in the blue skies.   
blue noses poked, recoiling as they found   
our young and glad-eyed statues underground   
singing salvation, the lewd chisel pecks   
at boy and girl one mutilated sex. 

all our high moments cheapened--greed and grime   
charred them in rickety stithies to quicklime. 

murderous world. that town that seemed a star   
rose in our soul. and there the ruins are.   
we'll not walk there again. who'd wish to walk   
where the rats gather and grey tourists talk?   
who'd walk there even alive? or bid his ghost   
trail phosphor on the melancholy coast?


					
					          am i to become profligate as if i were a blonde? or religious as if i were french?            each time my heart is broken it makes me feel more adventurous and how the same names keep recurring on that interminable list, but one of these days there'll be nothing left with which to venture forth.            why should i share you? why don't you get rid of someone else for a change?            i am the least difficult of men. all i want is boundless love.            even trees understand me good heavens, i lie under them, too, don't i? i'm just like a pile of leaves.            however, i have never clogged myself with the praises of pastoral life, nor with nostalgia for an innocent past of perverted acts in pastures. no. one need never leave the confines of new york to get all the greenery one wishes--i can't even enjoy a blade of grass unless i know there's a subway handy, or a record store or some other sign that people do not totally regret life. it is more important to affirm the least sincere the clouds get enough attention as it is and even they continue to pass. do they know what they're missing? uh huh.            my eyes are vague blue, like the sky, and change all the time they are indiscriminate but fleeting, entirely specific and disloyal, so that no one trusts me. i am always looking away. or again at something after it has given me up. it makes me restless and that makes me unhappy, but i cannot keep them still. if only i had grey, green, black, brown, yellow eyes i would stay at home and do something. it's not that i am curious. on the contrary, i am bored but it's my duty to be attentive, i am needed by things as the sky must be above the earth. and lately, so great has their anxiety become, i can spare myself little sleep.            now there is only one man i love to kiss when he is unshaven. heterosexuality you are inexorably approaching. how discourage her?            st. serapion, i wrap myself in the robes of your whiteness which is like midnight in dostoevsky. how am i to become a legend, my dear? i've tried love, but that hides you in the bosom of another and i am always springing forth from it like the lotus--the ecstasy of always bursting forth but one must not be distracted by it or like a hyacinth, to keep the filth of life away, yes, there, even in the heart, where the filth is pumped in and courses and slanders and pollutes and determines. i will my will, though i may become famous for a mysterious vacancy in that department, that greenhouse.            destroy yourself, if you don't know            it is easy to be beautiful it is difficult to appear so. i admire you, beloved, for the trap you've set. it's like a final chapter no one reads because the plot is over.            fanny brown is run away--scampered off with a cornet of horse i do love that little minx, & hope she may be happy, tho' she has vexed me by this exploit a little too. --poor silly cecchina or fb as we used to call her. --i wish she had a good whipping and , pounds. --mrs. thrale.         i've got to get out of here. i choose a piece of shawl and my dirtiest suntans. i'll be back, i'll re-emerge, defeated, from the valley you don't want me to go where you go, so i go where you don't want me to. it's only afternoon, there's a lot ahead. there won't be any mail downstairs. turning, i spit in the lock and the knob turns.
				

 

the white chocolate jar full of petals 
swills odds and ends around in a dizzying eye   
of four o'clocks now and to come. the tiger,   
marvellously striped and irritable, leaps   
on the table and without disturbing a hair   
of the flowers' breathless attention, pisses   
into the pot, right down its delicate spout. 
a whisper of steam goes up from that porcelain   
urethra. saint-sans it seems to be whispering,   
curling unerringly around the furry nuts   
of the terrible puss, who is mentally flexing.   
ah be with me always, spirit of noisy   
contemplation in the studio, the garden   
of zoos, the eternally fixed afternoons   
there, while music scratches its scrofulous   
stomach, the brute beast emerges and stands,   
clear and careful, knowing always the exact peril   
at this moment caressing his fangs with   
a tongue given wholly to luxurious usages   
which only a moment before dropped aspirin   
in this sunset of roses, and now throws a chair   
in the air to aggravate the truly menacing.



                                                      i

o what a physical effect it has on me
to dive forever into the light blue sea
of your acquaintance ah, but dearest friends,
like forms, are finished, as life has ends still,
it is beautiful, when october
is over, and february is over,
to sit in the starch of my shirt, and to dream of your sweet
ways as if the world were a taxi, you enter it, then
reply to no one, let's go five or six blocks.
isn't the blue stream that runs past you a translation from the russian?
aren't my eyes bigger than love?
isn't this history, and aren't we a couple of ruins?
is carthage pompeii? is the pillow the bed? is the sun
what glues our heads together? o midnight o midnight
is love what we are,
or has happiness come to me in a private car
that's so very small i'm amazed to see it there?


                                                       

we walk through the park in the sun, and you say, there's a spider
of shadow touching the bench, when morning's begun. i love you.
i love you fame i love you raining sun i love you cigarettes i love you love
i love you daggers i love smiles daggers and symbolism.


                                                       

inside the symposium of your sweetest look's
sunflower awning by the nurse-faced chrysanthemums childhood
again represents a summer spent sticking knives into porcelain raspberries, when china's
still a country oh, king edward abdicated years later, that's
exactly when. if you were seventy thousand years old, and i were a pill,
i know i could cure your headache, like playing baseball in drinking-water, as baskets
of towels sweetly touch the bathroom floor o benches of nothing
appear and reappear--electricity i'd love to be how
you are, as if
the world were new, and the selves were blue
which we don
until it's dawn,
until evening puts on
the gray hooded selves and the light brown selves of . . .
water your tear-colored nail polish
kisses me and the lumberyard seems new
as a calm
on the sea, where, like pigeons,
i feel so mutated, sad, so breezed, so revivified, and still so unabdicated--
not like an edge of land coming over the sea


i 

in a detachment cool as the glint of light 
on wet roads through wet spruce, or iced mountains   
hailed from the sea in moonfill, or the sea 
when one horizon's black and the other burning 

the gulls are kissing time in its own flowing 
over the shell-scraped rock   a coming and going   
as of glass bees with a bubble of light in each   
running errands in and out of the sunset. 

over the road and the spruce wood, over the ice,   
and out the picture of my picture window,   
the exorbitant separation of nature from nature   
wheels, whirls, and dances on itself. 

now damn me for a moral. over and out,   
over and in, the gulls drift up afire, 
screaming like hinges in the broken air 
of night and day like two smokes on the sea. 

and i do nothing. a shadow three feet under   
my window in the light, i look at light 
in one of the years of my life. this or another.   
or all together. or simply in this moment. 


ii 

lead flags of the sea. steel furls of the surf. 
day smoke and night smoke. fire at the smoke's top.   
a passion from the world in a calm eye. 
a calm of the world in the eye of passion. 

the day that sank birdless from staring calvary   
was another. and only another. and no other   
than the clucking calm of eden fussed to rest   
from the black bush afire in the first eye. 

a calm-in-violence like aegean time. 
day smoke and night smoke over the palled sea   
tensed for a clash of tridents. far ashore,   
a staring army camped beside a temple, 

the base of the temple black with powder stains,   
the pediment flashing wild in light above. 
--a day of the world in which a part of the world   
looked at another, two parts of a mist. 

at cassino the dusty german wetting his lips, 
his eyes crashed in his face like unhatched birds' eggs   
splashed from their nest, looked east from the burning night.   
there was no west. light came from nowhere behind him, 

slanted, flowed level, drained. he looked out, waiting.   
where had it come from, the light of his terrible patience?   
a dead man waited to die on the shell-scraped 
stones of another god, dust of the stones 

caked to his body, rivers of blood within him   
ran to their dusty sea beside the world.   
calm in his changes, risen from his changes,   
he looked his life out at the smoking world. 


iii 

i have no more to do than what i wait for   
under the changing light and the gulls afire   
in rays of rose-quartz. holy ghosts of the sea, 

they rise in light from behind me. the light lifts   
long from the edge of the world and juts away   
over the top of the dark. my life sits 

visible to itself and i sit still 
in a company of survivors and the dead. 
jew. greek, german, man at the edge of himself 

in the long light over the worlds he ran to   
to save unsaved. i practice the man in all,   
clutching the world from the world to praise it. 



the poet is a man who feigns 
and feigns so thoroughly, at last 
he manages to feign as pain 
the pain he really feels,

and those who read what once he wrote
feel clearly, in the pain they read,
neither of the pains he felt,
only a pain they cannot sense.

and thus, around its jolting track 
there runs, to keep our reason busy, 
the circling clockwork train of ours 
that men agree to call a heart. 




. 
of the gardens of adonis, lydia, i love 
most of all those fugitive roses 
         that on the day they are born, 
         that very day, must also die. 
eternal, for them, the light of day 
they're born when the sun is already high 
         and die before apollo's course

         across the visible sky is run. 
we too, of our lives, must make one day 
we never know, my lydia, nor want 
        to know of nights before or after 
        the little while that we may last. 
. 
to be great, be whole nothing that's you 
         should you exaggerate or exclude. 
in each thing, be all. give all you are 
         in the least you ever do. 
the whole moon, because it rides so high, 
         is reflected in each pool. 




the frightful reality of things 
is my everyday discovery. 
each thing is what it is. 
how can i explain to anyone how much 
i rejoice over this, and find it enough? 

to be whole, it is enough to exist. 

i have written quite a number of poems 
and may write many more, of course. 
each poem of mine explains it, 
though all my poems are different, 
because each thing that exists is always proclaiming it.

sometimes i busy myself with watching a stone, 
i don't begin thinking whether it feels. 
i don't force myself to call it my sister, 

but i enjoy it because of its being a stone, 
i enjoy it because it feels nothing, 
i enjoy it because it is not at all related to me. 

at times i also hear the wind blow by 
and find that merely to hear the wind blow makes 
          it worth having been born. 

i don't know what others will think who read this 
but i find it must be good because i think it 
         without effort, 
and without the idea of others hearing me think, 
because i think it without thoughts, 
because i say it as my words say it. 

once they called me a materialist poet 
and i admired myself because i never thought 
that i might be called by any name at all. 
i am not even a poet i see. 
if what i write has any value, it is not i who am 
        valuable. 
the value is there, in my verses. 
all this has nothing whatever to do with any will 
       of mine. 



i'm herdsman of a flock. 
the sheep are my thoughts 
and my thoughts are all sensations. 
i think with my eyes and my ears 
and my hands and feet 
and nostrils and mouth. 

to think a flower is to see and smell it. 
to eat a fruit is to sense its savor. 

and that is why, when i feel sad, 
in a day of heat, because of so much joy 
and lay me down in the grass to rest 
and close my sun-warmed eyes, 
i feel my whole body relaxed in reality 
and know the whole truth and am happy. 




i see the ships, the plotted crash, 
the stateroom's purgatory trash, 
the waiting wedged and still no splash. 
there is the torch that burns not through 
unless it drowns the sailor crew 
shoring the bulkhead pinning you. 
and then the priest who, being ill, 
intones through steel the bitter pill 
this tomb is your last confession grille. 
i think of you awake in bed, 
praying what all the voyage said 
have done with dying and be dead. 
it is a pride in loneliness 
like some propriety of dress 
that shuns the water meant to bless 
my hand as from a magnet pole 
works to the sunday dipping bowl 
to spot my tie and cross my soul.


sitting between the sea and the buildings 
he enjoyed painting the sea's portrait. 
but just as children imagine a prayer 
is merely silence, he expected his subject 
to rush up the sand, and, seizing a brush, 
plaster its own portrait on the canvas. 

so there was never any paint on his canvas 
until the people who lived in the buildings 
put him to work try using the brush 
as a means to an end. select, for a portrait, 
something less angry and large, and more subject 
to a painter's moods, or, perhaps, to a prayer. 

how could he explain to them his prayer 
that nature, not art, might usurp the canvas? 
he chose his wife for a new subject, 
making her vast, like ruined buildings, 
as if, forgetting itself, the portrait 
had expressed itself without a brush. 

slightly encouraged, he dipped his brush 
in the sea, murmuring a heartfelt prayer 
my soul, when i paint this next portrait 
let it be you who wrecks the canvas. 
the news spread like wildfire through the buildings 
he had gone back to the sea for his subject. 

imagine a painter crucified by his subject 
too exhausted even to lift his brush, 
he provoked some artists leaning from the buildings 
to malicious mirth we haven't a prayer 
now, of putting ourselves on canvas, 
or getting the sea to sit for a portrait 

others declared it a self-portrait. 
finally all indications of a subject 
began to fade, leaving the canvas 
perfectly white. he put down the brush. 
at once a howl, that was also a prayer, 
arose from the overcrowded buildings. 

they tossed him, the portrait, from the tallest of the buildings 
and the sea devoured the canvas and the brush 
as though his subject had decided to remain a prayer.


       that sea we see of surfaces
   turned upside down would be another world
a bone shop, soaked in pearl, a dumping-
ground for rarities, the sea-maws pumping
   grecian garbage roman cities hurled
       seaward westward toward our faces.

       that sea would yield up secret farms,
   gray-rotted by itself, encrusted thick
with unimaginable wealth, the spoil
of deaf-mute drownings, the immemorial
   dead, floating in a blue-green bailiwick
       of nun-like plants waving arms.

       that sea will not turn over. see
   in its deepest keep, far from its shallow,
the formal, hidden iceberg, slant, oblique
with pregnancy below, thrust up its peak--
   like ourselves in the water-beasted wallow,
       caught in a cellular ecstasy.

       in the same vein, all flesh conceals
   articulation's fishnet, whose thread-bones
a metaphysic harp from sky to heel
hang in the flesh that dangles from the creel
   depending from the weedy hand that owns
       all fishnets and all fishing reels.

       his answers breed a further question
   the fingernails of scale a snake will shed
in spring, coil after coil, on moistened clay,
though similar to the serpent wriggling away,
are but facsimiles, though not quite dead.
       testing this, see how the rest shun

       drying memorials to that race
   that mined our viewpoint in the garden,
whose inching tape maneuvered in the sun
to measure every guilty length of eden.
   man is an animal that needs a warden
       to frighten off the master's face,

       for even an idiot sees a world
   no tree or dog would dream of, finds a name
for pain or absence of it, marries love
of one kind of another. in his grove,
   insensible fruit trees and wild game
       grow naturally, though he lies curled,

       the spit and image of our wish,
   smoking a pipe, with an ice-cold cola
clutched in one hand, and the sundy funnies spread
on both his knees. he'll leave his lurching bed
   to throw hot jazz on an old victrola--
       a far cry from the primal fish

       whose fine-boned spine our back remembers
   the river bottoms, and the sea-silt soft
as soup, the mudflats where night crawlers came,
tempted by the water tops to change the lame
   arrangements, making of the air a loft
       fitted to our brackish members,

       and out we clambered, eyeing land,
   our moist eyes focused on the moron green,
hot on our backs abnormal dryness, shadow
forming in the seanets, seaweed into meadow,
   finally landing at the foot of pine,
       heavy with salty contraband

       while the birds beautifully beat blue
   on erect wings, as magically they soared,
feathered and efficient, from tallest trees to stake
a claim so ravishing that now we undertake
   to map an area we once ignored,
       still exiles from that upper view,

        for, mummers of the ocean's word,
   our dry translations tidied from the deep,
bespeak its ancient languages. the salt
our tears and blood must harbor from its vault
   is shed on every beach-head where we creep,
       part man, dry fish, and wingless bird.



... who can bear the idea of eternal recurrence?
i 

even as you went over, nietzsche,   
in your last letter, as ever, you tried   
to reach him 
                     dear herr professor,   
when it comes to it i too would very much 
prefer a professorial chair in basel 
to being god but i did not dare to go   
so far in my private egoism as to refrain   
for its sake from the creation of the world. 

the past before him, the hateful present 
stifling no end of futures with noisy smoke, 
what could the dear herr professor, magnificently   
sober jacob burckhardt, do or do for you 
how thrust pitiful hands into what proclaimed   
itself a sacred solitude? 
                                       maybe too at times, 
syringa blowing through his classroom gape- 
mouthed angels paracelsus pressed into his lectures   
in this very room, throwing all basel 
into an uproar and a hatred that finally   
drove him out, 
                      familiars also like a rout   
of mornings bickering to swell the retinue   
of dr. faustus after breakfast, trumpeting   
through the profundity of his pauses, 

maybe he could let that host, with nothing   
to lose in being, be themselves, especially 
as there sprang among them heroes out of raphael   
with everything to gain. 
                                     even now astorre 
the horseman, in the twinkle of that scholar   
eye, spurs quarrying the dark, falcon-plumed,   
plunges, a warrior of heaven, to the rescue   
of a youth, fallen with copious wounds,   
by this aid exalted. 


             ii 

                              alas, for all astorre's 
audacious charging down the margin of the page,   
the professor's age, parading with its sunday   
family-walks and the thundrous drummers of basel   
in trim, upholstered parks, benumbed him. 

what was there for him to do who saw 
his begetters, fighting men, furious, mighty   
in their pride, tumbled to such petty end? 

that beauty being slain on the high places   
in the midst of its noblest battle, should he,   
exclaiming, dare to tell it, publish it 
in the streets so prim and polished, to see   
the daughters of the philistines rejoice? 

he let you go, best emparadised, 
or so you said, in the sparkling shadow   
of a sword, retiring into frozen heights,   
a terrible loneliness, enhanced by sun. 


             iii 

at the end, rocks breaking their doors for you,   
out poured the shaggy men, hordes of flame   
and drunkenness. solitude, dressed in winds   
and falcons, rang, a honeycomb of voices   
hailing 
             dancer david agamemnon, amethyst   
with proud and deadly twisting dr. faustus   
borgia and astorre, those human hours,   
sowing splendors with their wily wrists. 

the peaks, much moved, conscious of the love   
that guides by the same capricious path as stars   
the agony, the maggot's tooth, hurtling   
to your beloved town, stormed its arcades   
past the drowsiest beds. god was dead,   
long live the gods. 
                              in that third-floor room,   
still going about in your academic jacket   
and down at heel, all the heavens rejoicing,   
laughing, lifting up your legs, 
into the middle of the rout you leaped, 
a satyr's dance, as always, the conclusion   
of the tragic truth . . . 


             iv 

                                    you in what we are, 
alas, and by your effort that had to fail   
have reached us. 
                         and we go, perhaps as the dear   
herr professor did, saddened that we cannot   
give ourselves, 
                        the greeks at last, paul, 
st. augustine, luther, calvin too, surpassed   
by the resolution--not time could tame it,   
not the mob's indifference--of your fury.


four feet up, under the bruise-blue 
fingered hat-felt, the eyes begin. the sly brim   
slips over the sky, street after street, and nobody   
knows, to stop it. it will cover 
the whole world, if there is time. fifty years'   
start in gray the eyes have you will never   
catch up to where they are, too clever   
and always walking, the legs not long but   
the boots big with wide smiles of darkness   
going round and round at their tops, climbing.   
they are almost to the knees already, where   
there should have been ankles to stop them.   
so must keep walking all the time, hurry, for   
the black sea is down where the toes are   
and swallows and swallows all. a big coat 
can help save you. but eyes push you down never   
meet eyes. there are hands in hands, and love   
follows its furs into shut doors who 
shall be killed first? do not look up there 
the wind is blowing the building-tops, and a hand   
is sneaking the whole sky another way, but   
it will not escape. do not look up. god is   
on high. he can see you. you will die.


still half drunk, after a night at cards,
with the grey dawn taking us unaware
among our guilty kings and queens, we drove
far north in the morning, winners, losers,
to a stream in the high hills, to climb up to a place
one of us knew, with some vague view
of cutting losses or consolidating gains
by the old standard appeal to the wilderness,
the desert, the empty places of our exile,
bringing only the biblical bread and cheese
and cigarettes got from a grocer's on the way,
expecting to drink only the clear cold water
among the stones, and remember, or forget.
though no one said anything about atonement,
there was still some purgatorial idea
in all those aching heads and ageing hearts
as we climbed the giant stair of the stream,
reaching the place around noon.

it was as promised, a wonder, with granite walls
enclosing ledges, long and flat, of limestone,
or, rolling, of lava within the ledges
the water, fast and still, pouring its yellow light,
and green, over the tilted slabs of the floor,
blackened at shady corners, falling in a foam
of crystal to a calm where the waterlight
dappled the ledges as they leaned
against the sun big blue dragonflies hovered
and darted and dipped a wing, hovered again
against the low wind moving over the stream,
and shook the flakes of light from their clear wings.
this surely was it, was what we had come for,
was nature, though it looked like art with its
grey fortress walls and laminated benches
as in the waiting room of some petrified station.
but we believed and what it was we believed
made of the place a paradise
for ruined poker players, win or lose,
who stripped naked and bathed and dried out on the rocks
like gasping trout the water they drank
making them drunk again, lit cigarettes and lay back
waiting for nature to say the last word
--as though the stones were memnon stones,
which, caught in a certain light, would sing.

the silence and even the noise of the waters
was silence grew pregnant that is the phrase,
grew pregnant but nothing else did. 
the mountains brought forth not a mouse, and the rocks,
unlike the ones you would expect to find
on the slopes of purgatory or near helicon,
mollified by muses and with a little give to 'em,
were modern american rocks, and hard as rocks.
our easy bones groaned, our flesh baked
on one side and shuddered on the other and each man
thought bitterly about primitive simplicity
and decadence, and how he had been ruined
by civilization and forced by circumstances
to drink and smoke and sit up all night
inspecting those perfectly arbitrary cards
until he was broken-winded as a trout on a rock
and had no use for the doctrines of jean jacques
rousseau, and could no longer afford
a savagery whether noble or not some
would never batter that battered copy of walden
again.

         but all the same,
the water, the sunlight, and the wind
did something even the dragonflies
did something to the minds full of telephone
numbers and flushes, to the flesh
sweating bourbon on one side and freezing on the other.
and the rocks, the old and tumbling boulders
which formed the giant stair of the stream,
induced again some purgatorial ideas
concerning humility, concerning patience
and enduring what had to be endured,
winning and losing and breaking even
ideas of weathering in whatever weather,
being eroded, or broken, or ground down into pebbles
by the stream's necessitous and grave currents.
but to these ideas did any purgatory
respond? only this one that in a world
where even the memnon stones were carved in soap
one might at any rate wash with the soap.

after a time we talked about the war,
about what we had done in the war, and how near
some of us had been to being drowned, and burned,
and shot, and how many people we knew
who had been drowned, or burned, or shot
and would it have been better to have died
in the war, the peaceful old war, where we were young?
but the mineral peace, or paralysis, of those
great stones, the moving stillness of the waters,
entered our speech the ribs and blood
of the earth, from which all fables grow,
established poetry and truth in us,
so that at last one said, i shall play cards
until the day i die, and another said,
in bourbon whisky are all the vitamins
and minerals needed to sustain man's life,
and still another, i shall live on smoke
until my spirit has been cured of flesh.

climbing downstream again, on the way home
to the lives we had left empty for a day,
we noticed, as not before, how of three bridges
not one had held the stream, which in its floods
had twisted the girders, splintered the boards, hurled
boulder on boulder, and had broken into rubble,
smashed practically back to nature,
the massive masonry of span after span
with its indifferent rage this was a sight
that sobered us considerably, and kept us quiet
both during the long drive home and after,
till it was time to deal the cards.


a telephone line goes cold
birds tread it wherever it goes.
a farm back of a great plain
tugs an end of the line.

i call that farm every year,
ringing it, listening, still
no one is home at the farm,
the line gives only a hum.

some year i will ring the line
on a night at last the right one,
and with an eye tapered for braille
from the phone on the wall

i will see the tenant who waits--
the last one left at the place
through the dark my braille eye
will lovingly touch his face.

hello, is mother at home?
no one is home today.
but father--he should be there.
no one--no one is here.

but you--are you the one . . . ?
then the line will be gone
because both ends will be home
no space, no birds, no farm.

my self will be the plain,
wise as winter is gray,
pure as cold posts go
pacing toward what i know.


i grow old under an intensity 
of questioning looks. nonsense, 
i try to say, i cannot teach you children 
how to live.--if not you, who will? 
cries one of them aloud, grasping my gilded 
frame till the world sways. if not you, who will? 
between their visits the table, its arrangement 
of bible, fern and paisley, all past change, 
does very nicely. if ever i feel curious 
as to what others endure, 
across the parlor you provide examples, 
wide open, sunny, of everything i am 
not. you embrace a whole world without once caring 
to set it in order. that takes thought. out there 
something is being picked. the red-and-white bandannas 
go to my heart. a fine young man 
rides by on horseback. now the door shuts. hester 
confides in me her first unhappiness. 
this much, you see, would never have been fitted 
together, but for me. why then is it 
they more and more neglect me? late one sleepless 
midsummer night i strained to keep 
five tapers from your breathing. no, the widowed 
cousin said, let them go out. i did. 
the room brimmed with gray sound, all the instreaming 
muslin of your dream . . . 
years later now, two of the grown grandchildren 
sit with novels face-down on the sill, 
content to muse upon your tall transparence, 
your clouds, brown fields, persimmon far 
and cypress near. one speaks. how superficial 
appearances are since then, as if a fish 
had broken the perfect silver of my reflectiveness, 
i have lapses. i suspect 
looks from behind, where nothing is, cool gazes 
through the blind flaws of my mind. as days, 
as decades lengthen, this vision 
spreads and blackens. i do not know whose it is, 
but i think it watches for my last silver 
to blister, flake, float leaf by life, each milling- 
downward dumb conceit, to a standstill 
from which not even you strike any brilliant 
chord in me, and to a faceless will, 
echo of mine, i am amenable.


m.a.k. september, -september, 
as i wandered on the beach 
i saw the heron standing   
sunk in the tattered wings 
he wore as a hunchback's coat.   
shadow without a shadow,   
hung on invisible wires   
from the top of a canvas day,   
what scissors cut him out?   
superimposed on a poster   
of summer by the strand   
of a long-decayed resort,   
poised in the dusty light   
some fifteen summers ago   
i wondered, an empty child,   
heron, whose ghost are you? 

i stood on the beach alone, 
in the sudden chill of the burned. 
my thought raced up the path.   
pursuing it, i ran 
to my mother in the house 
and led her to the scene. 
the spectral bird was gone. 
but her quick eye saw him drifting   
over the highest pines 
on vast, unmoving wings. 
could they be those ashen things,   
so grounded, unwieldy, ragged,   
a pair of broken arms 
that were not made for flight?   
in the middle of my loss 
i realized she knew 
my mother knew what he was. 

o great blue heron, now 
that the summer house has burned   
so many rockets ago, 
so many smokes and fires 
and beach-lights and water-glow   
reflecting pinwheel and flare   
the old logs hauled away,   
the pines and driftwood cleared   
from that bare strip of shore   
where dozens of children play   
now there is only you 
heavy upon my eye. 
why have you followed me here,   
heavy and far away? 
you have stood there patiently   
for fifteen summers and snows,   
denser than my repose, 
bleaker than any dream, 
waiting upon the day 
when, like grey smoke, a vapor   
floating into the sky, 
a handful of paper ashes, 
my mother would drift away.


for j. l. d.  why should we do this? what good is it to us? above all, how can we do such a thing? how can it possibly be done?  
--freud

 
my name is james a. wright, and i was born   
twenty-five miles from this infected grave,   
in martins ferry, ohio, where one slave   
to hazel-atlas glass became my father.   
he tried to teach me kindness. i return   
only in memory now, aloof, unhurried,   
to dead ohio, where i might lie buried,   
had i not run away before my time.   
ohio caught george doty. clean as lime,   
his skull rots empty here. dying's the best   
of all the arts men learn in a dead place.   
i walked here once. i made my loud display,   
leaning for language on a dead man's voice.   
now sick of lies, i turn to face the past.   
i add my easy grievance to the rest 

    
doty, if i confess i do not love you, 
will you let me alone? i burn for my own lies.   
the nights electrocute my fugitive, 
my mind. i run like the bewildered mad   
at st. clair sanitarium, who lurk, 
arch and cunning, under the maple trees,   
pleased to be playing guilty after dark. 
staring to bed, they croon self-lullabies. 
doty, you make me sick. i am not dead.   
i croon my tears at fifty cents per line. 

    
idiot, he demanded love from girls,   
and murdered one. also, he was a thief.   
he left two women, and a ghost with child.   
the hair, foul as a dog's upon his head,   
made such revolting ohio animals   
fitter for vomit than a kind man's grief.   
i waste no pity on the dead that stink, 
and no love's lost between me and the crying   
drunks of belaire, ohio, where police   
kick at their kidneys till they die of drink.   
christ may restore them whole, for all of me.   
alive and dead, those giggling muckers who   
saddled my nightmares thirty years ago   
can do without my widely printed sighing   
over their pains with paid sincerity.   
i do not pity the dead, i pity the dying. 

    
i pity myself, because a man is dead. 
if belmont county killed him, what of me?   
his victims never loved him. why should we?   
and yet, nobody had to kill him either.   
it does no good to woo the grass, to veil 
the quicklime hole of a man's defeat and shame.   
nature-lovers are gone. to hell with them.   
i kick the clods away, and speak my name. 

    
this grave's gash festers. maybe it will heal,   
when all are caught with what they had to do   
in fear of love, when every man stands still   
by the last sea, 
and the princes of the sea come down 
to lay away their robes, to judge the earth 
and its dead, and we dead stand undefended everywhere,   
and my bodies--father and child and unskilled criminal-- 
ridiculously kneel to bare my scars,   
my sneaking crimes, to god's unpitying stars. 

    
staring politely, they will not mark my face   
from any murderer's, buried in this place.   
why should they? we are nothing but a man. 

    
doty, the rapist and the murderer,   
sleeps in a ditch of fire, and cannot hear   
and where, in earth or hell's unholy peace,   
men's suicides will stop, god knows, not i.   
angels and pebbles mock me under trees.   
earth is a door i cannot even face.   
order be damned, i do not want to die,   
even to keep belaire, ohio, safe. 
the hackles on my neck are fear, not grief.   
open, dungeon open, roof of the ground   
i hear the last sea in the ohio grass,   
heaving a tide of gray disastrousness.   
wrinkles of winter ditch the rotted face   
of doty, killer, imbecile, and thief   
dirt of my flesh, defeated, underground.


nothing remained nothing, the wanton name 
that nightly i rehearsed till led away
to a dark sleep, or sleep that held one dream.

in this a huge contagious absence lay,
more space than space, over the cloud and slime,
defined but by the encroachments of its sway.

stripped to indifference at the turns of time,
whose end i knew, i woke without desire,
and welcomed zero as a paradigm.

but now it breaks--images burst with fire
into the quiet sphere where i have bided,
showing the landscape holding yet entire

the power that i envisaged, that presided
ultimate in its abstract devastations,
is merely change, the atoms it divided

complete, in ignorance, new combinations.
only an infinite finitude i see
in those peculiar lovely variations.

it is despair that nothing cannot be
flares in the mind and leaves a smoky mark
of dread.
               look upward. neither firm nor free,

purposeless matter hovers in the dark.


the chain uncouples, and his jacket hangs 
on the peg over hers, and he's inside.   

she stalls in the kitchen, putting the kettle on,   
buys herself a minute looking for two   
matching cups for the lime-flower tea,   
not really lime but linden, heart-shaped leaves   
and sticky flowers that smell of antifreeze.   
she talks a wall around her, twists the string   
tighter around the tea bag in her spoon.   
but every conversation has to break   
somewhere, and at the far end of the sofa   
he sits, warming his hands around the cup   
he hasn't tasted yet, and listens on   
with such an exasperating show of patience   
it's almost a relief to hear him ask it   
if you're not using your body right now 
maybe you'd let me borrow it for a while?  

it isn't what you're thinking. no, it's worse.   

why on earth did she find him so attractive   
the first time she met him, propping the wall   
at an awkward party, clearly trying to drink   
himself into some sort of conversation?   
was it the dark uncomfortable reserve   
she took upon herself to tease him out of,   
asking, are you a vampire? that depends,   
he stammered, are you a virgin? no, not funny,   
but why did she laugh at him? what made her think   
that he needed her, that she could teach him something?   
why did she let him believe she was drunk   
and needed a ride home? why did she let him   
take her shirt off, fumble around a bit   
on the spare futon, passing back and forth   
the warm breath of a half-hearted kiss   
they kept falling asleep in the middle of?   
and when he asked her, why did she not object?   
i'd like to try something. i need you to trust me.   

younger and given to daydreams, she imagined   
trading bodies with someone, a best friend,   
the boy she had a crush on. but the fact   
was more fantastic, a fairy-tale adventure   
where the wolf wins, and hides in the girl's red hood.   
how it happens she doesn't really remember,   
drifting off with a vague sense of being   
drawn out through a single point of her skin,   
like a bedsheet threaded through a needle's eye, 
and bundled into a body that must be his.   

sometimes she startles, as on the verge of sleep   
you can feel yourself fall backward over a brink,   
and snaps her eyelids open, to catch herself   
slipping out of the bed, her legs swinging   
over the edge, and feels the sudden sick   
split-screen impression of being for a second   
both she and her.   
                              what he does with her   
while she's asleep, she never really knows,   
flickers, only, conducted back in dreams   
walking in neighborhoods she doesn't know   
and wouldn't go to, overpasses, ragweed,   
cars dry-docked on cinderblocks, wolf-whistles,   
wanting to run away and yet her steps   
planted sure and defiant. performing tasks   
too odd to recognize and too mundane   
to have made up, like fixing a green salad   
with the sunflower seeds and peppers that she hates,   
pouring on twice the oil and vinegar   
that she would like, and being unable to stop.   
her hands feel but are somehow not her own,   
running over the racks of stacked fabric   
in a clothing store, stroking the slick silk,   
teased cotton and polar fleece, as if her fingers   
each were a tongue tasting the knits and weaves.   
harmless enough.   
                              it's what she doesn't dream   
that scares her, panic she can't account for, faces   
familiar but not known, dj vu   
making a mess of memory, coming to   
with a fresh love-bite on her left breast   
and the aftershock of granting another's flesh,   
of having gripped, slipped in and fluttered tender   
mmm, unbraided, and spent the whole slow day   
clutching her thighs to keep the chafe from fading,   
and furious at being joyful, less   
at the violation, less the danger, than the sense   
he'd taken her enjoyment for his own.   
that was the time before, the time she swore   
would be the last--returning to her senses,   
she'd grabbed his throat and hit him around the face   
and threw him out, and sat there on the floor   
shaking. she hadn't known how hard it was   
to throw a punch without pulling it back.   

now, as they sit together on her couch   
with the liquid cooling in the stained chipped cups   
that would never match, no matter how hard   
she stared at them, he seems the same as ever,   
a quiet clumsy self-effacing ghost   
with the gray-circled eyes that she once wanted   
so badly to defy, that seemed to see her   
seeing him--and she has to admit, she's missed him.   
why? she scrolls back through their conversations,   
searching for any reason not to hate him.   
she'd ask him, what's it like being a girl   
when you're not a girl? his answers, when he gave them,   
weren't helpful, so evasively poetic   
it's like a sponge somebody else is squeezing. 
a radio tuned to all stations at once. 
like having skin that's softer but more thick.  

then she remembers the morning she awoke   
with the smear of tears still raw across her cheeks   
and the spent feeling of having cried herself   
down to the bottom of something. why was i crying?   
she asked, and he looked back blankly, with that little   
curve of a lip that served him for a smile.   
because i can't.  
                              and that would be their secret.   
the power to feel another appetite   
pass through her, like a shudder, like a cold   
lungful of oxygen or hot sweet smoke,   
fill her and then be stilled. the freedom to fall   
asleep behind the blinds of his dark body   
and wake cleanly. and when she swings her legs   
over the edge of the bed, to trust her feet   
to hit the carpet, and know as not before   
how she never quite trusted the floor   
to be there, no, not since she was a girl   
first learning to swim, hugging her skinny   
breastless body close to the pool-gutter,   
skirting along the dark and darker blue   
of the bottom dropping out-- 
                              now she can stand,   
and take the cup out of his giving hand,   
and feel what they have learned inside each other   
fair and enough, and not without a kind   
of satisfaction, that she can put her foot   
down, clear to the bottom of desire,   
and find that it can stop, and go no deeper.


someone says tristan   
& isolde, the shared cup   
& broken vows binding them,   
& someone else says romeo   
& juliet, a lyre & jew's harp   
sighing a forbidden oath,   
but i say a midnight horn   
& a voice with a moody angel   
inside, the two married rib   
to rib, note for note. of course,   
i am thinking of those tuesdays   
or thursdays at billy berg's   
in la when lana turner would say,   
please sing strange fruit' 
for me, & then her dancing   
nightlong with mel torme,   
as if she knew what it took   
to make brass & flesh say yes 
beneath the clandestine stars   
& a spinning that is so fast   
we can't feel the planet moving.   
is this why some of us fall   
in & out of love? did lady day   
& prez ever hold each other   
& plead to those notorious gods?   
i don't know. but i do know   
even if a horn & voice plumb   
the unknown, what remains unsaid   
coalesces around an old blues   
& begs with a hawk's yellow eyes.


the water off these rocks is green and cold.
 the sandless coast takes the tide in its mouth,
 as a wolf brings down a deer or lifts its child.
  
 i walked this bay before you were my child.
 your fingers stinging brightly in the cold,
 i take each one and warm it in my mouth.
  
 though i've known this shore for years, my mouth 
 holds no charms of use to you, my child.
 you will have to learn the words to ward off cold
  
 and know them cold, child, in your open mouth. 



there are days i don't think about the sea
              weeks wash by in fact,
 then a shearwater--or some such--flutters by
 on the salt flats fanning out in my mind's eye,
 reflected there, a shimmering reverie,
                             recalling the pact
  
 i once made and renew today to hold
              to a higher altitude.
 but note the difference between this bird
 and me a slight disruption or harsh word
 and i crash, folded seaward, letting cold 
                             life intrude
  
 whereas the petrel, mindless of such height,
              scales each watery hill
 that rises up, adapting to the shape
 of each impediment, each low escape
 instinct in it, the scope of its flight
                             fitted to its will.



open the window and you want to fly out, 
though you never actually do--

i think i see you, still there on the ledge, 
where i've left you. 

how pulled-awake and flung 
can one life be? 

again i thought, it will end. 
again i promised and clung. 

i learned there that   
to cling was in my nature. 

i think i see you, though you flash 
quickly through the shutter. 

i think i hear you, though i sleep. 

remember this as a bolero, 
a finite flaring-- 

both the tulip tree   
burning in full bloom 

and the weeping silver birch.


hair still titian, 
but botticelli's grip has loosened-- 

not now rubenesque,    
and probably never 

ingres approaches,    
but courbet might capture me. 

could i be surreal? 
it seems almost likely-- 

bells in my ears 
and fortresses under 

cones have been set on my eyes. 
my spring is gone 

and summer's upon me, 
rude in its ripening. 

i'm espaliered, strung wide and tied,    
pinioned, and thus can i fly.


my father in the aluminum stern, cursing   
another fouled blood-knot all the shits   

and fucks as integral to the art of fishing   
as the bait-fish, little silver smelts   

i sewed like a manual transmission,   
the same inbred order and precision 

needling the leader through the ass, 
out the mouth, through the jaw, out the nostril   

and back down--suffering as my father suffered 
the bastard no-see-ums and the guttering johnson 

the obligatory dud, orange egg-pearls   
ballooning from its bust underside, hundreds of duds 

like every shit-luck setback that drove us on, 
fed by the huge image of everything   

we'd never caught, moving in joint blindness   
under munsungun. 
                         and whatever it was   
it was the fight that delivered us--a tension 

like a sequestered muscle, the line 
spooling, unspooling, the holy-shit- 

litany pulled from our awed mouths 
contracting with distance until a whole   

silence surfaced, the viscid, slapping body   
absorbing and reflecting raw light 

like the bit of cornea above a pupil. 
and then his tremendous, decent hands 

brandishing an oar-butt the brilliant lace   
of the gills, their crumpled hinge flaring 

in bilge water and the line, whipping 
and shuttling, feeding invisibly back, 

moving on on munsungun, sons 
survived by the same damn hunt they heired.


rosebud, so. dak., 
we all went to town one day
went to a store
bought you new shoes
red high heels

ain't seen you since.


once you saw a drove of young pigs
crossing the highway. one of them
pulling his body by the front feet,
the hind legs dragging flat.
without thinking,
you called the humane society.
they came with a net and went for him.
they were matter of fact, uniformed
there were two of them,
their truck ominous, with a cage.
he was hiding in the weeds. it was then
you saw his eyes. he understood.
he was trembling.
after they took him, you began to suffer regret.
years later, you remember his misfit body
scrambling to reach the others.
even at this moment, your heart
is going too fast your hands sweat.


all afternoon his tractor pulls a flat wagon 
with bales to the barn, then back to the waiting 
chopped field. it trails a feather of smoke. 
down the block we bend with the season 
shoes to polish for a big game, 
storm windows to batten or patch. 
and how like a field is the whole sky now 
that the maples have shed their leaves, too. 
it makes us believers--stationed in groups, 
leaning on rakes, looking into space. we rub blisters 
over billows of leaf smoke. or stand alone, 
bagging gold for the cold days to come.


farewell to the starlight in whiskey, 
so long to the sunshine in beer. 
the booze made me cocky and frisky 
but worried the man in the mirror. 
goodnight to the moonlight in brandy, 
adieu to the warmth of the wine. 
i think i can finally stand me 
without a glass or a stein. 
bye-bye to the balm in the vodka, 
ta-ta to the menthol in gin. 
i'm trying to do what i ought to, 
rejecting that snake medicine. 
i won't miss the blackouts and vomit, 
the accidents and regret. 
if i can stay off the rotgut, 
there might be a chance for me yet. 
so so long to god in a bottle, 
to the lies of rum and vermouth. 
let me slake my thirst with water 
and the sweet, transparent truth.


sometimes, the naked taste of potato 
reminds me of being poor. 

the first bites are gratitude, 
the rest, contented boredom. 

the little kitchen still flickers 
like a candle-lit room in a folktale. 

never again was my father so angry, 
my mother so still as she set the table, 

or i so much at home.


one rusty horseshoe hangs on a nail 
above the door, still losing its luck, 
and a work-collar swings, an empty 
old noose. the silence waits, wild to be 
broken by hoofbeat and heavy 
harness slap, will founder but remain 
while, outside, above the stable, 
eight, nine, now ten buzzards swing low 
in lazy loops, a loose black warp 
of patience, bearing the blank sky 
like a pall of wind on mourning 
wings. but the bones of this place are 
long picked clean. only the hayrake's 
ribs still rise from the rampant grasses.


he approaches her, trailing his whole fortune, 
perfectly cocksure, and suddenly spreads 
the huge fan of his tail for her amazement. 

each turquoise and purple, black-horned, walleyed quill 
comes quivering forward, an amphitheatric shell 
for his most fortunate audience her alone. 

he plumes himself. he shakes his brassily gold 
wings and rump in a dance, lifting his claws 
stiff-legged under the great bulge of his breast. 

and she strolls calmly away, pecking and pausing, 
not watching him, astonished to discover 
all these seeds spread just for her in the dirt.


you can't even buy a soda. you can only 
see these things, see a mother steer 
her son to the car, his head cocked 
licking his ice cream. 

earlier, driving, trying to keep   
between two cornfields, i couldn't see myself 
into a map, couldn't be anywhere in it, 
though i knew all the patient states 
between us. 

pigeons sit high on a mill's peaked roof, 
spaced even as beads. they can stand that 
close to each other, but looking at them 
you wouldn't know it. would you.


a little village in texas has lost its idiot.   -caption on a protest sign 
   let us deal justly.   -edgar, disguised as poor tom, from shakespeare's king lear act , scene  
but where, oh where is the holy idiot, 
truth teller and soothsayer, familiar 

of spirits, rat eater, unhouseled wanderer 
whose garble and babble fill rich and poor, 

homeless and housed, with awe and fear? 
is he hiding in the pit of the walkie-talkie, 

its grid of holes insatiably hungry, 
almost like a baby, sucking in the police sergeant's 

quiet voice as he calls in reinforcements? 
oh holy idiot, is that you sniffing the wind 

for the warm turd smell on the mounted policemen 
backing their horses' quivering, skittish 

haunches into the demonstrators' faces? 
oh little village among the villages, 

the wild man, the holy bedlamite is gone, 
and nobody, now, knows where to find him...

lying in mud? lying caked in mud, hair elfed into knots? 
some poor mad tom roving the heath 

for a warm soft place to lie his body down, 
his speech obsessed with oaths, demons, 

his tongue calling forth the foul fiend, flibbertigibbet 
as the horses back slowly, slowly into the crowd 

and he eats filth, he crams his ravenous mouth with filth-- 
and then he sits on his stool in the trampled hay 

and deep-rutted mud, he anoints himself 
with ashes and clay, he puts on his crown 

of fumiter weed and holds his scepter 
of a smouldering poker and calls the court to order.


i came awake in kindergarten,   
under the letter k chalked neat   
on a field-green placard leaned   

on the blackboard's top edge. they'd caged   me   
in a metal desk--the dull word writ   
to show k's sound. but k meant kick and kill 

when a boy i'd kissed drew me   
as a whiskered troll in art. on my sheet,   
the puffy clouds i made to keep rain in   

let torrents dagger loose. screw those   
who color in the lines, my mom had preached,   
words i shared that landed me on a short chair   

facing the corner's empty, sheetrock page. craning up,   
i found my k high above.   
you'll have to grow to here, its silence said.   

and in the surrounding alphabet, my whole life hid--   
names of my beloveds, sacred vows i'd break.   
with my pencil stub applied to wall,   

i moved around the loops and vectors,   
z to a, learning how to mean, how   
in the mean world to be.   

but while i worked the room around me   
began to smudge--like a charcoal sketch my mom   
was rubbing with her thumb. then   

the instant went, the month, and every season   
smeared, till with a wrenching arm tug   
i was here, grown, but still bent   

to set down words before the black eraser   
swipes our moment into cloud, dispersing all   
to zip. and when i blunder in the valley   

of the shadow of blank about to break   
in half, my being leans against my spinal k,   
which props me up, broomstick straight,   

a strong bone in the crypt of meat i am.


my father drummed darkness   
through the underbrush   
until lightning struck   

i take after him   

clouds crowd the sky   
around me as i run   
downhill on a high--   
i am my mother's son   
born long ago   
in the storm's eye


of your fate   
fast asleep   
on the bed you made   
dream away   
wake up late


taut with longing   
you must become   
the god you sought--   
the only one


the first lily of june opens its red mouth. 
all over the sand road where we walk 
multiflora rose climbs trees cascading 
white or pink blossoms, simple, intense 
the scene drifting like colored mist. 

the arrowhead is spreading its creamy 
clumps of flower and the blackberries 
are blooming in the thickets. season of 
joy for the bee. the green will never 
again be so green, so purely and lushly 

new, grass lifting its wheaty seedheads 
into the wind. rich fresh wine 
of june, we stagger into you smeared 
with pollen, overcome as the turtle 
laying her eggs in roadside sand.


it lies in our hands in crystals 
too intricate to decipher 

it goes into the skillet 
without being given a second thought 

it spills on the floor so fine 
we step all over it 

we carry a pinch behind each eyeball 

it breaks out on our foreheads 

we store it inside our bodies 
in secret wineskins 

at supper, we pass it around the table 
talking of holidays and the sea.


when despair for the world grows in me 
and i wake in the night at the least sound 
in fear of what my life and my children's lives may be, 
i go and lie down where the wood drake 
rests in his beauty on the water, and the great heron feeds. 
i come into the peace of wild things 
who do not tax their lives with forethought 
of grief. i come into the presence of still water. 
and i feel above me the day-blind stars 
waiting with their light. for a time 
i rest in the grace of the world, and am free.


my mother weeping 
in the dark hallway, in the arms of a man, 
not my father, 
as i sat at the top of the stairs unnoticed-- 
my mother weeping and pleading for what i didn't know 
then and can still only imagine-- 
for things to be somehow other than they were, 
not knowing what i would change, 
for, or to, or why, 
only that my mother was weeping 
in the arms of a man not me, 
and the rain brought down the winter sky 
and hid me in the walls that looked on, 
indifferent to my mother's weeping, 
or mine, 
in the rain that brought down the dark afternoon.


the woodpecker keeps returning 
to drill the house wall. 
put a pie plate over one place, he chooses another. 

there is nothing good to eat there 
he has found in the house 
a resonant billboard to post his intentions, 
his voluble strength as provider. 

but where is the female he drums for? where? 

i ask this, who am myself the ruined siding, 
the handsome red-capped bird, the missing mate.


marches in uniform down the traffic stripe 
at the center of the street, counts time 
to the unseen web that has rearranged 
the air around him, his left hand 
stiff as a leather strap along his side, 
the other saluting right through the decades 
as if they weren't there, as if everyone under ninety 
were pervasive fog the morning would dispel 
in its own good time, as if the high school band 
all flapping thighs and cuffs behind him 
were as ghostly as the tumbleweed on every road 
dead-ended in the present, all the ancient infantry 
shoulder right, through a skein of bone, presenting arms 
across the drift, nothing but empty graves now 
to round off another century, 
the sweet honey of the old cadence, the streets 
going by at attention, the banners glistening with dew, 
the wives and children blowing kisses.


our father liked to play a game.   
he played that he was dead.   
he took his thick black glasses off    
and stretched out on the bed.       
    
he wouldn't twitch and didn't snore   
or move in any way.   
he didn't even seem to breathe   
we asked, are you okay?   
    
we tickled fingers up and down   
his huge, pink, stinky feet--    
he didn't move he lay as still    
as last year's parakeet.   
    
we pushed our fingers up his nose,   
and wiggled them inside--    
next, we peeled his eyelids back.   
are you okay? we cried.   
    
i really thought he might be dead   
and not just playing possum,   
because his eyeballs didn't twitch   
when i slid my tongue across 'em.   
    
he's dead, we sobbed--but to be sure,    
i jabbed him in the jewels.       
he rose, like jesus, from the dead,       
though i don't think jesus drools.   
    
his right hand lashed both right and left.   
his left hand clutched his scrotum.   
and the words he yelled--i know damn well   
i'm way too young to quote 'em.


--after robert pinsky
defier of closed space, such as the head, opener 
of the sealed passageways, so that 
sunlight entering the nose can once again 

exit the ear, vaporizer, mist machine, whose 
soft hiss sounds like another human being 

but less erratic, more stable, or, if not like a human being, 
carried by one, by my mother to the sick chamber 
of my childhood -- as freud said, 

why are you always sick, louise? his cigar 
confusing mist with smoke, interfering 
with healing--embodied 

summoner of these ghosts, white plastic tub with your elegant 
clear tub, the water sanitized by boiling, 
sterile, odorless, 

in my mother's absence 
run by me, the one machine 

i understand what 
would life be if we could not buy 
objects to care for us 

and bear them home, away from the druggists' pity, 
if we could not carry in our own arms 
alms, alchemy, to the safety of our bedrooms, 
if there were no more 

sounds in the night, continuous 
hush, hush of warm steam, not 
like human breath though regular, if there were nothing in the world 

more hopeful than the self, 
soothing it, wishing it well. 


dead people don't like olives, 
i told my partners in eighth grade   
dancing class, who never listened   
as we fox-trotted, one-two, one-two.   
    
the dead people i often consulted   
nodded their skulls in unison   
while i flung my black velvet cape   
over my shoulders and glowered   
from deep-set, burning eyes,   
walking the city streets, alone at fifteen,   
crazy for cheerleaders and poems.   
    
at hamden high football games, girls   
in short pleated skirts   
pranced and kicked, and i longed   
for their memorable thighs.   
they were friendly--poets were mascots--    
but never listened when i told them   
that dead people didn't like olives.   
    
instead the poet, wearing his cape,   
continued to prowl in solitude   
intoning inscrutable stanzas   
as halfbacks and tackles   
made out, friday nights after football,   
on sofas in dark-walled rec rooms   
with magnanimous cheerleaders.   
    
but, decades later, when the dead   
have stopped blathering   
about olives, obese halfbacks wheeze   
upstairs to sleep beside cheerleaders   
waiting for hip replacements,   
while a lascivious, doddering poet,   
his burning eyes deep-set   
in wrinkles, cavorts with their daughters.


a tick-where-appropriate template
it begins with unspecified you and we   
raising fists of defiance to the void, 
the morning we opened the obituary, 
a pun on decompose you'd have enjoyed. 
these crocodile tears shed in rhyme, 
in an age too commercial to care, 
recall how we met the first time 
and the feisty old trooper you were, 
            you were, 
what a feisty old trooper you were 

the snook you cocked at convention 
writing only when the muse was near 
your solitary published collection, 
parnassus--a calling not a career, 
we reviewed andor said we admired 
its allusions to myth, its classical power 
we found inspiring if not inspired   
and important as a euphemism for   dour,   
            for dour,   
important to find euphemisms for dour 

your committee work your taste in shoes 
your alcoholism andor love for jazz 
your appetite for social issues 
that none of the young crowd has 
your impatience with those smart alecks 
who expect to have and eat their cake, 
and some daringly inverted syntax 
the occasional end-rhyme to make, 
            to make, 
occasionally an end-rhyme you'd make 


your insistence upon a thing called craft   
perhaps you meant margarine 
how establishment critics originally laughed 
at your pamphlets from the slovene 
how you very nearly popped your clogs 
as we fought to get your name cleared 
you were our stag set upon by dogs,   
indestructible in duffel coat andor beard, 
            your beard, 
the indescribable duffel coat andor beard 

your years of silence andor   second wife 
whose whereabouts remain uncertain 
a paean to your flowering late in life 
in some council flat in suburbiton 
and your dab hand with a hoover 
seasoned with the odd gratuitous clue 
much as we champion your oeuvre 
that we're better writers than you, 
            than you, 
we're better writers than you 

the valedictions when last we met--   
shut the door, comrades, adieu--   
however innocuous when said, 
now seem prophetic you knew 
your despair andor   your courage 
a warning for our planet and times 
culminating with a rhetorical flourish 
that pans out along these lines, 
            these lines, 
that pads out along these lines 

something something something world, 
something something something grope. 
something something something unfurled, 
something something something hope. 

something something something dark, 
something something something night. 
something something something lark, 
something something something light.


glory be to god for sexy things--   
   for cries of coupled lovers as they bind and bow 
       for moles that on her hip'll make his dolphin swim, 
fresh and fired up nutty balls g-strings 
   lovescapes pulsing and flesh-shoaled--furrow and plow 
      and all shapes, their leer and freckle and whim. 

all people dumpy, bald, regressive, strange 
   whoever is fickle, faithful who knows how? 
   with slick, abrasive sweet, sour disheveled, trim 
who father-forth and mother-forth all change--   
                     praise him. 



atlas, you're homer. i am so glad you're hera.    
thera so many things to tell you. i went on that    
minotaur of the museum. the new display centaurs    
on how you can contract sisyphus if you don't use    
a trojan on your dictys. it was all greek to me, see. 
when i was roman around,    
i rubbed midas against someone. medea, you look like a goddess,    
he said. the minerva him i told him to    
frigg off, oracle the cops. loki here, i said.    
in odin times men had better manners. it's best to try    
and nymph that sort of thing in the bud. he said he knew    
athena two about women like me, then tried to bacchus    
into a corner. dryads i could, he wouldn't stop.    
don't troy with my affections, he said.    
i'm already going to helen a hand basket.    
i pretended to be completely apollo by his behavior.    
if something like that mars your day, it styx with you    
forever. i'm not bragi, he said. but idon better.    
some people will never lerna. juno what i did?    
valhalla for help. i knew the police would    
pegasus to the wall. the sirens went off.    
are you or argonaut guilty, they asked.    
he told the cops he was iliad bad clams.    
he said he accidentally electra cupid himself    
trying to adjust a lamp shade. this job has its    
pluses and minos. the cops figured he was fulla it.    
he nearly runic for me. i'm telling you,    
it was quite an odyssey, but i knew things would    
pan out. and oh, by the way, here's all his gold.    
i was able to fleece him before the museum closed.


it's like being lost 
in the forest, hungry, with a 
plump live chicken in your cradling 
arms you want to savage the bird, 
but you also want the eggs. 

you go weak on your legs. 
what's worse, what you need 
most is the companionship, 
but you're too hungry to know that. 
that is something you only know after 
you've been lost a lot and always, 

eventually, alit upon 
your bird consumed her 
before you'd realized what 
a friend she'd been, letting you 
sleep-in late on the forest floor 
though she herself awoke 
at the moment of dawn 

and thought of long-lost 
rooster voices quaking 
the golden straw. she 
looks over at you, sleeping, 
and what can i tell you, she loves 
you, but like a friend. 

eventually, when lost 
in a forest with a friendly chicken 
you make a point of emerging 
from the woods together, 
triumphant her, fat with bugs, 
you, lean with berries. 

still, while you yet wander, 
you can not resist telling her 
your joke 

guy sees a pig with three legs, 
asks the farmer, what gives? 
farmer says, that pig woke   
my family from a fire, got us all out. 
says the guy, and lost the leg thereby? 
nope, says the farmer, 
still had all four when he took  
a bullet for me when i had  
my little struggle with the law. 
guy nods, so that's where  
he lost his paw? farmer shakes 
it off, says, nah, we fixed him up. 
a pause, guy says, so how'd he lose  
the leg? farmer says, well, hell, 
a pig like that  
you don't eat all at once. 

chicken squints. doesn't think 
it's funny.


you know how hard it is sometimes just to walk on the streets downtown, how everything enters you 
the way the scientists describe it--photons streaming through bodies, caroming off the air, the impenetrable brick 
of buildings an illusion--sometimes you can feel how porous you are, how permeable, and the man lurching in circles 
on the sidewalk, cutting the space around him with a tin can and saying uhh uhhhh uhh over and over 
is part of it, and the one in gold chains leaning against the glass of the luggage store is, and the one who steps toward you 
from his doorway, meaning to ask something apparently simple, like what's the time, something you know 
you can no longer answer he's part of it, the body of the world which is also yours and which keeps insisting 
you recognize it. and the trouble is, you do, but it's happening here, among the crowds and exhaust smells, 
and you taste every greasy scrap of paper, the globbed spit you step over, your tongue is as thick with dirt 
as though you've fallen on your hands and knees to lick the oil-scummed street, as sour as if you've been drinking 
the piss of those men passing their bottle in the little park with its cement benches and broken fountain. and it's no better 
when you descend the steps to the metro and some girl's wailing off-key about her heart--your heart-- 
over the awful buzzing of the strings, and you hurry through the turnstile, fumbling out the money that's passed 
from how many hands into yours, getting rid of all your change except one quarter you're sure she sees 
lying blind in your pocket as you get into a car and the doors seal themselves behind you. but still it isn't over. 
because later, when you're home, looking out your window at the ocean, at the calm of the horizon line, 
and the apple in your hand glows in that golden light that happens in the afternoon, suffusing you with something 
you're sure is close to peace, you think of the boy bagging groceries at safeway, of how his face was flattened 
in a way that was familiar--bootheel of a botched chromosome--and you remember his canceled blue eyes, 
and his hands, flaking, rash-reddened, that lifted each thing and caressed it before placing it carefully 
in your sack, and the monotonous song he muttered, paper or plastic, paper or plastic, his mouth slack, 
a teardrop of drool at the corner and you know he's a part of it too, raising the fruit to your lips you look out 
at the immense and meaningless blue and know you're inside it, you realize you're eating him now.


the rain this morning falls   
on the last of the snow 

and will wash it away. i can smell   
the grass again, and the torn leaves 

being eased down into the mud.   
the few loves i've been allowed 

to keep are still sleeping 
on the west coast. here in virginia 

i walk across the fields with only   
a few young cows for company. 

big-boned and shy, 
they are like girls i remember 

from junior high, who never   
spoke, who kept their heads 

lowered and their arms crossed against   
their new breasts. those girls 

are nearly forty now. like me,   
they must sometimes stand 

at a window late at night, looking out   
on a silent backyard, at one 

rusting lawn chair and the sheer walls   
of other people's houses. 

they must lie down some afternoons   
and cry hard for whoever used 

to make them happiest,   
and wonder how their lives 

have carried them 
this far without ever once 

explaining anything. i don't know   
why i'm walking out here 

with my coat darkening 
and my boots sinking in, coming up 

with a mild sucking sound   
i like to hear. i don't care 

where those girls are now.   
whatever they've made of it 

they can have. today i want   
to resolve nothing. 

i only want to walk 
a little longer in the cold 

blessing of the rain,   
and lift my face to it.


watching that frenzy of insects above the bush of white flowers,   
bush i see everywhere on hill after hill, all i can think of   
is how terrifying spring is, in its tireless, mindless replications.   
everywhere emergence seed case, chrysalis, uterus, endless manufacturing. 
and the wrapped stacks of styrofoam cups in the grocery, lately 
i can't stand them, the shelves of canned beans and soups, freezers   
of identical dinners then the snowflake-diamond-snowflake of the rug 
beneath my chair, rows of books turning their backs, 
even my two feet, how they mirror each other oppresses me, 
the way they fit so perfectly together, how i can nestle one big toe into the other 
like little continents that have drifted my god the unity of everything, 
my hands and eyes, yours doesn't that frighten you sometimes, remembering 
the pleasure of nakedness in fresh sheets, all the lovers there before you, 
beside you, crowding you out? and the scouring griefs, 
don't look at them all or they'll kill you, you can barely encompass your own 
i'm saying i know all about you, whoever you are, it's spring   
and it's starting again, the longing that begins, and begins, and begins.


i want a red dress. 
i want it flimsy and cheap, 
i want it too tight, i want to wear it   
until someone tears it off me. 
i want it sleeveless and backless, 
this dress, so no one has to guess 
what's underneath. i want to walk down 
the street past thrifty's and the hardware store   
with all those keys glittering in the window,   
past mr. and mrs. wong selling day-old   
donuts in their caf, past the guerra brothers   
slinging pigs from the truck and onto the dolly,   
hoisting the slick snouts over their shoulders.   
i want to walk like i'm the only 
woman on earth and i can have my pick.   
i want that red dress bad. 
i want it to confirm 
your worst fears about me, 
to show you how little i care about you   
or anything except what 
i want. when i find it, i'll pull that garment   
from its hanger like i'm choosing a body   
to carry me into this world, through   
the birth-cries and the love-cries too,   
and i'll wear it like bones, like skin,   
it'll be the goddamned 
dress they bury me in.


afterwards you had that drunk, drugged look 
my daughter used to get, when she had let go 
of my nipple, her mouth gone slack and her eyes   
turned vague and filmy, as though behind them   
the milk was rising up to fill her 
whole head, that would loll on the small 
white stalk of her neck so i would have to hold her   
closer, amazed at the sheer power 
of satiety, which was nothing like the needing 
to be fed, the wild flailing and crying until she fastened   
herself to me and made the seal tight 
between us, and sucked, drawing the liquid down   
and out of my body no, this was the crowning 
moment, this giving of herself, knowing 
she could show me how helpless 
she was--that's what i saw, that night when you   
pulled your mouth from mine and 
leaned back against a chain-link fence, 
in front of a burned-out church a man 
who was going to be that vulnerable, 
that easy and impossible to hurt.


after eighteen years there's no real grief left   
for the man who was my father. 
i hardly think of him anymore, 
and those dreams i used to have, 

in which he'd be standing in a room of people   
i didn't know--maybe his new friends,   
if the dead have friendships-- 
those dreams no longer trouble my sleep. 

he's not in the crooked houses i wander through   
or in the field by the highway 
where i'm running, chasing down 
some important piece of paper, 

desperate to reach it 
as it's lifted in the wake of trucks 
or flattened and marked by passing cars,   
as it's lifted again to swirl over 

a broken wood fence. i don't know why   
the paper's so important, or if anything 
is even written there. 
i don't know where the dead go, 

or why it's good to forget them, 
not to see them if they come crowding 
the windows or trying to lay themselves down   
and press along our bodies at night 

and ask that we love them again, 
that our sorrows include them once more.   
this morning i couldn't get up. 
i slept late, i dreamed of the single 

sheet of paper, which i never managed to reach   
as it stuttered and soared over the grass 
and a few flowers, so that i woke 
with a sense of loss, wondering who 

or what i had to mourn besides 
my father, whom i no longer mourn,   
father buried in the earth beneath grass,   
beneath flowers i trample as i run.


the ache of marriage 

thigh and tongue, beloved,   
are heavy with it,   
it throbs in the teeth 

we look for communion 
and are turned away, beloved,   
each and each 

it is leviathan and we   
in its belly 
looking for joy, some joy   
not to be known outside it 

two by two in the ark of   
the ache of it.


hypocrite women, how seldom we speak   
of our own doubts, while dubiously   
we mother man in his doubt 

and if at mill valley perched in the trees   
the sweet rain drifting through western air   
a white sweating bull of a poet told us 

our cunts are ugly--why didn't we   
admit we have thought so too? and   
what shame? they are not for the eye 

no, they are dark and wrinkled and hairy,   
caves of the moon ...          and when a   
dark humming fills us, a 

coldness towards life, 
we are too much women to   
own to such unwomanliness. 

whorishly with the psychopomp   
we play and plead--and say 
nothing of this later.             and our dreams, 

with what frivolity we have pared them   
like toenails, clipped them like ends of   
split hair.


from the tawny light 
from the rainy nights 
from the imagination finding 
itself and more than itself 
alone and more than alone 
at the bottom of the well where the moon lives,   
can you pull me 

into december? a lowland 
of space, perception of space 
towering of shadows of clouds blown upon 
clouds over 
                  new ground, new made 
under heavy december footsteps? the only 
way to live? 

the flawed moon 
acts on the truth, and makes   
an autumn of tentative 
silences. 
you lived, but somewhere else, 
your presence touched others, ring upon ring, 
and changed. did you think   
i would not change? 

                              the black moon 
turns away, its work done. a tenderness, 
unspoken autumn.   
we are faithful 
only to the imagination. what the 
imagination 
             seizes 
as beauty must be truth. what holds you 
to what you see of me is 
that grasp alone.


i like to find   
what's not found   
at once, but lies 

within something of another nature,   
in repose, distinct.   
gull feathers of glass, hidden 

in white pulp the bones of squid   
which i pull out and lay 
blade by blade on the draining board-- 

       tapered as if for swiftness, to pierce   
       the heart, but fragile, substance 
       belying design.               or a fruit, mamey, 

cased in rough brown peel, the flesh   
rose-amber, and the seed 
the seed a stone of wood, carved and 

polished, walnut-colored, formed   
like a brazilnut, but large, 
large enough to fill 
the hungry palm of a hand. 

i like the juicy stem of grass that grows 
within the coarser leaf folded round, 
and the butteryellow glow 
in the narrow flute from which the morning-glory   
opens blue and cool on a hot morning.


the moon is a sow 
and grunts in my throat 
her great shining shines through me   
so the mud of my hollow gleams   
and breaks in silver bubbles 

she is a sow 
and i a pig and a poet 

when she opens her white   
lips to devour me i bite back   
and laughter rocks the moon 

in the black of desire 
we rock and grunt, grunt and   
shine


all others talked as if 
talk were a dance. 
clodhopper i, with clumsy feet 
would break the gliding ring. 
early i learned to 
hunch myself 
close by the door 
then when the talk began 
i'd wipe my 
mouth and wend 
unnoticed back to the barn 
to be with the warm beasts, 
dumb among body sounds 
of the simple ones. 
i'd see by a twist 
of lit rush the motes 
of gold moving 
from shadow to shadow 
slow in the wake 
of deep untroubled sighs. 
the cows 
munched or stirred or were still. i 
was at home and lonely, 
both in good measure. until 
the sudden angel affrighted me--light effacing 
my feeble beam, 
a forest of torches, feathers of flame, sparks upflying   
but the cows as before 
were calm, and nothing was burning, 
             nothing but i, as that hand of fire   
touched my lips and scorched my tongue   
and pulled my voice 
                            into the ring of the dance.


the clouds as i see them, rising   
urgently, roseate in the   
mounting of somber power 

surging in evening haste over   
roofs and hermetic   
grim walls-- 

                          last night 
as if death had lit a pale light 
in your flesh, your flesh 
was cold to my touch, or not cold   
but cool, cooling, as if the last traces   
of warmth were still fading in you. 
my thigh burned in cold fear where   
yours touched it. 

but i forced to mind my vision of a sky   
close and enclosed, unlike the space in which these clouds move-- 
a sky of gray mist it appeared-- 
and how looking intently at it we saw 
its gray was not gray but a milky white 
in which radiant traces of opal greens, 
fiery blues, gleamed, faded, gleamed again, 
and how only then, seeing the color in the gray,   
a field sprang into sight, extending 
between where we stood and the horizon, 

a field of freshest deep spiring grass   
starred with dandelions, 
green and gold 
gold and green alternating in closewoven   
chords, madrigal field. 

is death's chill that visited our bed   
other than what it seemed, is it   
a gray to be watched keenly? 

wiping my glasses and leaning westward,   
clearing my mind of the day's mist and leaning   
into myself to see 
the colors of truth 

i watch the clouds as i see them   
in pomp advancing, pursuing   
the fallen sun.


after i had cut off my hands   
and grown new ones 

something my former hands had longed for   
came and asked to be rocked. 

after my plucked out eyes 
had withered, and new ones grown 

something my former eyes had wept for   
came asking to be pitied.


i thought i was growing wings-- 
it was a cocoon. 

i thought, now is the time to step   
into the fire-- 
it was deep water. 

eschatology is a word i learned 
as a child the study of last things 

facing my mirror--no longer young, 
       the news--always of death, 
       the dogs--rising from sleep and clamoring   
            and howling, howling, 

nevertheless 
i see for a moment   
that's not it it is   
the first things. 

word after word 
floats through the glass.   
towards me.


though the road turn at last   
to death's ordinary door,   
and we knock there, ready   
to enter and it opens 
easily for us, 
                     yet 
all the long journey 
we shall have gone in chains,   
fed on knowledge-apples   
acrid and riddled with grubs. 

we taste other food that life,   
like a charitable farm-girl,   
holds out to us as we pass-- 
but our mouths are puckered,   
a taint of ash on the tongue. 

it's not joy that we've lost-- 
wildfire, it flares 
in dark or shine as it will. 
what's gone 
is common happiness, 
plain bread we could eat 
with the old apple of knowledge. 

that old one--it griped us sometimes,   
but it was firm, tart,   
sometimes delectable ... 

the ashen apple of these days 
grew from poisoned soil. we are prisoners   
and must eat 
our ration. all the long road 
in chains, even if, after all, 
we come to 
death's ordinary door, with time 
smiling its ordinary 
long-ago smile.


the red eyes of rabbits   
aren't sad. no one passes 
the sad golden village in a barge 
any more. the sunset   
will leave it alone. if the   
curtains hang askew   
it is no one's fault. 
around and around and around 
everywhere the same sound   
of wheels going, and things   
growing older, growing   
silent. if the dogs 
bark to each other 
all night, and their eyes   
flash red, that's 
nobody's business. they have   
a great space of dark to   
bark across. the rabbits   
will bare their teeth at   
the spring moon.


a doll's hair concealing   
an eggshell skull delicately   
throbbing, within which 
maggots in voluptuous unrest   
jostle and shrug. oh, eileen, my   
big doll, your gold hair was   
not more sunny than this 
human fur, but 
your head was 
radiant in its emptiness, 
a small clean room. 

her warm and rosy mouth 
is telling lies--she would 
believe them if she could believe   
her pretty eyes 
search out corruption. oh, eileen   
how kindly your silence was, and   
what virtue 
shone in the opening and shutting of your   
ingenious blindness.


as the stores close, a winter light 
    opens air to iris blue, 
    glint of frost through the smoke 
    grains of mica, salt of the sidewalk. 
as the buildings close, released autonomous   
    feet pattern the streets 
    in hurry and stroll balloon heads 
    drift and dive above them the bodies   
    aren't really there. 
as the lights brighten, as the sky darkens, 
    a woman with crooked heels says to another woman   
    while they step along at a fair pace, 
    you know, i'm telling you, what i love best   
    is life. i love life even if i ever get 
    to be old and wheezy--or limp you know?   
    limping along?--i'd still ...  out of hearing.   
to the multiple disordered tones 
    of gears changing, a dance 
    to the compass points, out, four-way river.   
    prospect of sky 
    wedged into avenues, left at the ends of streets,   
    west sky, east sky more life tonight a range   
    of open time at winter's outskirts.


the old wooden steps to the front door   
where i was sitting that fall morning   
when you came downstairs, just awake,   
and my joy at sight of you emerging   
into golden day-- 
                         the dew almost frost 
pulled me to my feet to tell you   
how much i loved you 

those wooden steps 
are gone now, decayed 
replaced with granite, 
hard, gray, and handsome.   
the old steps live 
only in me 
my feet and thighs 
remember them, and my hands   
still feel their splinters. 

everything else about and around that house 
brings memories of others--of marriage, 
of my son. and the steps do too i recall 
sitting there with my friend and her little son who died,   
or was it the second one who lives and thrives? 
and sitting there in my life,' often, alone or with my husband. 
yet that one instant, 
your cheerful, unafraid, youthful, i love you too,'   
the quiet broken by no bird, no cricket, gold leaves   
spinning in silence down without 
any breeze to blow them, 
                                    is what twines itself 
in my head and body across those slabs of wood   
that were warm, ancient, and now 
wait somewhere to be burnt.


genial poets, pink-faced   
earnest wits-- 
you have given the world   
some choice morsels, 
gobbets of language presented 
as one presents t-bone steak 
and cherries jubilee.   
goodbye, goodbye, 
                            i don't care 
if i never taste your fine food again,   
neutral fellows, seers of every side.   
tolerance, what crimes 
are committed in your name. 

and you, good women, bakers of nicest bread,   
blood donors. your crumbs 
choke me, i would not want 
a drop of your blood in me, it is pumped   
by weak hearts, perfect pulses that never   
falter irresponsive 
to nightmare reality. 

it is my brothers, my sisters, 
whose blood spurts out and stops 
forever 
because you choose to believe it is not your business. 

goodbye, goodbye, 
your poems 
shut their little mouths,   
your loaves grow moldy,   
a gulf has split 
                     the ground between us, 
and you won't wave, you're looking 
another way. 
we shan't meet again-- 
unless you leap it, leaving   
behind you the cherished   
worms of your dispassion,   
your pallid ironies, 
your jovial, murderous,   
wry-humored balanced judgment, 
leap over, un- 
balanced? ... then 
how our fanatic tears 
would flow and mingle   
for joy ...


you keep me waiting in a truck 
with its one good wheel stuck in the ditch,   
while you piss against the south side of a tree. 
hurry. i've got nothing on under my skirt tonight.   
that still excites you, but this pickup has no windows   
and the seat, one fake leather thigh,   
pressed close to mine is cold.   
i'm the same size, shape, make as twenty years ago,   
but get inside me, start the engine   
you'll have the strength, the will to move.   
i'll pull, you push, we'll tear each other in half. 
come on, baby, lay me down on my back.   
pretend you don't owe me a thing   
and maybe we'll roll out of here,   
leaving the past stacked up behind us 
old newspapers nobody's ever got to read again. 



. russia,  

on the day the sienna-skinned man 
held my shoulders between his spade-shaped hands, 
easing me down into the azure water of jordan, 
i woke ninety-three million miles from myself, 
lev davidovich bronstein, 
shoulder-deep in the volga, 
while the cheap dye of my black silk shirt darkened the water. 

my head wet, water caught in my lashes.   
am i blind? 
i rub my eyes, then wade back to shore,   
undress and lie down, 
until stalin comes from his place beneath the birch tree. 
he folds my clothes 
and i button myself in my marmot coat, 
and together we start the long walk back to moscow. 
he doesn't ask, what did you see in the river?, 
but i hear the hosts of a man drowning in water and holiness,   
the castrati voices i can't recognize, 
skating on knives, from trees, from air 
on the thin ice of my last night in russia.   
leon trotsky. bread. 
i want to scream, but silence holds my tongue   
with small spade-shaped hands 
and only this comes, so quietly 
stalin has to press his ear to my mouth   
i have only myself. put me on the train.   
i won't look back. 


. mexico,  

at noon today, i woke from a nightmare   
my friend jacques ran toward me with an ax,   
as i stepped from the train in alma-ata. 
he was dressed in yellow satin pants and shirt.   
a marigold in winter. 
when i held out my arms to embrace him,   
he raised the ax and struck me at the neck,   
my head fell to one side, hanging only by skin.   
a river of sighs poured from the cut. 


. mexico, august ,  

the machine-gun bullets 
hit my wife in the legs, 
then zigzagged up her body. 
i took the shears, cut open her gown   
and lay on top of her for hours.   
blood soaked through my clothes   
and when i tried to rise, i couldn't. 

i wake then. another nightmare. 
i rise from my desk, walk to the bedroom   
and sit down at my wife's mirrored vanity.   
i rouge my cheeks and lips, 
stare at my bone-white, speckled egg of a face   
lined and empty. 
i lean forward and see jacques's reflection. 
i half-turn, smile, then turn back to the mirror. 
he moves from the doorway,   
lifts the pickax 
and strikes the top of my head.   
my brain splits. 
the pickax keeps going 
and when it hits the tile floor,   
it flies from his hands, 
a black dove on whose back i ride,   
two men, one cursing, 
the other blessing all things   
lev davidovich bronstein, 
i step from jordan without you.


for robert lowell
we smile at each other 
and i lean back against the wicker couch.   
how does it feel to be dead? i say. 
you touch my knees with your blue fingers.   
and when you open your mouth, 
a ball of yellow light falls to the floor   
and burns a hole through it. 
don't tell me, i say. i don't want to hear.   
did you ever, you start, 
wear a certain kind of silk dress 
and just by accident, 
so inconsequential you barely notice it,   
your fingers graze that dress 
and you hear the sound of a knife cutting paper,   
you see it too 
and you realize how that image 
is simply the extension of another image,   
that your own life 
is a chain of words 
that one day will snap. 
words, you say, young girls in a circle, holding hands,   
and beginning to rise heavenward 
in their confirmation dresses, 
like white helium balloons, 
the wreaths of flowers on their heads spinning, 
and above all that, 
that's where i'm floating,   
and that's what it's like 
only ten times clearer, 
ten times more horrible.   
could anyone alive survive it? 



earth is the birth of the blues, sang yellow bertha,   
as she chopped cotton beside mama rose.   
it was as hot as any other summer day,   
when she decided to run away. 
folks say she made a fortune 
running a whorehouse in new orleans, 
but others say she's buried somewhere out west,   
her grave unmarked, 
though you can find it in the dark 
by the scent of jasmine and mint, 
but i'm getting ahead of myself. 
if it wasn't for hell, 
we'd all be tapdancing with the devil 
mama rose used to say, 
but as it is, we just stand and watch, 
while someone else burns up before salvation.   
people desire damnation, bertha, she said,   
unwrapping the rag from her head 
to let the sweat flow down the corn rows,   
plaited as tightly as the night coming down   
on the high and mighty on judgment day.   
they say she knew what was coming,   
because she threw some bones that morning. 
she bent down to pick up her rag which had fallen   
and when she straightened up, her yellow gal   
had gone down the road. 
go then, she called out, i didn't want you no how. 
then she started talking to herself 
about how old white john caught her milking cows.   
he wrestled me to the ground and did his nastiness.   
he said, your daddy was a slave and his daddy   
and i'm claiming back what's mine. 
it was july. i remember fireworks going off outside.   
when bertha come, so white 
she liked to scared me to death, 
i let her suckle my breast 
and i said, all right, little baby, 
maybe i'll love you. maybe. 
mama rose said she did her best, 
but it's hard to raise a gal like that 
with everybody thinking she's giving them the high hat,   
because she's so light and got those green eyes   
that look right through you. she frightens people.   
even men, who're usually wanting to saddle up   
and ride that kind of mare, can't abide her. 
they're afraid if they try her, they'll never be the same.   
the only ones willing are white. 
they're watching her day and night, 
but they know john swore to kill any man 
who touched her, 
because lo and behold, he owns up to her. 
he's proud of her. nobody can believe it. 
he's even at her baptism. 
he buys her cheap dresses and candy at the store.   
he hands it to her out the door, 
because she can't go in. 
he won't, he won't stop looking at her 
like it's some kind of miracle she was born 
looking so much like him and his people. 
it's a warning, or something. 
it's evil turning back on itself, said the preacher   
the sunday cut clean through by the truth, 
by the living proof, as old john stood up in church   
and testified to the power of god, 
who spoke to him that morning, 
telling him he was a sinner. 
he died that winter. horrible suffering, they say.   
he had a stroke on the way to town. 
his car ran off the road and he drowned. 
they say bertha found him. 
they say she ran all the way to town for the doctor,   
who told her, i am not a colored doctor, 
so she went and got the sheriff. 
he listened for a while, then he locked her in a cell.   
he said he knew she was guilty of something.   
well, after a while, rose went down there 
and i swear she nearly had a fit. 
get my daughter out here, she said. 
how can you lock up your own brother's child?   
the sheriff knew it was true, so finally he said,   
you take her and don't ever cross my path again.   
when bertha passed him on the way out, 
he tripped her with his foot. 
when she got off the floor, she said, 
every dog has its day. 

from that time to this is a straight line,   
pointing at a girl, 
who doesn't even have shoes anymore,   
as she runs down the road, 
throwing off her ragged clothes, as she goes, 
until she's as naked as the day she was born.   
when she comes to washing hanging on the line,   
she grabs a fine dress and keeps on running.   
she's crying and laughing at the same time. 
along comes a truck that says j. goody on the side.   
the man driving stops to give her a ride. 
he swings the door open on the passenger side,   
but bertha says, move over, i'll drive. 
when she asks him why he stopped, 
he says, i know white trash, when i see it. 
you're just like me, but you're a girl. you're pretty.   
you can free yourself. all you have to do 
is show a little leg and some titty in the big city.   
he gave her fifty cents and a wink 
and she started thinking she might as well turn white.   
she got a job waiting table in a dance hall.   
one night, the boss heard her 
singing along with the band. 
he said, why don't you go up on stage, 
and she said, i play piano too. 
he said, howdy do. 
from then on, she made everybody pay 
one way, or another. 
she got hard. she took lovers-- 
fathers, sons, and husbands. 
it didn't matter, 
but once in a while, she heard her mother's voice,   
saying, you made the wrong choice, 
and she felt the blues 
and she let loose with a shout. 
lordy, said the boss, you sound colored.   
more and more people came to hear her sing, 
but they kind of feared her too. 
they said, she was too white to sing the blues like that.   
it wasn't right. 
one night, she got to talking with the boss. 
he walked round and round the office, shaking his head,   
saying how much he'd lose, 
if she stopped singing the blues. 
how often can you find a treasure like mine, he said,   
laying his hand on her shoulder, 
then he said, if i weren't so old, 
and his voice dropped off to a whisper, 
then he said, i got the answer now, sweet roberta.   
go on down to the dressing room and wait.   
it didn't take long. 
he came in and set a jar on the table.   
what do i do with this? asked bertha.   
he said, you're going to pass for colored.   
suddenly, she was wearing blackface.   
suddenly, she was safe on the other side   
of the door she slammed on the past 
and it was standing open at last. 
she could come and go as she pleased   
and no one saw her enter, or leave. 
she was free, she was freed, 
but she didn't feel it 
and she needed it to be real. 
she went on, though. she flowed like a river,   
carrying the body of a man, 
who had himself a nigger, because he could.   
she lived. she got old. 
she almost froze one cold spell 
and she got up from her sickbed 
and told her daughter 
she got during the change of life 
it was time to go. 
she sewed a note to her ragged coat. 
it said, this is the granddaughter of mama rose. 
she put fifty cents in her hand 
and went to stand with her at the bus stop.   
she would not return, but her child 
had earned the right to go home. 

when i got off the bus, 
a hush fell over the people waiting there.   
i was as white as my mother, 
but my eyes were gray, not green. 
i had hair down to my waist and braids so thick   
they weighed me down. 
mother said, my father was a white musician   
from another town, 
who found out her secret 
and left her and me to keep it. 
mama rose knew me, though, blind as she was.   
what color are you, gal? she asked 
and i told her, i'm as black as last night. 
that's how i passed, without asking permission.


when the rooster jumps up on the windowsill   
and spreads his red-gold wings, 
i wake, thinking it is the sun 
and call juanita, hearing her answer, 
but only in my mind. 
i know she is already outside, 
breaking the cane off at ground level, 
using only her big hands. 
i get the machete and walk among the cane,   
until i see her, lying face-down in the dirt. 

juanita, dead in the morning like this.   
i raise the machete-- 
what i take from the earth, i give back-- 
and cut off her feet. 
i lift the body and carry it to the wagon,   
where i load the cane to sell in the village.   
whoever tastes my woman in his candy, his cake,   
tastes something sweeter than this sugar cane   
it is grief. 
if you eat too much of it, you want more,   
you can never get enough. 



lightning hits the roof,   
shoves the knife, darkness,   
deep in the walls. 
they bleed light all over us   
and your face, the fan, folds up,   
so i won't see how afraid   
to be with me you are. 
we don't mix, even in bed,   
where we keep ending up.   
there's no need to hide it   
you're snow, i'm coal, 
i've got the scars to prove it.   
but open your mouth, 
i'll give you a taste of black   
you won't forget. 
for a while, i'll let it make you strong, 
make your heart lion, 
then i'll take it back. 



overhead, the match burns out, 
but the chunk of ice in the back seat 
keeps melting from imagined heat, 
while the old hudson tiptoes up the slope.   
my voile blouse, so wet it is transparent,   
like one frightened hand, clutches my chest. 
the bag of rock salt sprawled beside me wakes, thirsty   
and stretches a shaky tongue toward the ice. 

i press the gas pedal hard. 
i'll get back to the house, the dirt yard, the cesspool,   
to you out back, digging a well 
you could fill with your sweat, 
though there is not one reason i should want to.   
you never notice me until the end of the day,   
when your hand is on my knee 
and the ice cream, cooked to broth, 
is hot enough to burn the skin off my touch.


i scissor the stem of the red carnation 
and set it in a bowl of water. 
it floats the way your head would,   
if i cut it off. 
but what if i tore you apart   
for those afternoons 
when i was fifteen 
and so like a bird of paradise   
slaughtered for its feathers.   
even my name suggested wings,   
wicker cages, flight. 
come, sit on my lap, you said.   
i felt as if i had flown there   
i was weightless. 
you were forty and married. 
that she was my mother never mattered. 
she was a door that opened onto me. 
the three of us blended into a kind of somnolence 
and musk, the musk of sundays. sweat and sweetness.   
that dried plum and licorice taste 
always back of my tongue 
and your tongue against my teeth, 
then touching mine. how many times?-- 
i counted, but could never remember. 
and when i thought we'd go on forever, 
that nothing could stop us 
as we fell endlessly from consciousness, 
orders came war in the north.   
your sword, the gold epaulets,   
the uniform so brightly colored,   
so unlike war, i thought. 
and your horse how you rode out the gate. 
no, how that horse danced beneath you 
toward the sound of cannon fire. 
i could hear it, so many leagues away. 
i could see you fall, your face scarlet, 
the horse dancing on without you. 
and at the same moment, 
mother sighed and turned clumsily in the hammock,   
the madeira in the thin-stemmed glass 
spilled into the grass, 
and i felt myself hardening to a brandy-colored wood, 
my skin, a thousand strings drawn so taut   
that when i walked to the house   
i could hear music 
tumbling like a waterfall of china silk   
behind me. 
i took your letter from my bodice.   
salome, i heard your voice, 
little bird, fly. but i did not. 
i untied the lilac ribbon at my breasts   
and lay down on your bed. 
after a while, i heard mother's footsteps,   
watched her walk to the window.   
i closed my eyes 
and when i opened them 
the shadow of a sword passed through my throat   
and mother, dressed like a grenadier, 
bent and kissed me on the lips.


ruth visits her mother's grave in the california hills. 
she knows her mother isn't there but the rectangle of grass   
marks off the place where the memories are kept, 

like a library book named dorothy. 
some of the chapters might be dorothy 
better bird-watcher than cook 

dorothy, wife and atheist 
passionate recycler dorothy, here lies but not. 
in the summer hills, where the tall tough grass 

reminds you of persistence   
and the endless wind   
reminds you of indifference, 

ruth brings batches of white roses, 
extravagant gesture not entirely wasteful   
because as soon as she is gone she knows 
the deer come out of the woods to eat them. 

what was made for the eye 
goes into the mouth, 
thinks ruth to herself as she drives away, 
and in bed when she tries to remember her mother, 

she drifts instead to the roses, 
and when she thinks about the roses she   
sees instead the deer chewing them-- 

pale petals of the roses in the dark   
warm bellies of the sleeping deer-- 
that's what going to sleep is like.


three people come where no people belong any more.   
they are a woman who would be young 
and good-looking if these now seemed 
real qualities, a child with yellow hair, a man   
hardened in desperate humanity. but here are only   
dry cistern, adobe flaking, a lizard. and now this   
disagreeable feeling that they were summoned. sun   
on the corrugated roof is a horse treading, 
a horse with wide wings and heavy hoofs. the lizard   
is splayed head down on the wall, pulsing. they do not   
bother to lift their binoculars to the shimmering distance.   
from this dead center the desert spirals away,   
traveling outward and inward, pulsing. summoned   
from half across the world, from snow and rock,   
from chaos, they arrived a moment ago, they thought,   
in perfect fortuity. there is a presence emerging here in   
sun dance and clicking metal, where the lizard blinks   
with eyes whetted for extinction then swirling   
outward again, outward and upward through the sky's   
white-hot funnel. again and again among the dry   
wailing voices of displaced yankee ghosts 
this ranch is abandoned to terror and the sublime.   
the man turns to the woman and child. he has never   
said what he meant. they give him 
the steady cool mercy of their unreproachful eyes. 



for basil
luxury, then, is a way of 
being ignorant, comfortably 
an approach to the open market 
of least information. where theories   
can thrive, under heavy tarpaulins   
without being cracked by ideas. 

i have not seen the earth for years   
and think now possibly dirt is   
negative, positive, but clearly 
social. i cannot plant a seed, cannot   
recognize the root with clearer dent   
than indifference. though i eat 
and shit as a natural man  getting up   
from the desk to secure a turkey sandwich   
and answer the phone the poem undone   
undone by my station, by my station,   
and the bad words of newark. raised up   
to the breech, we seek to fill for this   
crumbling century. the darkness of love, 
in whose sweating memory all error is forced. 

undone by the logic of any specific death. old gentlemen   
who still follow fires, tho are quieter   
and less punctual. it is a polite truth   
we are left with. who are you? what are you   
saying? something to be dealt with, as easily. 
the noxious game of reason, saying, no, no,   
you cannot feel, like my dead lecturer   
lamenting thru gipsies his fast suicide. 



flesh, and cars, tar, dug holes beneath stone 
a rude hierarchy of money, band saws cross out   
music, feeling. even speech, corrodes. 
                                                          i came here 
from where i sat boiling in my veins, cold fear   
at the death of men, the death of learning, in 
cold fear, at my own. romantic vests of same death   
blank at the corner, blank when they raise their fingers 

criss the hearts, in dark flesh staggered so marvelous   
are their lies. so complete, their mastery, of these   
stupid niggers. loud spics kill each other, and will not 

make the simple trip to tiffany's. will not smash their stainless   
heads, against the simpler effrontery of so callous a code as gain. 

you are no brothers, dirty woogies, dying under dried rinds, in massa's   
droopy tuxedos. cab calloways of the soul, at the soul's juncture, a   
music, they think will save them from our eyes. in back of the terminal 

where the circus will not go. at the backs of crowds, stooped and vulgar   
breathing hate syllables, unintelligible rapes of all that linger in   
our new world. killed in white fedora hats, they stand so mute at what 

whiter slaves did to my father. they muster silence. they pray at the   
steps of abstract prisons, to be kings, when all is silence, when all 
is stone. when even the stupid fruit of their loins is gold, or something   
else they cannot eat. 



he had got, finally, 
to the forest 
of motives. there were no 
owls, or hunters. no connie chatterleys   
resting beautifully 
on their backs, having casually 
brought socialism 
to england.   
                  only ideas, 
and their opposites.

                nowhere. 



the sun is folding, cars stall and rise 
beyond the window. the workmen leave 
the street to the bums and painters' wives 
pushing their babies home. those who realize   
how fitful and indecent consciousness is 
stare solemnly out on the emptying street. 
the mourners and soft singers. the liars, 
and seekers after ridiculous righteousness. all   
my doubles, and friends, whose mistakes cannot   
be duplicated by machines, and this is all of our   
arrogance. being broke or broken, dribbling   
at the eyes. wasted lyricists, and men 
who have seen their dreams come true, only seconds   
after they knew those dreams to be horrible conceits   
and plastic fantasies of gesture and extension, 
shoulders, hair and tongues distributing misinformation   
about the nature of understanding. no one is that simple   
or priggish, to be alone out of spite and grown strong   
in its practice, mystics in two-pants suits. our style,   
and discipline, controlling the method of knowledge.   
beatniks, like bohemians, go calmly out of style. and boys   
are dying in mexico, who did not get the word.   
the lateness of their fabrication mark their holes   
with filthy needles. the lust of the world. this will not 
be news. the simple damning lust, 
                                       float flat magic in low changing   
                                       evenings. shiver your hands 
                                       in dance. empty all of me for 
                                       knowing, and will the danger   
                                       of identification, 

                           let me sit and go blind in my dreaming   
                           and be that dream in purpose and device. 

                           a fantasy of defeat, a strong strong man   
                           older, but no wiser than the defect of love.

& hide your disorder, your lies. 

there are unattractive wild ferns   
outside the window 
where the cats hide. they yowl

& bleeding on my tulips. 

steel bells, like the evil

childless old murderers, for centuries   
with musty eyes. 

i am distressed. thinking 
of the seasons, how they pass, 
how i pass, my very youth, the 
ripe sweet of my life drained off . . .

in the south, sleeping against 
the drugstore, growling under   
the trucks and stoves, stumbling   
through and over the cluttered eyes   
of early mysterious night. frowning   
drunk waving moving a hand or lash.   
dancing kneeling reaching out, letting   
a hand rest in shadows. squatting   
to drink or pee. stretching to climb   
pulling themselves onto horses near   
where there was sea the old songs   
lead you to believe. riding out   
from this town, to another, where   
it is also black. down a road 
where people are asleep. towards   
the moon or the shadows of houses.   
towards the songs' pretended sea.


he came back and shot. he shot him. when he came   
back, he shot, and he fell, stumbling, past the   
shadow wood, down, shot, dying, dead, to full halt. 

at the bottom, bleeding, shot dead. he died then, there   
after the fall, the speeding bullet, tore his face   
and blood sprayed fine over the killer and the grey light. 

pictures of the dead man, are everywhere. and his spirit   
sucks up the light. but he died in darkness darker than   
his soul and everything tumbled blindly with him dying 

down the stairs.   

we have no word 

on the killer, except he came back, from somewhere   
to do what he did. and shot only once into his victim's 
stare, and left him quickly when the blood ran out. we know 

the killer was skillful, quick, and silent, and that the victim   
probably knew him. other than that, aside from the caked sourness   
of the dead man's expression, and the cool surprise in the fixture 

of his hands and fingers, we know nothing.

haunting the black air, braver at night   
dreaming evil, i have done my hitch   
over the plain houses, light by light   
lonely thing, twelve-fingered, out of mind.   
a woman like that is not a woman, quite.   
i have been her kind. 

i have found the warm caves in the woods,   
filled them with skillets, carvings, shelves,   
closets, silks, innumerable goods 
fixed the suppers for the worms and the elves   
whining, rearranging the disaligned. 
a woman like that is misunderstood. 
i have been her kind. 

i have ridden in your cart, driver, 
waved my nude arms at villages going by,   
learning the last bright routes, survivor   
where your flames still bite my thigh 
and my ribs crack where your wheels wind.   
a woman like that is not ashamed to die.   
i have been her kind.

the black room took us 
like a cave or a mouth

dearest, 
although everything has happened, 
nothing has happened.   
the sea is very old. 
the sea is the face of mary, 
without miracles or rage 
or unusual hope, 
grown rough and wrinkled 
with incurable age. 

still, 
i have eyes. 
these are my eyes 
the orange letters that spell   
orient on the life preserver   
that hangs by my knees 
the cement lifeboat that wears   
its dirty canvas coat 
the faded sign that sits on its shelf   
saying keep off. 
oh, all right, i say, 
i'll save myself. 

over my right shoulder   
i see four nuns 
who sit like a bridge club,   
their faces poked out   
from under their habits, 
as good as good babies who   
have sunk into their carriages.   
without discrimination   
the wind pulls the skirts   
of their arms. 
almost undressed, 
i see what remains 
that holy wrist, 
that ankle, 
that chain. 

oh god, 
although i am very sad, 
could you please 
let these four nuns 
loosen from their leather boots 
and their wooden chairs 
to rise out 
over this greasy deck,   
out over this iron rail, 
nodding their pink heads to one side,   
flying four abreast 
in the old-fashioned side stroke 
each mouth open and round, 
breathing together   
as fish do, 
singing without sound. 

dearest, 
see how my dark girls sally forth, 
over the passing lighthouse of plum gut,   
its shell as rusty 
as a camp dish, 
as fragile as a pagoda 
on a stone 
out over the little lighthouse 
that warns me of drowning winds 
that rub over its blind bottom 
and its blue cover 
winds that will take the toes 
and the ears of the rider 
or the lover. 

there go my dark girls,   
their dresses puff   
in the leeward air. 
oh, they are lighter than flying dogs   
or the breath of dolphins 
each mouth opens gratefully, 
wider than a milk cup. 
my dark girls sing for this. 
they are going up. 
see them rise 
on black wings, drinking 
the sky, without smiles 
or hands 
or shoes. 
they call back to us 
from the gauzy edge of paradise, 
good news, good news. 



wait mister. which way is home?   
they turned the light out 
and the dark is moving in the corner.   
there are no sign posts in this room,   
four ladies, over eighty, 
in diapers every one of them. 
la la la, oh music swims back to me   
and i can feel the tune they played   
the night they left me 
in this private institution on a hill. 

imagine it. a radio playing 
and everyone here was crazy. 
i liked it and danced in a circle.   
music pours over the sense   
and in a funny way 
music sees more than i. 
i mean it remembers better 
remembers the first night here. 
it was the strangled cold of november   
even the stars were strapped in the sky   
and that moon too bright 
forking through the bars to stick me   
with a singing in the head. 
i have forgotten all the rest. 

they lock me in this chair at eight a.m.   
and there are no signs to tell the way,   
just the radio beating to itself   
and the song that remembers   
more than i. oh, la la la,   
this music swims back to me.   
the night i came i danced a circle   
and was not afraid. 
mister? 



for my mother, born march , died march  and my father, born february , died june 
gone, i say and walk from church,   
refusing the stiff procession to the grave,   
letting the dead ride alone in the hearse.   
it is june. i am tired of being brave. 

we drive to the cape. i cultivate 
myself where the sun gutters from the sky,   
where the sea swings in like an iron gate 
and we touch. in another country people die. 

my darling, the wind falls in like stones 
from the whitehearted water and when we touch   
we enter touch entirely. no one's alone. 
men kill for this, or for as much. 

and what of the dead? they lie without shoes   
in their stone boats. they are more like stone 
than the sea would be if it stopped. they refuse   
to be blessed, throat, eye and knucklebone. 



that does not keep me from having a terrible need of--shall i say the word--religion. then i go out at night to paint the stars.vincent van gogh in a letter to his brother
the town does not exist 
except where one black-haired tree slips 
up like a drowned woman into the hot sky. 
the town is silent. the night boils with eleven stars.   
oh starry starry night this is how 
i want to die. 

it moves. they are all alive. 
even the moon bulges in its orange irons   
to push children, like a god, from its eye. 
the old unseen serpent swallows up the stars.   
oh starry starry night this is how   
i want to die 

into that rushing beast of the night,   
sucked up by that great dragon, to split   
from my life with no flag, 
no belly, 
no cry.


for my friend, ruth, who urges me to make an appointment for the sacrament of confession
concerning your letter in which you ask   
me to call a priest and in which you ask   
me to wear the cross that you enclose   
your own cross, 
your dog-bitten cross, 
no larger than a thumb, 
small and wooden, no thorns, this rose-- 

i pray to its shadow, 
that gray place 
where it lies on your letter ... deep, deep. 
i detest my sins and i try to believe 
in the cross. i touch its tender hips, its dark jawed face,   
its solid neck, its brown sleep. 

true. there is 
a beautiful jesus. 
he is frozen to his bones like a chunk of beef. 
how desperately he wanted to pull his arms in 
how desperately i touch his vertical and horizontal axes   
but i can't. need is not quite belief. 

all morning long   
i have worn 
your cross, hung with package string around my throat.   
it tapped me lightly as a child's heart might, 
tapping secondhand, softly waiting to be born.   
ruth, i cherish the letter you wrote. 

my friend, my friend, i was born   
doing reference work in sin, and born   
confessing it. this is what poems are   
with mercy 
for the greedy, 
they are the tongue's wrangle, 
the world's pottage, the rat's star.


since you ask, most days i cannot remember. 
i walk in my clothing, unmarked by that voyage.   
then the almost unnameable lust returns. 

even then i have nothing against life. 
i know well the grass blades you mention,   
the furniture you have placed under the sun. 

but suicides have a special language. 
like carpenters they want to know which tools. 
they never ask why build. 

twice i have so simply declared myself,   
have possessed the enemy, eaten the enemy,   
have taken on his craft, his magic. 

in this way, heavy and thoughtful,   
warmer than oil or water, 
i have rested, drooling at the mouth-hole. 

i did not think of my body at needle point. 
even the cornea and the leftover urine were gone.   
suicides have already betrayed the body. 

still-born, they don't always die, 
but dazzled, they can't forget a drug so sweet   
that even children would look on and smile. 

to thrust all that life under your tongue-- 
that, all by itself, becomes a passion.   
death's a sad bone bruised, you'd say, 

and yet she waits for me, year after year,   
to so delicately undo an old wound,   
to empty my breath from its bad prison. 

balanced there, suicides sometimes meet,   
raging at the fruit a pumped-up moon,   
leaving the bread they mistook for a kiss, 

leaving the page of the book carelessly open, 
something unsaid, the phone off the hook 
and the love whatever it was, an infection.


here, 
in the room of my life 
the objects keep changing. 
ashtrays to cry into, 
the suffering brother of the wood walls, 
the forty-eight keys of the typewriter 
each an eyeball that is never shut, 
the books, each a contestant in a beauty contest,   
the black chair, a dog coffin made of naugahyde,   
the sockets on the wall 
waiting like a cave of bees, 
the gold rug 
a conversation of heels and toes, 
the fireplace 
a knife waiting for someone to pick it up, 
the sofa, exhausted with the exertion of a whore,   
the phone 
two flowers taking root in its crotch, 
the doors 
opening and closing like sea clams, 
the lights 
poking at me, 
lighting up both the soil and the laugh. 
the windows, 
the starving windows 
that drive the trees like nails into my heart.   
each day i feed the world out there 
although birds explode 
right and left. 
i feed the world in here too, 
offering the desk puppy biscuits. 
however, nothing is just what it seems to be.   
my objects dream and wear new costumes, 
compelled to, it seems, by all the words in my hands   
and the sea that bangs in my throat.


father, this year's jinx rides us apart 
where you followed our mother to her cold slumber 
a second shock boiling its stone to your heart,   
leaving me here to shuffle and disencumber   
you from the residence you could not afford   
a gold key, your half of a woolen mill, 
twenty suits from dunne's, an english ford,   
the love and legal verbiage of another will,   
boxes of pictures of people i do not know. 
i touch their cardboard faces. they must go. 

but the eyes, as thick as wood in this album,   
hold me. i stop here, where a small boy 
waits in a ruffled dress for someone to come ...   
for this soldier who holds his bugle like a toy   
or for this velvet lady who cannot smile.   
is this your father's father, this commodore 
in a mailman suit? my father, time meanwhile   
has made it unimportant who you are looking for.   
i'll never know what these faces are all about.   
i lock them into their book and throw them out. 

this is the yellow scrapbook that you began 
the year i was born as crackling now and wrinkly   
as tobacco leaves clippings where hoover outran   
the democrats, wiggling his dry finger at me 
and prohibition news where the hindenburg went   
down and recent years where you went flush   
on war. this year, solvent but sick, you meant   
to marry that pretty widow in a one-month rush.   
but before you had that second chance, i cried   
on your fat shoulder. three days later you died. 

these are the snapshots of marriage, stopped in places.   
side by side at the rail toward nassau now 
here, with the winner's cup at the speedboat races,   
here, in tails at the cotillion, you take a bow, 
here, by our kennel of dogs with their pink eyes,   
running like show-bred pigs in their chain-link pen   
here, at the horseshow where my sister wins a prize   
and here, standing like a duke among groups of men.   
now i fold you down, my drunkard, my navigator,   
my first lost keeper, to love or look at later. 

i hold a five-year diary that my mother kept   
for three years, telling all she does not say   
of your alcoholic tendency. you overslept, 
she writes. my god, father, each christmas day   
with your blood, will i drink down your glass   
of wine? the diary of your hurly-burly years   
goes to my shelf to wait for my age to pass.   
only in this hoarded span will love persevere.   
whether you are pretty or not, i outlive you, 
bend down my strange face to yours and forgive you.


child, the current of your breath is six days long.   
you lie, a small knuckle on my white bed   
lie, fisted like a snail, so small and strong 
at my breast. your lips are animals you are fed   
with love. at first hunger is not wrong. 
the nurses nod their caps you are shepherded   
down starch halls with the other unnested throng   
in wheeling baskets. you tip like a cup your head   
moving to my touch. you sense the way we belong.   
but this is an institution bed. 
you will not know me very long. 

the doctors are enamel. they want to know 
the facts. they guess about the man who left me,   
some pendulum soul, going the way men go   
and leave you full of child. but our case history   
stays blank. all i did was let you grow.   
now we are here for all the ward to see.   
they thought i was strange, although   
i never spoke a word. i burst empty   
of you, letting you learn how the air is so.   
the doctors chart the riddle they ask of me   
and i turn my head away. i do not know. 

yours is the only face i recognize. 
bone at my bone, you drink my answers in.   
six times a day i prize 
your need, the animals of your lips, your skin   
growing warm and plump. i see your eyes 
lifting their tents. they are blue stones, they begin   
to outgrow their moss. you blink in surprise 
and i wonder what you can see, my funny kin,   
as you trouble my silence. i am a shelter of lies.   
should i learn to speak again, or hopeless in   
such sanity will i touch some face i recognize? 

down the hall the baskets start back. my arms   
fit you like a sleeve, they hold 
catkins of your willows, the wild bee farms   
of your nerves, each muscle and fold 
of your first days. your old man's face disarms   
the nurses. but the doctors return to scold   
me. i speak. it is you my silence harms.   
i should have known i should have told 
them something to write down. my voice alarms   
my throat. name of father--none. i hold   
you and name you bastard in my arms. 

and now that's that. there is nothing more   
that i can say or lose. 
others have traded life before 
and could not speak. i tighten to refuse   
your owling eyes, my fragile visitor. 
i touch your cheeks, like flowers. you bruise   
against me. we unlearn. i am a shore   
rocking you off. you break from me. i choose   
your only way, my small inheritor 
and hand you off, trembling the selves we lose.   
go child, who is my sin and nothing more.


we sail out of season into an oyster-gray wind,   
over a terrible hardness. 
where dickens crossed with mal de mer 
in twenty weeks or twenty days 
i cross toward him in five. 
wrapped in robes-- 
not like caesar but like liver with bacon-- 
i rest on the stern 
burning my mouth with a wind-hot ash,   
watching my ship 
bypass the swells 
as easily as an old woman reads a palm. 
i think, as i look north, that a field of mules   
lay down to die. 

the ship is  hours out. 
i have entered her. 
she might be a whale, 
sleeping  and ship's company, 
the last  martini 
and steel staterooms where night goes on forever.   
being inside them is, i think, 
the way one would dig into a planet 
and forget the word light. 
i have walked cities, 
miles of mole alleys with carpets. 
inside i have been ten girls who speak french.   
they languish everywhere like bedsheets. 

oh my atlantic of the cracked shores, 
those blemished gates of rockport and boothbay,   
those harbor smells like the innards of animals   
old childish queen, where did you go, 
you bayer at wharfs and victorian houses? 

i have read each page of my mother's voyage.   
i have read each page of her mother's voyage. 
i have learned their words as they learned dickens'.   
i have swallowed these words like bullets.   
but i have forgotten the last guest--terror.   
unlike them, i cannot toss in the cabin   
as in childbirth. 
now always leaving me in the west   
is the wake, 
a ragged bridal veil, unexplained, 
seductive, always rushing down the stairs,   
never detained, never enough. 

the ship goes on 
as though nothing else were happening. 
generation after generation, 
i go her way. 
she will run east, knot by knot, over an old bloodstream, 
stripping it clear, 
each hour ripping it, pounding, pounding, 
forcing through as through a virgin. 
oh she is so quick 
this dead street never stops


i was thinking of a son. 
the womb is not a clock 
nor a bell tolling, 
but in the eleventh month of its life 
i feel the november 
of the body as well as of the calendar. 
in two days it will be my birthday 
and as always the earth is done with its harvest.   
this time i hunt for death, 
the night i lean toward, 
the night i want.   
well then-- 
speak of it 
it was in the womb all along. 

i was thinking of a son ...   
you the never acquired, 
the never seeded or unfastened,   
you of the genitals i feared, 
the stalk and the puppy's breath. 
will i give you my eyes or his? 
will you be the david or the susan? 
those two names i picked and listened for. 
can you be the man your fathers are-- 
the leg muscles from michelangelo, 
hands from yugoslavia 
somewhere the peasant, slavic and determined,   
somewhere the survivor bulging with life-- 
and could it still be possible,   
all this with susan's eyes? 

all this without you--   
two days gone in blood. 
i myself will die without baptism, 
a third daughter they didn't bother.   
my death will come on my name day.   
what's wrong with the name day?   
it's only an angel of the sun. 
woman, 
weaving a web over your own, 
a thin and tangled poison. 
scorpio, 
bad spider-- 
die 

my death from the wrists, 
two name tags, 
blood worn like a corsage 
to bloom 
one on the left and one on the right-- 
it's a warm room, 
the place of the blood. 
leave the door open on its hinges 

two days for your death   
and two days until mine. 

love that red disease-- 
year after year, david, you would make me wild 
david susan david david 
full and disheveled, hissing into the night, 
never growing old, 
waiting always for you on the porch ...   
year after year, 
my carrot, my cabbage, 
i would have possessed you before all women, 
calling your name, 
calling you mine.


everyone in me is a bird. 
i am beating all my wings.   
they wanted to cut you out   
but they will not. 
they said you were immeasurably empty   
but you are not. 
they said you were sick unto dying   
but they were wrong. 
you are singing like a school girl.   
you are not torn. 

sweet weight, 
in celebration of the woman i am 
and of the soul of the woman i am 
and of the central creature and its delight   
i sing for you. i dare to live. 
hello, spirit. hello, cup. 
fasten, cover. cover that does contain.   
hello to the soil of the fields. 
welcome, roots. 

each cell has a life. 
there is enough here to please a nation. 
it is enough that the populace own these goods.   
any person, any commonwealth would say of it,   
it is good this year that we may plant again   
and think forward to a harvest. 
a blight had been forecast and has been cast out. 
many women are singing together of this   
one is in a shoe factory cursing the machine,   
one is at the aquarium tending a seal,   
one is dull at the wheel of her ford,   
one is at the toll gate collecting, 
one is tying the cord of a calf in arizona,   
one is straddling a cello in russia, 
one is shifting pots on the stove in egypt, 
one is painting her bedroom walls moon color,   
one is dying but remembering a breakfast,   
one is stretching on her mat in thailand,   
one is wiping the ass of her child, 
one is staring out the window of a train   
in the middle of wyoming and one is   
anywhere and some are everywhere and all   
seem to be singing, although some can not   
sing a note. 

sweet weight, 
in celebration of the woman i am 
let me carry a ten-foot scarf, 
let me drum for the nineteen-year-olds, 
let me carry bowls for the offering 
if that is my part. 
let me study the cardiovascular tissue, 
let me examine the angular distance of meteors,   
let me suck on the stems of flowers 
if that is my part. 
let me make certain tribal figures 
if that is my part. 
for this thing the body needs 
let me sing 
for the supper,   
for the kissing,   
for the correct   
yes.


the end of the affair is always death.   
she's my workshop. slippery eye,   
out of the tribe of myself my breath   
finds you gone. i horrify 
those who stand by. i am fed.   
at night, alone, i marry the bed. 

finger to finger, now she's mine.   
she's not too far. she's my encounter.   
i beat her like a bell. i recline 
in the bower where you used to mount her.   
you borrowed me on the flowered spread.   
at night, alone, i marry the bed. 

take for instance this night, my love,   
that every single couple puts together   
with a joint overturning, beneath, above,   
the abundant two on sponge and feather,   
kneeling and pushing, head to head.   
at night alone, i marry the bed. 

i break out of my body this way,   
an annoying miracle. could i   
put the dream market on display?   
i am spread out. i crucify. 
my little plum is what you said.   
at night, alone, i marry the bed. 

then my black-eyed rival came. 
the lady of water, rising on the beach,   
a piano at her fingertips, shame   
on her lips and a flute's speech. 
and i was the knock-kneed broom instead.   
at night, alone, i marry the bed. 

she took you the way a woman takes   
a bargain dress off the rack 
and i broke the way a stone breaks. 
i give back your books and fishing tack.   
today's paper says that you are wed.   
at night, alone, i marry the bed. 

the boys and girls are one tonight. 
they unbutton blouses. they unzip flies.   
they take off shoes. they turn off the light.   
the glimmering creatures are full of lies. 
they are eating each other. they are overfed.   
at night, alone, i marry the bed.


liebe, meine liebe, i had not hoped   
to be so poor 

                   the night winds reach   
like the blind breath of the world 
in a rhythm without mind, gusting and beating   
as if to destroy us, battering our poverty   
and all the land's flat and cold and dark 
under iron snow 

                        the dog leaps in the wind   
barking, maddened with winter, and his voice   
claps again and again down the valley   
like tatters of revolutionary pennants 
                                                         birches 
cry and hemlocks by the brook 
stand hunched and downcast with their hands   
in their pockets 

liebe, the world is wild   
and without intention 

                               how far 
this might be from the night of christmas   
if it were not for you. 

down the reaching wind 
shrieks of starlight bear broken messages 
among mountains where shadows plunge 
                                                      yet our brightness   
is unwavering 
                   kennst du das land   
wo die zitronen blhn, im dunkeln laub 
die goldorangen ... liebe 
art thou singing 

it is a question partly 
of the tree with our stars and partly 
of your radiance brought from the land   
where legends flower to this land   
but more than these our bright poverty   
is a house in the wind and a light   
on the mountain 

liebe, our light rekindled 
in this remoteness from the other land, 
in this dark of the blue mountain where only   
the winds gather 
      is what we are for the time that we are   
      what we know for the time that we know 

how gravely and sweetly the poor touch in the dark.


sometimes i wish i were still out 
on the back porch, drinking jet fuel   
with the boys, getting louder and louder   
as the empty cans drop out of our paws   
like booster rockets falling back to earth 

and we soar up into the summer stars.   
summer. the big sky river rushes overhead,   
bearing asteroids and mist, blind fish   
and old space suits with skeletons inside.   
on earth, men celebrate their hairiness, 

and it is good, a way of letting life 
out of the box, uncapping the bottle 
to let the effervescence gush 
through the narrow, usually constricted neck. 

and now the crickets plug in their appliances   
in unison, and then the fireflies flash 
dots and dashes in the grass, like punctuation   
for the labyrinthine, untrue tales of sex   
someone is telling in the dark, though 

no one really hears. we gaze into the night 
as if remembering the bright unbroken planet   
we once came from, 
to which we will never   
be permitted to return. 
we are amazed how hurt we are. 
we would give anything for what we have.


i 
is the total black, being spoken 
from the earth's inside. 
there are many kinds of open. 
how a diamond comes into a knot of flame   
how a sound comes into a word, coloured   
by who pays what for speaking. 

some words are open 
like a diamond on glass windows 
singing out within the crash of passing sun 
then there are words like stapled wagers 
in a perforated book--buy and sign and tear apart-- 
and come whatever wills all chances 
the stub remains 
an ill-pulled tooth with a ragged edge. 
some words live in my throat 
breeding like adders. others know sun 
seeking like gypsies over my tongue 
to explode through my lips 
like young sparrows bursting from shell. 
some words 
bedevil me. 

love is a word another kind of open-- 
as a diamond comes into a knot of flame 
i am black because i come from the earth's inside   
take my word for jewel in your open light.


my mother had two faces and a frying pot   
where she cooked up her daughters 
into girls 
before she fixed our dinner. 
my mother had two faces 
and a broken pot 
where she hid out a perfect daughter   
who was not me 
i am the sun and moon and forever hungry   
for her eyes. 

i bear two women upon my back   
one dark and rich and hidden 
in the ivory hungers of the other   
mother 
pale as a witch 
yet steady and familiar 
brings me bread and terror 
in my sleep 
her breasts are huge exciting anchors   
in the midnight storm. 

all this has been 
before 
in my mother's bed 
time has no sense 
i have no brothers 
and my sisters are cruel. 

mother i need 
mother i need 
mother i need your blackness now   
as the august earth needs rain.   
i am 

the sun and moon and forever hungry   
the sharpened edge 
where day and night shall meet 
and not be 
one.


coming together   
it is easier to work   
after our bodies   
meet 
paper and pen 
neither care nor profit 
whether we write or not 
but as your body moves 
under my hands   
charged and waiting   
we cut the leash 
you create me against your thighs   
hilly with images 
moving through our word countries   
my body 
writes into your flesh 
the poem 
you make of me. 

touching you i catch midnight   
as moon fires set in my throat   
i love you flesh into blossom   
i made you 
and take you made 
into me.


i am fourteen 
and my skin has betrayed me   
the boy i cannot live without   
still sucks his thumb 
in secret 
how come my knees are 
always so ashy 
what if i die 
before morning 
and momma's in the bedroom   
with the door closed. 

i have to learn how to dance   
in time for the next party   
my room is too small for me   
suppose i die before graduation   
they will sing sad melodies   
but finally 
tell the truth about me 
there is nothing i want to do   
and too much 
that has to be done 
and momma's in the bedroom   
with the door closed. 

nobody even stops to think   
about my side of it 
i should have been on math team   
my marks were better than his   
why do i have to be 
the one 
wearing braces 
i have nothing to wear tomorrow   
will i live long enough 
to grow up 
and momma's in the bedroom   
with the door closed.


i have studied the tight curls on the back of your neck   
moving away from me 
beyond anger or failure 
your face in the evening schools of longing 
through mornings of wish and ripen 
we were always saying goodbye 
in the blood in the bone over coffee 
before dashing for elevators going 
in opposite directions 
without goodbyes. 

do not remember me as a bridge nor a roof   
as the maker of legends 
nor as a trap 
door to that world 
where black and white clericals 
hang on the edge of beauty in five oclock elevators   
twitching their shoulders to avoid other flesh   
and now 
there is someone to speak for them   
moving away from me into tomorrows   
morning of wish and ripen 
your goodbye is a promise of lightning   
in the last angels hand 
unwelcome and warning 
the sands have run out against us   
we were rewarded by journeys 
away from each other 
into desire 
into mornings alone 
where excuse and endurance mingle   
conceiving decision. 
do not remember me 
as disaster 
nor as the keeper of secrets 
i am a fellow rider in the cattle cars 
watching 
you move slowly out of my bed   
saying we cannot waste time 
only ourselves.


i 
however the image enters 
its force remains within 
my eyes 
rockstrewn caves where dragonfish evolve   
wild for life, relentless and acquisitive   
learning to survive 
where there is no food 
my eyes are always hungry 
and remembering 
however the image enters 
its force remains. 
a white woman stands bereft and empty 
a black boy hacked into a murderous lesson   
recalled in me forever 
like a lurch of earth on the edge of sleep   
etched into my visions 
food for dragonfish that learn 
to live upon whatever they must eat 
fused images beneath my pain. 

    ii 
the pearl river floods through the streets of jackson   
a mississippi summer televised. 
trapped houses kneel like sinners in the rain 
a white woman climbs from her roof to a passing boat   
her fingers tarry for a moment on the chimney   
now awash 
tearless and no longer young, she holds   
a tattered baby's blanket in her arms. 
in a flickering afterimage of the nightmare rain   
a microphone 
thrust up against her flat bewildered words 
          we jest come from the bank yestiddy   
                   borrowing money to pay the income tax   
                   now everything's gone. i never knew   
                   it could be so hard. 
despair weighs down her voice like pearl river mud   
caked around the edges 
her pale eyes scanning the camera for help or explanation 
unanswered 
she shifts her search across the watered street, dry-eyed   
                   hard, but not this hard. 
two tow-headed children hurl themselves against her   
hanging upon her coat like mirrors 
until a man with ham-like hands pulls her aside   
snarling she ain't got nothing more to say 
and that lie hangs in his mouth 
like a shred of rotting meat. 

    iii 
i inherited jackson, mississippi. 
for my majority it gave me emmett till   
his  years puffed out like bruises   
on plump boy-cheeks 
his only mississippi summer 
whistling a  gun salute to dixie 
as a white girl passed him in the street   
and he was baptized my son forever   
in the midnight waters of the pearl. 

his broken body is the afterimage of my st year 
when i walked through a northern summer 
my eyes averted 
from each corner's photographies   
newspapers protest posters magazines   
police story, confidential, true   
the avid insistence of detail 
pretending insight or information 
the length of gash across the dead boy's loins 
his grieving mother's lamentation   
the severed lips, how many burns   
his gouged out eyes 
sewed shut upon the screaming covers   
louder than life 
all over 
the veiled warning, the secret relish   
of a black child's mutilated body   
fingered by street-corner eyes   
bruise upon livid bruise 
and wherever i looked that summer 
i learned to be at home with children's blood 
with savored violence 
with pictures of black broken flesh   
used, crumpled, and discarded   
lying amid the sidewalk refuse   
like a raped woman's face. 

a black boy from chicago 
whistled on the streets of jackson, mississippi 
testing what he'd been taught was a manly thing to do 
his teachers 
ripped his eyes out his sex his tongue 
and flung him to the pearl weighted with stone 
in the name of white womanhood 
they took their aroused honor 
back to jackson 
and celebrated in a whorehouse 
the double ritual of white manhood 
confirmed. 

    iv 
    if earth and air and water do not judge them who are 
      we to refuse a crust of bread? 
      
emmett till rides the crest of the pearl, whistling 
 years his ghost lay like the shade of a raped woman   
and a white girl has grown older in costly honor   
what did she pay to never know its price? 
now the pearl river speaks its muddy judgment   
and i can withhold my pity and my bread. 

            hard, but not this hard. 
her face is flat with resignation and despair   
with ancient and familiar sorrows 
a woman surveying her crumpled future 
as the white girl besmirched by emmett's whistle   
never allowed her own tongue 
without power or conclusion 
unvoiced 
she stands adrift in the ruins of her honor   
and a man with an executioner's face 
pulls her away. 

within my eyes 
the flickering afterimages of a nightmare rain 
a woman wrings her hands 
beneath the weight of agonies remembered 
i wade through summer ghosts   
betrayed by vision 
hers and my own 
becoming dragonfish to survive   
the horrors we are living 
with tortured lungs 
adapting to breathe blood. 

a woman measures her life's damage 
my eyes are caves, chunks of etched rock 
tied to the ghost of a black boy   
whistling 
crying and frightened 
her tow-headed children cluster   
like little mirrors of despair   
their father's hands upon them   
and soundlessly 
a woman begins to weep.


moon marked and touched by sun   
my magic is unwritten 
but when the sea turns back 
it will leave my shape behind.   
i seek no favor 
untouched by blood 
unrelenting as the curse of love   
permanent as my errors 
or my pride 
i do not mix 
love with pity 
nor hate with scorn 
and if you would know me 
look into the entrails of uranus   
where the restless oceans pound. 

i do not dwell 
within my birth nor my divinities   
who am ageless and half-grown   
and still seeking 
my sisters 
witches in dahomey 
wear me inside their coiled cloths   
as our mother did 
mourning. 

i have been woman 
for a long time 
beware my smile 
i am treacherous with old magic   
and the noon's new fury 
with all your wide futures   
promised 
i am 
woman 
and not white.


time collapses between the lips of strangers   
my days collapse into a hollow tube 
soon implodes against now 
like an iron wall 
my eyes are blocked with rubble 
a smear of perspectives 
blurring each horizon 
in the breathless precision of silence 
one word is made. 

once the renegade flesh was gone   
fall air lay against my face 
sharp and blue as a needle 
but the rain fell through october   
and death lay    a condemnation   
within my blood. 

the smell of your neck in august   
a fine gold wire bejeweling war   
all the rest lies 
illusive as a farmhouse 
on the other side of a valley 
vanishing in the afternoon. 

day three    day four    day ten   
the seventh step 
a veiled door leading to my golden anniversary   
flameproofed free-paper shredded   
in the teeth of a pillaging dog   
never to dream of spiders   
and when they turned the hoses upon me 
a burst of light.


when the medication she was taking 
caused tiny vessels in her face to break, 
leaving faint but permanent blue stitches in her cheeks,   
my sister said she knew she would 
never be beautiful again. 

after all those years 
of watching her reflection in the mirror,   
sucking in her stomach and standing straight,   
she said it was a relief, 
being done with beauty, 

but i could see her pause inside that moment   
as the knowledge spread across her face   
with a fine distress, sucking 
the peach out of her lips, 
making her cute nose seem, for the first time,   
a little knobby. 

i'm probably the only one in the whole world   
who actually remembers the year in high school   
she perfected the art 
of being a dumb blond, 

spending recess on the breezeway by the physics lab,   
tossing her hair and laughing that canary trill   
which was her specialty, 

while some football player named johnny   
with a pained expression in his eyes 
wrapped his thick finger over and over again   
in the bedspring of one of those pale curls. 

or how she spent the next decade of her life   
auditioning a series of tall men, 
looking for just one with the kind 
of attention span she could count on. 

then one day her time of prettiness   
was over, done, finito, 
and all those other beautiful women   
in the magazines and on the streets   
just kept on being beautiful 
everywhere you looked, 

walking in that kind of elegant, disinterested trance 
in which you sense they always seem to have one hand   
touching the secret place 
that keeps their beauty safe, 
inhaling and exhaling the perfume of it-- 

it was spring. season when the young   
buttercups and daisies climb up on the   
mulched bodies of their forebears   
to wave their flags in the parade. 

my sister just stood still for thirty seconds,   
amazed by what was happening, 
then shrugged and tossed her shaggy head   
as if she was throwing something out, 

something she had carried a long ways, 
but had no use for anymore, 
now that it had no use for her. 
that, too, was beautiful.


the northern lights.         i wouldn't have noticed them 
    if the deer hadn't told me 
    a doe         her coat of pearls         her glowing hoofs 
                      proud and inquisitive 
                      eager for my appraisal 
and i went out into the night with electrical steps 
    but with my head held also proud 
                      to share the animal's fear 
                      and see what i had seen before 
    a sky flaring and spectral 
                      greenish waves and ribbons 
and the snow         under strange light         tossing in the pasture 
    like a storming ocean caught 
                      by a flaring beacon. 
    the deer stands away from me         not far 
                      there among bare black apple trees 
                      a presence i no longer see. 
    we are proud to be afraid 
                      proud to share 
the silent magnetic storm that destroys the stars 
                      and flickers around our heads 
    like the saints' cold spiritual agonies 
                      of old. 
i remember         but without the sense         other light-storms 
    cold memories discursive and philosophical 
                      in my mind's burden 
    and the deer remembers nothing. 
we move our feet         crunching bitter snow         while the storm 
    crashes like god-wars down the east 
                      we shake the sparks from our eyes 
    we quiver inside our shocked fur 
                      we search for each other 
    in the apple thicket-- 
                      a glimpse, an acknowledgment 
    it is enough and never enough-- 
we toss our heads         and say good night 
    moving away on bitter bitter snow.


there are so many roots to the tree of anger   
that sometimes the branches shatter   
before they bear. 

sitting in nedicks 
the women rally before they march   
discussing the problematic girls   
they hire to make them free. 
an almost white counterman passes   
a waiting brother to serve them first   
and the ladies neither notice nor reject   
the slighter pleasures of their slavery.   
but i who am bound by my mirror   
as well as my bed 
see causes in colour 
as well as sex 

and sit here wondering   
which me will survive   
all these liberations.


the edge of our bed was a wide grid 
where your fifteen-year-old daughter was hanging   
gut-sprung on police wheels 
a cablegram nailed to the wood 
next to a map of the western reserve 
i could not return with you to bury the body   
reconstruct your nightly cardboards 
against the seeping transvaal cold 
i could not plant the other limpet mine 
against a wall at the railroad station 
nor carry either of your souls back from the river   
in a calabash upon my head 
so i bought you a ticket to durban 
on my american express 
and we lay together 
in the first light of a new season. 

now clearing roughage from my autumn garden   
cow sorrel    overgrown rocket gone to seed   
i reach for the taste of today 
the new york times finally mentions your country   
a half-page story 
of the first white south african killed in the unrest 
not of black children massacred at sebokeng   
six-year-olds imprisoned for threatening the state   
not of thabo sibeko, first grader, in his own blood   
on his grandmother's parlor floor 
joyce, nine, trying to crawl to him 
shitting through her navel 
not of a three-week-old infant, nameless   
lost under the burned beds of tembisa 
my hand comes down like a brown vise over the marigolds   
reckless through despair 
we were two black women touching our flame   
and we left our dead behind us 
i hovered    you rose    the last ritual of healing   
it is spring, you whispered 
i sold the ticket for guns and sulfa   
i leave for home tomorrow 
and wherever i touch you 
i lick cold from my fingers 
taste rage 
like salt from the lips of a woman   
who has killed too often to forget   
and carries each death in her eyes   
your mouth a parting orchid   
someday you will come to my country   
and we will fight side by side? 

keys jingle in the door ajar    threatening   
whatever is coming belongs here 
i reach for your sweetness 
but silence explodes like a pregnant belly   
into my face 
a vomit of nevers. 

mmanthatisi turns away from the cloth 
her daughters-in-law are dyeing 
the baby drools milk from her breast 
she hands him half-asleep to his sister 
dresses again for war   
knowing the men will follow. 
in the intricate maseru twilights 
quick    sad    vital 
she maps the next day's battle 
dreams of durban    sometimes 
visions the deep wry song of beach pebbles 
running after the sea.


cold wind comes out of the white hills 
and rubs itself against the walls of the condominium   
with an esophogeal vowel sound, 
and a loneliness creeps 
into the conversation by the hot tub. 

we don't deserve pleasure 
just as we don't deserve pain, 
but it's pure sorcery the way the feathers of warm mist   
keep rising from the surface of the water 
to wrap themselves around a sculpted 
clavicle or wrist. 

it's not just that we are on 
the eighth story of the world 
looking out through glass and steel 
with a clarity of vision 
in which imported coffee and 
a knowledge of french painting 
                                              are combined, 

but that we are atop a pyramid 
of all the facts that make this possible   
the furnace that heats the water,   
the truck that hauled the fuel, 
the artery of highway 
blasted through the mountains, 

the heart attack of the previous owner,   
the history of western medicine   
that failed to save him, 
the successful development of tourism, 
the snow white lotions that counteract the chemistry   
of chlorine upon skin--our skin. 

down inside history's body, 
the slaves are still singing in the dark   
the roads continue to be built 
the wind blows and the building grips itself   
in anticipation of the next strong gust. 

so an enormous act of forgetting is required   
simply to kiss someone 
or to open your mouth 
for the fork of high-calorie pat 
someone is raising to your lips, 

which, considering the price,   
it would be a sin   
not to enjoy.


somewhere, someone is asking a question, 
and i stand squinting at the classroom 
with one hand cupped behind my ear, 
trying to figure out where that voice is coming from. 

i might be already an old man, 
attempting to recall the night 
his hearing got misplaced, 
front-row-center at a battle of the bands, 

where a lot of leather-clad, second-rate musicians,   
amped up to dinosaur proportions, 
test drove their equipment through our ears.   
each time the drummer threw a tantrum, 

the guitarist whirled and sprayed us with machine-gun riffs,   
as if they wished that they could knock us 
quite literally dead. 
we called that fun in , 

when we weren't sure our lives were worth surviving. 
i'm here to tell you that they were,   
and many of us did, despite ourselves,   
though the road from there to here 

is paved with dead brain cells, 
parents shocked to silence, 
and squad cars painting the whole neighborhood   
the quaking tint and texture of red jelly. 

friends, we should have postmarks on our foreheads   
to show where we have been 
we should have pointed ears, or polka-dotted skin   
to show what we were thinking 

when we hot-rodded over god's front lawn,   
and death kept blinking. 
but here i stand, an average-looking man   
staring at a room 

where someone blond in braids   
with a beautiful belief in answers   
is still asking questions. 

through the silence in my dead ear,   
i can almost hear the future whisper   
to the past it says that this is not a test   
and everybody passes.


themes from the tzu yeh and the book of songs
i have carried my pillow to the windowsill 
and try to sleep, with my damp arms crossed upon it,   
but no breeze stirs the tepid morning. 
only i stir ... come, tease me a little 
with such cold passion, so little teasing play, 
how long can we endure our life together? 

no use. i put on your long dressing-gown 
the untied sash trails over the dusty floor. 
i kneel by the window, prop up your shaving mirror   
and pluck my eyebrows. 
i don't care if the robe slides open 
revealing a crescent of belly, a tan thigh. 
i can accuse that nonexistent breeze ... 

i am as monogamous as the north star, 
but i don't want you to know it. you'd only take advantage.   
while you are as fickle as spring sunlight. 
all right, sleep the cat means more to you than i.   
i can rouse you, but then you swagger out. 
i glimpse you from the window, striding toward the river. 

when you return, reeking of fish and beer, 
there is salt dew in your hair. where have you been? 
your clothes weren't that wrinkled hours ago, when you left.   
you couldn't have loved someone else, after loving me 
i sulk and sigh, dawdling by the window.   
later, when you hold me in your arms 
it seems, for a moment, the river ceases flowing.


when a beautiful woman wakes up, 
she checks to see if her beauty is still there.   
when a sick person wakes up, 
he checks to see if he continues to be sick. 

he takes the first pills in a thirty-pill day,   
looks out the window at a sky 
where a time-release sun is crawling   
through the milky x ray of a cloud. 

        

i sing the body like a burnt-out fuse box,   
the wires crossed, the panel lit 
by red malfunction lights, the pistons firing   
out of sequence, 
the warning sirens blatting in the empty halls, 

and the hero is trapped in a traffic jam,   
the message doesn't reach its destination,   
the angel falls down into the body of a dog   
and is speechless, 

tearing at itself with fast white teeth   
and the consciousness twists evasively,   
like a sheet of paper, 
       traveled by blue tongues of flame. 

        

in the famous painting, the saint   
looks steadfastly heavenward, 
             away from the physical indignity below, 

the fascinating spectacle 
    of his own body 
                     bristling with arrows 
he looks up 
as if he were already adamantly elsewhere,   
    exerting that power of denial 
         the soul is famous for, 
that ability to say, none of this is real 

nothing that happened here on earth 
and who i thought i was, 
and nothing that i did or that was done to me,   
was ever real.


fear. three bears 
are not fear, mother 
and cubs come berrying   
in our neighborhood 

like any other family. 
i want to see them, or any   
distraction. flashlight   
poking across the brook 

into briary darkness,   
but they have gone, 
noisily. i go to bed.   
fear. unwritten books 

already titled. some 
idiot will shoot the bears 
soon, it always happens, 
they'll be strung up by the paws 

in someone's frontyard   
maple to be admired and   
measured, and i'll be paid   
for work yet to be done-- 

with a broken imagination.   
at last i dream. our 
plum tree, little, black,   
twisted, gaunt in the 

orchard how for a moment   
last spring it flowered 
serenely, translucently 
before yielding its usual 

summer crop of withered   
leaves. i waken, late,   
go to the window, look   
down to the orchard. 

is middle age what makes   
even dreams factual? 
the plum is serene and   
bright in new moonlight, 

dressed in silver leaves, 
and nearby, in the waste 
of rough grass strewn 
in moonlight like diamond dust, 

what is it?--a dark shape   
moves, and then another.   
are they ... i can't 
be sure. the dark house 

nuzzles my knee mutely,   
pleading for meaty dollars.   
fear. wouldn't it be great   
to write nothing at all 

except poems about bears? 



then one of the students with blue hair and a tongue stud   
says that america is for him a maximum-security prison 

whose walls are made of radioshacks and burger kings, and mtv episodes   
where you can't tell the show from the commercials, 

and as i consider how to express how full of shit i think he is,   
he says that even when he's driving to the mall in his isuzu 

trooper with a gang of his friends, letting rap music pour over them   
like a boiling jacuzzi full of ballpeen hammers, even then he feels 

buried alive, captured and suffocated in the folds   
of the thick satin quilt of america 

and i wonder if this is a legitimate category of pain,   
or whether he is just spin doctoring a better grade, 

and then i remember that when i stabbed my father in the dream last night,   
it was not blood but money 

that gushed out of him, bright green hundred-dollar bills   
spilling from his wounds, and--this is the weird part--, 

he gasped thank god--those ben franklins were   
clogging up my heart-- 

and so i perish happily, 
freed from that which kept me from my liberty-- 

which was when i knew it was a dream, since my dad   
would never speak in rhymed couplets, 

and i look at the student with his acne and cell phone and phony ghetto clothes 
and i think, i am asleep in america too, 

and i don't know how to wake myself either, 
and i remember what marx said near the end of his life 

i was listening to the cries of the past, 
when i should have been listening to the cries of the future. 

but how could he have imagined  channels of -hour cable 
or what kind of nightmare it might be 

when each day you watch rivers of bright merchandise run past you 
and you are floating in your pleasure boat upon this river 

even while others are drowning underneath you 
and you see their faces twisting in the surface of the waters 

and yet it seems to be your own hand 
which turns the volume higher?


windy today and i feel less than brilliant, 
driving over the hills from work. 
there are the dark parts on the road 
                     when you pass through clumps of wood   
and the bright spots where you have a view of the ocean,   
but that doesn't make the road an allegory. 

i should call marie and apologize 
for being so boring at dinner last night, 
but can i really promise not to be that way again?   
and anyway, i'd rather watch the trees, tossing   
in what certainly looks like sexual arousal. 

otherwise it's spring, and everything looks frail 
the sky is baby blue, and the just-unfurling leaves 
are full of infant chlorophyll,   
the very tint of inexperience. 

last summer's song is making a comeback on the radio,   
and on the highway overpass, 
the only metaphysical vandal in america has written   
memory loves time 
in big black spraypaint letters, 

which makes us wonder if time loves memory back. 

last night i dreamed of x again. 
she's like a stain on my subconscious sheets.   
years ago she penetrated me 
but though i scrubbed and scrubbed and scrubbed,   
i never got her out, 
but now i'm glad. 

what i thought was an end turned out to be a middle.   
what i thought was a brick wall turned out to be a tunnel.   
what i thought was an injustice 
turned out to be a color of the sky. 

outside the youth center, between the liquor store   
and the police station, 
a little dogwood tree is losing its mind 

overflowing with blossomfoam,   
like a sudsy mug of beer 
like a bride ripping off her clothes, 

dropping snow white petals to the ground in clouds, 

so nature's wastefulness seems quietly obscene.   
it's been doing that all week 
making beauty, 
and throwing it away, 
and making more.


          one 
from sappho to myself, consider the fate of women. 
how unwomanly to discuss it like a noose or an albatross necktie   
the clinical sobriquet hangs us codpiece coveters. 
never mind these epithets i myself have collected some honeys.   
juvenal set us apart in denouncing our vices 
which had grown, in part, from having been set apart 
women abused their spouses, cuckolded them, even plotted   
to poison them. sensing, behind the violence of his manner-- 
think i'm crazy or drunk?--his emotional stake in us,   
as we forgive strindberg and nietzsche, we forgive all those   
who cannot forget us. we are hyenas. yes, we admit it. 

while men have politely debated free will, we have howled for it,   
howl still, pacing the centuries, tragedy heroines. 
some who sat quietly in the corner with their embroidery 
were defarges, stabbing the wool with the names of their ancient   
oppressors, who ruled by the divine right of the male-- 
i'm impatient of interruptions i'm aware there were millions   
of mutes for every saint joan or sainted jane austen, 
who, vague-eyed and acquiescent, worshiped god as a man.   
i'm not concerned with those cabbageheads, not truly feminine   
but neutered by labor. i mean real women, like you and like me. 

freed in fact, not in custom, lifted from furrow and scullery,   
not obliged, now, to be the pot for the annual chicken,   
have we begun to arrive in time? with our well-known   
respect for life because it hurts so much to come out with it   
disdainful of sovereignty, national honor and other abstractions 
we can say, like the ancient chinese to successive waves of invaders,   
relax, and let us absorb you. you can learn temperance   
in a more temperate climate. give us just a few decades   
of grace, to encourage the fine art of acquiescence   
and we might save the race. meanwhile, observe our creative chaos,   
flux, efflorescence--whatever you care to call it 


         two 
i take as my theme the independent woman, 
independent but maimed observe the exigent neckties   
choking violet writers the sad slacks of stipple-faced matrons   
indigo intellectuals, crop-haired and callus-toed, 
cute spectacles, chewed cuticles, aced out by full-time beauties   
in the race for a male. retreating to drabness, bad manners,   
and sleeping with manuscripts. forgive our transgressions   
of old gallantries as we hitch in chairs, light our own cigarettes,   
not expecting your care, having forfeited it by trying to get even. 

but we need dependency, cosseting, and well-treatment.   
so do men sometimes. why don't they admit it?   
we will be cows for a while, because babies howl for us,   
be kittens or bitches, who want to eat grass now and then   
for the sake of our health. but the role of pastoral heroine   
is not permanent, jack. we want to get back to the meeting. 

knitting booties and brows, tartars or termagants, ancient   
fertility symbols, chained to our cycle, released 
only in part by devices of hygiene and personal daintiness,   
strapped into our girdles, held down, yet uplifted by man's   
ingenious constructions, holding coiffures in a breeze,   
hobbled and swathed in whimsy, tripping on feminine   
shoes with fool heels, losing our lipsticks, you, me, 
in ephemeral stockings, clutching our handbags and packages. 
our masks, always in peril of smearing or cracking, 
in need of continuous check in the mirror or silverware,   
keep us in thrall to ourselves, concerned with our surfaces.   
look at man's uniform drabness, his impersonal envelope   
over chicken wrists or meek shoulders, a formal, hard-fibered assurance.   
the drape of the male is designed to achieve self-forgetfulness. 

so, sister, forget yourself a few times and see where it gets you   
up the creek, alone with your talent, sans everything else. 
you can wait for the menopause, and catch up on your reading.   
so primp, preen, prink, pluck, and prize your flesh, 
all posturings all ravishment all sensibility 
meanwhile, have you used your mind today? 
what pomegranate raised you from the dead, 
springing, full-grown, from your own head, athena? 


         three          
i will speak about women of letters, for i'm in the racket.   
our biggest successes to date? old maids to a woman. 
and our saddest conspicuous failures? the married spinsters   
on loan to the husbands they treated like surrogate fathers.   
think of that crew of self-pitiers, not-very-distant, 
who carried the torch for themselves and got first-degree burns.   
or the sad sonneteers, toast-and-teasdales we loved at thirteen   
middle-aged virgins seducing the puerile anthologists   
through lust-of-the-mind barbiturate-drenched camilles   
with continuous periods, murmuring softly on sofas   
when poetry wasn't a craft but a sickly effluvium,   
the air thick with incense, musk, and emotional blackmail. 

i suppose they reacted from an earlier womanly modesty   
when too many girls were scabs to their stricken sisterhood,   
impugning our sex to stay in good with the men, 
commencing their insecure bluster. how they must have swaggered   
when women themselves endorsed their own inferiority   
vestals, vassals, and vessels, rolled into several, 
they took notes in rolling syllabics, in careful journals,   
aiming to please a posterity that despises them. 
but we'll always have traitors who swear that a woman surrenders   
her supreme function, by equating art with aggression   
and failure with femininity. still, it's just as unfair 
to equate art with femininity, like a prettily packaged commodity   
when we are the custodians of the world's best-kept secret   
merely the private lives of one-half of humanity. 

but even with masculine dominance, we mares and mistresses   
produced some sleek saboteuses, making their cracks 
which the porridge-brained males of the day were too thick to perceive, 
mistaking young hornets for perfectly harmless bumblebees. 
being thought innocuous rouses some women to frenzy   
they try to be ugly by aping the ways of men 
and succeed. swearing, sucking cigars and scorching the bedspread, 

slopping straight shots, eyes blotted, vanity-blown 
in the expectation of glory she writes like a man 
this drives other women mad in a mist of chiffon. 
one poetess draped her gauze over red flannels, a practical feminist. 

but we're emerging from all that, more or less, 
except for some ladylike laggards and quarterly priestesses   
who flog men for fun, and kick women to maim competition.   
now, if we struggle abnormally, we may almost seem normal 
if we submerge our self-pity in disciplined industry 
if we stand up and be hated, and swear not to sleep with editors 
if we regard ourselves formally, respecting our true limitations   
without making an unseemly show of trying to unfreeze our assets   
keeping our heads and our pride while remaining unmarried   
and if wedded, kill guilt in its tracks when we stack up the dishes 
and defect to the typewriter. and if mothers, believe in the luck of our children, 
whom we forbid to devour us, whom we shall not devour, 
and the luck of our husbands and lovers, who keep free women.


after po ch-i, for robert creeley
we don't lack people here on the northern coast, 
but they are people one meets, not people one cares for.   
so i bundle my daughters into the car 
and with my brother poets, go to visit you, brother. 

here come your guests a swarm of strangers and children 
but the strangers write verses, the children are daughters like yours.   
we bed down on mattresses, cots, roll up on the floor 
outside, burly old fruit trees in mist and rain 
in every room, bundles asleep like larvae. 

we waken and count our daughters. otherwise, nothing happens.   
you feed them sweet rolls and melon, drive them all to the zoo   
patiently, patiently, ever the father, you answer their questions.   
later, we eat again, drink, listen to poems. 
nothing occurs, though we are aware you have three daughters   
who last year had four. but even death becomes part of our ease   
poems, parenthood, sorrow, all we have learned 
from these of tenderness, holds us together 
in the center of life, entertaining daughters 
by firelight, with cake and songs. 

you, my brother, are a good and violent drinker,   
good at reciting short-line or long-line poems.   
in time we will lose all our daughters, you and i, 
be temperate, venerable, content to stay in one place,   
sending our messages over the mountains and waters.


i sing of morrisville   
if you call this cry 
      a song. i 
if you call this painful 

voice by that great name   
sing the poverty of my 
      region and of 
the wrong end of morrisville. 

you summer people will say   
that all its ends are wrong,   
      but there, right there, 
the very end of the wrong end-- 

a house with windows sagging,   
leaning roadward as in defense   
      or maybe defiance 
next to the granite ledge, 

our cliff of broken stone 
that shoulders our dilapidated 
        one-lane iron bridge.   
who lives here? i don't know. 

but they hermes reward them   
made this extraordinary garden,   
        geraniums, 
petunias and nasturtiums 

planted in every crevice and all   
the footholds of the cliff. 
        and then 
they painted the cliff-face, 

painted the old stone no design,   
just swatches of color, bold 
        rough splashes   
irregularly, garish orange 

and livid blue. is it 
fluorescent, do these stones   
        glow in the dark? 
maybe. i only know 

they glow in the day, so   
vivid i stopped my car, 
        whereupon two others   
came inquiring also, two 

crows in the broken spars 
of the white pine tree, cawing   
        above the house. 
why had those who inhabited 

this corner of poverty 
painted the stones? was it   
        that the flowers 
in living bravery nevertheless 

made too meager a show 
for the ruined cliff? or did they   
        think to bring art 
to nature, somehow to improve 

this corner of ugliness? 
for my part i thought how   
        these colors 
were beautiful and yet strange 

in their beauty, ugly colors,   
garish orange, livid blue   
        they reminded me 
of those spanish cemeteries 

i saw in new mexico, tin   
mirrors and plastic flowers   
        in the desert. then 
i knew why the stones 

had been painted to make   
reparation, such as the poor 
      might make, whose sorrow   
had been done here, this 

desecration. is not this 
the burden of all poor lands   
        everywhere, 
the basis of poverty? 

a spoiled land makes spoiled   
people. the poor know this.   
        i guess 
the crows know too, because off 

they flew, cawing above 
the bridge and the slashed hills   
        surrounding morrisville.   
i started my car and drove 

out on the iron bridge   
which rumbled its sullen   
        affirmation. 
and i sang as i sing now 

if you care to call it song   
my people of morrisville   
        who live 
where all the ends are wrong. 



my mother--preferring the strange to the tame 
dove-note, bone marrow, deer dung, 
frog's belly distended with finny young, 
leaf-mold wilderness, harebell, toadstool, 
odd, small snakes roving through the leaves, 
metallic beetles rambling over stones all 
wild and natural--flashed out her instinctive love, and quick, she   
picked up the fluttering, bleeding bat the cat laid at her feet,   
and held the little horror to the mirror, where 
he gazed on himself, and shrieked like an old screen door far off. 

depended from her pinched thumb, each wing 
came clattering down like a small black shutter. 
still tranquil, she began, it's rather sweet ... 
the soft mouse body, the hard feral glint 
in the caught eyes. then we saw, 
and recoiled lice, pallid, yellow, 
nested within the wing-pits, cozily sucked and snoozed.   
the thing dropped from her hands, and with its thud, 
swiftly, the cat, with a clean careful mouth 
closed on the soiled webs, growling, took them out to the back stoop. 

but still, dark blood, a sticky puddle on the floor   
remained, of all my mother's tender, wounding passion   
for a whole wild, lost, betrayed, and secret life   
among its dens and burrows, its clean stones,   
whose denizens can turn upon the world   
with spitting tongue, an odor, talon, claw,   
to sting or soil benevolence, alien 
as our clumsy traps, our random scatter of shot.   
she swept to the kitchen. turning on the tap,   
she washed and washed the pity from her hands. 



in the laboratory waiting room 
containing 
one television actor with a teary face 
trying a contact lens 
two muscular victims of industrial accidents   
several vain women--i was one of them--   
came deborah, four, to pick up her glass eye. 

it was a long day 
deborah waiting for the blood vessels 
painted 
on her iris to dry. 
her mother said that, holding deborah 
when she was born, 
first i inspected her, from toes to navel, 
then stopped at her head ... 
we wondered why 
the inspection hadn't gone the other way.   
looking into her eye 
was like looking into a volcano 

her vacant pupil 
went whirling down, down to the foundation   
of the world ... 
when she was three months old they took it out.   
she giggled when she went under 
the anaesthetic. 
forty-five minutes later she came back 
happy ... 
the gas wore off, she found the hole in her face 
you know, it never bled?, 
stayed happy, even when i went to pieces.   
she's five, in june. 

deborah, you get right down 
from there, or i'll have to slap 
laughing, deborah climbed into the lap 
of one vain lady, who 
had been discontented with her own beauty.   
now she held on to deborah, looked her steadily   
in the empty eye.


who took heroin, then sleeping pills, and who lies in a new york hospital
the florist was told, cyclamen or azalea   
white in either case, for you are pale 
as they are, blooming early and profusely 
though the azalea grows in sandier soil,   
needing less care while cyclamen's fleshy tubers   
are adored, yes, rooted out by some.   
one flourishes in aridness, while the other   
feeds the love which devours. 

but what has flung you here for salvaging   
from a city's dereliction, this new york? 
a world against whose finger-and-breath-marked windows   
these weak flares may be set. 
our only bulwark is the frailest cover   
lovers touch from terror of being alone.   
the urban surface tough and granular,   
poor ground for the affections to take root. 

left to our own devices, we devise 
such curious deaths, comas, or mutilations   
you may buy peace, white, in sugary tincture,   
no way of knowing its strength, or your own,   
until you lie quite still, your perfect limbs   
in meditation the spirit rouses, flutters 
like a handkerchief at a cell window, signaling,   
self-amazed, its willingness to endure. 

the thing to cling to is the sense of expectation.   
who knows what may occur in the next breath?   
in the pallor of another morning we neither   
anticipated nor wanted eve, waken to flowers   
unforeseen, from someone you don't even know.   
azalea or cyclamen ... we live in wonder, 
blaze in a cycle of passion and apprehension   
though once we lay and waited for a death.


i just had the old dodge in the shop 
with that same damned front-end problem,   
and i was out, so to speak, for a test run, 

loafing along, maybe  m.p.h.,   
down the old corvallis road, 
holding her out of the ruts and potholes. 

that's out in montana, the bitterroot valley.   
long ways from home is how they say it. 
long ways from home, boys, long long ways from home. 

might as well not put this clunker in the shop   
and keep my hard-earned in my pocket,   
she wobbles and humps like a scared rabbit. 

but it's a real fine summer day in corvallis,   
and i'm loafing along watching the sprayers   
do their slow drag on the fields of alfalfa, 

and i come to a side road with a little green sign   
says kurtz lane and i said to myself out loud,   
mistah kurtz--he alive. him doing just fine, 

because of the sign, you see, and because i'm lonesome   
and maybe kind of bitter in spite of the sunshine.   
it's still a goddamn long ways from home. 

that's one thing, though, that heart of darkness,   
i read that story every year, i never forget   
that crazy old son-of-a-bitch, that kurtz. 

and the next thing i see about a quarter-mile   
down the road is somebody small on the shoulder,   
a kid looking for a ride home, i figure. 

and he's a kid all right, maybe ten or eleven,   
but no montana boy, he's an oriental,   
one of those laotians that got resettled. 

can't figure why they brought them to montana.   
he's got those big eyes and caved-in cheeks   
like the pictures on the tv during vietnam, 

and his mouth is open a little. i say to myself,   
i'll give him a ride if he wants, and i even   
begin to slow down, but he didn't 

put up his thumb. just when i went by, he waved,   
real quick and shy, but still like he was trying   
to reach me. i drove on. then i bust out crying. 



part four of pro femina
at samoa, hardly unpacked, i commenced planting, 
when i'd opened the chicken crates, built the cochins a coop.   
the reverend mr. claxton called, found me covered with mud,   
my clothes torn, my hair in a wad, my bare feet bleeding.   
i had started the buffalo grass in the new-made clearing.   
the next day the priest paid a visit. civil but restless,   
i was dying to plant the alfalfa seed--gave him a packet. 

that evening i paced up and down, dropping melon seeds,   
tomatoes and bush lima beans here and there 
where i thought they would grow. we were short of food now,   
so i cooked up a mess of fat little parrots, disturbed   
at the way they suggested cages and swings and stands ...   
an excellent meal. i have been told the dodo survived here,   
and yearn for a pet on a string. and i built the pig-house. 

i had brought sweet coconut seed from savage island.   
i planted kidney potatoes in small earthen hills.   
sowed seeds of eggplant in numerous boxes of soil,   
tomato and artichoke too half-a-dozen fine pineapple   
sent over by mr. carruthers, the island solicitor.   
as fast as we eat them, we plant the tops. 
the kitchen a shack near the house. i made bread in the rain. 

october, . i have been here nearly a month 
put in corn, peas, onions, radishes, lettuce. lima beans 
are already coming up. the ripening cantaloupe were stolen.   
carruthers gave me mint root and grenadilla 
like a bouquet he delivered a load of trees, 
two mangoes among them. i set them out in a heavy rain,   
then rounded off the afternoon sowing indian corn. 

louis has called me a peasant. how i brooded   
confided it to you, diary, then crossed it out.   
peasant because i delve in the earth, the earth i own.   
confiding my seed and root--i too a creator?   
my heart melts over a bed of young peas. a blossom   
on the rose tree is like a poem by my son.   
my hurt healed by its cause, i go on planting. 

no one else works much. the natives take it easy 
the colonials keep their shops, and a shortage of customers.   
the mail comes four times a month, and the gossip all day.   
the bars are crowded with amateur politicians,   
office-seekers i named the earwig consul and king   
big talkers, with small-time conspirators drinking them in.   
mr. carruthers and i picked a site for the kitchen garden. 

i was planting a new lot of corn and pumpkin 
when a young chief arrived, laden with pineapple plants.   
i set them out as i talked to him on the way home. 
rats and a wild hen ate the corn. lettuce got too much sun.   
so i dug a new patch up the road in the fragrant evening   
i confided to louis, a puff of the sweetest scent 
blows back as i cast away a handful of so-called weeds 

it still hurts, his remark that i have the soul of a peasant.   
my vanity, like a newly felled tree, lies prone and bleeding.   
i clear the weeds near the house for planting maize.   
sweet corn and peas are showing. i send for more seeds.   
i clean out the potatoes, which had rotted in their hills. 
of course, rls is not idle he is writing a footnote to history 
how the great powers combine to carve up these islands. 

i discovered the ylang-ylang tree a base for perfume, 
though it suggested to me the odor of boots. 
another tree is scented like pepper and spice, 
and one terrible tree, i am forced to say, 
smells like ordure ... it nearly made me ill. 
breadfruit is plentiful. i found a banana grove, 
began clearing it instantly, and worked till i was dizzy. 

the garden looks like a graveyard beds shaped like tombs. 
i plant cabbage which i loathe, so the british won't tease me   
for not growing it. but behold in the hedge 
among citron and lime, many lemon trees, in full bearing.   
still, i will fall to brooding before the mirror, 
though louis says he finds the peasant class interesting. 
he is forty today. i am ten years his senior. 

on the cleared land, the green mummy-apple, 
male and female, is springing up everywhere. 
i discover wild ginger, turmeric, something like sugar.   
roots of orange, breadfruit and mango, seeds of cacao   
came with a shipment from sydney also eleven 
young navel orange trees. the strawberry plants are rotten.   
i am given a handful of bees. i plant more pineapple.   

all fall i am cursed with asthma, rheumatics, a painful ear. 
christmas. a hurricane. and the new year begins.   
louis describes it divinely to henry james. 
mr. carruthers' gift pineapple starts to fruit. 
i set out one precious rhubarb plant, pause to gloat 
at the ripe tomatoes, the flourishing long-podded beans.   
but the neighbors' horses break in and trample the corn.   

sometimes, when planting, a strange subterranean rumble   
--volcanic?--vexes the earth beneath this peasant haunch. 
i rise up from my furrow, knuckle smooth my brow 
as i sniff the air, suddenly chemical, a sulphurous fume.   
louis insisted on going to sydney, fell ill again. 
his mother comes back with him, finds me on my knees.   
the old lady's heart leaps alas, i am planting, not praying. 

we both rise at five-thirty, after dreaming of weeds.   
louis describes to me endless vivid deeps 
dreams of nettle-stings, stabs from the citron's thorns,   
the ants' fiery bites, the resistance of mud and slime,   
the evasions of wormy roots, the dead weight of heat   
in the sudden puffs of air ... louis writes till nine,   
then if he's well enough, he helps with the weeding. 

he writes colvin, keeper of prints at the british museum,   
i know pleasure still ... with a thousand faces, 
none perfect, a thousand tongues, all broken, 
a thousand hands, all with scratching nails ... 
high among joys, i place this delight of weeding, 
out here alone by the garrulous water, under the silence   
of the high wind, broken by sounds of birds. 

the shock of bird-calls, laughing and whistling   
they mimic his name till it seems, he says, 
the birds re-live the business of my day. 
but the rain continues to fall on birds and weeds. 
the new servants fooled around with the ice machine   
as the house leaked and listed. mildew spread its failure.   
mrs. s. gave me some nuts, and went back to australia. 

green peppers, eggplant, tomatoes are flourishing,   
asparagus also. the celery does to season soup.   
avocados grow at a rate that is almost frightening. 
coconuts too. i read about stanley and livingstone. 
i cured my five ulcers with calomel, wished i could tell   
stanley the remedy. instead, i made perfume. 
the servants feared devils, so i planted the orange grove alone. 

for two months i misplaced this diary ... 
war is in the air, talk of killing all whites. 
i bought coffee trees, rose trees, and indian beans,   
then went to fiji to rest, and to get more seeds   
from a former kew gardener. an indian in a shop   
told me how to raise persian melon and cauliflower   
and a radish that turns into a turnip when it grows up. 

i came home to a burgeoning world cacao, custard squash.   
the new house was finished, and painted peacock blue.   
the jealous old cat bit off the new cat's toes. 
my mother-in-law returned with her bible and lady's maid   
my daughter, her family, and my son lloyd came too.   
the relatives had a terrible row. mrs. s. refused 
to pray with the servants. i threw up my hands 

my diary entries grow farther and farther apart. 
i wrote life was a strain. later, someone crossed it out.   
in pain again, from an aneurysm inside my head ... 
i planted more and more cacao, and a form of cherry tree,   
tobacco and rubber, taught how by mr. sketchley.   
i planted more cacao through an epidemic of 'flu. 
three hundred seeds in baskets broke through the ground. 

i get almost no time to write. i have been planting ...   
four kinds of cabbage are doing very well. 
mr. haggard, the land commissioner, come to dine,   
points out a weed which makes excellent eating 
cooked like asparagus. i shall try it very soon. 
now, when the reverend mr. claxton comes to call,   
i refuse to see him. i am tired of the claxtons. 

the political situation grows grim. i rage at louis 
who toasts, her blessed majesty the queen, then aggressively   
throbbing, turns to my american son 
to say he may drink to the president afterward 
if he likes. i am writing this down 
hoping louis will see it later, and be ashamed 
of his childishness and bad taste. this will be erased. 

because war is near, the germans stop growing cacao.   
captain hufnagel offers me all the seeds i can use.   
so now we are blazing with cacao fever, 
the whole family infected. six hundred plants set out   
the verandah tracked with mud, and the cacao litter. 
mrs. s. upset by the mess. twelve hundred cacaos planted.   
joe, my son-in-law, planted his thousandth tree today. 

the tree onions make large bulbs but don't want to seed.   
most vigorous sunflower, watermelon--weeds 
the jelly from berries out of the bush is delicious 
lovely perfume from massoi, citron, vanilla, and gum.   
the peanuts are weeded while joe plays on his flute.   
i plant cabbage by moonlight, set out more cacao. 
the heart of a death's-head moth beats a tattoo in my hand. 

planted coffee all day, and breadfruit, five beauties ...   
planted coffee the better part of the day, eight plants.   
in the nursery, three times that many. planted coffee ...   
painted the storm shutters. planted coffee all morning.   
i found a heap of old bones in a bush near the sty 
two heads and a body a warrior died with his prize.   
louis gave the bones a funeral and a burial. 

a series of hurricanes louis writes to the times 
of the foul colonial politics. i send to new york for seeds   
southern cross cabbage, eggplant, sweet potato 
and two thousand custard apples. louis' own seed,   
david balfour, is growing. i wrote nothing 
from june till the end of this year too busy planting.   
the samoan princes are getting nearer to war. 

it pains me to write this my son-in-law has gone native   
in a spectacular way. belle is divorcing him. 
austin, my grandson, is in school in monterey. 
i have not, i believe, mentioned mrs. stevenson recently.   
she has gone back to scotland. the first breadfruit bore.   
belle and i go on sketching expeditions 
to the hostile samoan camps, stop in town for ginger beer. 

mr. haggard begged us to stay in town 
because he bitterly wanted women to protect. 
i suggested to him that i and my daughter 
could hide under his table and hand him cartridges   
at the window, to complete the romantic effect.   
it is clear that mr. haggard is ryder's brother 
he said, you'd sell your life for a bunch of banana trees. 

i've given permission to most of the boys 
to go to the races. lloyd has put up the lawn tennis things.   
mr. gurr, the neighbor, rushes in to say war has begun.   
we all race to the mission. eleven heads have been taken.   
later mr. dine's cousin received a head smeared with black   
the custom is to return them to the bereaved. 
he washed it off and discovered it was his brother. 

he sat there, holding his brother's head in his hands, 
kissing it, bathing it with his tears. a scandal arose 
because the heads of three girls have been taken as well 
unheard of before in samoa, returned wrapped in silk to their kin. 
at malie, the warriors danced a head-hunter's pantomime   
the men who had taken heads carried great lumps of raw pork   
between their teeth, cut in the semblance of heads. 

i stopped writing this. too hysterical with migraine. 
also, people find where i hide it, and strike things out.   
our favorite chief is exiled for life. the war winds down.   
louis works on his masterpiece, the weir of hermiston. 
well, i've kept him alive for eight more years, 
while his dear friends would have condemned him to fog and rain   
so they might enjoy his glorious talk in london, 

though it be the end of him. fine friends except for james.   
later at six, louis helped with the mayonnaise, 
when he put both hands to his head, said, oh, what a pain   
do i look strange? i said no, not wanting to frighten him.   
he was never conscious again. in two hours he died.   
tonight, the chiefs with their axes are digging a path   
to the top of the mountain. they will dig his grave. 

i will leave here as soon as i can, and never return,   
except to be buried beside him. i will live like a gipsy   
in my wild, ragged clothes, until i am old, old.   
i will have pretty gardens wherever i am, 
but never breadfruit, custard apples, grenadilla, cacao,   
pineapple, ylang-ylang, citron, mango, cacao,   
never again succumb to the fever of planting.


it's a spring morning sun pours in the window   
as i sit here drinking coffee, reading augustine.   
and finding him, as always, newly minted   
from when i first encountered him in school.   
today i'm overcome with astonishment   
at the way we girls denied all that was mean   
in those revered philosophers we studied 
who found us loathsome, loathsomely seductive   
irrelevant, at best, to noble discourse   
among the sex, the only sex that counted.   
wounded, we pretended not to mind it 
and wore tight sweaters to tease our shy professor. 

we sat in autumn sunshine as the clouds arose   
from slimy desires of the flesh, and from 
youth's seething spring. thank you, augustine.   
attempting to seem blas, our cheeks on fire, 
it didn't occur to us to rush from the room. 
instead we brushed aside the briars of unclean desire   
and struggled on through mires of misogyny 
till we arrived at kierkegaard, and began to see 
that though saint a. and sren had much in common   
including fear and trembling before women, 
the saint scared himself, while sren was scared of us. 
had we, poor girls, been flattered by their thralldom? 

yes, it was always us, the rejected feminine   
from whom temptation came. it was our flesh   
with its deadly sweetness that led them on. 
yet how could we not treasure augustine, 
stuck fast in the bird-lime of pleasure? 
that roomful of adolescent poets manqu 
assuaged, bemused by music, let the meaning go.   
swept by those psalmic cadences, we were seduced   
some of us tried for a while to be well-trained souls   
and pious seekers, enmeshed in the saint's dialectic   
responsible for our actions, yet utterly helpless. 
a sensible girl would have barked like a dog before god. 

we students, children still, were shocked to learn 
the children these men desired were younger than we   
augustine fancied a girl about eleven, 
the age of adeodatus, augustine's son. 
sren, like poe, eyed his girl before she was sixteen,   
to impose his will on a malleable child, when 
she was not equipped to withstand or understand him.   
ah, the pygmalion instinct mold the clay 
create the compliant doll that can only obey, 
expecting to be abandoned, minute by minute.   
it was then i abandoned philosophy, 
a minor loss, although i majored in it. 

but we were a group of sunny innocents.   
i don't believe we knew what evil meant. 
now i live with a well-trained soul who deals with evil,   
including error, material or spiritual,   
easily, like changing a lock on the kitchen door. 
he prays at set times and in chosen places   
at meals, in church, while i 
pray without thinking how or when to pray,   
in a low mumble, several times a day,   
like running a continuous low fever 
the sexual impulse for the most part being over.   
believing i believe. not banking on it ever. 

it's afternoon. i sit here drinking kir 
and reading kierkegaard all sin begins with fear. 
true. we lie first from terror of our parents.   
in, i believe, an oblique crack at augustine,   
sren said by denying the erotic 
it was brought to the attention of the world.   
the rainbow curtain rises on the sensual   
christians must admit it before they can deny it.   
he reflected on his father's fierce repression   
of the sexual, which had bent him out of shape   
yet he had to pay obeisance to that power 
he chose his father when he broke with his regina. 

sren said by denying the erotic 
it is brought to the attention of the world.   
you must admit it before you can deny it. 
so much for repetition--another theory   
which some assume evolved from his belief   
he could replay his courtship of regina 
with a happy ending. meanwhile she'd wait for him,   
eternally faithful, eternally seventeen.   
instead, within two years, the bitch got married.   
in truth, he couldn't wait till he got rid of her,   
to create from recollection, not from living   
to use the material, not the material girl. 

i sip my kir, thinking of eitheror, 
especially either, starring poor elvira. 
he must have seen giovanni a score of times,   
and sren knew the score. 
he took regina to the opera only once, 
and as soon as mozart's overture was over,   
kierkegaard stood up and said, now we are leaving.   
you have heard the best the expectation of pleasure.   
in his interminable aria on the subject   
s.k. insisted the performance was the play.   
was the overture then the foreplay? poor regina   
should have known she'd be left waiting in the lurch. 

though he chose a disguise in which to rhapsodize,   
it was his voice too elvira's beauty 
would perish soon the deflowered quickly fade 
a night-blooming cereus after juan's one-night stand.   
sren, eyes clouded by romantic mist, 
portrayed elvira always sweet sixteen. 
s.k.'s interpretation seems naive. 
he didn't seem to realize that innocent sopranos   
who are ready to sing elvira, don't exist. 
his diva may have had it off with leporello 
just before curtain time, believing it freed her voice   
so backstage legend has it, and weakened his. 

i saw la stupenda sing elvira once. 
her cloak was larger than an army tent. 
would giovanni be engulfed when she inhaled?   
would the boards shiver when she stamped her foot?   
her voice of course was great. innocent it was not.   
sren, long since, would have fallen in a faint.   
when he, or his doppelgnger, wrote 
that best-seller, the diary of a seducer, 
he showed how little he knew of true don juans   
those turgid letters, machinations, and excursions,   
those tedious conversations with dull aunts,   
those convoluted efforts to get the girl 

think of the worldly european readers 
who took sren seriously, did not see 
his was the cynicism of the timid virgin.   
once in my youth i knew a real don juan   
or he knew me. he didn't need to try, 
the characteristic of a true seducer. 
he seems vulnerable, shy he hardly speaks.   
somehow, you know he will never speak of you.   
you trust him--and you thrust yourself at him.   
he responds with an almost absentminded grace.   
even before the consummation he's looking past you   
for the next bright yearning pretty face. 

relieved at last of anxieties and tensions 
when your terrible efforts to capture him are over,   
you overflow with happyunhappy languor. 
but s.k's alter-ego believes the truly terrible 
is for you to be consoled by the love of another.   
we women, deserted to a woman, have a duty   
to rapidly lose our looks, decline, and die, 
our only chance of achieving romantic beauty. 
so augustine was sure, when monica, his mother,   
made him put aside his nameless concubine   
she'd get her to a nunnery, and pine. 
he chose his mother when he broke with his beloved. 

in sren's long replay of his wrecked romance,   
guiltynot guilty, he says he must tear himself away   
from earthly love, and suffer to love god. 
augustine thought better love, human therefore flawed,   
is the way to the love of god. to deny this truth   
is to be left outside, breathing into the dust, 
filling the eyes with earth. we women, 
outside, breathing dust, are still the other. 
the evening sun goes down time to fix dinner. 
you women have no major philosophers. we know.   
but we remain philosophic, and say with the saint,   
let me enter my chamber and sing my songs of love.


you rose from our embrace and the small light spread 
like an aureole around you. the long parabola 
of neck and shoulder, flank and thigh i saw 
permute itself through unfolding and unlimited 
minuteness in the movement of your tall tread, 
the spine-root swaying, the picasso-like clat 
of scissoring slender legs. i knew some law 
of being was at work. at one time i had said 
that love bestows such values, and so it does, 
but the old man in his canto was right and wise 
ubi amor ibi ocullus est. 
always i wanted to give and in wanting was 
the poet. a man now, aging, i know the best 
of love is not to bestow, but to recognize. 



you died. and because you were greek they gave you   
          a coin to carry under your tongue and then also   
biscuits and honey. when you came to the riverbank 
          you saw a crazy-looking black bumboat on the water   
with a figure standing in it, lanky and dressed 
          darkly, holding a sweep. you were taken across, 
and you gave your coin for the passage, and continued 
          until you came to a three-headed dog, who snarled   
and threatened you, even though you were not trying 
          to escape. you gave him the biscuits smeared   
with honey, and you passed onward to the field 
          of asphodel and through the gate of tartarus. or 

you died and you were navajo. they had carried you 
          out of the hogan earlier so you'd die in the sunshine.   
or if it happened inside suddenly, they stuffed up 
          the smokehole and boarded the front entrance, and cut   
an opening in the back, the north-facing, dark-facing 
          side, to carry you out, and no one ever used   
that hogan again. they took off your moccasins 
          and put them on again wrong side to, the left one   
on the right foot, the right on the left, so that your 
          chindi would be confused and unable to return   
along your tracks. they washed your hair in suds 
          made from the yucca. then they gave you   
enough fried bread and water to last four days, 
          and you set off on your journey. but actually 

none of these things happened. you just died. 



just over the horizon a great machine of death is roaring and rearing. 
we can hear it always. earthquake, starvation, the ever-renewing sump of corpse-flesh.
but in this valley the snow falls silently all day, and out our window 
we see the curtain of it shifting and folding, hiding us away in our little house,
we see earth smoothened and beautified, made like a fantasy, the snow-clad trees
so graceful. in our new bed, which is big enough to seem like the north pasture almost
with our two cats, cooker and smudgins, lying undisturbed in the southeastern and southwestern corners,
we lie loving and warm, looking out from time to time. snowbound, we say. we speak of the poet
who lived with his young housekeeper long ago in the mountains of the western province, the kingdom
of cruelty, where heads fell like wilted flowers and snow fell for many months
across the pass and drifted deep in the vale. in our kitchen the maple-fire murmurs
in our stove. we eat cheese and new-made bread and jumbo spanish olives
which have been steeped in our special brine of jalapeos and garlic and dill and thyme.
we have a nip or two from the small inexpensive cognac that makes us smile and sigh.
for a while we close the immense index of images that is our lives--for instance,
the child on the mescalero reservation in new mexico sitting naked in  outside his family's hut,
covered with sores, unable to speak. but of course we see the child every day,
we hold out our hands, we touch him shyly, we make offerings to his implacability.
no, the index cannot close. and how shall we survive? we don't and cannot and will never
know. beyond the horizon a great unceasing noise is undeniable. the machine,
like an immense clanking vibrating shuddering unnameable contraption as big as a house, as big as the whole town,
may break through and lurch into our valley at any moment, at any moment.
cheers, baby. here's to us. see how the curtain of snow wavers and then falls back.


both of us had been close 
to joel, and at joel's death 
my friend had gone to the wake   
and the memorial service 
and more recently he had 
visited joel's grave, there 
at the back of the grassy 
cemetery among the trees, 
a quiet, gentle place, he said,   
befitting joel. and i said,   
what's the point of going   
to look at graves? i went 
into one of my celebrated 
tirades. people go to look   
at the grave of keats or hart   
crane, they go traveling just to   
do it, what a waste of time.   
what do they find there? hell,   
i wouldn't go look at the grave of   
shakespeare if it was just   
down the street. i wouldn't   
look at-- and i stopped. i 
was about to say the grave of god   
until i realized i'm looking at it   
all the time.... 



to tell the truth, those brick housing authority buildings   
for whose loveliness no soul had planned, 
like random dominoes stood, worn out and facing each other,   
creating the enclosure that was our home. 

long basement corridors connected one house to another   
and had a special smell, from old bicycles and baby carriages   
in the storage rooms. the elevators 
were used by kissing teenagers. 

the playground--iron swingchains, fences, iron monkey bars,   
iron seesaw handles, doubtless now rusted-- 
left a strong iron smell on my hands and in the autumn air   
and rang with cries. to me it is even precious 

where they chased the local mongoloid, yelling stupid joey stupid joey 
now i've said everything nice i can about this. 



now here is a typical children's story   
that happens in gorgeous october   
when the mothers are coming 
in the afternoon, wearing brisk boots   
and windy skirts to pick up 
the little children from the day care center 

frost in the air 
the maples golden and crimson 
my son in a leaf pile in the playground dreaming   
i am late, the playground is almost 
empty, my husband will kill me 

i gather my son to go home, 
he forgets his sweater in the playground and i send him back   
he dawdles, he is playing with leaves 
in his mind, it is already a quarter 
to six, will you come on i say 

and hurry along the corridor, there are yellow and blue rocket   
paintings, but i feel bad and ask what did you do today,   
do you recognize this story, the way he stands and picks   
his nose, move i say, do you want dinner or not   
i'm going to make a nice dinner, fried chicken 
i wheedle, so could you please walk a little 
faster, okay, i walk a little faster and get upstairs   
myself, pivot on boot-heel, nobody there, 
he is putting something in his mouth, his sable eyelashes   
downcast, and i am swooping down the stairwell screaming 

         damn you   
         that's filthy 
         i told you not before dinner 

we are climbing the stairs 
and i am crying, my son is not crying 
i have shaken him, i have pried the sweet from his cheek   
i have slapped his cheek like a woman slapping a carpet   
with all my strength 

         mothers are very strong 
         he is too young to do anything about this   
         will not remember he remembers it 

the mind is a leaf pile where you can bury 
anything, pain, the image of a woman 
who wears a necklace of skulls, a screaming woman   
you dig quickly and deposit the pulpy thing 
you drop leaves on it and it stays there, that is the story 

that is sticking in my mind as we push 
the exit door, and run through the evening wind   
to my car where i jerk the gearshift and pick   
up a little speed, going along 
this neat suburban avenue full of maples 
the mark of my hand a blush on my son's cheek. 



--for paul metcalf
a linear projection a route. it crosses 
the ocean in many ships. arriving in the new   
land, it cuts through and down forests and it   
keeps moving. terrain rock, weaponry.   
dark trees, mastery. grass, to yield. earth,   
reproachful. fox, bear, coon, wildcat   
prowl gloomily, it kills them, it skins them,   
its language alters, no account varmint, its 
teeth set, nothing defeats its obsession, it becomes   
a snake in the reedy river. spits and prays,   
keeps moving. behind it, a steel track. cold,   
permanent. not permanent. it will decay. this   
does not matter, it does not actually care, 
murdering the buffalo, driving the laggard regiments,   
the caring was a necessary myth, an eagle like   
a speck in heaven dives. the line believes   
that the entire wrinkled mountain range is the   
eagle's nest, and everything tumbles in place.   
it buries its balls at wounded knee, it rushes   
gold, it gambles. it buys plastics. another   
ocean stops it. soon, soon, up by its roots,   
severed, irrecoverably torn, that does not matter,   
it decides, perpendicular from here escape. 

a prior circle a mouth. it is nowhere, 
everywhere, swollen, warm. expanding and contracting   
it absorbs and projects children, jungles, 
black shoes, pennies, blood. it speaks 
too many dark, suffering languages. reaching a hand   
toward its throat, you disappear entirely. no 
wonder you fear this bleeding pulse, no wonder. 



they remember the dead who died in the resistance.   
it is in sweet tones that they speak of them.   
they shake their heads, still, after the dinner 

walking back to the car, while an evening snow   
that has started windlessly, white from pearl-gray,   
falls into streets that are already slushy. 

they shake their heads, as we do when there is something   
too strange to believe, 
or as a beast does, stunned by a blow. 

to die in the resistance,   they say, is to fail   
to turn into slush, to escape this ugliness.   
it is at once to leap, a creamy swan, 

upward.   three voices oboe, piano, cello. 
the high one wishes to be pleasing, the middle   
to be practical, the deep to persevere. 

a movie theater lobby in front of them 
throws its light on the sidewalk, like a woman   
swiftly emptying a bucket of water 

the flakes are falling in its yellow light.   
then they pass a caf, its light red neon,   
then a closed pharmacy. 

                                    --they pull sharp air 
into their lungs, a pain that is a pleasure.   
try to live as if there were no god,   
they don't say, but they mean. 

a recollection of purity, a clean 
handkerchief each man feels in his own pocket, 
perturbs them, slows their pace down. now they have seen 

a yellow stain on a pile of old snow 
between two parked cars, where a man has peed   
the resistance. the falling flakes, falling 

on the men's hats. and now 
the snow grows heavier, falls on their stooping shoulders. 



boil over--it's what the nerves do,   
watch them seethe when stimulated, 

murmurs the man at the stove   
to the one at the fridge-- 

watch that electric impulse that finally makes them   
fume and fizz at either 

frayed end. if you could grasp a bundle 
of nerves in your fist like a jumper cable, and sense that 

python's writhe, or a garden hose when the pressure's   
high and it wilfully weaves about 

trying its best to get away from you-- 
you'd see how nothing is passive, 

we're all--i mean from our elephant sun, ejaculant   
great-grandfather, cascading down 

to weightless   
unstoppable neutrinos 

leaving their silvery trace   
in vacuum chambers, in 

effervescent lines, twisted   
madly in our madhouse jackets, 

rules, laws, which we are seething to break   
though to rupture them might be of course to die, 

or, possibly,   
to change 

boil, it's what water 
and everything else teaches.


like a bowerbird trailing a beakful of weeds   
like prize ribbons for the very best 

the lover, producer   
of another's pleasure 

he whom her swollen lips await 
might wing through any day of the decade 

a form of health insurance   
for which it is never too late 

titanic, silver brush 
hindenburg, of exploding cigars a climax 

the watery below, the fiery above 
ashes of print between--pigment between 


if the crippled woman were to descend   
from her bed, her fortress beyond midnight 

downstairs nudestaircase to the kitchen   
naked to sit at the table writingthinking 

she might hear the washer spin like a full orchestra   
complete a cycle like a train crash 

before the fiend would stare through the window   
step smoothly into the kitchen, stop some clocks. 

envy shapes a fig tree in one's breast,   
that is, bluntly to say, a cancer, 

that is to say 
in a mind, a fertile windy field. a murdered child. 

well then, fear, primarily of falling.   
ebony surf toils on the beach, a glaze 

at the same moment i am from a cliff falling   
the kitchen fiend removes his dior tie 

places his hand over the woman's   
and softly says i am the lover. 


now if the crippled woman began to dance   
to pirouette, to rumba 

growling for her child 
her burning page, the devil would be shamed 

materialism is not for everyone  religion is   
the extension of politics by other means 

would disembody like a wicked smoke   
back to the status of myth 

away he'd streak, blue, into the-- 
o faun, we would finally call, farewell 

o faun, we would faintly faintly call   
o faun, we would, we would fondly-- 

she does not dance. she does not wish   
to produce another's pleasure. 

they have torn her apart   
into beige rectangles.


music is most sovereign because more than anything  else, rhythm and harmony find their way to the inmost  soul and take strongest hold upon it, bringing with  them and imparting grace. --plato, the republic  the cranes are flying ... --chekhov 
and here it comes around the world, 
in chicago, petersburg, tokyo, the dancers 
hit the floor running the communal dancefloor 

here, there, at intervals, sometimes paved,   
sometimes rotted linoleum awash in beer,   
sometimes a field across which the dancers streak 

like violets across grass, sometimes packed dirt   
in a township of corrugated metal roofs 
and what was once prescribed ritual, the profuse 

strains of premeditated art, is now improvisation,   
the desperately new, where to the sine-curved   
yelps and spasms of police sirens outside 

the club, a spasmodic feedback ululates   
the death and cremation of history,   
until a boy whose hair is purple spikes, 

and a girl wearing a skull 
that wants to say i'm cool but i'm in pain, 
get up and dance together, sort of, age thirteen. 

young allegorists, they'll mime motions 
of shootouts, of tortured ones in basements,   
of cold insinuations before sex 

between enemies, the jubilance of the criminal.   
the girl tosses her head and dances   
the shoplifter's meanness and self-betrayal 

for a pair of stockings, a scarf, a perfume,   
the boy dances stealing the truck,   
shooting his father. 

the point is to become a flying viper,   
a diving vulva, the great point 
is experiment, like pollen flinging itself 

into far other habitats, or seed   
that travels a migrant bird's gut   
to be shit overseas. 

the creatures gamble on the whirl of life   
and every adolescent body hot 
enough to sweat it out on the dance floor 

is a laboratory maybe this lipstick, these boots,   
these jeans, these earrings, maybe if i flip   
my hair and vibrate my pelvis 

exactly synched to the band's wildfire noise   
that imitates history's catastrophe   
nuke for nuke, maybe i'll survive, 

maybe we'll all survive. . . . 

at the intersection of poverty and plague 
the planet's children--brave, uncontrollable, juiced   
out of their gourds--invent the sacred dance. 



the first warm day,   
and by mid-afternoon   
the snow is no more   
than a washing 
strewn over the yards, 
the bedding rolled in knots   
and leaking water,   
the white shirts lying   
under the evergreens.   
through the heaviest drifts   
rise autumn's fallen   
bicycles, small carnivals   
of paint and chrome,   
the octopus 
and tilt-a-whirl   
beginning to turn 
in the sun. now children,   
stiffened by winter   
and dressed, somehow,   
like old men, mutter   
and bend to the work   
of building dams. 
but such a spring is brief   
by five o'clock 
the chill of sundown,   
darkness, the blue tvs   
flashing like storms 
in the picture windows,   
the yards gone gray,   
the wet dogs barking   
at nothing. far off   
across the cornfields 
staked for streets and sewers,   
the body of a farmer   
missing since fall 
will show up 
in his garden tomorrow,   
as unexpected 
as a tulip. 



the gravel road rides with a slow gallop   
over the fields, the telephone lines   
streaming behind, its billow of dust   
full of the sparks of redwing blackbirds. 

on either side, those dear old ladies, 
the loosening barns, their little windows   
dulled by cataracts of hay and cobwebs   
hide broken tractors under their skirts. 

so this is nebraska. a sunday   
afternoon july. driving along 
with your hand out squeezing the air,   
a meadowlark waiting on every post. 

behind a shelterbelt of cedars, 
top-deep in hollyhocks, pollen and bees,   
a pickup kicks its fenders off 
and settles back to read the clouds. 

you feel like that you feel like letting   
your tires go flat, like letting the mice   
build a nest in your muffler, like being   
no more than a truck in the weeds, 

clucking with chickens or sticky with honey   
or holding a skinny old man in your lap   
while he watches the road, waiting 
for someone to wave to. you feel like 

waving. you feel like stopping the car 
and dancing around on the road. you wave   
instead and leave your hand out gliding   
larklike over the wheat, over the houses. 




in the naked bed, in plato's cave, 
reflected headlights slowly slid the wall,   
carpenters hammered under the shaded window,   
wind troubled the window curtains all night long,   
a fleet of trucks strained uphill, grinding,   
their freights covered, as usual. 
the ceiling lightened again, the slanting diagram   
slid slowly forth. 
                            hearing the milkman's chop,   
his striving up the stair, the bottle's chink,   
i rose from bed, lit a cigarette, 
and walked to the window. the stony street   
displayed the stillness in which buildings stand,   
the street-lamp's vigil and the horse's patience.   
the winter sky's pure capital 
turned me back to bed with exhausted eyes. 

strangeness grew in the motionless air. the loose   
film grayed. shaking wagons, hooves' waterfalls,   
sounded far off, increasing, louder and nearer.   
a car coughed, starting. morning, softly   
melting the air, lifted the half-covered chair   
from underseas, kindled the looking-glass,   
distinguished the dresser and the white wall.   
the bird called tentatively, whistled, called,   
bubbled and whistled, so perplexed, still wet   
with sleep, affectionate, hungry and cold. so, so,   
o son of man, the ignorant night, the travail   
of early morning, the mystery of beginning   
again and again, 
                         while history is unforgiven.


in musty light, in the thin brown air   
of damp carpet, doll heads and rust,   
beneath long rows of sharp footfalls   
like nails in a lid, an old man stands   
trying on glasses, lifting each pair 
from the box like a glittering fish   
and holding it up to the light 
of a dirty bulb. near him, a heap   
of enameled pans as white as skulls   
looms in the catacomb shadows,   
and old toilets with dry red throats   
cough up bouquets of curtain rods. 

you've seen him somewhere before.   
he's wearing the green leisure suit   
you threw out with the garbage,   
and the christmas tie you hated,   
and the ventilated wingtip shoes   
you found in your father's closet   
and wore as a joke. and the glasses   
which finally fit him, through which   
he looks to see you looking back-- 
two mirrors which flash and glance-- 
are those through which one day 
you too will look down over the years,   
when you have grown old and thin   
and no longer particular, 
and the things you once thought   
you were rid of forever 
have taken you back in their arms. 



it's a kitchen. its curtains fill 
with a morning light so bright   
you can't see beyond its windows   
into the afternoon. a kitchen   
falling through time with its things   
in their places, the dishes jingling   
up in the cupboard, the bucket   
of drinking water rippled as if 
a truck had just gone past, but that truck   
was thirty years. no one's at home   
in this room. its counter is wiped,   
and the dishrag hangs from its nail,   
a dry leaf. in housedresses of mist,   
blue aprons of rain, my grandmother   
moved through this life like a ghost,   
and when she had finished her years,   
she put them all back in their places 
and wiped out the sink, turning her back   
on the rest of us, forever. 



calmly we walk through this april's day,   
metropolitan poetry here and there,   
in the park sit pauper and rentier,   
the screaming children, the motor-car   
fugitive about us, running away,   
between the worker and the millionaire   
number provides all distances,   
it is nineteen thirty-seven now,   
many great dears are taken away,   
what will become of you and me 
this is the school in which we learn ...   
besides the photo and the memory? 
... that time is the fire in which we burn. 

this is the school in which we learn ...   
what is the self amid this blaze? 
what am i now that i was then 
which i shall suffer and act again, 
the theodicy i wrote in my high school days   
restored all life from infancy, 
the children shouting are bright as they run   
this is the school in which they learn ...   
ravished entirely in their passing play 
... that time is the fire in which they burn. 

avid its rush, that reeling blaze 
where is my father and eleanor? 
not where are they now, dead seven years,   
but what they were then? 
                                     no more? no more? 
from nineteen-fourteen to the present day,   
bert spira and rhoda consume, consume 
not where they are now where are they now?   
but what they were then, both beautiful 

each minute bursts in the burning room,   
the great globe reels in the solar fire,   
spinning the trivial and unique away. 
how all things flash how all things flare   
what am i now that i was then?   
may memory restore again and again   
the smallest color of the smallest day   
time is the school in which we learn,   
time is the fire in which we burn.


beside the highway, the giant slide 
with its rusty undulations lifts 
out of the weeds. it hasn't been used   
for a generation. the ticket booth 
tilts to that side where the nickels shifted   
over the years. a chain link fence keeps out   
the children and drunks. blue morning glories   
climb halfway up the stairs, bright clusters   
of laughter. call it a passing fancy, 
this slide that nobody slides down now.   
those screams have all gone east 
on a wind that will never stop blowing   
down from the rockies and over the plains,   
where things catch on for a little while,   
bright leaves in a fence, and then are gone. 




dogs are shakespearean, children are strangers. 
let freud and wordsworth discuss the child, 
angels and platonists shall judge the dog, 
the running dog, who paused, distending nostrils, 
then barked and wailed the boy who pinched his sister,   
the little girl who sang the song from twelfth night,   
as if she understood the wind and rain, 
the dog who moaned, hearing the violins in concert.   
--o i am sad when i see dogs or children 
for they are strangers, they are shakespearean. 

tell us, freud, can it be that lovely children   
have merely ugly dreams of natural functions?   
and you, too, wordsworth, are children truly   
clouded with glory, learned in dark nature?   
the dog in humble inquiry along the ground,   
the child who credits dreams and fears the dark,   
know more and less than you they know full well   
nor dream nor childhood answer questions well   
you too are strangers, children are shakespearean. 

regard the child, regard the animal,   
welcome strangers, but study daily things,   
knowing that heaven and hell surround us,   
but this, this which we say before we're sorry,   
this which we live behind our unseen faces,   
is neither dream, nor childhood, neither   
myth, nor landscape, final, nor finished,   
for we are incomplete and know no future,   
and we are howling or dancing out our souls   
in beating syllables before the curtain   
we are shakespearean, we are strangers.


when i wake now it's below ocherous, saw-ridged 
pine beams. haze streaks all three windows. i look up 
at the dog-eared, glossy magazine photo
i've taken with me for years. it gets tacked
like a claim to some new wall in the next place--
bill russell & wilt chamberlain, one on one
the final game of the  nba championship,
two hard men snapped elbowing & snatching at a basketball 
as if it were a moment one of them might stay inside 
forever. i was with
my father the night that game played
on a fuzzy color television, in a jammed fall river bar. 
seagram & beer chasers for hoarse ex-jocks,
smoke rifting the air. a drunk called him tiger
and asked about the year he'd made all-state guard--
point man, ball-hawk, pacer. something he rarely spoke 
of, & almost always with a gruff mix of impatience 
and shyness. each year,
days painting suburban tract houses & fighting 
with contractors followed by
night shifts at the fire station
followed by his kids swarming at breakfast
and my mother trying to stay out of his way,
each of the many stone-hard moments between  & --
they made up a city of granite mills
by a slate & blue river. that town was my father's 
life, & still is. if he felt cheated by it,
by its fate for him,
to bear that disappointment, he kept it secret. 
                                                                      that
night, when he stared deep into a drunk's memory, 
he frowned. he said nothing. he twisted on the stool, 
and ordered this guy a beer.
whatever my father & i have in common
is mostly silence. and anger that keeps twisting 
back on itself, though not before it ruins,
often, even something simple
as a walk in the dunes at a warm beach.
but what we share too is a love so awkward
that it explains, with unreasoning perfection,
why we still can't speak
easily to each other, about the past or anything else,
and why i wake this far from the place where i grew up, 
while the wall above me claims now
nothing has changed & all is different.


the withness of the body
the heavy bear who goes with me,   
a manifold honey to smear his face,   
clumsy and lumbering here and there,   
the central ton of every place,   
the hungry beating brutish one   
in love with candy, anger, and sleep,   
crazy factotum, dishevelling all,   
climbs the building, kicks the football,   
boxes his brother in the hate-ridden city. 

breathing at my side, that heavy animal,   
that heavy bear who sleeps with me,   
howls in his sleep for a world of sugar,   
a sweetness intimate as the water's clasp,   
howls in his sleep because the tight-rope   
trembles and shows the darkness beneath.   
--the strutting show-off is terrified,   
dressed in his dress-suit, bulging his pants,   
trembles to think that his quivering meat   
must finally wince to nothing at all. 

that inescapable animal walks with me, 
has followed me since the black womb held,   
moves where i move, distorting my gesture,   
a caricature, a swollen shadow, 
a stupid clown of the spirit's motive,   
perplexes and affronts with his own darkness,   
the secret life of belly and bone, 
opaque, too near, my private, yet unknown,   
stretches to embrace the very dear 
with whom i would walk without him near,   
touches her grossly, although a word 
would bare my heart and make me clear,   
stumbles, flounders, and strives to be fed   
dragging me with him in his mouthing care,   
amid the hundred million of his kind,   
the scrimmage of appetite everywhere.


dawn comes later and later now,   
and i, who only a month ago 
could sit with coffee every morning   
watching the light walk down the hill   
to the edge of the pond and place   
a doe there, shyly drinking, 

then see the light step out upon   
the water, sowing reflections   
to either side--a garden 
of trees that grew as if by magic-- 
now see no more than my face,   
mirrored by darkness, pale and odd, 

startled by time. while i slept,   
night in its thick winter jacket   
bridled the doe with a twist 
of wet leaves and led her away, 
then brought its black horse with harness   
that creaked like a cricket, and turned 

the water garden under. i woke,   
and at the waiting window found   
the curtains open to my open face   
beyond me, darkness. and i, 
who only wished to keep looking out,   
must now keep looking in. 



the mind is an ancient and famous capital 

the mind is a city like london, 
smoky and populous it is a capital 
like rome, ruined and eternal, 
marked by the monuments which no one 
now remembers. for the mind, like rome, contains   
catacombs, aqueducts, amphitheatres, palaces, 
churches and equestrian statues, fallen, broken or soiled.   
the mind possesses and is possessed by all the ruins   
of every haunted, hunted generation's celebration. 

call us what you will we are made such by love.   
we are such studs as dreams are made on, and   
our little lives are ruled by the gods, by pan, 
piping of all, seeking to grasp or grasping 
all of the grapes and by the bow-and-arrow god, 
cupid, piercing the heart through, suddenly and forever. 

dusk we are, to dusk returning, after the burbing,   
after the gold fall, the fallen ash, the bronze,   
scattered and rotten, after the white null statues which   
are winter, sleep, and nothingness when   
will the houselights of the universe 
light up and blaze? 
                            for it is not the sea 
which murmurs in a shell, 
and it is not only heart, at harp o'clock,   
it is the dread terror of the uncontrollable   
horses of the apocalypse, running in wild dread   
toward arcturus--and returning as suddenly ... 


the fear and dread of the mind of the others 

--the others were the despots of despair-- 

the river's freshness sailed from unknown sources-- 

... they snickered giggled, laughed aloud at last,   
they mocked and marvelled at the statue which was   
a caricature, as strained and stiff, and yet   
a statue of self-love--since self-love was 
to them, truly my true love, how, then, was i a stillness of nervousness   
so nervous a caricature did they suppose   
self-love was unrequited, or betrayed? 
they thought i had fallen in love with my own face,   
and this belief became the night-like obstacle   
to understanding all my unbroken suffering,   
my studious self-regard, the pain of hope,   
the torment of possibility 
how then could i have expected them to see me   
as i saw myself, within my gaze, or see 
that being thus seemed as a toad, a frog, a wen, a mole.   
knowing their certainty that i was only 
a monument, a monster who had fallen in love   
with himself alone, how could i have 
told them what was in me, within my heart, trembling and passionate   
within the labyrinth and caves of my mind, which is   
like every mind partly or wholly hidden from itself?   
the words for what is in my heart and in my mind   
do not exist. but i must seek and search to find   
amid the vines and orchards of the vivid world of day   
approximate images, imaginary parallels 
for what is my heart and dark within my mind   
comparisons and mere metaphors for all 
of them are substitutes, both counterfeit and vague 
they are, at most, deceptive resemblances, 
false in their very likeness, like the sons 
who are alike and kin and more unlike and false 
because they seem the father's very self but each one is   
--although begotten by the same forbears--himself, 
the unique self, each one is unique, like every other one,   
and everything, older or younger, nevertheless 
a passionate nonesuch who has before has been. 
do you hear, do you see? do you understand me now, and how   
the words for what is my heart do not exist? 


the river was the emblem of all beauty   all 

... 
the river was the abundant belly of beauty itself   
the river was the dream space where i walked, 
the river was itself and yet it was--flowing and freshening-- 
a self anew, another self, or self renewed 
at every tick of eternity, and by each glint of light   
mounting or sparkling, descending to shade and black   
--had i but told them my heart, told how it was 
taunted at noon and pacified at dusk, at starfall midnight   
strong in hope once more, ever in eagerness 
jumping like joy, would they have heard? how could they? 
how, when what they knew was, like the grass, 
simple and certain, known through the truth of touch, another form and fountain of falsehood's fecundity-- 
gazing upon their faces as they gazed 
could they have seen my faces as whores who are   
holy and deified as priestesses of hope 
                         --the sacred virgins of futurity-- 
promising dear divinity precisely because   
they were disfigured ducks who might become 
and be, and ever beloved, white swans, noble and beautiful. 
                                    could they have seen how my faces were 
bonfires of worship and vigil, blazes of adoration and hope   
--surely they would have laughed again, renewed their scorn,   
giggled and snickered, cruel. surely have said 
this is the puerile mania of the obsessed, 
the living logic of the lunatic 
i was the statue of their merriment, 
dead and a death, pharoah and monster forsaken and lost. 

... 
my faces were my apes my apes became   
performers in the sundays of their parks,   
buffoons or clowns in the farce or comedy 
when they took pleasure in knowing that they were not like me. 

... 
i waited like obsession in solitude 
the sun's white terror tore and roared at me,   
the moonlight, almond white, at night,   
whether awake or sleeping, arrested me   
and sang, softly, haunted, unlike the sun 
but as the sun. withheld from me or took away   
despair or peace, making me once more 
with thought of what had never been before----


 

the children of the czar   
played with a bouncing ball 

in the may morning, in the czar's garden,   
tossing it back and forth. 

it fell among the flowerbeds   
or fled to the north gate. 

a daylight moon hung up 
in the western sky, bald white. 

like papa's face, said sister,   
hurling the white ball forth. 


        

while i ate a baked potato   
six thousand miles apart, 

in brooklyn, in ,   
aged two, irrational. 

when franklin d. roosevelt   
was an arrow collar ad. 

o nicholas alas alas 
my grandfather coughed in your army, 

hid in a wine-stinking barrel,   
for three days in bucharest 

then left for america 
to become a king himself. 


        

i am my father's father, 
you are your children's guilt. 

in history's pity and terror   
the child is aeneas again 

troy is in the nursery, 
the rocking horse is on fire. 

child labor the child must carry   
his fathers on his back. 

but seeing that so much is past   
and that history has no ruth 

for the individual, 
who drinks tea, who catches cold, 

let anger be general 
i hate an abstract thing. 


        

brother and sister bounced   
the bounding, unbroken ball, 

the shattering sun fell down   
like swords upon their play, 

moving eastward among the stars   
toward february and october. 

but the maywind brushed their cheeks   
like a mother watching sleep, 

and if for a moment they fight   
over the bouncing ball 

and sister pinches brother   
and brother kicks her shins, 

well the heart of man is known   
it is a cactus bloom. 


        

the ground on which the ball bounces   
is another bouncing ball. 

the wheeling, whirling world   
makes no will glad. 

spinning in its spotlight darkness,   
it is too big for their hands. 

a pitiless, purposeless thing,   
arbitrary and unspent, 

made for no play, for no children,   
but chasing only itself. 

the innocent are overtaken,   
they are not innocent. 

they are their father's fathers, 
the past is inevitable. 


        

now, in another october   
of this tragic star, 

i see my second year,   
i eat my baked potato. 

it is my buttered world, 
but, poked by my unlearned hand, 

it falls from the highchair down   
and i begin to howl. 

and i see the ball roll under   
the iron gate which is locked. 

sister is screaming, brother is howling,   
the ball has evaded their will. 

even a bouncing ball   
is uncontrollable, 

and is under the garden wall.   
i am overtaken by terror 

thinking of my father's fathers,   
and of my own will.


jeremiah dickson was a true-blue american, 
for he was a little boy who understood america, for he felt that he must 
think about everything because that's all there is to think about,   
knowing immediately the intimacy of truth and comedy,   
knowing intuitively how a sense of humor was a necessity   
for one and for all who live in america. thus, natively, and   
naturally when on an april sunday in an ice cream parlor jeremiah   
was requested to choose between a chocolate sundae and a banana split 
he answered unhesitatingly, having no need to think of it 
being a true-blue american, determined to continue as he began   
rejecting the either-or of kierkegaard, and many another european   
refusing to accept alternatives, refusing to believe the choice of between 
rejecting selection denying dilemma electing absolute affirmation knowing 
         in his breast 
                  the infinite and the gold 
                  of the endless frontier, the deathless west. 

both i will have them both declared this true-blue american   
in cambridge, massachusetts, on an april sunday, instructed 
         by the great department stores, by the five-and-ten, 
taught by christmas, by the circus, by the vulgarity and grandeur of 
         niagara falls and the grand canyon, 
tutored by the grandeur, vulgarity, and infinite appetite gratified and   
         shining in the darkness, of the light 
on saturdays at the double bills of the moon pictures, 
the consummation of the advertisements of the imagination of the light 
which is as it was--the infinite belief in infinite hope--of columbus,   
         barnum, edison, and jeremiah dickson.


after his ham & cheese in the drape factory cafeteria,   
having slipped by the bald shipping foreman   
to ride a rattling elevator to the attic 
where doves flicker into the massive eaves 
and where piled boxes of out-of-style 
cotton and lace won't ever be 
decorating anyone's sun parlor windows. 
having dozed off in that hideout he fixed 
between five four-by-six cardboard storage cartons   
while the rest of us pack mediterranean dreams   
and colonial ruffles and drapes colored like moons,   
and he wakes lost-- 
shot through 
into a world of unlocked unlocking light-- 
suddenly he knows where he is and feels half nuts   
and feels like killing some pigeons with a slingshot. 

that's all, and that's why he pokes 
his calloused fingers into the broken machinery,   
hunting for loose nuts a half inch wide-- 
five greasy cold ones that warm in his pocket-- 
and yanks back the snag-cut strip of inner tube   
with a nut snug at the curve to snap it   
at the soft chest of a dopey bird. 
then the noise of pigeons flopping down   
to creosoted hardwood, and then a grin   
the guy gives me & all his other pals later.   
and afternoon tightens down on all   
our shoulders, until the shift whistle   
blasts, blowing through the plant like air   
through lace. as it always has, as it does.   
that bright. that stunned.


when i fall asleep, and even during sleep, 
i hear, quite distinctly, voices speaking 
whole phrases, commonplace and trivial,   
having no relation to my affairs.   

dear mother, is any time left to us 
in which to be happy? my debts are immense. 
my bank account is subject to the court's judgment. 
i know nothing. i cannot know anything.   
i have lost the ability to make an effort. 
but now as before my love for you increases.   
you are always armed to stone me, always   
it is true. it dates from childhood. 

for the first time in my long life 
i am almost happy. the book, almost finished,   
almost seems good. it will endure, a monument 
to my obsessions, my hatred, my disgust.   

debts and inquietude persist and weaken me.   
satan glides before me, saying sweetly 
rest for a day you can rest and play today.   
tonight you will work. when night comes,   
my mind, terrified by the arrears, 
bored by sadness, paralyzed by impotence,   
promises tomorrow i will tomorrow. 
tomorrow the same comedy enacts itself   
with the same resolution, the same weakness.   

i am sick of this life of furnished rooms.   
i am sick of having colds and headaches   
you know my strange life. every day brings 
its quota of wrath. you little know 
a poet's life, dear mother i must write poems,   
the most fatiguing of occupations. 

i am sad this morning. do not reproach me. 
i write from a caf near the post office, 
amid the click of billiard balls, the clatter of dishes,   
the pounding of my heart. i have been asked to write   
a history of caricature. i have been asked to write   
a history of sculpture. shall i write a history 
of the caricatures of the sculptures of you in my heart? 

although it costs you countless agony, 
although you cannot believe it necessary, 
and doubt that the sum is accurate, 
please send me money enough for at least three weeks.


when i was a young man, i loved to write poems   
         and i called a spade a spade 
and the only only thing that made me sing   
         was to lift the masks at the masquerade.   
i took them off my own face, 
         i took them off others too 
and the only only wrong in all my song 
         was the view that i knew what was true. 

now i am older and tireder too 
         and the tasks with the masks are quite trying.   
i'd gladly gladly stop if i only only knew 
         a better way to keep from lying,   
and not get nervous and blue 
         when i said something quite untrue   
i looked all around and all over 
         to find something else to do   
i tried to be less romantic 
         i tried to be less starry-eyed too   
but i only got mixed up and frantic 
         forgetting what was false and what was true. 

but tonight i am going to the masked ball, 
         because it has occurred to me 
that the masks are more true than the faces 
         --perhaps this too is poetry? 
i no longer yearn to be nave and stern 
         and masked balls fascinate me 
now that i know that most falsehoods are true 
         perhaps i can join the charade?   
this is, at any rate, my new and true view 
         let live and believe, i say. 
the only only thing is to believe in everything 
         it's more fun and safer that way


she had turned her face up into 
a rain of light, and came on smiling. 

the light trickled down her forehead   
and into her eyes. it ran down 

into the neck of her sweatshirt 
and wet the white tops of her breasts. 

her brown shoes splashed on 
into the light. the moment was like 

a circus wagon rolling before her 
through puddles of light, a cage on wheels, 

and she walked fast behind it,   
exuberant, curious, pushing her cane 

through the bars, poking and prodding,   
while the world cowered back in a corner. 



--for george shelton
sometimes everything feels like a trick. 
some days things seem to have been stolen from you.   
cash to pay the bills, your sense of humor, friendship.   
you could almost believe those are what you look for 
as you walk around your neighborhood. but, no, instead, you get   
splashes of zinnias against stucco, cactus wrens,   
a pack of kids who ignore the sodium amber streetlights   
which just stuttered on, because it means their mothers   
want them home right this minute. and, on the corner variety   
store's wall, a crude, sun-washed mural of the angel gabriel   
defaced by thick black sideburns so he looks like a street punk,   
a strutting cholo, so he seems the only creature on earth   
who hasn't heard the news that everything can be lost.   
his strong upper arms curving naked and graceful   
as the tan thighs of a slender, athletic girl. 
a girl he's after, though she's gotten bored waiting 
on the stoop and watching the sun set behind the foothills.   
sky reddening until it slams into a blue that blesses   
anyone oblivious to all the negations, 
including the one, pal, where you think it's possible   
to step out of your heart and leave it empty as   
an egg shell or a cardboard box. 

when you finally return home 
the tint of sky more or less matches the flash 
of a thrush as it swoops from limb to branch, 
acacia to willow. standing at the kitchen counter, 
you pick through a carton of strawberries. 
good juicy ones from the moldy and over-ripe. 
choices that are easy. what do you trust anymore? 
the aproned man in the mercado said california strawberries, 
they're the best this time of year. in bed, later, 
you remember the grocer, round belly under his apron,   
but as you start, nearly asleep, to tell your wife about him,   
how he talked about his deals, she starts 
reading aloud from a tattered bird guide, that the wood thrush   
is essentially useful and worthwhile. 
what is worthwhile?                      now, remember.


from a certain point onward there is no longer any turning back. that is the point that must be reached. 
franz kafka
father 
on these occasions, the feelings surprise,   
spontaneous as rain, and they compel   
explicitness, embarrassed eyes---- 


son 
father, you're not polonius, you're reticent,   
but sure. i can already tell 
the unction and falsetto of the sentiment   
which gratifies the facile mouth, but springs   
from no felt, had, and wholly known things. 


father 
you must let me tell you what you fear 
when you wake up from sleep, still drunk with sleep   
you are afraid of time and its slow drip, 
like melting ice, like smoke upon the air 
in february's glittering sunny day. 
your guilt is nameless, because its name is time,   
because its name is death. but you can stop 
time as it dribbles from you, drop by drop. 


son 
but i thought time was full of promises,   
even as now, the emotion of going away---- 


father 
that is the first of all its menaces, 
the lure of a future different from today   
all of us always are turning away 
to the cinema and asia. all of us go   
to one indeterminate nothing. 


son 
                                          must it be so? 
i question the sentiment you give to me, 
as premature, not to be given, learned alone   
when experience shrinks upon the chilling bone.   
i would be sudden now and rash in joy, 
as if i lived forever, the future my toy. 
time is a dancing fire at twenty-one, 
singing and shouting and drinking to the sun,   
powerful at the wheel of a motor-car, 
not thinking of death which is foreign and far. 


father 
if time flowed from your will and were a feast   
i would be wrong to question your zest.   
but each age betrays the same weak shape.   
each moment is dying. you will try to escape   
from melting time and your dissipating soul   
by hiding your head in a warm and dark hole.   
see the evasions which so many don, 
to flee the guilt of time they become one,   
that is, the one number among masses,   
the one anonymous in the audience, 
the one expressionless in the subway, 
in the subway evening among so many faces,   
the one who reads the daily newspaper,   
separate from actor and act, a member 
of public opinion, never involved. 
integrated in the revery of a fine cigar,   
fleeing to childhood at the symphony concert,   
buying sleep at the drugstore, grandeur   
at the band concert, hawaii 
on the screen, and everywhere a specious splendor   
one, when he is sad, has something to eat,   
an ice cream soda, a toasted sandwich,   
or has his teeth fixed, but can always retreat   
from the actual pain, and dream of the rich.   
this is what one does, what one becomes   
because one is afraid to be alone, 
each with his own death in the lonely room.   
but there is a stay. you can stop 
time as it dribbles from you, drop by drop. 


son 
now i am afraid. what is there to be known? 


father 
guilt, guilt of time, nameless guilt. 
grasp firmly your fear, thus grasping your self,   
your actual will. stand in mastery, 
keeping time in you, its terrifying mystery. 
face yourself, constantly go back 
to what you were, your own history. 
you are always in debt. do not forget 
the dream postponed which would not quickly get   
pleasure immediate as drink, but takes 
the travail of building, patience with means. 
see the wart on your face and on your friend's face,   
on your friend's face and indeed on your own face.   
the loveliest woman sweats, the animal stains   
the ideal which is with us like the sky ... 


son 
because of that, some laugh, and others cry. 


father 
do not look past and turn away your face.   
you cannot depart and take another name,   
nor go to sleep with lies. always the same,   
always the same self from the ashes of sleep   
returns with its memories, always, always, 
the phoenix with eight hundred thousand memories 


son 
what must i do that is most difficult? 


father 
you must meet your death face to face,   
you must, like one in an old play, 
decide, once for all, your heart's place.   
love, power, and fame stand on an absolute   
under the formless night and the brilliant day,   
the searching violin, the piercing flute.   
absolute venus and caesar fade at that edge,   
hanging from the fiftieth-story ledge, 
or diminished in bed when the nurse presses   
her sickening unguents and her cold compresses.   
when the news is certain, surpassing fear, 
you touch the wound, the priceless, the most dear.   
there in death's shadow, you comprehend   
the irreducible wish, world without end. 


son 
i begin to understand the reason for evasion,   
i cannot partake of your difficult vision. 


father 
begin to understand the first decision.   
hamlet is the example only dying 
did he take up his manhood, the dead's burden,   
done with evasion, done with sighing,   
done with revery. 
                           decide that you are dying   
because time is in you, ineluctable   
as shadow, named by no syllable.   
act in that shadow, as if death were now   
your own self acts then, then you know. 


son 
my father has taught me to be serious. 


father 
be guilty of yourself in the full looking-glass.


i have seen the brown recluse spider   
run with a net in her hand, or rather,   
what resembled a net, what resembled 
a hand. she ran down the gleaming white floor   
of the bathtub, trailing a frail swirl   
of hair, and in it the hull of a beetle   
lay woven. the hair was my wife's,   
long and dark, a few loose strands, a curl   
she might idly have turned on a finger,   
she might idly have twisted, speaking to me,   
and the legs of the beetle were broken. 



written on clapboard or asbestos siding, the cartoony   
spray-paint signatures of apollo and zeus, 
two home boys out bombing last night in thick fog. 
fog near the shade of pearls. except they didn't see the mist   
that way, glad for their thin leather gloves. 
wind raw at the wide avenue, so they cut 
from there to here. 
                              even if this is in the past 
tense, tense of the totally chilled-out, 
even if they argued here over krylon blue or candy-apple red,   
that doesn't mean they knocked-off and streaked home then.   
and if i saw fog the shade of pearls 
it doesn't mean my heart in its own corrosive and healing fog   
can't tug on thin leather gloves and stand 
in front of a wall, pissing off the fates 
and whoever else owns that wall. whoever owns it   
means less than the dry, fallen leaves of eucalyptus   
blown crackling over tar and concrete 
and sounding, when you shut your eyes, like every tree   
bursting into leaf for the first time, speeded-up 
like the first minute of the world.


long ago we quit lifting our heels 
like the others--horse, dog, and tiger-- 
though we thrill to their speed 
as they flee. even the mouse 
bearing the great weight of a nugget   
of dog food is enviably graceful. 
there is little spring to our walk, 
we are so burdened with responsibility,   
all of the disciplinary actions 
that have fallen to us, the punishments,   
the killings, and all with our feet 
bound stiff in the skins of the conquered.   
but sometimes, in the early hours,   
we can feel what it must have been like   
to be one of them, up on our toes, 
stealing past doors where others are sleeping,   
and suddenly able to see in the dark. 



each could picture probably 
with great care his brother drawing   
the corded string of a watered silk bag 
and mumbling to basho above the keepsake   
pay your respects to mother's white hair   
now your eyebrows look a little white too 
but all have turned instead to watch this child   
a girl my daughter simone 
an astute migrant 
skimming the stream of days 
toted wherever she wants 
to eat the dirt of inattentive towns   
to arm wrestle as with 
the blind & steal a stoic 
shipping him home-- 
all have turned & run to her because   
she has a spider on her neck she has   
seen herself 
though blindfolded by a cloud 
the sun is a yellowjacket 
drowning in a cup of coffee she carries   
a spider in her hair 
blond & blonder dear river. 



they have set aside their black tin boxes,   
scratched and dented, 
spattered with drops of pink and blue   
and their dried-up, rolled-up tubes   
of alizarin crimson, chrome green,   
zinc white, and ultramarine 
their vials half full of gold powder   
stubs of wax pencils 
frayed brushes with tooth-bitten shafts   
and have gone in fashion and with grace   
into the clouds of loose, lush roses,   
narcissus, pansies, columbine,   
on teapots, chocolate pots, 
saucers and cups, the good haviland dishes   
spread like a garden 
on the white lace sunday cloth,   
as if their souls were bees 
and the world had been nothing but flowers. 




now that everything seems so persuasive   
you will go on changing      as always   
it has always been the case with you   
whether you knew it or not      ever since   
that morning in the swamp      that sunday   
a sunless windy morning      when   
right in front of you      a fat hive dropped   
unbidden      out of a blackened tree   
a tupelo      and where it fell      the water   
was shallow      eighteen inches at most   
but in it      one hundred & fifty-six wasps   
drowned      so      no      you are not 
finished      your apprenticeship is not yet over   
you have fallen in love      inadvertently      you   
are the bride-to-be      and now      having   
dressed yourself in the gown      for practice   
you must stand before a mirror   
in the upper right-hand corner of   
which      all of a sudden      a courtroom   
will appear      the litigants judge & jury   
suspended there      in midair      a news   
bulletin      the reporter's face reflected   
from a portable television far across   
the room      the sound turned down   
the litigants looking tense      or bored   
the whole crew of them a little   
self-conscious      like characters who have 
just recently been conjured      though somewhat   
incompletely      by a staff of studio writers   
in century city      california 
in a field off a vermont road      later   
this week      you'll listen to a car ticking 
as it cools      the sound of the engine   
blending with the cicadas in tall bluegrass   
floating past      as in a dream then   
you will finger the veil & lift 
your mother & father long ago set aside   
in a folder for silences & song 
you'll waken      almost immediately   
reborn      you will have lifted the veil   
though of course      sooner or later      farther   
down the line      that stranger      the one   
with whom you spend so much time   
in your mind      talking      he will reveal   
he is your brother      and what 
will you have to say to him then      when   
as he must      he asks if you had 
allowed yourself to lead a happy life   
in spite of the fact your parents 
had not      what is it you will tell him   
what answer can you give? 



it seemed those rose-pink dishes   
she kept for special company   
were always cold, brought down   
from the shelf in jingling stacks,   
the plates like the panes of ice   
she broke from the water bucket   
winter mornings, the flaring cups   
like tulips that opened too early 
and got bitten by frost. they chilled   
the coffee no matter how quickly   
you drank, while a heavy 
everyday mug would have kept   
a splash hot for the better 
part of a conversation. it was hard   
to hold up your end of the gossip   
with your coffee cold, but it was   
a special occasion, just the same,   
to sit at her kitchen table 
and sip the bitter percolation 
of the past week's rumors from cups   
it had taken a year to collect   
at the grocery, with one piece free   
for each five pounds of flour. 



it is  in new york a friday 
three days after bastille day, yes 
it is  and i go get a shoeshine 
because i will get off the  in easthampton   
at  and then go straight to dinner 
and i don't know the people who will feed me 

i walk up the muggy street beginning to sun   
and have a hamburger and a malted and buy 
an ugly new world writing to see what the poets   
in ghana are doing these days 
                                                        i go on to the bank 
and miss stillwagon first name linda i once heard   
doesn't even look up my balance for once in her life   
and in the golden griffin i get a little verlaine   
for patsy with drawings by bonnard although i do   
think of hesiod, trans. richmond lattimore or   
brendan behan's new play or le balcon or les ngres 
of genet, but i don't, i stick with verlaine 
after practically going to sleep with quandariness 

and for mike i just stroll into the park lane 
liquor store and ask for a bottle of strega and   
then i go back where i came from to th avenue   
and the tobacconist in the ziegfeld theatre and   
casually ask for a carton of gauloises and a carton 
of picayunes, and a new york post with her face on it 

and i am sweating a lot by now and thinking of 
leaning on the john door in the  spot 
while she whispered a song along the keyboard 
to mal waldron and everyone and i stopped breathing


the days are dog-eared, the edges torn,   
ragged--like those pages   
i ripped once out of library books, 

for their photos 
of vallejo and bootless robert johnson.   
a fine needs paying now 

it's true, but   
not by me. 
i am no more guilty 

than that thrush is 
who sits there stripping moss   
off the wet bark of a tree. 

a red fleck, like his, glows 
at the back of my head--a beauty mark,   
left by the brain's after-jets. 

i would not wish for the three brains   
robert required 
to double-clutch his guitar 

and chase those sounds he had to know   
led down 
and into a troubled dusky river, always. 

three brains did johnson no earthly good,   
neither his nor vallejo's  &  
worked right exactly--o bunglers, 

o banged-up pans of disaster 
crying for days, said cesar, & singing for months.   
how can i be so strong some times, 

at others weak? i wish to be free, 
but free to do what? to leave myself behind?   
to switch channels remotely? 

better to sing. 
not like the bird, but as they sang,   
cesar & robert-- 

with the shocked & seeded   
sweetness of an apple 
split open by a meat cleaver.


sunlight fades 
the storefront full of magazines. 
month to month 
they boss us--the covers, 
they tell us 
that if we want to get happy & alluring   
real happy, alluring sexually 
we must for goddamn sure 
take up the breeding of jack russell terriers,   
or else dig 
ourselves 
a little backyard fishpond. 

days of fish, days of dog, days of sex-- 
in that order, necessarily. 

in the sun 
all the titles are trying 
to vanish--phrases like trout pond 
diluted, the -point sans serif, inked-red   
passion bleached now, apathetic, ghostly-- 
words that want my attention   
like movers on the street lugging mirrors, 
a moment when i seem to   
come toward myself & then   
i'm gone 
too. i am not 
a greedy man. all i want 
is to be a visitor to this life.


from the tower window 
the moon 
draws a silver maple's shadow 
across a spangled lawn 
                                  horses 
rear, manes lashing the air, 
front legs floating. 
                              half monarch, 
half shadow, the tree   
aspires to the sky 
one branch, cracked by lightning, 
scrapes the earth.   
                           reflected 
on the grass, bent twigs 
are curved hooves, galloping 
as the moon rises. 

divided it stands 
in wholeness, mourning 
its victories, praising 
the god of trees, the king of horses. 

the tree holds souls 
in a bark prison 
poised like a runner at the starting line-- 
and bolts free, wildly 
pawing the ground those roots lie under.


i wanted to be sure to reach you 
though my ship was on the way it got caught   
in some moorings. i am always tying up   
and then deciding to depart. in storms and   
at sunset, with the metallic coils of the tide   
around my fathomless arms, i am unable   
to understand the forms of my vanity   
or i am hard alee with my polish rudder   
in my hand and the sun sinking. to   
you i offer my hull and the tattered cordage   
of my will. the terrible channels where   
the wind drives me against the brown lips   
of the reeds are not all behind me. yet   
i trust the sanity of my vessel and   
if it sinks, it may well be in answer   
to the reasoning of the eternal voices, 
the waves which have kept me from reaching you.


it's my lunch hour, so i go 
for a walk among the hum-colored   
cabs. first, down the sidewalk   
where laborers feed their dirty   
glistening torsos sandwiches 
and coca-cola, with yellow helmets   
on. they protect them from falling   
bricks, i guess. then onto the   
avenue where skirts are flipping   
above heels and blow up over   
grates. the sun is hot, but the   
cabs stir up the air. i look   
at bargains in wristwatches. there   
are cats playing in sawdust. 
                                          on 
to times square, where the sign 
blows smoke over my head, and higher   
the waterfall pours lightly. a   
negro stands in a doorway with a   
toothpick, languorously agitating.   
a blonde chorus girl clicks he   
smiles and rubs his chin. everything   
suddenly honks it is  of   
a thursday. 
                neon in daylight is a   
great pleasure, as edwin denby would   
write, as are light bulbs in daylight.   
i stop for a cheeseburger at juliet's   
corner. giulietta masina, wife of   
federico fellini,  bell' attrice. 
and chocolate malted. a lady in   
foxes on such a day puts her poodle   
in a cab. 
             there are several puerto   
ricans on the avenue today, which   
makes it beautiful and warm. first   
bunny died, then john latouche,   
then jackson pollock. but is the   
earth as full as life was full, of them?   
and one has eaten and one walks,   
past the magazines with nudes   
and the posters for bullfight and   
the manhattan storage warehouse,   
which they'll soon tear down. i   
used to think they had the armory   
show there. 
                a glass of papaya juice   
and back to work. my heart is in my   
pocket, it is poems by pierre reverdy.


in legends of the jews, lewis ginzberg writes that an egyptian princess hung a tapestry woven with diamonds and pearls above king solomon's bed. when the king wanted to rise, he thought he saw stars and, believing it was night, slept on.
scaling ladders with buckets of white enamel, 
i painted the stars and the moon on my windowpanes   
to hold back days and nights. i yanked the telephone 
and stopped the wooden clock. the weeks a lightning stroke,   
desire turned to love. with my blue diamond, 
i sliced minutes in half and made days vanish, 
fooling the hours. 

                           i became so skillful   
at firmaments that miracles occurred 
a bearded comet moved across the room   
breeding no omens, tearing no major kingdoms   
into small provinces, but there it was,   
reminding us that rock may spin and flare,   
lifting the senses, burning into sight. 

you eased pale hands away i saw your shoulders   
recede through doorways, watched your image fail   
with your famished smile. i left our room 
with dream-filled eyes, and standing in the sun,   
i gazed at bricks and glass and saw, suddenly,   
flashing in stony light, the stars and the moon.


that day i hired a private detective to follow me,   
and could not read his notes. in a tangled grove,   
i hid behind white pines, compressed my body,   
then watched him write, left-handed and myopic,   
under an irish cap, when i asked for help   
from strangers who spoke slavic languages.   
wary, moving ahead, i found a depot, 
watched an immense train churn, haloed in steam,   
and boarded, second class. i had no ticket,   
and my expired passport represented 
a drooping head with unfamiliar eyes. 
unshaken, rows behind, the stranger waited,   
wielding camera and pen. across the border 
i disembarked, but knew he would capture me,   
with soundless footsteps, even on black gravel. 

i tried to recall my crime. i know i am guilty, 
but never why. lawless, i have ignored 
those signs wrong way go back and no way out,   
circles that tell me you are here. i gather 
it is the whispers that explode, the looks 
that make dogs whimper. when i bow in prayer 
i think of love i know i've killed my friends, 
pelting them with a touch--and yet i've heard 
they are alive. besides, that's not the real 

offense. i would cross any path, or trek 
through swamps to find my crime. but even he,   
that bald, insistent man who follows me,   
unsleeping, cannot tell me what i've done.


squinting through eye-slits in our balaclavas,   
we lurch across washington square park   
hunched against the wind, two hooded figures   
caught in the monochrome, carrying sacks 

of fruit, as we've done for years. the frosted, starch- 
stiff sycamores make a lean christmas tree 
seem to bulk larger, tilted under the arch 
and still lit in three colors. once in january, 

we found a feather here and stuffed the quill   
in twigs to recall that jay. the musical fountain   
is here, its water gone, a limestone circle 
now. though rap succeeds the bluegrass strains 

we've played in it, new praise evokes old sounds.   
white branches mimic visions of past storms 
some say they've heard ghosts moan above this ground,   
once a potter's field. no two stones are the same, 

of course the drums, the tawny pears we hold,   
are old masks for new things. still, in a world   
where fretted houses with faades are leveled   
for condominiums, not much has altered 

here. at least it's faithful to imagined 
views. and, after all, we know the sycamore 
will screen the sky in a receding wind. 
now, trekking home through grit that's mounting higher, 

faces upturned to test the whirling snow, 
in new masks, we whistle to make breath-clouds form   
and disappear, and form again, and o,   
my love, there's sun in the crook of your arm.


pardon us for uttering a handful 
of words in any language, so cut loose 
are we from homes, and from his name that is still   
nameless, blessed be he. we raised a prayer house-- 

that is, we broke new wood for one, but some 
tough burned it, snarling carve only stones for the dead. 
damp ground, no fire, no psalm we all remember.   
but tall ships anchor here, and at low tide, 

people with wheat-colored hair look out to sea,   
just as we'd searched for land. pray if you must, 
my father said, and when prayer fails, a story,   
if it is all you have, will do. months past, 

we left recife's forced-worship laws in the year 
of their lord sixteen hundred and fifty-four, for our new   
world, old-country amsterdam. leagues seaward,   
spanish pirates slaughtered our scant crew, 

and all that was left of us friends wheezed 
their last while they ragged us on rose up on deck   
and tossed our bags in the sea. we watched the wake   
turn silver kiddish wine cups, hanging bowls, 

a candelabrum for the promised altar, 
carved pointers. books' pages curled and sank, 
prayer shawls ballooned and, soaking, spiraled downward.   
just as we stared, again we heard swords clank-- 

a french ship, the ste. catherine her prow had shone   
gold on a gray horizon, came to our 
port side and rescued us. in that commotion 
on deck, we crouched below--not out of fear, 

i swear, but stunned by luminous words 
that echoed oddly--beautifully--like lightning   
flickering through palls of thickset clouds.   
a jaunty captain rasped to us in hiding 

where are you bound? 
                                  amsterdam. old country. 
where? 
             amsterdam. 
                                 antilles? 
                                                   no, amsterdam. 
yes, yes. nieuw amsterdam. i'll see 
you get there safely. he meant well, bless him. 

ste. catherine sailed to land at its tip no larger   
than a meadow, fanned out at its sides 
manhattan island. our new master, 
stuyvesant, lashed us with phrases, wheffs, guzzads, 

that stung but were not fathomed, mercifully,   
when we came on a sabbath, more than twenty   
men, women, a baby born at sea. 
still cursing, he let us land, and heard our praise, 

then disappeared among lank citizens 
with faded skin who stride to the bay and brood   
on water that we trust and dread, and listen   
to tales unstamped by laws and never sacred.


is there no balm in gilead? so cries   
dour jeremiah in granite tones.   
there is a balm in gilead, replies   
a negro spiritual. the baritone 

who chants it, leaning forward on the platform,   
looks up, not knowing his voice is a rainstorm   
that rinses air to reveal earth's surprises. 
today, the summer gone, four monarch butterflies, 

their breed's survivors, sucked a flower's last blooms,   
opened their wings, orange-and-black stained glass,   
and printed on the sky in zigzag lines, 
watch bright things rise winter moons, the white undersides   
of a california condor, once thought doomed, 
now flapping wide like the first bird from ashes.


the cure for loneliness is solitude.  --marianne moore
hopper never painted this, but here   
on a snaky path his vision lingers 

three white tombs, robots with glassed-in faces   
and meters for eyes, grim mouths, flat noses, 

lean forward on a platform, like strangers   
with identical frowns scanning a blur, 

far off, that might be their train. 
gas tanks broken for decades face parson's 

smithy, planked shut now. both relics must stay.   
the pumps have roots in gas pools, and the smithy 

stores memories of hammers forging scythes   
to cut spartina grass for dry salt hay. 

the tanks have the remove of local clammers   
who sink buckets and stand, never in pairs, 

but one and one and one, blank-eyed, alone,   
more serene than lonely. today a woman 

rakes in the shallows, then bends to receive   
last rays in shimmering water, her long shadow 

knifing the bay. she slides into her truck 
to watch the sky flame over sand flats, a hawk's 

wind arabesque, an island risen, brown   
atlantis, at low tide she probes the shoreline 

and beyond grassy dunes for where the land   
might slope off into night. hers is no common 

emptiness, but a vaster silence filled   
with terns' cries, an abundant solitude. 

nearby, the three dry gas pumps, worn   
survivors of clam-digging generations, 

are luminous, and have an exile's grandeur   
that says in perfect solitude, there's fire. 

one day i approached the vessels 
and wanted to drive on, the road ablaze 

with dogwood in full bloom, but the contraptions   
outdazzled the road's white, even outshone 

a bleached shirt flapping alone 
on a laundry line, arms pointed down. 

high noon. three urns, ironic in their outcast   
dignity--as though, like some pine chests, 

they might be prized in disuse--cast rays, 
spun leaf--covered numbers, clanked, then wheezed 

and stopped again. shadows cut the road   
before i drove off into the dark woods.


mothers of america 
                                     let your kids go to the movies 
get them out of the house so they won't know what you're up to   
it's true that fresh air is good for the body 
                                                                             but what about the soul   
that grows in darkness, embossed by silvery images 
and when you grow old as grow old you must 
                                                                                they won't hate you   
they won't criticize you they won't know 
                                                                         they'll be in some glamorous country   
they first saw on a saturday afternoon or playing hookey 

they may even be grateful to you 
                                                            for their first sexual experience   
which only cost you a quarter 
                                                       and didn't upset the peaceful home   
they will know where candy bars come from 
                                                                                 and gratuitous bags of popcorn   
as gratuitous as leaving the movie before it's over 
with a pleasant stranger whose apartment is in the heaven on earth bldg   
near the williamsburg bridge 
                                                       oh mothers you will have made the little tykes 
so happy because if nobody does pick them up in the movies   
they won't know the difference 
                                                         and if somebody does it'll be sheer gravy   
and they'll have been truly entertained either way 
instead of hanging around the yard 
                                                                 or up in their room 
                                                                                                     hating you 
prematurely since you won't have done anything horribly mean yet   
except keeping them from the darker joys 
                                                                             it's unforgivable the latter   
so don't blame me if you won't take this advice 
                                                                                      and the family breaks up   
and your children grow old and blind in front of a tv set 
                                                                                                      seeing   
movies you wouldn't let them see when they were young


the eager note on my door said call me,   
call when you get in so i quickly threw   
a few tangerines into my overnight bag,   
straightened my eyelids and shoulders, and 

headed straight for the door. it was autumn   
by the time i got around the corner, oh all 
unwilling to be either pertinent or bemused, but   
the leaves were brighter than grass on the sidewalk 

funny, i thought, that the lights are on this late   
and the hall door open still up at this hour, a   
champion jai-alai player like himself? oh fie   
for shame what a host, so zealous and he was 

there in the hall, flat on a sheet of blood that 
ran down the stairs. i did appreciate it. there are few   
hosts who so thoroughly prepare to greet a guest   
only casually invited, and that several months ago.


turn back was all she snapped out as she passed   
in a red dress that caught sunrays through mist.   
i saw her lurch upwind, kick off spiked heels,   
climb out to the edge of a knife-sharp rockpile, 

and, arms outstretched, lead the sea's tympani,   
lure the din, guiding the steamy waves   
to shore. will the almighty answer me? 
she sang out to the ocean's rising octaves, 

as blown palms pointed scarflike fronds to land.   
earlier that sunday, she had prayed 
to a black christ in a church on the island, 
droned verses for a safe calm, and trekked homeward 

to board white louvered windows for the storm.   
she had refused the chapel's sanctuary 
to ask the ocean why the wind ripped homes   
and would again. her anger captured me, 

and stayed when i saw rain gleam on red ginger,   
drench trumpets islanders call yellow-bells,   
and soak ixora. bonelike bits of shells 
and conchs lay on the beach as on an altar. 

silent, i watched her. under a blank sky,   
where waves broke over coral, in thick haze,   
pitched forward to hear the whirlwind's reply,   
she shook a fist, then opened hands in praise.


at night chinamen jump   
on asia with a thump 

while in our willful way   
we, in secret, play 

affectionate games and bruise   
our knees like china's shoes. 

the birds push apples through   
grass the moon turns blue, 

these apples roll beneath   
our buttocks like a heath 

full of chinese thrushes   
flushed from china's bushes. 

as we love at night   
birds sing out of sight, 

chinese rhythms beat   
through us in our heat, 

the apples and the birds   
move us like soft words, 

we couple in the grace   
of that mysterious race.

he lives, who last night flopped from a log   
into the creek, and all night by an ankle   
lay pinned to the flood, dead as a nail   
but for the skin of the teeth of his dog. 

i brought him boiled eggs and broth.   
he coughed and waved his spoon 
and sat up saying he would dine alone,   
being fatigue itself after that bath. 

i sat without in the sun with the dog.   
wearing a stocking on the ailing foot,   
in monster crutches, he hobbled out,   
and addressed the dog in bitter rage. 

he told the yellow hound, his rescuer,   
its heart was bad, and it ought 
not wander by the creek at night 
if all his dogs got drowned he would be poor. 

he stroked its head and disappeared in the shed   
and came out with a stone mallet in his hands   
and lifted that rocky weight of many pounds   
and let it lapse on top of the dog's head. 

i carted off the carcass, dug it deep. 
then he came too with what a thing to lug,   
or pour on a dog's grave, his thundermug,   
and poured it out and went indoors to sleep. 

i saw him sleepless in the pane of glass   
looking wild-eyed at sunset, then the glare   
blinded the glass--only a red square   
burning a house burning in the wilderness.


 
in the evening 
haze darkening on the hills,   
purple of the eternal,   
a last bird crosses over,   
flop flop,' adoring 
only the instant. 

     
nine years ago, 
in a plane that rumbled all night   
above the atlantic, 
i could see, lit up 
by lightning bolts jumping out of it,   
a thunderhead formed like the face 
of my brother, looking down   
on blue, 
lightning-flashed moments of the atlantic. 

     
he used to tell me, 
what good is the day?   
on some hill of despair   
the bonfire 
you kindle can light the great sky-- 
though it's true, of course, to make it burn   
you have to throw yourself in ... 

     
wind tears itself hollow 
in the eaves of these ruins, ghost-flute 
of snowdrifts 
that build out there in the dark   
upside-down ravines   
into which night sweeps 
our cast wings, our ink-spattered feathers. 

     
i listen. 
i hear nothing. only 
the cow, the cow of such   
hollowness, mooing 
down the bones. 

     
is that a 
rooster? he 
thrashes in the snow   
for a grain. finds   
it. rips 
it into 
flames. flaps. crows.   
flames 
bursting out of his brow. 

     
how many nights must it take 
one such as me to learn 
that we aren't, after all, made 
from that bird that flies out of its ashes,   
that for us 
as we go up in flames, our one work 
is 
to open ourselves, to be 
the flames? 



for saul chessler, -
i walked from my house down coolidge street last night   
and air, beginning movement in the trees,   
shook down a hushing from the branches.   
on either side of me the houses 
like solid shadow, blocks of silence 
in the violet light, so dim without dimming.   
and i saw you, saul, my old friend, waiting   
for me at the corner where our two streets met. 


i wanted to ask you what it was like to die 
but you said first, as if you didn't want to tell me,   
the doctors made me better. we can run again.'   
you ran behind me the way you always did, 
your slow strides lunging though they never could keep up   
this time they stayed right there at my heels.   
turning, i saw one pocket inside out 
clapping on your coat front like a white hand.   
your breath quickened, scrawled in the chilling air   
like mine, and vanishing. we ran on a field of snow.   
our footsteps pattered the smooth crust,   
each one feeling like it might break through.   
around us the pure white kindled under violet. 


and we returned by train. sitting next to you, 
staring through the window, i saw your body 
lying like a dark slash in the snow, 
your arms flung up, your legs crossed, 
even as i heard you next to me 
still struggling to catch your breath. you were just   
pretending to be alive--remembering to breathe.   
lumbering under living weight, saying you were cured,   
your flushed cheeks--all just to put me at my ease,   
afraid that your death might embarrass me, even then   
saul, you were more a friend to me than you were dead.   
but in my mind the question was still circling 
what is it like to die? but how could i catch you 
in a lie which you intended as a kindness? 
beside you on the train, hurtling back 
into the strange familiarity of coolidge street, 
remaining silent, i returned the courtesy.



          
in late winter 
i sometimes glimpse bits of steam   
coming up from 
some fault in the old snow 
and bend close and see it is lung-colored   
and put down my nose 
and know 
the chilly, enduring odor of bear. 

          
i take a wolf's rib and whittle 
it sharp at both ends 
and coil it up 
and freeze it in blubber and place it out   
on the fairway of the bears. 

and when it has vanished 
i move out on the bear tracks, 
roaming in circles 
until i come to the first, tentative, dark   
splash on the earth. 

and i set out 
running, following the splashes 
of blood wandering over the world. 
at the cut, gashed resting places 
i stop and rest, 
at the crawl-marks 
where he lay out on his belly 
to overpass some stretch of bauchy ice 
i lie out 
dragging myself forward with bear-knives in my fists. 

          
on the third day i begin to starve, 
at nightfall i bend down as i knew i would   
at a turd sopped in blood, 
and hesitate, and pick it up, 
and thrust it in my mouth, and gnash it down,   
and rise 
and go on running. 

          
on the seventh day, 
living by now on bear blood alone, 
i can see his upturned carcass far out ahead, a scraggled,   
steamy hulk, 
the heavy fur riffling in the wind. 

i come up to him 
and stare at the narrow-spaced, petty eyes,   
the dismayed 
face laid back on the shoulder, the nostrils 
flared, catching 
perhaps the first taint of me as he 
died. 

i hack 
a ravine in his thigh, and eat and drink,   
and tear him down his whole length 
and open him and climb in 
and close him up after me, against the wind, 
and sleep. 

          
and dream 
of lumbering flatfooted 
over the tundra, 
stabbed twice from within, 
splattering a trail behind me, 
splattering it out no matter which way i lurch, 
no matter which parabola of bear-transcendence,   
which dance of solitude i attempt, 
which gravity-clutched leap, 
which trudge, which groan. 

          
until one day i totter and fall-- 
fall on this 
stomach that has tried so hard to keep up,   
to digest the blood as it leaked in, 
to break up 
and digest the bone itself and now the breeze   
blows over me, blows off 
the hideous belches of ill-digested bear blood   
and rotted stomach 
and the ordinary, wretched odor of bear, 

blows across 
my sore, lolled tongue a song 
or screech, until i think i must rise up   
and dance. and i lie still. 

          
i awaken i think. marshlights 
reappear, geese 
come trailing again up the flyway. 
in her ravine under old snow the dam-bear 
lies, licking 
lumps of smeared fur 
and drizzly eyes into shapes 
with her tongue. and one 
hairy-soled trudge stuck out before me, 
the next groaned out, 
the next, 
the next, 
the rest of my days i spend 
wandering wondering 
what, anyway, 
was that sticky infusion, that rank flavor of blood, that poetry, by which i lived?


for i can snore like a bullhorn 
or play loud music 
or sit up talking with any reasonably sober irishman 
and fergus will only sink deeper 
into his dreamless sleep, which goes by all in one flash,   
but let there be that heavy breathing 
or a stifled come-cry anywhere in the house 
and he will wrench himself awake 
and make for it on the run--as now, we lie together, 
after making love, quiet, touching along the length of our bodies,   
familiar touch of the long-married, 
and he appears--in his baseball pajamas, it happens, 
the neck opening so small he has to screw them on-- 
and flops down between us and hugs us and snuggles himself to sleep, 
his face gleaming with satisfaction at being this very child. 

in the half darkness we look at each other 
and smile 
and touch arms across this little, startlingly muscled body-- 
this one whom habit of memory propels to the ground of his making, 
sleeper only the mortal sounds can sing awake, 
this blessing love gives again into our arms.


when first i walked here i hobbled   
along ties set too close together   
for a boy to step easily on each.   
i thought my stride one day 
would reach every other and from then on   
i would walk in time with the way   
toward that lobachevskian haze   
up ahead where the two rails meet.   
here we put down our pennies, dark,   
on shined steel they trembled, fell still   
then the locomotive out of attleboro 
rattling its berserk wheel-rods into perfect circles,   
brightened them into wafers, the way a fork   
mashes into view the inner light of a carrot   
in a stew. in this late march sunshine,   
crossing the trees at the angle of a bow   
when it effleurages out of the chanterelle   
the c three octaves above middle c,   
the vertical birthwood remembers   
its ascent lines, shrunken by half, exactly   
back down, each tree on its fallen summer.   
back then, these rocks often asked   
blood offerings--but this one, once, asked bone,   
the time billy wallace tripped and broke out 
his front teeth. fitted with gold replicas, 
he asked, speaking more brightly, what good   
are golden teeth, given what we've got 
to eat? nebuchadnezzar 
spent seven years down on all fours   
eating vetch and alfalfa, ruminating 
the mouth-feel of bloom and wither,   
until he was whole. if you 
held a grass blade between both thumbs   
and blew hard you could blurt a shriek   
out of it--like that beseeching leaves oaks   
didn't drop last winter just now scratch   
on a breeze. maybe billy, lured 
by bones' memory, comes back 
sometimes, too, to the seekonk woods,   
to stand in the past and just look at it. 
here he might kneel, studying this clump of grass, 
as a god might inspect the strands of a human sneeze   
that percusses through. or he might stray   
into the now untrafficked whistling-lanes   
of the mourning doves, who used to call and call   
into the future, and give a start, as though,   
this very minute, by awful coincidence,   
they reach it. and at last traipse off 
down the tracks, with arrhythmic gait,   
as wanderers must do once they realize   
the over-the-unknown route, too, ends up   
where time wants. on this spot 
i skinned the muskrat. the musk breezed away.   
i buried the rat. of the fur 
i made a hat, which as soon as put on   
began to rot off, causing my scalp to crawl.   
in circles, of course, keeping to the skull. 
one day could this scrap of damp skin 
crawl all the way off, and the whole organism   
follow? to do what? effuse with musk,   
or rot with rat? when, a quarter- 
turn after the sun, the half-moon,   
too, goes down and we find ourselves   
in the night's night, then somewhere   
hereabouts in the dark must be death.   
knowledge of it beforehand is surely among   
existence's most spectacular feats--and yet right here,   
on this ordinary afternoon, in these woods,   
with a name meaning black goose in wampanoag,   
or in modern seekonkese, slob blowing fat nose, 
this unlikely event happens--a creature   
walking the tracks knows it will come.   
then too long to touch every tie, his stride   
is now just too short to reach every other, 
and so he is to be still the wanderer, the hirtle   
of too much replaced by the common limp   
of too little. but he almost got there. 
almost stepped in consonance with the liturgical,   
sleeping gods' snores you can hear humming up 
from former times inside the ties. he almost   
set foot in that border zone where what follows   
blows back, shimmering everything, making   
walking like sleepwalking, railroad tracks   
a country lane on a spring morning,   
on which a man, limping but blissful,   
makes his way homeward, his lips, suppled   
by kissing to bunch up like that, blowing 
these short strands of hollowed-out air,   
haunted by future, into a tune on the tracks.   
i think i'm about to be shocked awake. 
as i was in childhood, when i battered myself   
back to my senses against a closed door, 
or woke up hanging out of an upstairs window.   
somnambulism was my attempt to slip 
under cover of nightmare across no father's land   
and embrace a phantasm. if only 
i had found a way to enter his hard time   
served at labor by day, by night in solitary,   
and put my arms around him in reality,   
i might not now be remaking him 
in memory still anti-alchemizing bass kettle's   
golden reverberations back down 
to hair, flesh, blood, bone, the base metals.   
i want to crawl face down in the fields 
and graze on the wild strawberries, my clothes   
stained pink, even for seven years   
if i must, if they exist. i want to lie out 
on my back under the thousand stars and think   
my way up among them, through them,   
and a little distance past them, and attain   
a moment of absolute ignorance, 
if i can, if human mentality lets us. 
i have always intended to live forever 
but not until now, to live now. the moment   
i have done one or the other, i here swear,   
no one will have to drag me , i'll come   
but never will i agree to burn my words. 
the poplar logs creosoted asleep under the tracks   
have stopped snoring. maybe they've   
already waked up. the bow saws at g.   
an oak leaf rattles on its tree. the rails   
may never meet, o fellow euclideans,   
for you, for me. so what if we groan.   
that's our noise. laughter is our stuttering   
in a language we can't speak yet. behind,   
the world made of wishes goes dark. ahead,   
if not now then never, shines what is.


the two boys lean out on the railing   
of the front porch, looking up. 
behind them they can hear their mother   
in one room watching name that tune,   
their father in another watching   
a walter cronkite special, the tvs   
turned up high and higher till they   
each can't hear the other's show.   
the older boy is saying that no matter   
how many stars you counted there were   
always more stars beyond them   
and beyond the stars black space   
going on forever in all directions,   
so that even if you flew up 
millions and millions of years   
you'd be no closer to the end   
of it than they were now 
here on the porch on tuesday night   
in the middle of summer. 
the younger boy can think somehow   
only of his mother's closet,   
how he likes to crawl in back   
behind the heavy drapery 
of shirts, nightgowns and dresses,   
into the sheer black where 
no matter how close he holds   
his hand up to his face 
there's no hand ever, no 
face to hold it to. 

a woman from another street 
is calling to her stray cat or dog,   
clapping and whistling it in, 
and farther away deep in the city   
sirens now and again 
veer in and out of hearing. 

the boys edge closer, shoulder   
to shoulder now, sad ptolemies, 
the older looking up, the younger 
as he thinks back straight ahead 
into the black leaves of the maple 
where the street lights flicker 
like another watery skein of stars. 
name that tune and walter cronkite 
struggle like rough water 
to rise above each other. 
and the woman now comes walking 
in a nightgown down the middle 
of the street, clapping and 
whistling, while the older boy 
goes on about what light years 
are, and solar winds, black holes, 
and how the sun is cooling 
and what will happen to 
them all when it is cold.


the bud 
stands for all things, 
even for those things that don't flower, 
for everything flowers, from within, of self-blessing   
though sometimes it is necessary 
to reteach a thing its loveliness, 
to put a hand on its brow 
of the flower 
and retell it in words and in touch 
it is lovely 
until it flowers again from within, of self-blessing   
as saint francis 
put his hand on the creased forehead 
of the sow, and told her in words and in touch   
blessings of earth on the sow, and the sow   
began remembering all down her thick length,   
from the earthen snout all the way 
through the fodder and slops to the spiritual curl of the tail,   
from the hard spininess spiked out from the spine   
down through the great broken heart 
to the sheer blue milken dreaminess spurting and shuddering   
from the fourteen teats into the fourteen mouths sucking and blowing beneath them 
the long, perfect loveliness of sow.


 
the old watch their 
thick eyes 
puff and foreclose by the moon. the young, heads   
trailed by the beginnings of necks, 
shiver, 
in the guarantee they shall be bodies. 

in the frog pond 
the vapor trail of a sac bomber creeps, 

i hear its drone, drifting, high up   
in immaculate ozone. 

          
and i hear, 
coming over the hills, america singing, 
her varied carols i hear 
crack of deputies' rifles practicing their aim on stray dogs at night,   
sput of cattleprod, 
tv going on about the smells of the human body, 
curses of the soldier as he poisons, burns, grinds, and stabs   
the rice of the world, 
with open mouth, crying strong, hysterical curses. 

          
and by paddies in asia 
bones 
wearing a few shadows 
walk down a dirt road, smashed   
bloodsuckers on their heel, knowing   
flesh thrown down in the sunshine   
dogs shall eat 
and flesh flung into the air 
shall be seized by birds, 
shoulder blades smooth, unmarked by old feather-holes,   
hands rivered 
by blue, erratic wanderings of the blood,   
eyes crinkled shut at almost seeing   
the drifting sun that gives us our lives.


the man splitting wood in the daybreak   
looks strong, as though, if one weakened,   
one could turn to him and he would help.   
gus newland was strong. when he split wood   
he struck hard, flashing the bright steel   
through the air so hard the hard maple   
leapt apart, as it's feared marriages will do   
in countries reluctant to permit divorce,   
and even willow, which, though stacked   
to dry a full year, on being split 
actually weeps--totem wood, therefore,   
to the married-until-death--sunders   
with many little lip-wetting gasp-noises. 
but gus is dead. we could turn to our fathers,   
but they help us only by the unperplexed   
looking-back of the numerals cut into headstones.   
or to our mothers, whose love, so devastated,   
can't, even in spring, break through the hard earth.   
our spouses weaken at the same rate we do.   
we have to hold our children up to lean on them.   
everyone who could help goes or hasn't arrived.   
what about the man splitting wood in the daybreak,   
who looked strong? that was years ago. that was me.


 
i can support it no longer.   
laughing ruefully at myself   
for all i claim to have suffered   
i get up. damned nightmarer 

it is new hampshire out here, 
it is nearly the dawn. 
the song of the whippoorwill stops 
and the dimension of depth seizes everything. 

 
the whistles of a peabody bird go overhead   
like a needle pushed five times through the air,   
they enter the leaves, and come out little changed. 

the air is so still 
that as they go off through the trees 
the love songs of birds do not get any fainter. 

 
the last memory i have 
is of a flower that cannot be touched, 

through the bloom of which, all day,   
fly crazed, missing bees. 

 
as i climb sweat gets up my nostrils,   
for an instant i think i am at the sea, 

one summer off cap ferrat we watched a black seagull   
straining for the dawn, we stood in the surf, 
grasshoppers splash up where i step, 
the mountain laurel crashes at my thighs. 

 
there is something joyous in the elegies   
of birds. they seem 
caught up in a formal delight, 
though the mourning dove whistles of despair. 

but at last in the thousand elegies 
the dead rise in our hearts, 
on the brink of our happiness we stop   
like someone on a drunk starting to weep. 

 
i kneel at a pool, 
i look through my face 
at the bacteria i think 
i see crawling through the moss. 

my face sees me, 
the water stirs, the face,   
looking preoccupied, 
gets knocked from its bones. 

 
i weighed eleven pounds 
at birth, having stayed on 
two extra weeks in the womb.   
tempted by room and fresh air   
i came out big as a policeman   
blue-faced, with narrow red eyes.   
it was eight days before the doctor   
would scare my mother with me. 

turning and craning in the vines   
i can make out through the leaves 
the old, shimmering nothingness, the sky. 

 
green, scaly moosewoods ascend,   
tenants of the shaken paradise, 

at every wind last night's rain   
comes splattering from the leaves, 

it drops in flurries and lies there,   
the footsteps of some running start. 

 
from a rock 
a waterfall, 
a single trickle like a strand of wire,   
breaks into beads halfway down. 

i know 
the birds fly off 
but the hug of the earth wraps 
with moss their graves and the giant boulders. 

in the forest i discover a flower. 

the invisible life of the thing 
goes up in flames that are invisible,   
like cellophane burning in the sunlight. 

it burns up. its drift is to be nothing. 

in its covertness it has a way 
of uttering itself in place of itself, 
its blossoms claim to float in the empyrean, 

a wrathful presence on the blur of the ground. 

the appeal to heaven breaks off. 
the petals begin to fall, in self-forgiveness. 
it is a flower. on this mountainside it is dying.


i can feel she has got out of bed.   
that means it is seven a.m. 
i have been lying with eyes shut,   
thinking, or possibly dreaming, 
of how she might look if, at breakfast,   
i spoke about the hidden place in her   
which, to me, is like a soprano's tremolo, 
and right then, over toast and bramble jelly, 
if such things are possible, she came. 
i imagine she would show it while trying to conceal it. 
i imagine her hair would fall about her face 
and she would become apparently downcast, 
as she does at a concert when she is moved. 
the hypnopompic play passes, and i open my eyes 
and there she is, next to the bed,   
bending to a low drawer, picking over   
various small smooth black, white, 
and pink items of underwear. she bends   
so low her back runs parallel to the earth, 
but there is no sway in it, there is little burden, the day has hardly begun. 
the two mounds of muscles for walking, leaping, lovemaking, 
lift toward the east--what can i say? 
simile is useless there is nothing like them on earth. 
her breasts fall full the nipples 
are deep pink in the glare shining up through the iron bars 
of the gate under the earth where those who could not love 
press, wanting to be born again.   
i reach out and take her wrist 
and she falls back into bed and at once starts unbuttoning my pajamas.   
later, when i open my eyes, there she is again,   
rummaging in the same low drawer.   
the clock shows eight. hmmm.   
with huge, silent effort of great, 
mounded muscles the earth has been turning. 
she takes a piece of silken cloth 
from the drawer and stands up. under the falls   
of hair her face has become quiet and downcast,   
as if she will be, all day among strangers,   
looking down inside herself at our rapture.


the house is so quiet now 
the vacuum cleaner sulks in the corner closet,   
its bag limp as a stopped lung, its mouth   
grinning into the floor, maybe at my 
slovenly life, my dog-dead youth. 

i've lived this way long enough, 
but when my old woman died her soul 
went into that vacuum cleaner, and i can't bear   
to see the bag swell like a belly, eating the dust   
and the woolen mice, and begin to howl 

because there is old filth everywhere 
she used to crawl, in the corner and under the stair.   
i know now how life is cheap as dirt,   
and still the hungry, angry heart   
hangs on and howls, biting at air.


naked before the glass she said,   
i see my body as no man has,   
nor any shall unless i wed 
and naked in a stranger's house   
stand timid beside his bed. 
there is no pity in the flesh. 

or else i shall grow old, she said,   
alone, and change my likeliness   
for a vile, slack shape, a head 
shriveled with thinking wickedness   
against the day i must be dead   
and eaten by my crabbed wish. 

one or the other way, she said,   
how shall i know the difference, 
when wrinkles come, to spinster or bride?   
whether to marry or burn is bless- 
ed best, o stranger to my bed,   
there is no pity in the flesh. 



i tell you that i see her still 
at the dark entrance of the hall. 
one gas lamp burning near her shoulder   
shone also from her other side   
where hung the long inaccurate glass   
whose pictures were as troubled water.   
an immense shadow had its hand   
between us on the floor, and seemed   
to hump the knuckles nervously,   
a giant crab readying to walk,   
or a blanket moving in its sleep. 

you will remember, with a smile   
instructed by movies to reminisce,   
how strict her corsets must have been,   
how the huge arrangements of her hair   
would certainly betray the least   
impassionate displacement there.   
it was no rig for dallying, 
and maybe only marriage could   
derange that queenly scaffolding-- 
as when a great ship, coming home,   
coasts in the harbor, dropping sail 
and loosing all the tackle that had laced 
her in the long lanes .... 
                                       i know 
we need not draw this figure out. 
but all that whalebone came from whales.   
and all the whales lived in the sea,   
in calm beneath the troubled glass,   
until the needle drew their blood. 

i see her standing in the hall, 
where the mirror's lashed to blood and foam,   
and the black flukes of agony 
beat at the air till the light blows out.


the gregarious dark is shifting   
when she puts her second drink,   
the free one, half on the coaster.   
the tipped wine poised at the brim   
is the beginning of the bad girl   
she'll promise never to be again   
tomorrow, who can taunt him now   
to prove he doesn't love her 
and never could her hand slides   
up his thigh until he tenses-- 
my little prig, don't you want   
to fuck me?' the bad girl 
she couldn't be at home, his wife on ice.   
all he can do is smile back 
as though she's made a harmless   
good-natured joke, and struggle   
not to look around to see 
who's heard, who's watching. he wants   
to smash the wine glass in her face   
so he can know for once 
exactly what he's done wrong   
but he places it instead 
back safely on the coaster 
quickly before she sees. 
never cautious enough, he is prepared   
even if she knocks it over 
to go down on his hands and knees   
and wipe it up, kind and forgiving.   
in all ways careful to acquit himself   
so that tomorrow when she says 
she doesn't deserve him, he's too good,   
he can believe her. tomorrow   
will be his happy hour. there won't be   
anything she wouldn't do for him.


it is true, that even in the best-run state   
such things will happen it is true, 
what's done is done. the law, whereby we hate   
our hatred, sees no fire in the flue 
but by the smoke, and not for thought alone   
it punishes, but for the thing that's done. 

and yet there is the horror of the fact,   
though we knew not the man. to die in jail,   
to be beaten to death, to know the act   
of personal fury before the eyes can fail   
and the man die against the cold last wall   
of the lonely world--and neither is that all 

there is the terror too of each man's thought,   
that knows not, but must quietly suspect   
his neighbor, friend, or self of being taught   
to take an attitude merely correct   
being frightened of his own cold image in   
the glass of government, and his own sin, 

frightened lest senate house and prison wall 
be quarried of one stone, lest righteous and high   
look faintly smiling down and seem to call   
a crime the welcome chance of liberty,   
and any man an outlaw who aggrieves   
the patriotism of a pair of thieves.


up in the billboard, over old south station,   
the captain, all wide grin and ruddy cheek,   
held up a golden shot of cutty sark 
high as the skyline where the sunset spread 
a gold fan from the twig-like spars and rigging   
of a departing clipper ship. above 
the picture the dull haze of a real sun rose,   
dragging the day up with it. seven o'clock.   
the agitated horns, brakes, fingers, and catcalls   
down below me were already merging   
and channeling everybody on to warehouse,   
factory, department store and office. 

my father and uncle talking over all the goods   
to be received that day, the goods delivered,   
their two reflections in the window floating   
like blurry ghosts within the captain's grin,   
their voices raised a little above the soft   
erratic humming of the big machines,   
the riveters and pressers, warming, rousing   
the century order, did it get out last night?   
and had the buckles come from personal?   
who'd go do jaffey? who'd diddle abramowitz   
and saperstein? those cocksucking sons of bitches,   
cut their balls off if they fuck with us . . . 

how automatically at any provocation   
i can aim the words at anybody now, 
woman or man, the reverberating 
angry this, not that, in pussy', cocksucker',   
fuckhead', hammered down so far inside me   
it's almost too securely there to feel. 
but i was thirteen then, and for the first   
time old enough to have my father say 
these things in front of me, which must have meant   
i was a man now too, i listened blushing,   
ashamed of blushing for clues of what it was   
i had become, or was supposed to be 

it did and didn't have to do with bodies,   
being a man, it wasn't fixed in bodies, 
but somehow passed between them, going to   
by being taken from, ever departing,   
ever arriving, unstoppable as money,   
and moving in a limited supply   
it seemed to follow where the money went.   
being a man was something that you did   
to other men, which meant a woman 
was what other men became when you would do them.   
either you gave a fucking, or you took one,   
did or were done to, it was simple as that. 

somebody shouted from beyond the office   
that tony had passed out in the can again.   
the lush, the no good lush,' my uncle said,   
get him the fuck out of here for good, will ya.' 
the stall door swung back, scrawled with giant cocks,   
tits, asses and cunts, beyond which in the shadows   
my father was gently wrestling with the man,   
trying to hold him steady while his free hand   
shimmied the tangled shorts and trousers up   
over the knees and hips, and even got 
the shirt tucked in, the pants zipped deftly enough   
for tony not to notice, though he did. 

even then i knew they'd fire him, 
and that it wasn't gratitude at all 
that made the man weep inconsolably, 
his head bowed, nodding, as my father led him   
to the elevator, still with his arm around him,   
patting his shoulder, easing him through the door.   
i knew the tenderness that somewhere else   
could possibly have been a lover's or a father's   
could here be only an efficient way 
to minimize the trouble. and yet it seemed   
somehow my father was too adept at it,   
too skillful, not to feel it in some way. 

and feeling it not to need to pull back,   
to separate himself from what the rest 
of him was doing, which was why, i think, 
his face throughout was blank, expressionless 
like the faces of the presidents on the bills   
he handed tony as the door slid shut.   
the men fast at the riveters and pressers   
and the long row of women at the singers   
were oil now even more than men or women,   
mute oil in the loud revving of the place,   
a blur of hands on automatic pilot, 
slipping leather through the pumping needles, 

under the thrusting rods, the furious hammers,   
the nearly invisible whirring of the blades.   
come on now, al, it's time,' my father said,   
and the captain seemed to grin a little wider,   
as if his pleasure there at the end of his   
unending day grew freer, more disencumbered,   
because he saw me at the start of mine,   
under my father's arm, his soft voice broken   
against the noise into an unfollowable tune   
of favors and petty cash, and how much ass   
he had to kiss to get me this, and i 
should be a man now and not disappoint him.


for francis and barbara
 
among the high-branching, leafless boughs   
above the roof-peaks of the town,   
snowflakes unnumberably come down. 

i watched out of the attic window   
the laced sway of family trees,   
intricate genealogies 

whose strict, reserved gentility,   
trembling, impossible to bow,   
received the appalling fall of snow. 

all during sunday afternoon,   
not storming, but befittingly,   
out of a still, grey, devout sky, 

the snowflakes fell, until all shapes 
went under, and thickening, drunken lines   
cobwebbed the sleep of solemn pines. 

up in the attic, among many things   
inherited and out of style,   
i cried, then fell asleep awhile, 

waking at night now, as the snow- 
flakes from darkness to darkness go   
past yellow lights in the street below. 

i cried because life is hopeless and beautiful.   
and like a child i cried myself to sleep 
high in the head of the house, feeling the hull   
beneath me pitch and roll among the steep   
mountains and valleys of the many years 
   that brought me to tears. 

down in the cellar, furnace and washing machine,   
pump, fuse-box, water heater, work their hearts   
out at my life, which narrowly runs between   
them and this cemetery of spare parts 
for discontinued men, whose hats and canes   
   are my rich remains. 

and women, their portraits and wedding gowns   
stacked in the corners, brooding in wooden trunks   
and children's rattles, books about lions and clowns   
and headless, hanging dresses swayed like drunks   
whenever a living footstep shakes the floor 
   i mention no more 

but what i thought today, that made me cry,   
is this, that we live in two kinds of thing   
the powerful trees, thrusting into the sky 
their black patience, are one, and that branching 
relation teaches how we endure and grow   
   the other is the snow, 

falling in a white chaos from the sky,   
as many as the sands of all the seas, 
as all the men who died or who will die, 
as stars in heaven, as leaves of all the trees   
as abraham was promised of his seed 
   generations bleed, 

till i, high in the tower of my time   
among familiar ruins, began to cry 
for accident, sickness, justice, war and crime,   
because all died, because i had to die. 
the snow fell, the trees stood, the promise kept, 
   and a child i slept.


people are putting up storm windows now,   
or were, this morning, until the heavy rain   
drove them indoors. so, coming home at noon,   
i saw storm windows lying on the ground,   
frame-full of rain through the water and glass 
i saw the crushed grass, how it seemed to stream   
away in lines like seaweed on the tide 
or blades of wheat leaning under the wind. 
the ripple and splash of rain on the blurred glass   
seemed that it briefly said, as i walked by,   
something i should have liked to say to you, 
something ... the dry grass bent under the pane   
brimful of bouncing water ... something of   
a swaying clarity which blindly echoes 
this lonely afternoon of memories 
and missed desires, while the wintry rain   
unspeakable, the distance in the mind 
runs on the standing windows and away. 



old court. old chain net hanging in frayed links from the rim,   
the metal blackboard dented, darker where the ball   
for over thirty years has kissed it, the blacktop buckling,   
the white lines nearly worn away. old common ground   
where none of the black men warming up before the basket   
will answer or even look in my direction when i ask   
if i can run too, the chill a mutual understanding,   
one of the last we share, letting me join them here,   
if nowhere else, by not letting me forget i don't belong. 

old court. old courtesy, handshake, exchange of names,   
in the early days of bussing, between assassinations,   
before our quaint welcoming of them had come to seem,   
even to ourselves, the haughty overflow of wealth   
so thoroughly our own we didn't need to see it.   
old beautiful delusion in those courtly gestures   
that everything now beyond our wanting just to play 
was out of bounds, and we were free between the white lines   
of whatever we assumed we each of us assumed. 

old court, old dream dreamed by the weave, the trap,   
the backdoor pass. old fluid legacy, among the others, 
that conjures even now within our bodies and between them   
such a useless, such an intimate forgetting, as in the moment   
when you get a step on your defender and can tell 
exactly by how another man comes at you 
where your own man is and, without looking, lob the ball   
up in the air so perfectly as he arrives that 
in a single motion he can catch and finger roll it in. 

old court. old dwindling cease fire, with no hope of peace,   
that we silently turn away from when the game is over,   
hurrying back as if believing contact meant contagion   
to our separate tribes, to the cleansing fires of what,   
despite ourselves, we momentarily forgot 
old lore, old news, old burning certitudes we can't   
stoke high or hot enough, yet won't stop ever stoking   
until whatever it is we think we are anneals 
and toughens into an impenetrable shield.


the cursive crawl, the squared-off characters   
these by themselves delight, even without   
a meaning, in a foreign language, in 
chinese, for instance, or when skaters curve   
all day across the lake, scoring their white   
records in ice. being intelligible, 
these winding ways with their audacities   
and delicate hesitations, they become   
miraculous, so intimately, out there 
at the pen's point or brush's tip, do world   
and spirit wed. the small bones of the wrist   
balance against great skeletons of stars   
exactly the blind bat surveys his way   
by echo alone. still, the point of style   
is character. the universe induces 
a different tremor in every hand, from the   
check-forger's to that of the emperor 
hui tsung, who called his own calligraphy   
the slender gold.' a nervous man 
writes nervously of a nervous world, and so on. 

miraculous. it is as though the world 
were a great writing. having said so much,   
let us allow there is more to the world   
than writing continental faults are not   
bare convoluted fissures in the brain.   
not only must the skaters soon go home   
also the hard inscription of their skates 
is scored across the open water, which long   
remembers nothing, neither wind nor wake.


an introductory lecture
this morning we shall spend a few minutes   
upon the study of symbolism, which is basic   
to the nature of money. i show you this nickel.   
icons and cryptograms are written all over 
the nickel one side shows a hunchbacked bison   
bending his head and curling his tail to accommodate   
the circular nature of money. over him arches 
united states of america, and, squinched in   
between that and his rump, e pluribus unum, 
a roman reminiscence that appears to mean   
an indeterminately large number of things   
all of which are the same. under the bison 
a straight line giving him a ground to stand on   
reads five cents. and on the other side of our nickel   
there is the profile of a man with long hair   
and a couple of feathers in the hair we know   
somehow that he is an american indian, and   
he wears the number nineteen-thirty-six. 
right in front of his eyes the word liberty, bent   
to conform with the curve of the rim, appears   
to be falling out of the sky y first the indian   
keeps his eyes downcast and does not notice this   
to notice it, indeed, would be shortsighted of him.   
so much for the iconography of one of our nickels,   
which is now becoming a rarity and something of   
a collectors' item for as a matter of fact 
there is almost nothing you can buy with a nickel,   
the representative american indian was destroyed   
a hundred years or so ago, and his descendants'   
relations with liberty are maintained with reservations,   
or primitive concentration camps while the bison,   
except for a few examples kept in cages, 
is now extinct. something like that, i think, 
is what keats must have meant in his celebrated   
ode on a grecian urn. 
                               notice, in conclusion, 
a number of circumstances sometimes overlooked   
even by experts a indian and bison, 
confined to obverse and reverse of the coin,   
can never see each other b they are looking   
in opposite directions, the bison past 
the indian's feathers, the indian past 
the bison's tail c they are upside down 
to one another d the bison has a human face   
somewhat resembling that of jupiter ammon. 
i hope that our studies today will have shown you   
something of the import of symbolism 
with respect to the understanding of what is symbolized.


 

water roared everywhere around us, yet from the bank   
all we could see of it were quick spumes and flashes   
here and there, in among the boulders. cautiously,   
as if they might awaken, we clambered over   
the gigantic slabs and humps, the sun-baked ovals   
lumpy as hammered clay, and saw downstream below us   
only the vague shapes of others, almost billowy,   
like magnified amoebas, stretching away to even   
vaguer ones beyond them, turning the narrow   
streambed through the valley to a lunar seam. 


        

easing ourselves down over the massive sides 
we were hot and tired, eager for the pools below   
we could make out older water in the rough grain,   
undulating and immobile currents, band swirled on band,   
mica-speckled, cloudy, each seeming to move off,   
as it faded, through the stone--each one a glacial rune,   
each boulder an innumerable pebble in the ice sheet's 
tidal suck and drag two hundred thousand years,   
two billion, five, the molten core, spoor   
of gasses in the vast night, at our fingertips. 


        

then the pool your clothes shed, with one hand braced   
against the rock ledge you had slipped into the hip-high   
rushing water, and were wading out, bent over, reaching   
like the blind before you for the slippery boulder 
you slid across, pushing against the white weight 
of the pouring mist, your skin goose-fleshed, speckled   
bright as mica, and then, part mist yourself, 
you turned back, smiling, calling though i couldn't   
hear you, calling and waving for me to climb down   
to where you were, to join you there. and so i did.


this morning, between two branches of a tree   
beside the door, epeira once again 
has spun and signed his tapestry and trap.   
i test his early-warning system and 
it works, he scrambles forth in sable with   
the yellow hieroglyph that no one knows   
the meaning of. and i remember now 
how yesterday at dusk the nighthawks came   
back as they do about this time each year, 
grey squadrons with the slashes white on wings   
cruising for bugs beneath the bellied cloud.   
now soon the monarchs will be drifting south,   
and then the geese will go, and then one day   
the little garden birds will not be here.   
see how many leaves already have 
withered and turned a few have fallen, too.   
change is continuous on the seamless web,   
yet moments come like this one, when you feel   
upon your heart a signal to attend 
the definite announcement of an end 
where one thing ceases and another starts   
when like the spider waiting on the web   
you know the intricate dependencies   
spreading in secret through the fabric vast   
of heaven and earth, sending their messages   
ciphered in chemistry to all the kinds, 
the whisper down the bloodstream it is time.


by the dry road the fathers cough and spit, 
this is their room. they are the ones who hung   
that bloody sun upon the southern wall   
and crushed the armored beetle to the floor. 

the father's skin is seamed and dry, the map 
of that wild region where they drained the swamp   
and set provision out that they might sit, 
of history the cracked precipitate, 

until the glass be shattered and the sun   
descend to burn the prosperous flesh away   
of the filthy world, so vilely fathered on   
the fathers, such black cinders, sitting there. 

old pioneers, what lecheries remain? 
when schoolgirls pass, what whispers of their skirts,   
cold gleams of flesh, solicit in your veined 
and gemlike eyes the custom of desire? 

none now. their eyes are sunk in ancient flesh,   
and the sarcastic triumph of the mind 
they now enjoy, letting their lust alone   
who may have kin but have no longer kind. 

neither tomorrow's monstrous tumor nor   
the reformation of the past they wish,   
who hold in silent colloquy the world   
a shrivelled apple in the hand of god. 

they hang at night their somber flags aloft, 
and through the amorous dark pursue their theme   
of common images, that sleep may show   
them done with all disasters but the one.


on the long shore, lit by the moon   
to show them properly alone,   
two lovers suddenly embraced   
so that their shadows were as one.   
the ordinary night was graced 
for them by the swift tide of blood   
that silently they took at flood,   
and for a little time they prized 
   themselves emparadised. 

then, as if shaken by stage-fright   
beneath the hard moon's bony light,   
they stood together on the sand   
embarrassed in each other's sight   
but still conspiring hand in hand,   
until they saw, there underfoot, 
as though the world had found them out,   
the goose fish turning up, though dead, 
   his hugely grinning head. 

there in the china light he lay,   
most ancient and corrupt and grey.   
they hesitated at his smile, 
wondering what it seemed to say 
to lovers who a little while 
before had thought to understand,   
by violence upon the sand, 
the only way that could be known   
   to make a world their own. 

it was a wide and moony grin 
together peaceful and obscene 
they knew not what he would express,   
so finished a comedian 
he might mean failure or success,   
but took it for an emblem of 
their sudden, new and guilty love 
to be observed by, when they kissed,   
   that rigid optimist. 

so he became their patriarch, 
dreadfully mild in the half-dark. 
his throat that the sand seemed to choke,   
his picket teeth, these left their mark   
but never did explain the joke 
that so amused him, lying there 
while the moon went down to disappear   
along the still and tilted track 
   that bears the zodiac.


unwitting accomplice in the scheme of law   
she thought to violate, man-set as it was,   
and, here, inconsequential as the sun   
at midnight, drought at flood-time-- 
when she heard a baby in the tall reeds   
at the river's brink, she was nobody's   
daughter, subject of no rule 
but the one his need for her established   
as she knelt down to quell his crying   
with a little tune just seeing him there   
had taught her how to hum. 

                                        now as then, 
it is the same tune, timelessly in time,   
your mother hums as she kneels down   
beside your little barge of foam, 
smiling to see you smile when she wrings 
out from the sponge a ragged string   
of water over the chest and belly,   
the dimpled loins, the bud so far   
from flowering, and the foot slick 
as a fish your hand tries to hold up 
till it slips back splashing 
with such mild turbulence that she laughs,   
and you laugh to see her laugh. 

here now, as it was then, it is still 
so many years before the blood's smeared   
over doorposts, before the nile clots   
with the first-born, and the women   
wailing,wailing throughout the city 
here now again is the kingdom of pleasure,   
where they are safe still, mother and child,   
from the chartered rod of the fathers,   
and where a father can still pray, lord,   
jealous chooser, devouring law, keep   
away from them, just keep away.


see amos, 
a door sunk in a hillside, with a bolt 
thick as the boy's arm, and behind that door   
the walls of ice, melting a blue, faint light,   
an air of cedar branches, sawdust, fern   
decaying seasons keeping from decay. 

a summer guest, the boy had never seen   
a servant told him of it how the lake 
froze three foot thick, how farmers came with teams,   
with axe and saw, to cut great blocks of ice,   
translucid, marbled, glittering in the sun,   
load them on sleds and drag them up the hill   
to be manhandled down the narrow path   
and set in courses for the summer's keeping,   
the kitchen uses and luxuriousness 
of the great houses. and he heard how once 
a team and driver drowned in the break of spring   
the man's cry melting from the ice that summer   
frightened the sherbet-eaters off the terrace. 

dust of the cedar, lost and evergreen   
among the slowly blunting water walls 
where the blade edge melted and the steel saw's bite   
was rounded out, and the horse and rider drowned 
in the red sea's blood, i was the silly child 
who dreamed that riderless cry, and saw the guests 
run from a ghostly wall, so long before 
the winter house fell with the summer house, 
and the houses, egypt, the great houses, had an end.


this admirable gadget, when it is 
wound on a string and spun with steady force,   
maintains its balance on most any smooth 
surface, pleasantly humming as it goes. 
it is whirled not on a constant course, but still   
stands in unshivering integrity 
for quite some time, meaning nothing perhaps   
but being something agreeable to watch,   
a silver nearly silence gleaning a still- 
ness out of speed, composing unity   
from spin, so that its hollow spaces seem   
solids of light, until it wobbles and   
begins to whine, and then with an odd lunge   
eccentric and reckless, it skids away   
and drops dead into its own skeleton.


the oldest sister, her two hands on the table,   
about to push herself up, stares with grim   
determination at the affronting dishes,   
waiting, it seems, until the middle sister   
finishes her story, so she can clear them away.   
her gaze so tense with purpose she can almost   
see germs spawning in the mess of white fish   
flaking from the spines, the smear of egg yolk   
and the torn rolls disfiguring the china   
as if the meal, the moment it is over, 
the meal she made a point of telling them   
she shopped for, got up early to prepare,   
were now inedible, because uneaten. 
it's no great comfort either that her brother   
sitting opposite holds up a flared match   
over the pipe from which smoke rolls away   
across the table like a phantom mold 
in and around the open tub of butter, 
the gouged block of cream cheese and the coffee cups   
so in a moment when she finally does stand 

she'll say again, as always, for love or money   
in my mouth i'd never put such filth,   
and he'll say, winking at the middle sister,   
that's what she said on her honeymoon. 

the youngest sister is sitting on the couch 
behind the table her face--sheer disengagement,   
toneless and still--appears to hang suspended   
beyond the oldest sister's shoulder, far   
enough away for no one yet to notice   
as her legs cross that the ashtray in her lap   
spills ash over the sunflowers of her housedress.   
or that the cigarette between her fingers   
sags loosely and is dangling while the hand   
lifts like a puppet's on a string of smoke. 

her death is just three months away. 

even though it's summer otherwise 
the brother and middle sister would be home,   
in florida, summer and late morning-- 
with sunlight only just now catching on 
a corner of the window shut behind them, 
shut against the smog, the steady traffic 
and the panicked blare and drawn-out whining fade   
of sirens--the apartment is still quiet, 
still cool enough, right now, to keep the body   
in the wavering frail zone of what it needs 
to be forgotten, so they can sit like this 
together, with the oldest sister's sharp eye 
on the wrecked meal, the brother and sister talking 

listen, she would be saying, listen, charlie,   
her elbows on the table, both hands open,   
the body fashioned to the voice's weary   
what can you do? what are ya gonna do?   
in answer to some story of a cousin's   
sudden illness and he was my age, just 
like that one day he's shaving with the toothpaste, 
or a friend's death that one, she didn't care   
how sick she got, she always had her hair done,   
his back pain, her arthritis, or the daughter   
who won't diet and she'd be such a beauty   
after his joke about the nurse, and hers   
about the bedpan, listen, they each say,   
listen, what are ya gonna do? 

                                              the schmo, 
he never should've married her, for christ sake,   
until he told her that he had a problem,   
that was his first mistake, then he goes   
throwing away his pills, because he's happy   
he doesn't need them anymore, the schmo,   
so of course what happens is she wakes up   
and finds him weeping at the kitchen table, 
just weeping, he doesn't know why, he won't eat,   
won't get dressed, says he's quittin' his job, 
you know, nuts, nuts, so naturally she leaves him,   
the poor schmo, and he's such a good boy . . .  

all of the harm that's imperceptibly 
but surely coming for them the way the sun 
burns brick by brick all morning toward the window   
like a slow fuse--all of the bad news now 
is in the body only enough to hold 
the middle sister's two hands open, shrug 
her shoulders in a way they recognize   
as hers, the way their mother did as if   
all trouble were, for now, no heavier   
than the familiar voice repeating, listen,   
listen it could be worse so who's to say? 
what was, was when your number's up--like old charms   
woven around each story till they've made   
what happens what was only meant to happen,   
coherent with fate, fated as family. 

after the funeral three months from now,   
they'll have to listen to the oldest sister 
tell them they had no business moving away   
to florida, and irene sick as she was.   
and selfish. she was selfish, that one. after   
all those years of living with that bum, 
her husband, may his cheap soul rest in peace,   
didn't she deserve a little pleasure? 
and anyway, what could be done for her?   
didn't the stroke just make it easier 
for her to sit all day, and smoke, and not care   
ashes were falling on the couch, the carpet 
her bathrobe filthy, filthy? oh it was terrible-- 
and now they will hear the old unfairnesses,   
old feuds and resentments come to her voice   
like consolation, like a mother helping   
her recite the story of that last bad day-- 
all that smoke, and running in with nothing   
but the dishtowel to beat down the flames,   
and irene, just irene, just sitting there, 
the queen of sheba--what difference did it make   
since she was there, she was always there,   
her big sister, to clean up the mess? 

only three months, and yet it could be years,   
or decades, for the sun has only just now 
caught in the window, and its bright plaque warms   
the air so gradually that none of them 
can know it's warming, or that soon someone,   
distracted by a faint sheen prickling the skin,   
will break the story, look up toward the window   
and, startled by the full glare, check the time.   
right now, though, the future is a luxury   
of instances in which the cigarette, 
raised halfway to the lips, will go on rising.   
nothing bad, right now, can happen here   
except as news, bad news the brother and sister   
mull and rehearse, puzzle and fret until   
it seems the very telling of it is 
what keeps them safe. and safe, too, the oldest sister,   
dreaming of all the perishables sealed,   
wrapped up and hurried back into the fridge's   
uncontaminated airlessness, 
dreaming of how the soapsuds curdle and slide   
over the dishes in a soothing fury, 
not minding that it scalds her hands to hold   
each plate and cup and bowl under the hot,   
hard jet of water, if it gets them clean.


there's never a dull moment in the human body.  --the insight lady
dear old equivocal and closest friend,   
grand vizier to a weak bewildered king,   
now we approach the ecclesiastean age 
where the heart is like to go off inside your chest   
like a party favor, or the brain blow a fuse   
and the comic-book light-bulb of idea black out   
forever, the idiot balloon of speech   
go blank, and we shall know, if it be knowing,   
the world as it was before language once again 

mighty fortress, maybe already mined   
and readying to blow up grievances   
about the lifetime of your servitude, 
the body of this death one talkative saint   
wanted to be delivered of not yet,   
aggressively asserting your ancient right   
to our humiliation by the bowel 
or the rough justice of the elderly lecher's   
retiring from this incontinence to that 

dark horse, it's you we've put the money on   
regardless, the parody and satire and 
the nevertheless forgiveness of the soul   
or mind, self, spirit, will or whatever else 
the ever-unknowable unknown is calling itself 
this time around--shall we renew our vows?   
how should we know by now how we might do   
divorced? homely animal, in sickness and health,   
for the duration buddy, you know the drill.


long scree of pill bottles 
         spilling over the tipped brim   
of the wicker basket, fifty or more,   
         a hundred, 

your name on every one and under 
         your name the brusque rune of instructions-- 
which ones to take, how many, and often, 
         on what days, 

with or without food, before or 
         after eating, impossible 
toward the end to keep them all straight,   
         not even 

with your charts, your calendars, the bottles   
         ranged in sequence along the kitchen   
counter--you always so 
         efficient, 

organized, never without a plan, 
         even when planning had come down   
to this and nothing more, for there was   
         still a future 

in it, though the future reached 
         only from one bottle to 
the next, from pill to pill, each one 
         another 

toehold giving way 
         beneath you on the steep slope   
you never stopped struggling against,   
         unable not 

to climb, and then, when climbing 
         was impossible, not to try slowing   
the quickening descent. you had 
         descended now, 

your body thinned to the machine 
         of holding on, while i exhausted   
by the vigil, with all your medicine 
         spread before me, 

looked for something, anything 
         at all to help me sleep.   
to help me for a short while anyway 
         not be 

aware of you, your gaunt hand 
         clutching the guardrail, your eyes   
blind, flitting, scanning, it seemed,   
         the air above them 

for their own sight, and the whimper   
         far back in the throat, the barely   
audible continuous 
         half-cry half- 

wheeze i couldn't hear and not think 
         you were saying something, though   
i couldn't make out what. i wanted 
         to sleep, 

i wanted if just for that one night 
         to meet you there on that steep slope,   
the two of us together, facing 
         opposite 

directions, i, because i wasn't 
         dying, looking down, desiring   
what you, still looking up, resisted,   
         because you were.


and does the heart grow old? you know   
in the indiscriminate green 
of summer or in earliest snow 
a landscape is another scene, 

inchoate and anonymous, 
and every rock and bush and drift   
as our affections alter us 
will alter with the season's shift. 

so love by love we come at last, 
as through the exclusions of a rhyme,   
or the exactions of a past, 
to the simplicity of time, 

the antiquity of grace, where yet   
we live in terror and delight   
with love as quiet as regret   
and love like anger in the night.

magisterial. 
                   my lovely daughter-- 
walking me to the car 
                                 to say goodbye   
the day i left 
                      to keep watch at my brother's 
bedside-- 
               suddenly 
                            singing i 
feel pretty, oh so 
                            pretty 
                                        as she raised   
her arms up in a loose oval 
                                        over her head   
and pirouetted all along the walk. 

savage 
          and magisterial-- 
                                     the joy of it, 
the animal candor of 
                                 each arabesque, 
each leaping turn and counterturn, 
                                                    her voice 
now wobbly 
                with laughter, 
                                       and i pity

savagely beautiful, 
                              not so much like   
the lion that the camera 
                                     freezes 
                                                 in mid- 
pounce, claws 
                     outstretched for the stumbling 
                                                                   antelope, 
as like the herd 
                         escaping 
                                     that the camera 
pans to, zig- 
                     zagging, 
                                  swerving as one,   
their leaping strides now

                                                               faster,   
even after, 
                it seems, 
                               the fear subsides-- 
after the fear and 
                            the relief 
                                             they keep   
on running 
                for nothing but 
                                          the joy of running,   
though 
          it could be 
                               any one of them

                  from its fallen

sister or brother, 
                            across the wide 
                                                      savanna,   
under a bright sun 
                              into fresher grass.


here they are. the soft eyes open.   
if they have lived in a wood 
it is a wood. 
if they have lived on plains 
it is grass rolling 
under their feet forever. 

having no souls, they have come,   
anyway, beyond their knowing.   
their instincts wholly bloom   
and they rise. 
the soft eyes open. 

to match them, the landscape flowers,   
outdoing, desperately 
outdoing what is required 
the richest wood, 
the deepest field. 

for some of these, 
it could not be the place 
it is, without blood. 
these hunt, as they have done, 
but with claws and teeth grown perfect, 

more deadly than they can believe.   
they stalk more silently, 
and crouch on the limbs of trees,   
and their descent 
upon the bright backs of their prey 

may take years 
in a sovereign floating of joy.   
and those that are hunted   
know this as their life, 
their reward to walk 

under such trees in full knowledge   
of what is in glory above them,   
and to feel no fear, 
but acceptance, compliance.   
fulfilling themselves without pain 

at the cycle's center, 
they tremble, they walk   
under the tree, 
they fall, they are torn,   
they rise, they walk again.


off highway  
at cherrylog road i entered   
the ' ford without wheels,   
smothered in kudzu, 
with a seat pulled out to run 
corn whiskey down from the hills, 

and then from the other side   
crept into an essex 
with a rumble seat of red leather   
and then out again, aboard   
a blue chevrolet, releasing   
the rust from its other color, 

reared up on three building blocks.   
none had the same body heat 
i changed with them inward, toward   
the weedy heart of the junkyard,   
for i knew that doris holbrook   
would escape from her father at noon 

and would come from the farm   
to seek parts owned by the sun   
among the abandoned chassis,   
sitting in each in turn 
as i did, leaning forward 
as in a wild stock-car race 

in the parking lot of the dead.   
time after time, i climbed in   
and out the other side, like   
an envoy or movie star 
met at the station by crickets.   
a radiator cap raised its head, 

become a real toad or a kingsnake   
as i neared the hub of the yard,   
passing through many states,   
many lives, to reach 
some grandmother's long pierce-arrow   
sending platters of blindness forth 

from its nickel hubcaps 
and spilling its tender upholstery 
on sleepy roaches, 
the glass panel in between   
lady and colored driver   
not all the way broken out, 

the back-seat phone 
still on its hook. 
i got in as though to exclaim,   
let us go to the orphan asylum,   
john i have some old toys 
for children who say their prayers. 

i popped with sweat as i thought   
i heard doris holbrook scrape 
like a mouse in the southern-state sun   
that was eating the paint in blisters   
from a hundred car tops and hoods.   
she was tapping like code, 

loosening the screws,   
carrying off headlights,   
sparkplugs, bumpers, 
cracked mirrors and gear-knobs,   
getting ready, already, 
to go back with something to show 

other than her lips' new trembling   
i would hold to me soon, soon,   
where i sat in the ripped back seat 
talking over the interphone,   
praying for doris holbrook   
to come from her father's farm 

and to get back there 
with no trace of me on her face 
to be seen by her red-haired father 
who would change, in the squalling barn,   
her back's pale skin with a strop, 
then lay for me 

in a bootlegger's roasting car 
with a string-triggered i-gauge shotgun   
to blast the breath from the air. 
not cut by the jagged windshields,   
through the acres of wrecks she came   
with a wrench in her hand, 

through dust where the blacksnake dies   
of boredom, and the beetle knows   
the compost has no more life. 
someone outside would have seen   
the oldest car's door inexplicably   
close from within 

i held her and held her and held her,   
convoyed at terrific speed 
by the stalled, dreaming traffic around us,   
so the blacksnake, stiff 
with inaction, curved back 
into life, and hunted the mouse 

with deadly overexcitement,   
the beetles reclaimed their field   
as we clung, glued together, 
with the hooks of the seat springs   
working through to catch us red-handed   
amidst the gray breathless batting 

that burst from the seat at our backs.   
we left by separate doors 
into the changed, other bodies 
of cars, she down cherrylog road   
and i to my motorcycle 
parked like the soul of the junkyard 

restored, a bicycle fleshed 
with power, and tore off 
up highway , continually   
drunk on the wind in my mouth,   
wringing the handlebar for speed,   
wild to be wreckage forever.


... a separation from the world, a penetration to some source of power and a life-enhancing return ... 
van gennep rites de passage 
moth-force a small town always has,   

          given the night. 

                                           what field-forms can be, 
         outlying the small civic light-decisions over 
               a man walking near home? 
                                                         men are not where he is   
      exactly now, but they are around him    around him like the strength 

of fields.    the solar system floats on 
    above him in town-moths. 
                                             tell me, train-sound, 
    with all your long-lost grief, 
                                             what i can give.   
    dear lord of all the fields 
                                             what am i going to do? 
                                        street-lights, blue-force and frail 
as the homes of men, tell me how to do it    how 
    to withdraw    how to penetrate and find the source   
      of the power you always had 
                                             light as a moth, and rising 
       with the level and moonlit expansion 
    of the fields around, and the sleep of hoping men. 

       you?    i?    what difference is there?    we can all be saved 

       by a secret blooming. now as i walk 
the night    and you walk with me    we know simplicity   
   is close to the source that sleeping men 
       search for in their home-deep beds. 
       we know that the sun is away    we know that the sun can be conquered   
   by moths, in blue home-town air. 
          the stars splinter, pointed and wild. the dead lie under 
the pastures.    they look on and help.    tell me, freight-train, 
                            when there is no one else 
   to hear. tell me in a voice the sea 
         would have, if it had not a better one as it lifts, 
          hundreds of miles away, its fumbling, deep-structured roar 
               like the profound, unstoppable craving 
            of nations for their wish. 
                                                      hunger, time and the moon 

         the moon lying on the brain 
                                                    as on the excited sea    as on 
          the strength of fields. lord, let me shake   
         with purpose.    wild hope can always spring   
         from tended strength.    everything is in that. 
            that and nothing but kindness.    more kindness, dear lord 
of the renewing green.    that is where it all has to start 
         with the simplest things. more kindness will do nothing less 
             than save every sleeping one 
             and night-walking one 

         of us. 
                   my life belongs to the world. i will do what i can.


so i would hear out those lungs,   
the air split into nine levels, 
some gift of tongues of the whistler 

in the invalid's bed my mother,   
warbling all day to herself 
the thousand variations of one song 

it is called buckdancer's choice.   
for years, they have all been dying   
out, the classic buck-and-wing men 

of traveling minstrel shows   
with them also an old woman   
was dying of breathless angina, 

yet still found breath enough   
to whistle up in my head   
a sight like a one-man band, 

freed black, with cymbals at heel,   
an ex-slave who thrivingly danced   
to the ring of his own clashing light 

through the thousand variations of one song   
all day to my mother's prone music,   
the invalid's warbler's note, 

while i crept close to the wall   
sock-footed, to hear the sounds alter,   
her tongue like a mockingbird's break 

through stratum after stratum of a tone   
proclaiming what choices there are   
for the last dancers of their kind, 

for ill women and for all slaves 
of death, and children enchanted at walls   
with a brass-beating glow underfoot, 

not dancing but nearly risen   
through barnlike, theatrelike houses   
on the wings of the buck and wing.


a -year-old stewardess fell ... to her death tonight when she was swept through an emergency door that sud- denly sprang open ... the body ... was found ... three hours after the accident.                                                                            --new york times
the states when they black out and lie there rolling    when they turn 
to something transcontinental    move by    drawing moonlight out of the great 
one-sided stone hung off the starboard wingtip    some sleeper next to 
an engine is groaning for coffee    and there is faintly coming in 
somewhere the vast beast-whistle of space. in the galley with its racks 
of trays    she rummages for a blanket    and moves in her slim tailored 
uniform to pin it over the cry at the top of the door. as though she blew 

the door down with a silent blast from her lungs    frozen    she is black 
out finding herself    with the plane nowhere and her body taking by the throat 
the undying cry of the void    falling    living    beginning to be something 
that no one has ever been and lived through    screaming without enough air 
still neat    lipsticked    stockinged    girdled by regulation    her hat 
still on    her arms and legs in no world    and yet spaced also strangely 
with utter placid rightness on thin air    taking her time    she holds it 
in many places    and now, still thousands of feet from her death she seems 
to slow    she develops interest    she turns in her maneuverable body 

to watch it. she is hung high up in the overwhelming middle of things in her 
self    in low body-whistling wrapped intensely    in all her dark dance-weight 
coming down from a marvellous leap    with the delaying, dumfounding ease 
of a dream of being drawn    like endless moonlight to the harvest soil 
of a central state of one's country    with a great gradual warmth coming 
over her    floating    finding more and more breath in what she has been using 
for breath    as the levels become more human    seeing clouds placed honestly 
below her left and right    riding slowly toward them    she clasps it all 
to her and can hang her hands and feet in it in peculiar ways    and 
her eyes opened wide by wind, can open her mouth as wide    wider and suck 
all the heat from the cornfields    can go down on her back with a feeling 
of stupendous pillows stacked under her    and can turn    turn as to someone 
in bed    smile, understood in darkness    can go away    slant    slide 
off tumbling    into the emblem of a bird with its wings half-spread 
or whirl madly on herself    in endless gymnastics in the growing warmth 
of wheatfields rising toward the harvest moon.    there is time to live 
in superhuman health    seeing mortal unreachable lights far down seeing 
an ultimate highway with one late priceless car probing it    arriving 
in a square town    and off her starboard arm the glitter of water catches 
the moon by its one shaken side    scaled, roaming silver    my god it is good 
and evil    lying in one after another of all the positions for love 
making    dancing    sleeping    and now cloud wisps at her no 
raincoat    no matter    all small towns brokenly brighter from inside 
cloud    she walks over them like rain    bursts out to behold a greyhound 
bus shooting light through its sides    it is the signal to go straight 
down like a glorious diver    then feet first    her skirt stripped beautifully 
up    her face in fear-scented cloths    her legs deliriously bare    then 
arms out    she slow-rolls over    steadies out    waits for something great 
to take control of her    trembles near feathers    planes head-down 
the quick movements of bird-necks turning her head    gold eyes the insight- 
eyesight of owls blazing into the hencoops    a taste for chicken overwhelming 
her    the long-range vision of hawks enlarging all human lights of cars 
freight trains    looped bridges    enlarging the moon racing slowly 
through all the curves of a river    all the darks of the midwest blazing 
from above. a rabbit in a bush turns white    the smothering chickens 
huddle    for over them there is still time for something to live 
with the streaming half-idea of a long stoop    a hurtling    a fall 
that is controlled    that plummets as it wills    turns gravity 
into a new condition, showing its other side like a moon    shining 
new powers    there is still time to live on a breath made of nothing 
but the whole night    time for her to remember to arrange her skirt 
like a diagram of a bat    tightly it guides her    she has this flying-skin 
made of garments    and there are also those sky-divers on tv    sailing 
in sunlight    smiling under their goggles    swapping batons back and forth 
and he who jumped without a chute and was handed one by a diving 
buddy. she looks for her grinning companion    white teeth    nowhere 
she is screaming    singing hymns    her thin human wings spread out 
from her neat shoulders    the air beast-crooning to her    warbling 
and she can no longer behold the huge partial form of the world    now 
she is watching her country lose its evoked master shape    watching it lose 
and gain    get back its houses and peoples    watching it bring up 
its local lights    single homes    lamps on barn roofs    if she fell 
into water she might live    like a diver    cleaving    perfect    plunge 

into another    heavy silver    unbreathable    slowing    saving 
element there is water    there is time to perfect all the fine 
points of diving    feet together    toes pointed    hands shaped right 
to insert her into water like a needle    to come out healthily dripping 
and be handed a coca-cola    there they are    there are the waters 
of life    the moon packed and coiled in a reservoir    so let me begin 
to plane across the night air of kansas    opening my eyes superhumanly 
bright    to the damned moon    opening the natural wings of my jacket 
by don loper    moving like a hunting owl toward the glitter of water 
one cannot just fall    just tumble screaming all that time    one must use 
it    she is now through with all    through all    clouds    damp    hair 
straightened    the last wisp of fog pulled apart on her face like wool revealing 
new darks    new progressions of headlights along dirt roads from chaos 

and night    a gradual warming    a new-made, inevitable world of one's own 
country    a great stone of light in its waiting waters    hold    hold out 
for water who knows when what correct young woman must take up her body 
and fly    and head for the moon-crazed inner eye of midwest imprisoned 
water    stored up for her for years    the arms of her jacket slipping 
air up her sleeves to go    all over her? what final things can be said 
of one who starts her sheerly in her body in the high middle of night 
air    to track down water like a rabbit where it lies like life itself 
off to the right in kansas? she goes toward    the blazing-bare lake 
her skirts neat    her hands and face warmed more and more by the air 
rising from pastures of beans    and under her    under chenille bedspreads 
the farm girls are feeling the goddess in them struggle and rise brooding 
on the scratch-shining posts of the bed    dreaming of female signs 
of the moon    male blood like iron    of what is really said by the moan 
of airliners passing over them at dead of midwest midnight    passing 
over brush fires    burning out in silence on little hills    and will wake 
to see the woman they should be    struggling on the rooftree to become 
stars for her the ground is closer    water is nearer    she passes 
it    then banks    turns    her sleeves fluttering differently as she rolls 
out to face the east, where the sun shall come up from wheatfields she must 
do something with water    fly to it    fall in it    drink it    rise 
from it    but there is none left upon earth    the clouds have drunk it back 
the plants have sucked it down    there are standing toward her only 
the common fields of death    she comes back from flying to falling 
returns to a powerful cry    the silent scream with which she blew down 
the coupled door of the airliner    nearly    nearly losing hold 
of what she has done    remembers    remembers the shape at the heart 
of cloud    fashionably swirling    remembers she still has time to die 
beyond explanation. let her now take off her hat in summer air the contour 
of cornfields    and have enough time to kick off her one remaining 
shoe with the toes    of the other foot    to unhook her stockings 
with calm fingers, noting how fatally easy it is to undress in midair 
near death    when the body will assume without effort any position 
except the one that will sustain it    enable it to rise    live 
not die    nine farms hover close    widen    eight of them separate, leaving 
one in the middle    then the fields of that farm do the same    there is no 
way to back off    from her chosen ground    but she sheds the jacket 
with its silver sad impotent wings    sheds the bat's guiding tailpiece 
of her skirt    the lightning-charged clinging of her blouse    the intimate 
inner flying-garment of her slip in which she rides like the holy ghost 
of a virgin    sheds the long windsocks of her stockings    absurd 
brassiere    then feels the girdle required by regulations squirming 
off her no longer monobuttocked    she feels the girdle flutter    shake 
in her hand    and float    upward    her clothes rising off her ascending 
into cloud    and fights away from her head the last sharp dangerous shoe 
like a dumb bird    and now will drop in    soon    now will drop 

in like this    the greatest thing that ever came to kansas    down from all 
heights    all levels of american breath    layered in the lungs from the frail 
chill of space to the loam where extinction slumbers in corn tassels thickly 
and breathes like rich farmers counting will come along them after 
her last superhuman act    the last slow careful passing of her hands 
all over her unharmed body    desired by every sleeper in his dream 
boys finding for the first time their loins filled with heart's blood 
widowed farmers whose hands float under light covers to find themselves 
arisen at sunrise    the splendid position of blood unearthly drawn 
toward clouds    all feel something    pass over them as she passes 
her palms over her long legs    her small breasts    and deeply between 
her thighs    her hair shot loose from all pins    streaming in the wind 
of her body    let her come openly    trying at the last second to land 
on her back    this is it    this 
                                                          all those who find her impressed 
in the soft loam    gone down    driven well into the image of her body 
the furrows for miles flowing in upon her where she lies very deep 
in her mortal outline    in the earth as it is in cloud    can tell nothing 
but that she is there    inexplicable    unquestionable    and remember 
that something broke in them as well    and began to live and die more 
when they walked for no reason into their fields to where the whole earth 
caught her    interrupted her maiden flight    told her how to lie she cannot 
turn    go away    cannot move    cannot slide off it and assume another 
position    no sky-diver with any grin could save her    hold her in his arms 
plummet with her    unfold above her his wedding silks    she can no longer 
mark the rain with whirling women that take the place of a dead wife 
or the goddess in norwegian farm girls    or all the back-breaking whores 
of wichita. all the known air above her is not giving up quite one 
breath    it is all gone    and yet not dead    not anywhere else 
quite    lying still in the field on her back    sensing the smells 
of incessant growth try to lift her    a little sight left in the corner 
of one eye    fading    seeing something wave    lies believing 
that she could have made it    at the best part of her brief goddess 
state    to water    gone in headfirst    come out smiling    invulnerable 
girl in a bathing-suit ad    but she is lying like a sunbather at the last 
of moonlight    half-buried in her impact on the earth    not far 
from a railroad trestle    a water tank    she could see if she could 
raise her head from her modest hole    with her clothes beginning 
to come down all over kansas    into bushes    on the dewy sixth green 
of a golf course    one shoe    her girdle coming down fantastically 
on a clothesline, where it belongs    her blouse on a lightning rod 

lies in the fields    in this field    on her broken back as though on 
a cloud she cannot drop through    while farmers sleepwalk without 
their women from houses    a walk like falling toward the far waters 
of life    in moonlight    toward the dreamed eternal meaning of their farms 
toward the flowering of the harvest in their hands    that tragic cost 
feels herself go    go toward    go outward    breathes at last fully 
not    and tries    less    once    tries    tries    ah, god--


in a stable of boats i lie still, 
from all sleeping children hidden.   
the leap of a fish from its shadow   
makes the whole lake instantly tremble.   
with my foot on the water, i feel   
the moon outside 

take on the utmost of its power. 
i rise and go out through the boats.   
i set my broad sole upon silver, 
on the skin of the sky, on the moonlight,   
stepping outward from earth onto water   
in quest of the miracle 

this village of children believed   
that i could perform as i dived 
for one who had sunk from my sight.   
i saw his cropped haircut go under.   
i leapt, and my steep body flashed   
once, in the sun. 

dark drew all the light from my eyes.   
like a man who explores his death 
by the pull of his slow-moving shoulders,   
i hung head down in the cold, 
wide-eyed, contained, and alone 
among the weeds, 

and my fingertips turned into stone   
from clutching immovable blackness.   
time after time i leapt upward 
exploding in breath, and fell back   
from the change in the children's faces   
at my defeat. 

beneath them i swam to the boathouse   
with only my life in my arms 
to wait for the lake to shine back 
at the risen moon with such power   
that my steps on the light of the ripples   
might be sustained. 

beneath me is nothing but brightness   
like the ghost of a snowfield in summer.   
as i move toward the center of the lake,   
which is also the center of the moon,   
i am thinking of how i may be 
the savior of one 

who has already died in my care.   
the dark trees fade from around me.   
the moon's dust hovers together.   
i call softly out, and the child's 
voice answers through blinding water.   
patiently, slowly, 

he rises, dilating to break 
the surface of stone with his forehead.   
he is one i do not remember 
having ever seen in his life. 
the ground i stand on is trembling   
upon his smile. 

i wash the black mud from my hands.   
on a light given off by the grave   
i kneel in the quick of the moon   
at the heart of a distant forest   
and hold in my arms a child   
of water, water, water.


and now the green household is dark.   
the half-moon completely is shining   
on the earth-lighted tops of the trees.   
to be dead, a house must be still. 
the floor and the walls wave me slowly   
i am deep in them over my head.   
the needles and pine cones about me 

are full of small birds at their roundest,   
their fist without mercy gripping 
hard down through the tree to the roots   
to sing back at light when they feel it.   
we lie here like angels in bodies, 
my brothers and i, one dead, 
the other asleep from much living, 

in mid-air huddled beside me. 
dark climbed to us here as we climbed 
up the nails i have hammered all day 
through the sprained, comic rungs of the ladder   
of broom handles, crate slats, and laths 
foot by foot up the trunk to the branches   
where we came out at last over lakes 

of leaves, of fields disencumbered of earth   
that move with the moves of the spirit.   
each nail that sustains us i set here 
each nail in the house is now steadied 
by my dead brother's huge, freckled hand.   
through the years, he has pointed his hammer   
up into these limbs, and told us 

that we must ascend, and all lie here.   
step after step he has brought me,   
embracing the trunk as his body, 
shaking its limbs with my heartbeat,   
till the pine cones danced without wind   
and fell from the branches like apples.   
in the arm-slender forks of our dwelling 

i breathe my live brother's light hair.   
the blanket around us becomes 
as solid as stone, and it sways. 
with all my heart, i close 
the blue, timeless eye of my mind.   
wind springs, as my dead brother smiles   
and touches the tree at the root 

a shudder of joy runs up 
the trunk the needles tingle   
one bird uncontrollably cries. 
the wind changes round, and i stir   
within another's life. whose life? 
who is dead? whose presence is living?   
when may i fall strangely to earth, 

who am nailed to this branch by a spirit?   
can two bodies make up a third? 
to sing, must i feel the world's light?   
my green, graceful bones fill the air   
with sleeping birds. alone, alone 
and with them i move gently. 
i move at the heart of the world.


they will soon be down 

to one, but he still will be 
for a little while    still will be stopping 

the flakes in the air with a look, 
surrounding himself with the silence 
of whitening snarls. let him eat 
the last red meal of the condemned 

to extinction, tearing the guts 

from an elk. yet that is not enough 
for me. i would have him eat 

the heart, and from it, have an idea 
stream into his gnarling head 
that he no longer has a thing 
to lose, and so can walk 

out into the open, in the full 

pale of the sub-arctic sun 
where a single spruce tree is dying 

higher and higher. let him climb it 
with all his meanness and strength. 
lord, we have come to the end 
of this kind of vision of heaven, 

as the sky breaks open 

its fans around him and shimmers 
and into its northern gates he rises 

snarling    complete    in the joy of a weasel 
with an elk's horned heart in his stomach 
looking straight into the eternal 
blue, where he hauls his kind. i would have it all 

my way at the top of that tree i place 

the new world's last eagle 
hunched in mangy feathers    giving 

up on the theory of flight. 
dear god of the wildness of poetry, let them mate 
to the death in the rotten branches, 
let the tree sway and burst into flame 

and mingle them, crackling with feathers, 

in crownfire. let something come 
of it    something gigantic    legendary 

rise beyond reason over hills 
of ice    screaming    that it cannot die, 
that it has come back, this time 
on wings, and will spare no earthly thing 

that it will hover, made purely of northern 

lights, at dusk    and fall 
on men building roads will perch 

on the moose's horn like a falcon 
riding into battle    into holy war against 
screaming railroad crews will pull 
whole traplines like fibres from the snow 

in the long-jawed night of fur trappers. 

but, small, filthy, unwinged, 
you will soon be crouching 

alone, with maybe some dim racial notion 
of being the last, but none of how much 
your unnoticed going will mean 
how much the timid poem needs 

the mindless explosion of your rage, 

the glutton's internal fire    the elk's 
heart in the belly, sprouting wings, 

the pact of the blind swallowing 
thing, with himself, to eat 
the world, and not to be driven off it 
until it is gone, even if it takes 

forever. i take you as you are 

and make of you what i will, 
skunk-bear, carcajoy, bloodthirsty 

non-survivor. 
                        lord, let me die    but not die 
out.


the sea here used to look 
as if many convicts had built it, 

standing deep in their ankle chains,   
ankle-deep in the water, to smite 

the land and break it down to salt.   
i was in this bog as a child 

when they were all working all day   
to drive the pilings down. 

i thought i saw the still sun 
strike the side of a hammer in flight 

and from it a sea bird be born   
to take off over the marshes. 

as the gray climbs the side of my head   
and cuts my brain off from the world, 

i walk and wish mainly for birds, 
for the one bird no one has looked for 

to spring again from a flash 
of metal, perhaps from the scratched 

wedding band on my ring finger.   
recalling the chains of their feet, 

i stand and look out over grasses 
at the bridge they built, long abandoned, 

breaking down into water at last,   
and long, like them, for freedom 

or death, or to believe again 
that they worked on the ocean to give it 

the unchanging, hopeless look   
out of which all miracles leap.


beginning to dangle beneath 
the wind that blows from the undermined wood,   
      i feel the great pulley grind, 

      the thread i cling to lengthen   
and let me soaring and spinning down into marble, 
      hooked and weightlessly happy 

      where the squared sun shines 
back equally from all four sides, out of stone   
      and years of dazzling labor, 

      to land at last among men 
who cut with power saws a parian whiteness 
      and, chewing slow tobacco, 

      their eyebrows like frost, 
shunt house-sized blocks and lash them to cables   
      and send them heavenward 

      into small-town banks, 
into the columns and statues of government buildings,   
      but mostly graves. 

      i mount my monument and rise 
slowly and spinningly from the white-gloved men   
      toward the hewn sky 

      out of the basement of light, 
sadly, lifted through time's blinding layers   
      on perhaps my tombstone 

      in which the original shape 
michelangelo believed was in every rock upon earth   
      is heavily stirring, 

      surprised to be an angel, 
to be waked in north georgia by the ponderous play   
      of men with ten-ton blocks 

      but no more surprised than i 
to feel sadness fall off as though i myself   
      were rising from stone 

      held by a thread in midair, 
badly cut, local-looking, and totally uninspired,   
      not a masterwork 

      or even worth seeing at all 
but the spirit of this place just the same,   
      felt here as joy.


i have just come down from my father. 
higher and higher he lies 
above me in a blue light 
shed by a tinted window. 
i drop through six white floors 
and then step out onto pavement. 

still feeling my father ascend, 
i start to cross the firm street, 
my shoulder blades shining with all 
the glass the huge building can raise. 
now i must turn round and face it, 
and know his one pane from the others. 

each window possesses the sun 
as though it burned there on a wick. 
i wave, like a man catching fire. 
all the deep-dyed windowpanes flash, 
and, behind them, all the white rooms 
they turn to the color of heaven. 

ceremoniously, gravely, and weakly, 
dozens of pale hands are waving 
back, from inside their flames. 
yet one pure pane among these 
is the bright, erased blankness of nothing. 
i know that my father is there, 

in the shape of his death still living. 
the traffic increases around me 
like a madness called down on my head. 
the horns blast at me like shotguns, 
and drivers lean out, driven crazy-- 
but now my propped-up father 

lifts his arm out of stillness at last. 
the light from the window strikes me 
and i turn as blue as a soul, 
as the moment when i was born. 
i am not afraid for my father-- 
look he is grinning he is not 

afraid for my life, either, 
as the wild engines stand at my knees 
shredding their gears and roaring, 
and i hold each car in its place 
for miles, inciting its horn 
to blow down the walls of the world 

that the dying may float without fear 
in the bold blue gaze of my father. 
slowly i move to the sidewalk 
with my pin-tingling hand half dead 
at the end of my bloodless arm. 
i carry it off in amazement, 

high, still higher, still waving, 
my recognized face fully mortal, 
yet not not at all, in the pale, 
drained, otherworldly, stricken, 
created hue of stained glass. 
i have just come down from my father.


how time reverses   
the proud in heart   
i now make verses   
who aimed at art. 

but i sleep well.   
ambitious boys 
whose big lines swell   
with spiritual noise, 

despise me not 
and be not queasy   
to praise somewhat   
verse is not easy. 

but rage who will. 
time that procured me   
good sense and skill   
of madness cured me.


plato, despair 
we prove by norms 
how numbers bear 
empiric forms, 

how random wrong 
will average right 
if time be long 
and error slight, 

but in our hearts 
hyperbole 
curves and departs 
to infinity. 

error is boundless. 
nor hope nor doubt, 
though both be groundless, 
will average out.


allegiance is assigned   
forever when the mind   
chooses and stamps the will.   
thus, i must love you still   
through good and ill. 

but though we cannot part   
we may retract the heart   
and build such privacies   
as self-regard agrees   
conduce to ease. 

so manners will repair   
the ravage of despair 
which generous love invites,   
preferring quiet nights   
to vain delights.


i am no shepherd of a child's surmises. 
i have seen fear where the coiled serpent rises, 

thirst where the grasses burn in early may 
and thistle, mustard, and the wild oat stay. 

there is dust in this air. i saw in the heat 
grasshoppers busy in the threshing wheat. 

so to this hour. through the warm dusk i drove 
to blizzards sifting on the hissing stove, 

and found no images of pastoral will, 
but fear, thirst, hunger, and this huddled chill.


there is no stillness in this wood. 
the quiet of this clearing 
is the denial of my hearing 
the sounds i should. 

there is no vision in this glade. 
this tower of sun revealing 
the timbered scaffoldage is stealing 
essence from shade. 

only my love is love's ideal. 
the love i could discover 
in these recesses knows no lover, 
is the unreal, 

the undefined, unanalysed, 
unabsolute many 
it is antithesis of any, 
in none comprised.


you are the problem i propose, 
my dear, the text my musings glose 
i call you for convenience love. 
by definition you're a cause 
inferred by necessary laws-- 
you are so to the saints above. 
but in this shadowy lower life 
i sleep with a terrestrial wife 
and earthy children i beget. 
love is a fiction i must use, 
a privilege i can abuse, 
and sometimes something i forget. 

now, in the heavenly other place 
love is in the eternal mind 
the luminous form whose shade she is, 
a ghost discarnate, thought defined. 
she was so to my early bliss, 
she is so while i comprehend 
the forms my senses apprehend, 
and in the end she will be so. 

her whom my hands embrace i kiss, 
her whom my mind infers i know. 
the one exists in time and space 
and as she was she will not be 
the other is in her own grace 
and is she is eternally. 

plato you shall not plague my life. 
i married a terrestrial wife. 
and hume she is not mere sensation 
in sequence of observed relation. 
she has two forms--ah, thank you, duns--, 
i know her in both ways at once. 
i knew her, yes, before i knew her, 
and by both means i must construe her, 
and none among you shall undo her.


speak to her heart   
that manic force   
when wits depart   
forbids remorse. 

dream with her dreaming   
until her lust 
seems to her seeming   
an act of trust 

do without doing   
love's wilful potion   
veils the ensuing, 
and brief, commotion.


if wisdom, as it seems it is,
be the recovery of some bliss
from the conditions of disaster--
terror the servant, man the master--
it does not follow we should seek 
crises to prove ourselves unweak. 
much of our lives, god knows, is error, 
but who will trifle with unrest? 
these fools who would solicit terror, 
obsessed with being unobsessed 
professionals of experience
who have disasters to withstand them 
as if fear never had unmanned them, 
flaunt a presumptuous innocence.

i have preferred indifference.


after some years bohemian came to this--
this maenad with hair down and gaping kiss 
wild on the barren edge of under fifty. 
she would finance his art if he were thrifty.


this humanist whom no beliefs constrained 
grew so broad-minded he was scatter-brained.


in the thirtieth year of life 
i took my heart to be my wife, 

and as i turn in bed by night 
i have my heart for my delight. 

no other heart may mine estrange 
for my heart changes as i change, 

and it is bound, and i am free, 
and with my death it dies with me.


the plane tilts in to nashville,   
coming over the green lights   
like a toy train skipping past   
the signals on a track. 
the city is livid with lights, 
as if the weight of all the people   
shooting down her arteries   
had inflamed them. 
it's friday night, 
and people are home for the homecomings.   
as i come into the terminal, 
a young black man, in a vested gray suit,   
paces in the florid tennessee air, 
breaks into a run like a halfback 
in open field, going past the delirious faces,   
past the poster of molly bee 
in her shiny chaps, her hips tilted forward   
where the guns would be, her legs set, 
as if she would run, as if she were 
a cheerleader who doffs her guns 
on saturday afternoon and careens 
down the sidelines after some broken field runner,   
who carries it in, for now, 
for all the state of tennessee 
with its nut-smelling trees, 
its stolid little stone walls 
set out under thick blankets of leaves,   
its crisp lights dangling on the porches 
of homes that top the graveled driveways,   
where people who cannot yodel or yell   
putter in the grave october afternoons,   
waiting for saturday night and the lights   
that spatter on molly bee's silver chaps.   
i don't want to think of them, 
or even of the broken field runner in the terminal,   
still looking for his girl, his pocket 
full of dates and parties, as i come 
into this friday night of homecomings   
and hobble over the highway in a taxi   
that has its radio tuned to country music.   
i come up to the campus, 
with a large wreath jutting up 
under the elegant dormitories, 
where one girl sits looking down at the shrieking cars,   
as the lights go out, one by one, around her   
and the laughter drifts off, rising, rising,   
as if it would take flight away 
from the livid arteries of nashville. 
now, in sleep, i leave my brass-headed bed,   
and see her enter with tall singers, 
they in african shirts, she in a robe.   
she sits among them, as a golden lance   
catches her, suddenly chubby, with soft lips   
and unhurried eyes, quite still in the movement   
around her, waiting, as the other voices fade,   
as the movement stops, and starts to sing,   
her voice moving up from its tart entrance 
until it swings as freely 
as an ecstatic dancer's foot, 
rises and plays among the windows 
it would with angels and falls,   
almost visible, to return to her, 
and leave her shaking with the tears   
i'm ashamed to release, and leave her   
twisting there on that stool with my shame   
for the livid arteries, the flat saturdays,   
the inhuman homecomings of nashville.   
i kneel before her. she strokes my hair,   
as softly as she would a cat's head,   
and goes on singing, her voice shifting   
and bringing up the carolina calls,   
the waterboy, the railroad cutter, the jailed,   
the condemned, all that had been forgotten   
on this night of homecomings, all 
that had been misplaced in those livid arteries.   
she finishes, and leaves, 
her shy head tilted and wrinkled 
in the green-tinged lights of the still campus.   
i close my eyes and listen, 
as she goes out to sing this city home.


in a morning coat,

hands locked behind your back,

you walk gravely along the lines in your head.

these others stand with you, 

squinting the city into place, 

yet cannot see what you see, 

what you would see

--a vision of these paths, 

laid out like a star,

or like a body,

the seed vibrating within itself, 

breaking into the open,

dancing up to stop at the end of the universe.

i say your vision goes as far as this, 

the egg of the world,

where everything remains, and moves,

holding what is most against it against itself,

moving, as though it knew its end, against death.

in that order,

the smallest life, the small event take shape.

yes, even here at this point, 

amma's plan consumes you,

the prefigured man, nommo, the son of god.

i call you into this time,

back to that spot

and read these prefigurations 

into your mind,

and know it could not be strange to you 

to stand in the dark and emptiness 

of a city not your vision alone.

now, i have searched the texts

and forms of cities that burned,

that decayed, or gave their children away, 

have been picking at my skin,

watching my hand move,

feeling the weight and shuttle of my body, 

listening with an ear as large as god's 

to catch some familiar tone in my voice. 

now, i am here in your city,

trying to find that spot

where the vibration starts.

there must be some mistake.


over the earth, 

in an open space,

you and i step to the time

of another ceremony. 

these people, changed,

but still ours,

shake another myth 

from that egg.

some will tell you

that beginnings are only

possible here,

that only the clamor of these drums

could bring our god to earth.

a city, like a life,

must be made in purity.


so they call you,

knowing you are intimate with stars,

to create this city, this body.

so they call you,

knowing you must purge the ground.


sir, suffer me to recall to your mind that time, in which the arms and tyranny of the british crown were exerted, with every powerful effort in order to reduce you to a state of servitude look back, i entreat you, on the variety of dangers to which you were exposed reflect on that time, in which every human aid appeared unavailable, and in which even hope and fortitude wore the aspect of inability to the conflict, and you cannot but be led to a serious and grateful sense of your miraculous and providential preservation you cannot but acknowledge, that the present freedom and tranquility which you enjoy you have mercifully received, and that it is the peculiar blessing of heaven.


reflect on that time.

the spirits move, even

in the events of men,

hidden in a language

that cannot hide it.

you were never lost

in the language of number alone

you were never lost

to the seed vibrating alone,

holding all contradictions within it.

look back, i entreat you,

over your own painful escapes.


the seed now vibrates into a city,

and a man now walks where you walked.

wind and rain must assault him,

and a man must build against them.

we know now, too, that the house

must take the form of a man

--warmth at his head, movement at his feet,

his needs and his shrine at his hands.

image of shelter image of man

pulled back into himself

into the seed before the movement,

into the silence before the sound

of movement, into stillness,

which may be self-regard,

or only stillness.


recall number.

recall your calculations,

your sight, at night,

into the secrets of stars.

but still you must exorcise this ground.


here was a time, in which your tender feelings for yourselves had engaged you thus to declare, you were then impressed with proper ideas of the great violation of liberty, and the free possession of those blessings, to which you were entitled by nature but, sir, how pitiable it is to reflect, that although you were so fully convinced of the benevolence of the father of mankind, and of his equal and impartial distribution of these rights and privileges, which he hath conferred upon them, that you should at the same time counteract his mercies, in detaining by fraud and violence so numerous a part of my brethren, under groaning captivity, and cruel oppression, that you should at the same time be found guilty of that most criminal act, which you professedly detested in others, with respect to yourselves.


can we say now

that it is the god

who chains us to this place? 

is it this god

who requires the movement, 

the absence of movement,

the prefiguration of movement 

only under his control? 

if so,

what then is the reason 

for these dancers,

these invocations,

the sight of these lesser gods 

lining out the land?

how pitiable it is to reflect 

upon that god, without grace, 

without the sense of that small

beginning of movement, 

where even the god

becomes another and not himself,

himself and not another. 

so they must call you,

knowing you are intimate with stars

so they must call you,

knowing different resolutions. 

you sit in contemplation, 

moving from line to line,

struggling for a city

free of that criminal act,

free of anything but the small,

imperceptible act, which itself becomes free.

free. free. how will the lines fall 

into that configuration?

how will you clear this uneasiness, 

posting your calculations and forecasts

into a world you yourself cannot enter?

uneasy, at night,

you follow stars and lines to their limits,

sure of yourself, sure of the harmony 

of everything, and yet you moan

for the lost harmony, the crack in the universe.

your twin, i search it out, 

and call you back

your twin, i invoke

the descent of nommo.


i say your vision goes as far as this. 

and so you, benjamin banneker, 

walk gravely along these lines, 

the city a star, a body,

the seed vibrating within you, 

and vibrating still,

beyond your power,

beyond mine.


old now, 
your eyes nearly blank   
from plotting the light's 
movement over the years,   
you clean your almanac 
and place it next 
to the heart of this letter.   
i have you in mind, 
giving a final brush and twist   
to the difficult pages, 
staring down the shape of the numbers   
as though you would find a flaw   
in their forms. 
solid, these calculations 
verify your body on god's earth.   
at night, 
the stars submit themselves 
to the remembered way you turn them   
the moon gloats under your attention. 
i, who know so little of stars, 
whose only acquaintance with the moon   
is to read a myth, or to listen   
to the surge 
of songs the women know,   
sit in your marvelous reading   
of all movement, 
of all relations. 

so you look into what we see   
yet cannot see, 
and shape and take a language   
to give form to one or the other,   
believing no form will escape,   
no movement appear, nor stop,   
without explanation, 
believing no reason is only reason,   
nor without reason. 
i read all of this into your task,   
all of this into the uneasy   
reproof of your letter. 

surely, there must be a flaw. 
these perfect calculations fall apart. 
there are silences 
that no perfect number can retrieve, 
omissions no perfect line could catch.   
how could a man but challenge god's 
impartial distributions? 
how could a man sit among 
the free and ordered movements 
of stars, and waters, beasts and birds,   
each movement seen or accounted for,   
and not know god jealous, 
and not know that he himself must be? 

so you go over the pages again, 
looking for the one thing 
that will not reveal itself, 
judging what you have received, 
what you have shaped, 
believing it cannot be strange 
to the man you address. 
but you are strange to him 
--your skin, your tongue, 
the movement of your body, 
even your mysterious ways with stars.   
you argue here with the man and god,   
and know that no man can be right,   
and know that no god will argue right.   
your letter turns on what the man knows, 
on what god, you think, would have us know.   
all stars will forever move under your gaze,   
truthfully, leading you from line to line,   
from number to number, from truth to truth,   
while the man will read your soul's desire,   
searcher, searching yourself, 
losing the relations.


wolbe dich, welt wenn die totenmuschel heranschwimmt, will es hier luten.  vault over, world when the seashell of death washes up  there will be a knelling. 
--paul celan, stimmen voices

death knocks all night at my door. 
the soul answers, 
and runs from the water in my throat.   
water will sustain me when i climb   
                                  the steep hill 
that leads to a now familiar place. 
i began, even as a child, to learn water's order,   
and, as i grew intact, the feel of its warmth 
in a new sponge, of its weight in a virgin towel.   
i have earned my wine in another's misery,   
when rum bathed a sealed throat 
and cast its seal on the ground. 
i will be bound, to the one who leads me away,   
by the ornaments on my wrists, the gold dust   
in my ears, below my eye and tied to my 
                        loincloth in a leather pouch.   
they dress me now in my best cloth,   
and fold my hands, adorned with silk, 
                            against my left cheek.   
gold lies with me on my left side. 
gold has become the color of distance,   
                              and of your sorrow. 

sorrow lies, red clay on my brow. 
red pepper caresses my temples. 
i am adorned in the russet-brown message   
the soul brings from its coming-to-be.   
there is a silken despair in my body 
that grief shakes from it, 
a cat's voice, controlled by palm wine 
                                 and a widow's passion. 
it is time to feed the soul 
         --a hen, eggs, mashed yams-- 
and encourage the thirst resting 
near the right hand i see before me. 
                  always i think of death. 
                            i cannot eat. 
                  i walk in sadness, and i die. 
yet life is the invocation sealed in the coffin,   
and will walk through our wall, 
passing and passing and passing, 
                     until it is set down, 
to be lifted from this body's habitation.   
i now assume the widow's pot, 
the lamp that will lead me through solitude,   
to the edge of my husband's journey. 
i hold three stones upon my head, 
darkness i will release when i run 
from the dead, 
with my eyes turned away 
                     toward another light. 

this is the day of rising. 
a hut sits in the bush, sheltered by summe,   
standing on four forked ends. 
we have prepared for the soul's feast   
with pestle, mortar, a strainer, three   
hearthstones, a new pot and new spoon.   
someone has stripped the hut's body   
and dressed it with the edowa. 
now, when the wine speaks 
and the fire has lifted its voice, 
the dead will be clothed in hair, 
                        the signs of our grief. 
sun closes down on an intensity of ghosts.   
it is time to close the path. 
it is time for the snail's pace 
of coming again into life, 
               with the world swept clean, 
               the crying done, 
and our ordinary garments decent in the dead one's eyes.


en mi pas el otoo nace de una flor seca,  de algunos pajaros . . . o del vaho penetrante de ciertos rios de la llanura.  --molinari, oda a una larga tristeza 
each instant comes with a price, the blue-edged bill   
on the draft of a bird almost incarnadine,   
the shanked ochre of an inn that sits as still   
as the beavertail cactus it guards the fine   
rose of that flower gone as bronze as sand,   
the river's chalky white insistence as it   
moves past the gray afternoon toward sunset.   
autumn feels the chill of a late summer lit   
only by goldenrod and a misplaced strand   
of blackberries deplores all such sleight of hand   
turns sullen, selfish, envious, full of regret. 

someone more adept would mute its voice. the spill   
of its truncated experience would shine 
less bravely and, out of the dust and dunghill   
of this existence call it hope, in decline, 
as here the blue light of autumn falls, command   
what is left of exhilaration and fit 
this season's unfolding to the alphabet 
of turn and counterturn, all that implicit   
arc of a heart searching for a place to stand.   
yet even that diminished voice can withstand   
the currying of its spirit. here lies--not yet. 

if, and only if, the leafless rose he sees, 
or thinks he sees, flowered a moment ago, 
this endangered heart flows with the river that flees   
the plain, and listens with eye raised to the slow   
revelation of cloud, hoping to approve   
himself, or to admonish the rose for slight   
transgressions of the past, this the ecstatic   
ethos, a logic that seems set to reprove   
his facility with unsettling delight. 
autumn might be only desire, a twelfth night   
gone awry, a gift almost too emphatic. 

logic in a faithful light somehow appeases   
the rose, and stirs the hummingbird's vibrato.   
by moving, i can stand where the light eases   
me into the river's feathered arms, and, so,   
with the heat of my devotion, again prove   
devotion, if not this moment, pure, finite.   
autumn cradles me with idiomatic 
certainty, leaves me nothing to disapprove. 
i now acknowledge this red moon, to requite   
the heart alone given power to recite 
its faith, what a cradled life finds emblematic.


if you undo your do you would 
be strange. hair has been on my mind.   
i used to lean in the doorway 
and watch my stony woman wind 
the copper through the black, and play 
with my understanding, show me she culd   
take a cup of river water, 
and watch it shimmy, watch it change, 
turn around and become ash bone.   
wind in the cottonwoods wakes me   
to a day so thin its breastbone   
shows, so paid out it shakes me free   
of its blue dust. i will arrange   
that river water, bottom juice.   
i conjure my head in the stream   
and ride with the silk feel of it 
as my woman bathes me, and shaves   
away the scorn, sponges the grit   
of solitude from my skin, laves   
the salt water of self-esteem   
over my feathering body. 
how like joy to come upon me   
in remembering a head of hair   
and the way water would caress   
it, and stress beauty in the flair   
and cut of the only witness 
to my dance under sorrow's tree. 
this swift darkness is spring's first hour. 

i carried my life, like a stone,   
in a ragged pocket, but i 
had a true weaving song, a sly   
way with rhythm, a healing tone.


cigarettes in my mouth 
to puncture blisters in my brain.   
my bass a fine piece of furniture.   
my fingers soft, too soft to rattle   
rafters in second-rate halls. 
the harmonies i could never learn   
stick in ayler's screams. 
an african chant chokes us. my image shot. 

if you look off over the hudson, 
the dark cooperatives spit at the dinghies   
floating up the night. 

                a young boy pisses 
on lovers rolling against each other   
under a trackless el. 

         this could have been my town, 
with light strings that could stand a tempo. 

                  now, 
                  it's the end 
                  of an ethnic dream. 

i've grown intellectual, 
go on accumulating furniture and books,   
damning literature, writing for myself,   
calculating the possibilities that someone   
will love me, or sleep with me. 
eighteen-year-old girls come back from the southern   
leers and make me cry. 

                  here, there are 
                  coffee shops, bars, 
                  natural tonsorial parlors,   
                  plays, streets, 
                  pamphlets, days, sun, 
                  heat, love, anger,   
                  politics, days, and sun. 

here, we shoot off 
every day to new horizons,   
coffee shops, bars, 
natural tonsorial parlors,   
plays, streets, 
pamphlets, days, sun, 
heat, love, anger, 
politics, days, and sun. 

                  it is the end of an ethnic dream.   
                  my bass a fine piece of furniture.   
                  my brain blistered.


guadalajara--new york,  
the trees are crystal chandeliers,   
and deep in the hollow 
a child pits its voice 
against the rain. 
the city screams its prayers   
at the towers in the distance. 

those guitars again. 
and the catholic mantis   
clutching at the sky, 
a pearl of a city, 
cuando se duerme. 

subway blue boys 
now ride shotgun 
against my freedom and my fears.   
pistols snap like indignant heels, 
at midday, and we stand at the docks,   
singing a farewell we'd soon forget. 

hymns resound against that dome   
entre la fiesta y la agonia. 
worms feed on its concrete, 
or we pluck them out of bodies. 

but time to forget. 
or remember the easiness   
of leaving easy loves, 
disappearing 
in the arms of secret dreams. 

we'll sit at the end   
of a banquet board, 
and powder our tutored wigs, 
flip the pages of gentility 
in the rainy season. 

english lessons over tea   
for the price of memory. 

         il mio supplizio   
          quando 
         non mi credo   
         in armonia. 

they say the time 
is not much different. 
the strange and customary turns   
of living may coincide. 

in mariachi plaza 
travelers sing elegies to the beauty   
of revolutions and tranquillity. 

from the opposite side of the river,   
coming in, the skyline seems scrubbed   
and pointed ominously into the darkness. 

i walk through the market,   
kissing colors in a murmur   
of self-induced petition. 

two spires, 
lying against the night, 
are suddenly armed to sail. 

the water foams against the bottom,   
the way it looked when i left 
that dying city 

only a turning to feel the bark 
slope off into the night, 
with a promise to return. 

         un di, s'io non andr sempre fuggendo   
         di gente in gente, mi vedrai seduto 
         su la tua pietra, o fratel mio, gemendo   
         it fior dei tuoi gentili anni caduto. 

from line to line,   
from point to point, 
is an architect's end of cities. 

but i lie down 
to a different turbulence 
and a plan of transformation.


i write my god in blue. 
i run my gods upstream on flimsy rafts. 
i bathe my goddesses in foam, in moonlight. 
i take my reasons from my mother's snuff breath,   
or from an old woman, sitting with a lemonade,   
at twilight, on the desert's steps. 
brown by day and black by night, 
my god has wings that open to no reason. 
he scutters from the touch of old men's eyes,   
scutters from the smell of wisdom, an orb   
of light leaping from a fire. 
press him he bleeds. 
when you take your hand to sacred water,   
there is no sign of any wound. 
and so i call him supreme, great artist,   
judge of time, scholar of all living event,   
the possible prophet of the possible event.   
blind men, on bourbon, with guitars,   
blind men with their scars dulled by kola,   
blind men seeking the shelter of a raindrop,   
blind men in corn, blind men in steel,   
reason by their lights that our tongues   
are free, our tongues will redeem us.   
speech is the fact, and the fact is true.   
what is moves, and what is moving is.   
we cling to these contradictions. 
we know we will become our contradictions,   
our complex body's own desire. 
yet speech is not the limit of our vision.   
the ear entices itself with any sound.   
the skin will caress whatever tone   
or temperament that rises or descends.   
the bones will set themselves to a dance.   
the blood will argue with a bird in flight. 
the heart will scale the dew from an old chalice,   
brush and thrill to an old bone. 
and yet there is no sign to arrest us 
                                     from the possible. 
we remain at rest there, in transit 
from our knowing to our knowledge. 
so i would set a limit where i meet my logic.   
i would clamber from my own cave 
into the curve of sign, an alphabet 
of transformation, the clan's cloak of reason.   
i am good when i am in motion, 
when i think of myself at rest 
in the knowledge of my moving, 
when i have the vision of my mother at rest, 
in moonlight, her lap the cradle of my father's head.   
i am good when i trade my shells, 
and walk from boundary to boundary,   
unarmed and unafraid of another's speech.   
i am good when i learn the world 
through the touch of my present body.   
i am good when i take the cove of a cub 
                                             into my care. 
i am good when i hear the changes in my body   
echo all my changes down the years, 
when what i know indeed is what i would 
                                              know in deed. 
i am good when i know the darkness of all light, 
and accept the darkness, not as sign, but as my body.   
this is the a of absolutes, 
the logbook of judgments, 
the good sign.


it should have a woman's name, 
something to tell us how the green skirt of land 
                                           has bound its hips. 
when the day lowers its vermilion tapestry over the west ridge,   
the water has the sound of leaves shaken in a sack,   
and the child's voice that you have heard below 
                                                          sings of the sea. 

by slow movements of the earth's crust, 
or is it that her hip bones have been shaped   
by a fault of engineering? 
some coquetry cycles this blue edge, 
a spring ready to come forth to correct   
                                    love's mathematics. 

saturday rises immaculately. 
the water's jade edge plays against corn-colored   
picnic baskets, rose and lemon bottles, red balloons,   
dancers in purple tights, a roan mare out of its field.   
it is not the moment to think of bahia 
and the gray mother with her water explanation.   
not far from here, the city, a mass of swift water   
in its own depression, licks its sores. 

still, i would be eased by reasons. 
sand dunes in drifts. 
lava cuts its own bed at a mountain base.   
blindness enters where the light refuses to go.   
in loch lomond, the water flowers with algae   
and a small life has taken the name of a star. 

you will hear my star-slow heart 
empty itself with a light-swift pitch   
where the water thins to a silence. 
and the woman who will not be named   
screams in the birth of her fading away.


yo ave del agua floreciente duro en fiesta.   --deseo de persistencia, poesa nhuatl
 

in the region of rain and cloud, 
i live in shade, 
under the moss mat of days bruised 
                        purple with desire. 
my dominion is a song in the wide ring of water.   
there, i run to and fro, 
braiding the logical act 
            in the birth of an ear of corn,   
polychromatic story i will now tell 
in the weaving, power's form in motion, 
a devotion to the unstressed. 
once, i wreathed around a king, 
became a fishing net, a maze 
               a deadly wealth of robe. 
mothers who have heard me sing take heart   
i always prick them into power. 


y vengo alzando al viento la roja flor de invierno.   
i lift the red flower of winter into the wind.   
       --poesa nhuatl 


i 

out of the ninth circle, 
a phoenician boat rocks upward into light 
and the warmth of a name--given to heaven-- 
that arises in the ninth realm. 
earth's realm discloses the egyptian   
on the point of invention, 
               deprived of life and death,   
heart deep in the soul's hawk, 
a thymos shadow knapping the tombed body.   
some one or thing is always heaven bound.   
some flowered log doubles my bones.   
the spirit of toltec turtledoves escapes.   
a sharp, metaphorical cry sends me 
               into the adorned sepulchre,   
and the thing that decays learns 
                  how to speak its name. 


lift 

down hidalgo, 
past alvarado and basurto,   
i walk a straight line 
to the snailed pasco los berros.   
here, at noon, the sun, 
         a silver bead, 
veils what the dawn has displayed. 
even so, 
         i have taken up the morning's bond again   
         --the lake with its pendulum leg   
         shining in the distance, 
         the boy in white 
         hauling his bottle of chalky milk home. 
i know i sit in the deep of a city 
with its brocade of hills, 

where a thin rain is an evening's fire. 
i have heard the women sing 
near their gas lamps, 
when the rose end of day lights a hunger 
for the garlanded soups and meat they prepare. 
often, i have taken the high ground   
by the pond, over a frog's voice   
                  dampened by lilies, 
and been exalted by the soothsayer   
who knows i'm not at home. 
i am the arcane body, 
raised at the ninth hour, 
to be welcomed by the moonlight   
                     of such spirited air. 
i am the dane of degrees 
who realizes how the spirit glows   
                     even as it descends. 


red 

the heart, catalectic though it be, does glow,   
responds to every midnight bell within you.   
this is a discourse on reading heat, 
the flushed char of burned moments one sees   
after the sexton's lamp flows 
over the body's dark book. 
there is suspicion   
here that violet   
traces of 
sacrifice 
stand 
bare. 


flower 

this marble dust recalls that sunset   
with the best burgundy, and the way,   
after the charm of it, the peacocks   
escaped their cages on the green.   
i would now embellish the flame   
that ornaments you, 
even as it once in that moment   
                                          did.   
i carry you blossomed, 
cream and salt of a high crown.   
you must flare, 
          stream forth, 
blister and scale me, 
even as you structure the enveloping kiss,   
                  sporophore of our highest loss. 


winter 

under the evergreens, 
the grouse have gone under the snow.   
women who follow their fall flight   
tell us that, if you listen, you can hear   
their dove's voices ridge the air,   
a singing that follows us to a bourne 
                  released from its heat sleep.   
we have come to an imagined line, 
                            celestial, 
that binds us to the burr of a sheltered thing 
and rings us with a fire that will not dance, 
               in a horn that will not sound. 
we have learned, like these birds, 
to publish our decline, 
when over knotted apples and straw-crisp leaves,   
the slanted sun welcomes us once again 
to the arrested music in the earth's divided embrace. 


wind 

through winter, 
harmattan blacks the air. 
my body fat with oil, 
i become another star at noon,   
when the vatic insistence 
of the dog star's breath clings to me.   
though i am a woman, 
i turn south, 
toward the fire, 
and hear the spirits in the bush.   
but this is my conceit 
water will come from the west,   
and i will have my trance, 
                                        be reborn, 
perhaps in a mediterranean air,   
the rhone delta's contention   
with the eastern side of rain.   
in all these disguises, 
i follow the aroma of power. 
so i am charged in my own field,   
to give birth to the solar wind,   
particles spiraling around the line 
                            of my body, 
moving toward the disruption, 
the moment when the oil of my star at noon 
                                     is a new dawn. 


i shall go away, i shall disappear, 
i shall be stretched on a bed of yellow roses   
and the old women will cry for me. 
so the toltecas wrote their books are finished,   
but your heart has become perfect.


extravagant sweep 
                         of clear sky 
                                           darkening 
in the big picture window 
                                     beside the bed, 
lights here and there 
                               already flashing all 
across the city down below us-- 
                                              ellen 
and the girls out somewhere, 
                                          you and i alone, 
you with your eyes closed, 
                                       i with a drink in hand 
you suddenly in character, 
                                        your voice 
a wraith's voice, 
                         faint, stumbling, 
                                                   slurry 
with morphine, 
                     and yet 
                               still artful 
                                                 as ever, 
even if the art 
                      was obvious, 
the dying brother 
                      playing the dying brother-- 
do you think 
                  you have a problem 
                                             with that? 
                                                            the question   
masking a declaration, 
                                 the brother 
                                                 a savior,   
the savior a judge, 
                            not all that different from   
before except that now 
                                 the dying had   
distilled 
             all doubt away 
                                  as you repeated,   
do you think 
                  you have a 
                                 problem? 
                                                me? with what?   
i too in character now, 
                                  the character   
without character, 
                           the little brother who   

in your mind proves 
                              the truth 
                                           of all you think   
by his resistance to it, 
                                    pulling 
                                                the scene off   
by refusing to play it, 
                                  pretending not to know 
with what? 
                with that, 
                                  head tilted to the shot 
glass, 
         this? 
                   my one desire now 
                                             a little shtick, 
a final moment 
                     of material-- 
                                       this? 
a problem? 
               not at all. 
                               there's plenty more 
where that came from, 
                               almost a whole bottle. 
you imperturbable, 
                           look at yourself, 
how you sit here 
                           drinking all alone. 
                                                       well, mea 
gulpa. 
         are you happy now? 
                                     you drink 
a lot. 
         i have a lot 
                              to drink about. 
and that was that. 
                            for now you drifted off, 
or seemed to, 
                     your eyes closed, 
                                                head turned away,   
the two of us 
                     together 
                                  for the last 
time ever on the stage 
                                  of being brothers, 
our see-through 
                        figures in the picture window   
spectral and vast 
                           against the city 
                                                    flashing 
a ghostly circuitry 
                              of nerves 
                                             within 
the ancient masks we wore, 
                                        the hand i lifted, 
the drink i knocked back 
                                     in a final toast 
in honor of the timing, 
                                  the concentration 
that neither 
                   one of us 
                                  could ever break.


did you ever have a family?    
                                                    dark   
dining room, 
                  bright kitchen, 
                                        white steam 
from the big pot my mother's stirring   
reaching in wavy tendrils to her face,   
around her face, all the way around   
to me at the table, then beyond me   
into the darkness where my brother is. 

were you ever a child? 
                                             i'm hungry   
but i know we'll 
                         eat soon,      
                                           so 
even the hunger's sweet. 

did you ever really have a brother? 
                                                                  he's singing   
there in the dark 
                           corner 
                                     beside the stereo, 
the volume turned down so low   
all we hear is him, his voice, and   
his eyes are closed so that there's   
nothing around him anywhere 
that might reveal he isn't 
who the song insists he is. 

and that is? 
                           irresistible, 
unforgettable,         
                            someone         
                                              to whom   
as in imaginary gardens 
where the nectarine and curious 
peach into my hands themselves 
do reach, love comes as soon 
as called, comes just as dreamed. 

did any of this ever happen? 
                                                    the hunger's 
sweet, 
          it's as if 
                           the song weaves 
through the fragrance of the braiding   
steam from him to me to her 
to me to him because her eyes 
are closed now too her 
slippered feet tap, caper 
a soft shoe while the ladle 
sways in her hand as she stirs. 

were you ever a child? 
                                             i know 
i'll eat soon.         
                           did you ever really have a brother? 
you should have       
                            heard him,    
                                              his voice was   
unforgettable, irresistible, his voice 
was an imaginary garden woven through with fragrance.   

did you ever have a family? 
                                                   their eyes are closed.   
that's how i know      
                              we're there    
                                                   inside it,   
it's made of sound and steam 
that weaves between dark 
dining room, bright kitchen.   
we're there because i'm hungry,   
and we'll all be eating soon 
together, and the hunger's sweet.


when he was my age and i was already a boy   
my father made a machine in the garage.   
a wired piece of steel 
with many small and beautiful welds 
ground so smooth they resembled rows of pearls. 

he went broke with whatever it was.   
he held it so carefully in his arms.   
he carried it foundry to foundry.   
i think it was his harp, 
i think it was what he longed to make   
with his hands for the world. 

he moved it finally from the locked closet   
to the bedroom 
to the garage again 
where he hung it on the wall 
until i climbed and pulled it down 
and rubbed it clean 
and tried to make it work.


snow hurries 
the strawberries 
from the bush. 
star-wet water rides   
you into summer,   
into my autumn. 
your cactus hands   
are at my heart again.   
lady, i court 
my dream of you 
in lilies and in rain.   
i vest myself 
in your oldest memory   
and in my oldest need.   
and in my passion 
you are the deepest blue   
of the oldest rose.   
star circle me an axe.   
i cannot cut myself 
from any of your emblems.   
it will soon be cold here, 
and dark here 
the grass will lie flat 
to search for its spring head. 
i will bow again 
in the winter of your eyes. 
if there is music, 
it will be the weather's bells 
to call me to the abandoned chapel 
of your simple body.


never mind what you think. 
the old man did not rush 
recklessly into the coop the last minute.   
the chickens hardly stirred 
for the easy way he sang to them.   
red sun is burning out 
past slag heaps of the mill. the old man   
touches the blade of his killing knife   
with his fat thumb. 
i'm in the backyard on a quilt 
spread out under the heavy dark plums   
he cooks for his whiskey. 
he walks among the hens singing 
his chicken song way down in his throat   
until he finds the one who's ready   
and he holds her to his barrel chest. 

what did you think? 
did you think you just jerk the bird   
from her roost and hack her head off? 

beyond the coop 
i see the fleeting white dress of my grandmother   
as she crosses and recrosses the porch 
to fill the bucket with scalding water. 

how easy the feathers will come 
when she drowns them for plucking   
and clouds the air with a stench 
i can't stand not to breathe. 
i'm not even a boy yet but i watch   
the old man sing out into the yard, 
his knife already at the chicken's throat   
when everything begins to spin in my world-- 
he slices off the head without a squawk,   
and swirls the bird in circles, a fine   
blood spray fanning out far enough   
to reach me where i wait 
obediently, where i can't stop watching   
the head the old man picks up, 
his free hand becomes a puppet chicken 
clucking at me, pecking my head with the cold beak   
until i cry for him to stop, 
until he pins me down, clucking, laughing, blood   
all over his hands. 

he did it so i would remember him 
i tell myself all these years later. 
he did it because it was his last summer   
among us. in august he didn't feel the fly   
come into his cancerous ear and lay its eggs. 
he didn't feel the maggots hatch 
as he sat dazed with pills in the sun. 
he pecked my head and laughed out of love,   
out of love he snatched me roughly to his chest   
and sang his foreign songs way, 
way down in his throat.


calliope  sahu
night enters the plaza, step by step, in the singular   
flaring of lamps on churro carts, taco stands,   
benches set with deep bowls of pozole,   
on rugs embroidered with relics, crosses, bones, 
                           pamphlets, dream books. 
around this cathedral, there is an order never shaken   
all our eyes and postures speak of the certainty 
                           of being forever in place. 
these are the ones who always hear the veiled day fall, 
the street tile's serpentine hiss under the evening's drone.   
compadre, not all have come from reforma, along madero.   
there are those whose spotless white manta tells me   
they are not from here--as now, you see, a village   
wedding party come to engage the virgin's peace. 

this evening, in the zcalo, lanterns become candles, 
or starlight, whatever recalls a woman, 
beating her clothes on rocks in a village stream. 
at her side, a man buckets the muddy water for his stove.   
what does the spirit say, in its seating, 
when such impurity can console, 
and the slipped vowels of an unfamiliar name   
                               rise from the shallows?   
lovers meet here, 
and carry consummation's black weed into dawn,   
and meet again when the full moon, 
                  on its flamboyant feet, surges   
over the mud floor of a barrio saturday night.   
she, of the rock, has offered the water man 
beans, flour tortillas, cebollas encurtidas and atole,   
a hand for the bell dance that rings all night,   
the surprise of knowing the name of the horse 
that waits in the shadows when the dance has gone. 

she knows this room, where every saint has danced,   
revolves on its own foundation, 
and that the noon heat ache beneath her hair   
guides her through a love's lost steps. 
her love lies deeper than a heart's desire,   
far beyond even her hand's intention, 
when midnight at the feast sings 
with the singular arrow that flies by day,   
                                 a sagitta mortis. 
now, in her presence, i always return to hands,   
parts of that unwieldly flesh about our souls, 
where the life of fridays, the year of lent, the wilderness,   
lies and invites another danger. 

i sit at the mass, 
and mark the quail movement of the priests' hands,   
as they draw submission from us. 
the long night of atonement that burrs our knees   
                                  feeds those hands. 
but there are other hands--our own, yet another's-- 
in the mortar, in the glass, 
             tight with blood and innocence. 
a cathedral moment may last for centuries,   
given to us as a day, and a day, and half a day,   
as a baroque insistence lying over classic form, 
as the womb from which the nation rises whole.   
inside there, the nation walks the chinese rail,   
arrives at the altar of pardon, 
                                    lingers, goes on, 
to the grotto where the kings stand in holy elation.   

perhaps, this reticent man and woman will find   
that moment of exhilaration in marriage, born 
on the mud floor when they entered each other   
for the good hidden in each, in flesh that needs 
                                           no propitiation. 
there must be a canticle, a love-song, 
an epithalamion, a marriage song of god, to our souls,   
wrapped up, if we would open it, and read it. 

             adorar es dar para recibir. 
how much we have given to this cathedral's life.   
how often we have heard prophecies of famine,   
or war, or pestilence, advocacies of labor   
and fortune that have failed to sustain. 
compadre, i wish i were clever enough to sleep   
in a room of saints, and close my senses 
to the gaming, the burl of grilled meat and pulque,   
the sweet talk of political murders, the corrido   
laughter that follows a jefe to his bed, 
all these silences, all these intimations   
of something still to be constructed. 
but forgive me for knowing this, 
                that i have been touched by fire, 
and that, even in spiritual things, nothing is perfect.   
and this i understand, 
in the cathedral grotto, where the kings have buckled on   
their customary deeds, the darkest lady has entered.   
be still, and hear the singing, while calliope encounters 
                                                             the saints. 
the wedding party, 
austerely figured in this man and woman,   
advances to the spot where the virgin 
                         once sat to receive us.


for my wife
after the storm, after the rain stopped pounding,   
we stood in the doorway watching horses   
walk off lazily across the pasture's hill. 
we stared through the black screen, 
our vision altered by the distance 
so i thought i saw a mist 
kicked up around their hooves when they faded   
like cut-out horses 
away from us. 
the grass was never more blue in that light, more   
scarlet beyond the pasture 
trees scraped their voices into the wind, branches   
crisscrossed the sky like barbed wire 
but you said they were only branches. 

okay. the storm stopped pounding. 
i am trying to say this straight for once   
i was sane enough to pause and breathe   
outside my wild plans and after the hard rain   
i turned my back on the old curses. i believed   
they swung finally away from me ... 

but still the branches are wire 
and thunder is the pounding mortar,   
still i close my eyes and see the girl   
running from her village, napalm   
stuck to her dress like jelly, 
her hands reaching for the no one   
who waits in waves of heat before her. 

so i can keep on living, 
so i can stay here beside you, 
i try to imagine she runs down the road and wings   
beat inside her until she rises   
above the stinking jungle and her pain 
eases, and your pain, and mine. 

but the lie swings back again. 
the lie works only as long as it takes to speak   
and the girl runs only as far 
as the napalm allows 
until her burning tendons and crackling   
muscles draw her up 
into that final position 

burning bodies so perfectly assume. nothing   
can change that she is burned behind my eyes   
and not your good love and not the rain-swept air   
and not the jungle green 
pasture unfolding before us can deny it.


					
					there was another life of cool summer mornings, the dogwood air and the slag stink so gray like our monsoon which we loved for the rain and cool wind until the rot came into us. and i remember the boys we were the evening of our departure, our mothers waving through the train's black pluming exhaust they were not proud in their tears of our leaving, so don't tell me to shut up about the war or i might pull something from my head, from my head, from my head that you wouldn't want to see and whoever the people are might be offended.  from the green country you reconstruct in your brain, from the rubble and stink of your occupation, there is no moving out. a sweet boy who got drunk and brave on our long ride into the state draws a maze every day on white paper, precisely in his room of years as if you could walk into it. all day he draws and imagines his platoon will return from the burning river where he sent them sixteen years ago into fire. he can't stop seeing the line of trees explode in white phosphorous blossoms and the liftship sent for them spinning uncontrollably beyond hope into the citadel wall. only his mother comes these days, drying the fruit in her apron or singing the cup of hot tea into his fingers which, like barbed wire, web the air.
				

 

because this evening miss hoang yen 
sat down with me in the small 
tiled room of her family house 
i am unable to sleep. 
we shared a glass of cold and sweet water.   
on a blue plate her mother brought us 
cake and smiled her betel-black teeth at me   
but i did not feel strange in the house 
my country had tried to bomb into dust.   
in english thick and dazed as blood 
she told me how she watched our planes   
cross her childhood's sky, 
all the children of hanoi 
carried in darkness to mountain hamlets, nixon's   
christmas bombing. she let me hold her hand,   
her shy unmoving fingers, and told me 
how afraid she was those days and how this fear   
had dug inside her like a worm and lives   
inside her still, won't die or go away. 
and because she's stronger, she comforted me,   
said i'm not to blame, 
the million sorrows alive in her gaze. 
with the dead we share no common rooms. 
with the frightened we can't think straight   
no words can bring the burning city back.   
outside on hung dao street 
i tried to say good-bye and held her hand   
too long so she looked back through traffic   
towards her house and with her eyes   
she told me i should leave. 
all night i ached for her and for myself   
and nothing i could think or pray 
would make it stop. some birds sang morning   
home across the lake. in small reed boats   
the lotus gatherers sailed out 
among their resuming white blossoms. 

                                           hanoi, 


a boy who knew enough to save for something   
like the whim that took me downtown on the bus   
one lost saturday morning of my mother's birthday,   
i sat in the back where the gasoline smell   
made me dizzy and i closed my eyes but didn't   
think of her, only of myself, basking in the light   
and love that would fall down on me when i   
handed her the box and she untied the bow to save 
and lifted something shining out and held it up before us   
like a promise taking shape for once in her hands,   
though i didn't know what to buy, the bus door   
hissing behind me because i'm in some kind of   
state now, a trance that comes when you pull   
at the cords of light that connect the mother to the boy,   
the  department store 
opening up before me like a jeweled city.   
in lingerie i found myself 
surrounded by those torsos sheened in silk,   
dreaming my mother, feeling the silk against me,   
the two of us moving through a cloudy room   
in a dance i can't remember until shame comes.   
from out of nowhere the matron frowned,   
asked what i wanted, hovered over me. 
confused and afraid i whispered, without thinking, 
the black hose with rhinestones down the seams please 
and pointed to the pair across the room   
stretched over legs on the glass counter   
as if about to step off 
and i saw her in my mind slip them on,   
her skirt hiked above the garters, the sun   
catching in her tangled hair 
until the matron made a sound in her throat   
and looked at me with eyes that said   
what's wrong with you dirty boy. 

all the way home a sweet ache rocked me,   
the silver package riding my lap 
like a heavy wrong thing 
i couldn't give up no matter how it 
dragged me down to a place 
where i could barely breathe or see or feel.   
whatever happened that spinning afternoon-- 
she ran her fingers over the rhinestone seams 
or she didn't, she wore them out into an evening 
or kept them forever in her drawer of impossible things-- 
doesn't matter. i would find my way into the light 
of another woman into whose arms i fall 
nights my fingers can't tear through the dark   
that eats me, the silk stretched across her breasts,   
the need for something womanly to raise me up   
pounding in my head until i curl in sleep   
away from those longings, ancient and blue.


that night we drank warm whiskey   
in our parked car 
beyond woods now lost to the suburbs,   
i fell in love with you. 

what waited was the war   
like a bloody curtain,   
and a righteous moment   
when the lovely boy's 

spine was snapped, 
then the long falling into hell. 
but lately, you've been calling me 
back through the years of bitter silence 

to tell me of another river of blood   
and of the highland's 
howl at dusk of human voices   
blasted into ecstasy. 

that night in sweet lorain   
we drank so long and hard   
we raised ourselves 
above the broken places, 

mill fires burning 
red against the sky. why   
is there is no end   
to this unraveling.


i watch the woods for deer as if i'm armed. 
i watch the woods for deer who never come.   
i know the hes and shes in autumn 
rendezvous in orchards stained with fallen   
apples' scent. i drive my car this way to work   
so i may let the crows in corn believe 
it's me their caws are meant to warn, 
and snakes who turn in warm and secret caves 

they know me too. they know the boy 
who lives inside me still won't go away. 
the deer are ghosts who slip between the light   
through trees, so you may only hear the snap   
of branches in the thicket beyond hope.   
i watch the woods for deer, as if i'm armed.


with focus sharp as flemish-painted face 
in film of varnish brightly fixed
and through a polished hand-lens deeply seen, 
sunday at noon through hyaline thin air 
sees down the street,
and in the camera of my eye depicts 
row-houses and row-lives
glass after glass, door after door the same, 
face after face the same, the same,
the brutal visibility the same

as if one life emerging from one house 
would pause, a single image caught between 
two facing mirrors where vision multiplies
beyond perspective,
a silent clatter in the high-speed eye 
spinning out photo-circulars of sight.

i see slip to the curb the long machines
out of whose warm and windowed rooms pirouette 
shellacked with silk and light
the hard legs of our women.
our women are one woman, dressed in black. 
the carmine printed mouth
and cheeks as soft as muslin-glass belong
outright to one dark dressy man,
merely a swagger at her curvy side.
this is their visit to themselves
all day from porch to porch they weave
a nonsense pattern through the even glare, 
stealing in surfaces
cold vulgar glances at themselves.

and high up in the heated room all day
i wait behind the plate glass pane for one, 
hot as a voyeur for a glimpse of one,
the vision to blot out this woman's sheen 
all day my sight records expensively 
row-houses and row-lives.

but nothing happens no diagonal
with melting shadow falls across the curb
neither the blinded negress lurching through fatigue, 
nor exiles bleeding from their pores,
nor that bright bomb slipped lightly from its rack 
to splinter every silvered glass and crystal prism,
witch-bowl and perfume bottle
and billion candle-power dressing-bulb, 
no direct hit to smash the shatter-proof 
and lodge at last the quivering needle
clean in the eye of one who stands transfixed 
in fascination of her brightness.


o hideous little bat, the size of snot, 
with polyhedral eye and shabby clothes, 
to populate the stinking cat you walk 
the promontory of the dead man's nose, 
climb with the fine leg of a duncan-phyfe
   the smoking mountains of my food 
      and in a comic mood 
   in mid-air take to bed a wife.

riding and riding with your filth of hair 
on gluey foot or wing, forever coy,
hot from the compost and green sweet decay, 
sounding your buzzer like an urchin toy--
you dot all whiteness with diminutive stool,
   in the tight belly of the dead
      burrow with hungry head
   and inlay maggots like a jewel.

at your approach the great horse stomps and paws 
bringing the hurricane of his heavy tail
shod in disease you dare to kiss my hand
which sweeps against you like an angry flail 
still you return, return, trusting your wing 
   to draw you from the hunter's reach
      that learns to kill to teach
   disorder to the tinier thing.

my peace is your disaster. for your death 
children like spiders cup their pretty hands 
and wives resort to chemistry of war.
in fens of sticky paper and quicksands
you glue yourself to death. where you are stuck 
   you struggle hideously and beg,
      you amputate your leg
   imbedded in the amber muck.

but i, a man, must swat you with my hate, 
slap you across the air and crush your flight, 
must mangle with my shoe and smear your blood, 
expose your little guts pasty and white,
knock your head sidewise like a drunkard's hat, 
   pin your wings under like a crow's,
      tear off your flimsy clothes
   and beat you as one beats a rat.

then like gargantua i stride among
the corpses strewn like raisins in the dust, 
the broken bodies of the narrow dead
that catch the throat with fingers of disgust. 
i sweep. one gyrates like a top and falls
   and stunned, stone blind, and deaf
      buzzes its frightful f
   and dies between three cannibals.


the light has traveled unthinkable thousands of miles to be   
condensed, recharged, and poured off the white white pages 
of an open bible the country parson holds in front of this couple   
in a field, in july, in the sap and the flyswirl of july 
in upper wisconsin, where their vows buzz in a ring in the air 
like the flies, and are as sweet as the sap, in these rich and ritual minutes.   
is it sentimental? oops. and out of that bible the light continues   
to rush as if from a faucet. there will be a piecrust cooling   
out of its own few x'ed-out cuts. and will it make us run   
for the picklier taste of irony rolled around protectively on our tongues   
like a grab of greek olives? my students and i discuss this   
slippery phenomenon. does context matter? does 
earned count? if a balled-up fidget of snakes 
in the underbrush dies in a freeze is it sentimental? no,   
yes, maybe. what if a litter of cocker spaniels? what 
if we called them puppydogs in the same poem in that same hard,   
hammering winter? when my father was buried, 
the gray snow in the cemetery was sheet tin. if i said 
that? yes, no, what does tone or history do 
to the hollywood hack violinists who patiently wait to play   
the taut nerves of the closest human body until from that   
lush cue alone, the eyes swell moistly, and the griefs 
we warehouse daily take advantage of this thinning 
of our systems, then the first sloppy gushes begin . . . 
is that wrong? did i tell you the breaths 
of the gravediggers puffed out like factorysmoke 
as they bent and straightened, bent and straightened, 
mechanically? are wise old toothless black blues singers   
sentimental?--gran'ma? country cookin'? but 
they have their validity, don't they, yes? their 
sweat-in-the-creases, picking up the lighting 
in a fine-lined mesh of what it means to have gone through time   
alive a little bit on this planet. hands shoot up . . . opinions . . . 
questions . . . what if the sun wept? the moon? why, in the face 
of those open faces, are we so squeamish? call out 
the crippled girl and her only friend the up-for-sale foal,   
and let her tootle her woeful pennywhistle musics. 
what if some chichi streetwise junkass from the demimonde 
gave forth with the story of orphans forced through howling storm   
to the workhouse, letting it swing between the icy-blue   
quotation marks of cynicism--then? what if   
i wept? what if i simply put the page down,   
rocked my head in my own folded elbows, forgot   
the rest of it all, and wept? what if i stepped into   
the light of that page, a burnished and uncompromising   
light, and walked back up to his stone a final time,   
just that, no drama, and it was so cold, 
and the air was so brittle, metal buckled 
out song like a bandsaw, and there, from inside me,   
where they'd been lost in shame and sophistry 
all these years now, every last one of my childhood's   
heartwormed puppydogs found its natural voice. 



it stops the town we come through. workers raise 
their oily arms in good salute and grin. 
kids scream as at a circus. business men 
glance hopefully and go their measured way. 
and women standing at their dumbstruck door 
more slowly wave and seem to warn us back, 
as if a tear blinding the course of war
might once dissolve our iron in their sweet wish.

fruit of the world, o clustered on ourselves 
we hang as from a cornucopia
in total friendliness, with faces bunched
to spray the streets with catcalls and with leers. 
a bottle smashes on the moving ties
and eyes fixed on a lady smiling pink
stretch like a rubber-band and snap and sting 
the mouth that wants the drink-of-water kiss.

and on through crummy continents and days, 
deliberate, grimy, slightly drunk we crawl,
the good-bad boys of circumstance and chance, 
whose bucket-helmets bang the empty wall 
where twist the murdered bodies of our packs 
next to the guns that only seem themselves. 
and distance like a strap adjusted shrinks, 
tightens across the shoulder and holds firm.

here is a deck of cards out of this hand 
dealer, deal me my luck, a pair of bulls,
the right draw to a flush, the one-eyed jack. 
diamonds and hearts are red but spades are black, 
and spades are spades and clubs are clovers--black. 
but deal me winners, souvenirs of peace. 
this stands to reason and arithmetic, 
luck also travels and not all come back.

trains lead to ships and ships to death or trains, 
and trains to death or trucks, and trucks to death, 
or trucks lead to the march, the march to death, 
or that survival which is all our hope
and death leads back to trucks and trains and ships, 
but life leads to the march, o flag at last 
the place of life found after trains and death--
nightfall of nations brilliant after war.


mail-day, and over the world in a thousand drag-nets 
      the bundles of letters are dumped on the docks and beaches,
      and all that is dear to the personal conscious reaches 
around us again like filings around iron magnets, 
and war stands aside for an hour and looks at our faces 
of total absorption that seem to have lost their places.

o demobilized for a moment, a world is made human, 
      returns to a time that is neither the present or then, 
      but a garland of clippings and wishes of who-knows-when,
a time of its own creation, a thing of acumen
that keeps us, like movies, alive with a purpose, aside 
from the play-acting truth of the newsreel in which we have died.

and aside from the candy and pictures and books we receive,
      as if we were patients whose speedy recovery were certain,
      there is proof of the end and the lights and the bow at the curtain,
after which we shall smile at each other and get up to leave.
aside from the play in the play there is all that is fact,
these letters, the battle in progress, the place of the act.

and the optimal joy of the conflict, the tears of the ads 
      may move us or not, and the movies at night in the palms
      may recall us or not to the kiss, and on sunday the psalms
may remind us of sunday or not, but aside from the lads 
who arrive like our letters still fresh from the kiss and the tear,
there are mouths that are dusty and eyes that are wider than fear.

say no more of the dead than a prayer, say no more of the land
      where the body is laid in the coral than that it is far 
      take your finger away from the map of wherever-we-are,
for we lie in the map of the chart of your elderly hand 
do not hasten the future in agony too there is time
for the growth of the rose of the spirit astir in the slime.

for aside from ourselves as we are there is nothing alive 
      except as it keeps us alive, not tomorrow but now, 
      our mail-day, today of the blood of the sweat of our brow,
the year of our war to the end. when and where we arrive
is no matter, but how is the question we urgently need, 
how to love and to hate, how to die, how to write and to read.



what should the wars do with these jigging fools?
the man behind the book may not be man, 
his own man or the book's or yet the time's, 
but still be whole, deciding what he can 
in praise of politics or german rimes

but the intellectual lights a cigarette
and offers it lit to the lady, whose odd smile 
is the merest hyphen--lest he should forget 
what he has been resuming all the while.

he talks to overhear, she to withdraw
to some interior feminine fireside
where the back arches, beauty puts forth a paw 
like a black puma stretching in velvet pride,

making him think of cats, a stray of which 
some days sets up a howling in his brain, 
pure interference such as this neat bitch 
seems to create from listening disdain.

but talk is all the value, the release,
talk is the very fillip of an act,
the frame and subject of the masterpiece 
under whose film of age the face is cracked.

his own forehead glows like expensive wood, 
but back of it the mind is disengaged,
self-sealing clock recording bad and good 
at constant temperature, intact, unaged.

but strange, his body is an open house 
inviting every passerby to stay
the city to and fro beneath his brows
wanders and drinks and chats from night to day.

think of a private thought, indecent room 
where one might kiss his daughter before bed 
life is embarrassed shut the family tomb, 
console your neighbor for his recent dead

do something die in spain or paint a green 
gouache, go into business rimbaud did, 
or start another little magazine,
or move in with a woman, have a kid.

invulnerable, impossible, immune,
do what you will, your will will not be done 
but dissipate the light of afternoon
till evening flickers like the midnight sun,

and midnight shouts and dies i'd rather be 
a milkman walking in his sleep at dawn 
bearing fat quarts of cream, and so be free, 
crossing alone and cold from lawn to lawn.

i'd rather be a barber and cut hair
than walk with you in gilt museum halls, 
you and the puma-lady, she so rare 
exhaling her silk soul upon the walls.

go take yourselves apart, but let me be 
the fault you find with everyman. i spit, 
i laugh, i fight and you, l'homme qui rt
swallow your stale saliva, and still sit.



the gates clanged and they walked you into jail 
more tense than felons but relieved to find
the hostile world shut out, the flags that dripped 
from every mother's windowpane, obscene 
the bloodlust sweating from the public heart, 
the dog authority slavering at your throat. 
a sense of quiet, of pulling down the blind 
possessed you. punishment you felt was clean.

the decks, the catwalks, and the narrow light 
composed a ship. this was a mutinous crew 
troubling the captains for plain decencies, 
a mayflower brim with pilgrims headed out 
to establish new theocracies to west,
a noah's ark coasting the topmost seas 
ten miles above the sodomites and fish. 
these inmates loved the only living doves.

like all men hunted from the world you made 
a good community, voyaging the storm 
to no safe plymouth or green ararat
trouble or calm, the men with bibles prayed, 
the gaunt politicals construed our hate. 
the opposite of all armies, you were best 
opposing uniformity and yourselves
prison and personality were your fate.

you suffered not so physically but knew 
maltreatment, hunger, ennui of the mind. 
well might the soldier kissing the hot beach 
erupting in his face damn all your kind. 
yet you who saved neither yourselves nor us 
are equally with those who shed the blood 
the heroes of our cause. your conscience is 
what we come back to in the armistice.


i am an atheist who says his prayers.

i am an anarchist, and a full professor at that. i take the loyalty oath.

i am a deviate. i fondle and contribute, backscuttle and brown, father of three.

i stand high in the community. my name is in who's who. people argue about my modesty.

i drink my share and yours and never have enough. i free-load officially and unofficially.

a physical coward, i take on all intellectuals, established poets, popes, rabbis, chiefs of staff.

i am a mystic. i will take an oath that i have seen the virgin. under the dry pandanus, to the scratching of kangaroo rats, i achieve psychic onanism. my tree of nerves electrocutes itself.

i uphold the image of america and force my luck. i write my own ticket to oblivion.

i am of the race wrecked by success. the audience brings me news of my death. i write out of boredom, despise solemnity. the wrong reason is good enough for me.

i am of the race of the prematurely desperate. in poverty of comfort i lay gunpowder plots. i lapse my insurance.

i am the babbitt metal of the future. i never read more than half of a book. but that half i read forever.

i love the palimpsest, statues without heads, fertility dolls of the continent of mu. i dream prehistory, the invention of dye. the palms of the dancers' hands are vermillion. their heads oscillate like the cobra. high-caste woman smelling of earth and silk, you can dry my feet with your hair.

i take my place beside the philistine and unfold my napkin. this afternoon i defend the marines. i goggle at long cars.

without compassion i attack the insane. give them the horsewhip

the homosexual lectures me brilliantly in the beer booth. i can feel my muscles soften. he smiles at my terror.

pitchpots flicker in the lemon groves. i gaze down on the plains of hollywood. my fine tan and my arrogance, my gray hair and my sneakers, o israel

wherever i am i become. the power of entry is with me. in the doctor's office a patient, calm and humiliated. in the foreign movies a native, shabby enough. in the art gallery a person of authority there's a secret way of approaching a picture. others move off. the high official insults me to my face. i say nothing and accept the job. he offers me whiskey.

how beautifully i fake i convince myself with men's room jokes and epigrams. i paint myself into a corner and escape on pulleys of the unknown. whatever i think at the moment is true. turn me around in my tracks i will take your side.

for the rest, i improvise and am not spiteful and water the plants on the cocktail table.


fire isn't allowed, for the sake of the books.
the lean monk-copyist who scribes the books is slate-blue at his fingertips
this steely late-november day in the year . brother ambrosio 
huffs some perfunctory warmth on his stiffening hands, 
then bends again to his goat's-horn of ink. for every line, 
he believes, he's forgiven a sin. and now he's at his heavy 
uncial letters, and will be for nine hours more,
until a slab of bread and a beet relieve his transcriptual ardor. 
what he copies?--psalter, missal, hagiography
the predetermined and sanctioned community passions 
of a religious culture. nothing like the twentieth century's 
prevalent kneejerk self-expression. nothing like the priest,

excuse me former priest, and former nun, on daytime talk tv, 
who live, she tells us, in a trinity of love with the former 
creator-of-tourist-ashtrays-out-of-catfish-heads. this is, 
she insists, the final and jubilant stage of a lifelong quest 
to feel belongingness initiated thirty years before 
by parents skittering cross-country with the military they 
were wholly rootless, and so she grew up unable to commit. the following day, 
a man confesses to pedophilia because of a lesbian aunt. 
a woman says she robbed the sack-n-save of . 
because of what they're dumping in the water supply, it makes me 
go all freaky. steve was bounced out from the chicken shack 
because i'm scandinavian. the culture

of blame is so completely exterior in its search for cause, 
some days i wake to think i'll find most people laboring
under the weight of sci-fi-style mind parasites, like fleshy turbans 
spewing in, and feeding off, their brain blood. this by this
i mean of course a recognition of the magic of objective correlative 
boppin' about in the spotlight is, to some length, 
understandable you can't beat the miniscule carry-along 
convenience of a silicon chip invisibly set in something, 
but for sheer persuasive visual power, that can't touch 
a s generating plant, its giant alcatrazian shape 
against the sky, and the enormous wrestling electrical crackles 
snaking its rooftop pylon. in the scriptorium, even

--such an isolated unit of human endeavor, its limited range 
of reactions surely is pure--when brother ambrosio 
nods off, sleepy in his long day's long eighth hour 
of thickly nibbed and careful letters, he knows
it's imps in league with satan that keep pulling down his eyelids. 
if in scratching his flea-measled thigh he spills 
a hand's-expanse of ink across the vellum page, the fleas 
are tiny devils on a guerilla mission from hell. 
and once a devilkin took lodging in his belly, and there 
created rumbling noises like a toad, and which, for hours, 
spoiled the concentration of all of the other brothers. 
we find parchment scraps with appropriate exorcisms

away you flaming sow, you poisoned udder,
you arse of the arch-fiend, shit-fly, stinking he-goat, 
out out out, away, back into thine infernal kitchen,
you bestial puke we also find
those charming marginal doodles sprigs in flower, 
unicorns, seemingly every songbird in creation such 
diminutive external bodies given to the longings of these 
cooped-up men. and when they came to drag my friend jess 
screaming to the ward, because he was beating his head 
on the lawyer's steps, it was clear to us all that the chemicals 
in his mind had turned against him. it was clear to jess
that he was being hunted like prey by hounds from the moon.



two hands lie still, the hairy and the white, 
and soon down ladders of reflected light 
the sleepers climb in silence. gradually 
they separate on paths of long ago,
each winding on his arm the unpleasant clew 
that leads, live as a nerve, to memory.

but often when too steep her dream descends, 
perhaps to the grotto where her father bends 
to pick her up, the husband wakes as though 
he had forgotten something in the house. 
motionless he eyes the room that glows 
with the little animals of light that prowl

this way and that. soft are the beasts of light 
but softer still her hand that drifts so white 
upon the whiteness. how like a water-plant 
it floats upon the black canal of sleep, 
suspended upward from the distant deep 
in pure achievement of its lovely want

quietly then he plucks it and it folds
and is again a hand, small as a child's.
he would revive it but it barely stirs
and so he carries it off a little way
and breaks it open gently. now he can see 
the sweetness of the fruit, his hand eats hers.


 dante gabriel rossetti buried his young wife elizabeth rossetti with a sheaf of his unpublished poems.
 
. . . and then of course the weeping some demurely, some 
flamboyantly. those elegiac tears, if shed
enough, will alter a face and the person
behind the face. we all know that erosion

is a mighty thing, and even--for example--
the seemingly permanent, hard-black mississippi banks 
undo and slip south. in a sense, the delta
at new orleans--the land gone silt, and rebuilt--

is the mississippi's second thought. my pet, 
your wiles have altered my earlier obstinacy,
and the vision of you in your luxury stateroom beckons
i shall join you for your voyage on the gigantic

--what? oh. titanic--is a tragic second thought.
a happy one when skyler and i decided to try again 
to save the marriage. now we're lazing in a pour 
of sunday morning light as orangely voluptuous

as marmalade. a simile's a first thought,
then an equaled next. she slips back into sleep,
and now i'm reading about the night that shady london dandy 
charles augustus howell  unshoveled the grave

at highgate, broke the coffin, and looted her bone breast
of the book in question, bound in rough gray calf, and with 
red edges to the leaves, on eager orders from rossetti 
--who'd had second thoughts in seven years, desiring

to publish now a volume of his verses , poems. 
lizzie's death-stenched pages were saturated
with disinfectant by a medical practitioner who
is drying them leaf by leaf--and then they joined the world

of woven radish baskets, bobbered fishing skeins, and god dolls 
in their second life as art on a museum wall a world where 
the conversion pool saw swimmers step in white robes
from its farther end, reborn to new religion and the lumbering

land animals said no, and gave up legs, and so their legs rolled up 
like stored-away and useless rugs inside them, and they returned 
to the waters, and birthed and breached in the waters,
and made the waters their orchestral glory,

and spouted out their great ionic columns of air and water 
in the touch of the changing mind of earth,
that's sunlit at times
and at other times darkened.



    the bugle sounds the measured call to prayers, 
    the band starts bravely with a clarion hymn, 
    from every side, singly, in groups, in pairs,
each to his kind of service comes to worship him.

    our faces washed, our hearts in the right place, 
    we kneel or stand or listen from our tents 
    half-naked natives with their kind of grace
move down the road with balanced staffs like mendicants.

    and over the hill the guns bang like a door 
    and planes repeat their mission in the heights. 
    the jungle outmaneuvers creeping war
and crawls within the circle of our sacred rites.

    i long for our disheveled sundays home, 
    breakfast, the comics, news of latest crimes, 
    talk without reference, and palindromes,
sleep and the philharmonic and the ponderous times.

    i long for lounging in the afternoons
    of clean intelligent warmth, my brother's mind, 
    books and thin plates and flowers and shining spoons,
and your love's presence, snowy, beautiful, and kind.


the name of his native country pronounced on a distant shore 
could not please the ears of a traveller more than hearing 
the words nitrogen, oxidation of iron and hygrometer.
--alexander von humboldt, nineteenth-century scientist-explorer 
when visiting a distant and imponderable shire, 
one longs to hear the cry hygrometer
fresh hygrometer for sale yes, and when the fair 
sex sidles close and coyly murmurs nitrogen
into a burly masculine ear, i guarantee you the translation 
is very easy. the allurements of a local siren,

whispering the kind of patois a traveler like lord byron 
favors, never fail to comfort, and to reassure,
evoking pleasant memories of one's own beloved hygrometer 
at home, kept fresh in cosmoline and camphor
and awaiting one's rearrival back in his native xenon and nitrogen. 
without these occasional reminiscences, any translation

from nation to nation, tongue to tongue, becomes a translation 
difficult to sustain. i think of my grandmother we're not hirin' 
today go away dumb jew--her share
of the language that greeted her here in the land of alien hygrometer 
and freedom, where she was only one more funny-skirted for-
eigner yearning to hear a lulling hungarian nitrogen

hum her to sleep. eventually, of course, the american nitrogen 
sufficed. her daughter could speak, in free translation,
both uranium and argon and her granddaughter gigs with fire 'n 
ice, a skinhead punk-grunge group that performs in sheer
black nighties and clown wigs--she plays mean electric hygrometer 
in the first set and then, for a twofer,

very american, that plays paper-and-comb. far
out. she's so fluent in various world wide webbery that nitrogen 
in a thousand different inflections is her birthright, and almost any translation, 
mind to mind, gender to gender, is second nature. i earn
my keep, i party, i sleep is her motto. though she's for-
tunate in having a lover who's ceo at hygrometer,

potassium, klein & wong it helps to pay the hygrometer 
man when he knocks at the door. i won't say that they fear 
this guy exactly, but he's a major badass nitrogen-
sucking cyberwired ninja-kicking shitheel or, translation
call him sir. it makes one pine for a land where the birds all choir in 
sweetly trilling melodies on a flower-scented shore,

and a translation sings all night. row gen-
tly toward it. the tender forests sigh, and the soft whirr 
of the hygrometer promises oxidation of iron.



as a sloop with a sweep of immaculate wing on her delicate spine
and a keel as steel as a root that holds in the sea as she leans,
leaning and laughing, my warm-hearted beauty, you ride, you ride,
you tack on the curves with parabola speed and a kiss of goodbye,
like a thoroughbred sloop, my new high-spirited spirit, my kiss.

as my foot suggests that you leap in the air with your hips of a girl,
my finger that praises your wheel and announces your voices of song,
flouncing your skirts, you blueness of joy, you flirt of politeness,
you leap, you intelligence, essence of wheelness with silvery nose,
and your platinum clocks of excitement stir like the hairs of a fern.

but how alien you are from the booming belts of your birth and the smoke
where you turned on the stinging lathes of detroit and lansing at night
and shrieked at the torch in your secret parts and the amorous tests,
but now with your eyes that enter the future of roads you forget
you are all instinct with your phosphorous glow and your streaking hair.

and now when we stop it is not as the bird from the shell that i leave
or the leathery pilot who steps from his bird with a sneer of delight,
and not as the ignorant beast do you squat and watch me depart,
but with exquisite breathing you smile, with satisfaction of love,
and i touch you again as you tick in the silence and settle in sleep.


each morning he'd anoint the room's four corners 
with an arc of piss, and then--until 
he was forcibly halted--beat his forehead open
on the eastern wall, the sunrise wall, 
incanting a doggerel prayer about god
the flower, god of the hot plucked heart and
she, if loose in the halls, would join him,
squatting in the center of the room and masturbating 
with a stolen bar of soap. this isn't why 
they were sent to the madhouse this is what 
they needed to do once in the madhouse this 
is the only meaningful ritual they could fashion 
there, created from the few, make-do 
materials available. it isn't wondrous strange 
more than the mega-boozhwah formulaic splendor 
of my sister's wedding ten, eleven years ago 
her opulent bouquet of plastic flowers 
for the wilting pour of wattage at the photo session, 
nigglingly arranged to match the real bouquet 
she carried down the aisle, bloom per bloom 
the five-foot taj mahal of sculpted pastel sherbet 
endless fiddler on the roof i'm sorry 
now i cranked my academic sneer hauteur in place 
all night. i'm sorry i didn't lose myself 
like a drunken bee in a room-sized rose, 
in waltzing auntie sally to the lush swell 
of the band. we need this thing. there's not one 
mineral in stonehenge that our blood can't also raise. 
one dusk, one vividly contusion-color 
dusk, with my fists in my pockets and 
a puzzle of fish-rib clouds in the sky, i 
stopped at the low-level glow of a basement window 
hot good noodle shop and furtively looked in
a full-grown pig was splayed on the table,
stunned but fitfully twitching, it looked as if
it had grasshoppers under its skin. a man and a woman 
slit that body jaw-to-ass with an ornate knife, 
and then they both scooped out a tumble 
of many dozens of wasps, preserved
by the oils of living pig to a beautiful black and amber 
gem-like sheen. i saw it. did i
see it? from inside this, over their wrists 
in the tripes, they carefully removed
the wooden doll of a man and the wooden doll of a woman 
maybe two inches tall, a tiny lacquered sun 
and matching brass coin of a moon, and then 
a child's-third-grade-version of a house 
made out of pallid wax a square of walls, 
a pyramid roof, and a real smoking chimney.



traveling through the dark i found a deer 
dead on the edge of the wilson river road. 
it is usually best to roll them into the canyon 
that road is narrow to swerve might make more dead. 

by glow of the tail-light i stumbled back of the car   
and stood by the heap, a doe, a recent killing   
she had stiffened already, almost cold. 
i dragged her off she was large in the belly. 

my fingers touching her side brought me the reason-- 
her side was warm her fawn lay there waiting,   
alive, still, never to be born. 
beside that mountain road i hesitated. 

the car aimed ahead its lowered parking lights   
under the hood purred the steady engine. 
i stood in the glare of the warm exhaust turning red   
around our group i could hear the wilderness listen. 

i thought hard for us all--my only swerving--,   
then pushed her over the edge into the river.

it causes the man to do what he and the woman had promised   
they never would one night while she's asleep, he snoops   
her bureau for telltale relics of the mysterious mr.   
number one. and why, or even what 
he hopes to find, he couldn't clearly say a letter? photo?   
sex toy?--something, some objectified gossip, a fossil   
of bygone love. essentially, we make of our own psyches   
a bureau and pay a shrink to snoop as for the moment   
when our neural linkage first began to form, 
as for the flavor of the fluids in the womb. . . we're all 

amnesiacs and our earliest self, just like the universe's   
earliest being, is a phantom limb with the faintest   
mnemonic of starbursts in an otherwise chill void. i have   
a friend d l this poem is hers who, orphaned   
as a newborn, is devoted to learning her origin 
as doggedly as any cosmologist tracks light to its source, although   
her search when not pure internet is more a matter 
of tape-recording the beer-sour stories in sailor bars, 
of sifting ashy memories in nursing homes, 
one backwards inch of plotline at a time. and yet somebody 

else is waking up this morning with the need   
to be detached from any history, 
to stand here like a person in a play who enters   
onstage from a pool of perfect blankness. then, 
of course, he can start over, minute-zero-of-year-zero,   
unbesmirched. we could have told him that he'd be this   
anguished--sneaking in her drawer, below those folded   
pastel lozenges of lingerie, uncovering the one thing   
that could ruin them. now he wants only to float who   
doesn't, sometimes? in an anti-world appealing, but 

illusory. we can't unmoor ourselves from linearity,   
no more than any one of us can be a human being   
unconnected to a genome--and in fact, no more   
than mama-all-of-time-and-space-herself i mean   
the cosmos can unwrap her vasty body from its own   
twelve million years of big bang background radiation   
so it wafts--a tossed off, filmy scarf--far elsewhere.   
no there isn't any elsewhere. when we sleep   
or simply deepen into quietude enough, the voices   
come--the rhythmic, grave, ancestral murmur, 

a woman bearing a ritual clamshell bowl . . . 
a man with a done-deal sales contract . . . whispers, 
knuckle-rap, cleared throats. . . . her great-grandfather,   
d l has uncovered, was a lector--a reader they used   
to relieve the tedium of the leaf rollers' shifts   
in cigar manufactories. shakespeare, dickens,   
union tracts, love letters, family diaries . . . . he's   
walking through the tobacco aroma he's setting his text   
on his easel and the story--the only story we know,   
the story of before--is recited. 



at noon in the desert a panting lizard   
waited for history, its elbows tense,   
watching the curve of a particular road   
as if something might happen. 

it was looking at something farther off   
than people could see, an important scene   
acted in stone for little selves 
at the flute end of consequences. 

there was just a continent without much on it   
under a sky that never cared less.   
ready for a change, the elbows waited.   
the hands gripped hard on the desert.


the renewal project is doomed because 
its funding board's vice-president resigned because   
the acids of divorce were eating day-long   
at her stomach, at her thoughts because 
her husband was neglecting her, in favor of his daughter, 
who was dying because her husband, 
bi and edgy, bore an aids sore that was ripe   
enough with fear and woe to throw this whole   
thick network of connections off its balance 
and down a hole of human misery. haven't we seen it happen?   
--when a crowded room at a party was tilted   
perilously askew by the weight of two   
wept tears that weren't as large as a housefly's wings,   
that couldn't have filled a pistachio shell. 

 


it's like this because because because, 
sawyer was drunk when he delivered his opening remarks   
onstage at stardome planetarium. he 
stood below a slide show of the emptiness of outer space   
--stars and planets, scattered like the scantest 
motes of dust in unimaginable void--and was about   
to make the leap to what percent of us, 
our dearly thumping bodies, is a corresponding emptiness . . .   
when one foot met a wire that had strayed 
outside the curtain, and a wild arc of hand undid 
the podium, which canted off its casters sidelong 
into the -d galaxy props, and you could say whatever   
thimble or pustule or hackle of grief was his, 
it had toppled the whole damn universe. 

 


was she a ghost? sometimes she thought she was 
a ghost, transparent, stealing through the lives of people   
untouched and untouching. and so she carried a bucket   
of burning coals we'll call it that for now against   
her breasts and then she knew she was alive. and   
he. . . ?--was just the rusty foxing that an antique book   
exhales into dim air, wasn't that what he was,   
oh it was, yes it was, and so one afternoon he strapped   
a meteorite to his back, and now he walks the streets   
like anybody else. an ageless tribal saying   
if you aren't given a burden, you must carve own.   
an eye will do, if it's ill. one word, if it's cruel.   
and don't be fooled by breath the throat holds up   
some old-time blues the way a hod holds bricks. 

 


but she didn't die of full-blown aids 
--sawyer's daughter. even so, her twisted legs and limp   
are enough to sometimes send him a little 
over the blotto line. tonight, though, after show time,   
he's just soused enough to wander through the mock-up   
stage-set milky ways agog with child-wonder 
all those luminescent islands all that vacuum 
look a planet floats, there's that much cosmos   
all around it. a planet while we . . . we couldn't   
squint and levitate a half inch, not the guru-most 
among us. well, we could if the laws of the universe changed.   
it's only the earth that makes us so heavy. 
it's only our lives that keep our lives 
from floating off into the nothing. 



sometimes up out of this land   
a legend begins to move. 
is it a coming near 
of something under love? 

love is of the earth only,   
the surface, a map of roads   
leading wherever go miles   
or little bushes nod. 

not so the legend under,   
fixed, inexorable, 
deep as the darkest mine   
the thick rocks won't tell. 

as fire burns the leaf 
and out of the green appears   
the vein in the center line 
and the legend veins under there, 

so, the world happens twice-- 
once what we see it as 
second it legends itself 
deep, the way it is.


mine was a midwest home--you can keep your world.   
plain black hats rode the thoughts that made our code.   
we sang hymns in the house the roof was near god. 

the light bulb that hung in the pantry made a wan light,   
but we could read by it the names of preserves-- 
outside, the buffalo grass, and the wind in the night. 

a wildcat sprang at grandpa on the fourth of july   
when he was cutting plum bushes for fuel, 
before indians pulled the west over the edge of the sky. 

to anyone who looked at us we said, my friend   
liking the cut of a thought, we could say hello. 
but plain black hats rode the thoughts that made our code. 

the sun was over our town it was like a blade.   
kicking cottonwood leaves we ran toward storms.   
wherever we looked the land would hold us up.


when we first moved here, pulled   
the trees in around us, curled   
our backs to the wind, no one   
had ever hit the moon--no one. 
now our trees are safer than the stars,   
and only other people's neglect   
is our precious and abiding shell, 
pierced by meteors, radar, and the telephone. 

from our snug place we shout 
religiously for attention, in order to hide   
only silence or evasion will bring 
dangerous notice, the hovering hawk 
of the state, or the sudden quiet stare   
and fatal estimate of an alerted neighbor. 

this message we smuggle out in   
its plain cover, to be opened   
quietly friends everywhere-- 
we are alive those moon rockets   
have missed millions of secret   
places best wishes. 

burn this.


setting a trotline after sundown 
if we went far enough away in the night   
sometimes up out of deep water 
would come a secret-headed channel cat, 

eyes that were still eyes in the rush of darkness,   
flowing feelers noncommittal and black, 
and hidden in the fins those rasping bone daggers,   
with one spiking upward on its back. 

we would come at daylight and find the line sag,   
the fishbelly gleam and the rush on the tether   
to feel the swerve and the deep current 
which tugged at the tree roots below the river.


anyone with quiet pace who 
walks a gray road in the west 
may hear a badger underground where   
in deep flint another time is 

caught by flint and held forever,   
the quiet pace of god stopped still.   
anyone who listens walks on   
time that dogs him single file, 

to mountains that are far from people,   
the face of the land gone gray like flint.   
badgers dig their little lives there,   
quiet-paced the land lies gaunt, 

the railroad dies by a yellow depot,   
town falls away toward a muddy creek.   
badger-gray the sod goes under 
a river of wind, a hawk on a stick.


all the sioux were defeated. our clan   
got poor, but a few got richer. 
they fought two wars. i did not 
take part. no one remembers your vision   
or even your real name. now   
the children go to town and like   
loud music. i married a christian. 

crazy horse, it is not fair 
to hide a new vision from you. 
in our schools we are learning 
to take aim when we talk, and we have   
found out our enemies. they shift when   
words do they even change and hide   
in every person. a teacher here says   
hurt or scorned people are places   
where real enemies hide. he says   
we should not hurt or scorn anyone,   
but help them. and i will tell you   
in a brave way, the way crazy horse   
talked that teacher is right. 

i will tell you a strange thing 
at the rodeo, close to the grandstand,   
i saw a farm lady scared by a blown   
piece of paper and at that place   
horses and policemen were no longer   
frightening, but suffering faces were,   
and the hunched-over backs of the old. 

crazy horse, tell me if i am right 
these are the things we thought we were   
doing something about. 

in your life you saw many strange things,   
and i will tell you another now i salute   
the white man's flag. but when i salute   
i hold my hand alertly on the heartbeat   
and remember all of us and how we depend   
on a steady pulse together. there are those   
who salute because they fear other flags   
or mean to use ours to chase them   
i must not allow my part of saluting   
to mean this. all of our promises,   
our generous sayings to each other, our   
honorable intentions--those i affirm   
when i salute. at these times it is like   
shutting my eyes and joining a religious 
colony at prayer in the gray dawn   
in the deep aisles of a church. 

now i have told you about new times.   
yes, i know others will report 
different things. they have been caught   
by weak ways. i tell you straight 
the way it is now, and it is our way,   
the way we were trying to find. 

the chokecherries along our valley 
still bear a bright fruit. there is good 
pottery clay north of here. i remember 
our old places. when i pass the musselshell 
i run my hand along those old grooves in the rock.


whispering to each handhold, i'll be back,   
i go up the cliff in the dark. one place   
i loosen a rock and listen a long time 
till it hits, faint in the gulf, but the rush 
of the torrent almost drowns it out, and the wind-- 
i almost forgot the wind it tears at your side   
or it waits and then buffets you sag outward. . . . 

i remember they said it would be hard. i scramble   
by luck into a little pocket out of 
the wind and begin to beat on the stones 
with my scratched numb hands, rocking back and forth 
in silent laughter there in the dark-- 
made it again oh how i love this climb 
--the whispering to stones, the drag, the weight   
as your muscles crack and ease on, working   
right. they are back there, discontent, 
waiting to be driven forth. i pound 
on the earth, riding the earth past the stars   
made it again made it again


ours are the streets where bess first met her   
cancer. she went to work every day past the   
secure houses. at her job in the library 
she arranged better and better flowers, and when   
students asked for books her hand went out   
to help. in the last year of her life 
she had to keep her friends from knowing   
how happy they were. she listened while they 
complained about food or work or the weather.   
and the great national events danced   
their grotesque, fake importance. always 

pain moved where she moved. she walked   
ahead it came. she hid it found her.   
no one ever served another so truly   
no enemy ever meant so strong a hate.   
it was almost as if there was no room   
left for her on earth. but she remembered 
where joy used to live. she straightened its flowers   
she did not weep when she passed its houses   
and when finally she pulled into a tiny corner   
and slipped from pain, her hand opened 
again, and the streets opened, and she wished all well.


cold nights outside the taverns in wyoming 
pickups and big semis lounge idling, letting their   
haunches twitch now and then in gusts of powder snow,   
their owners inside for hours, forgetting as well   
as they can the miles, the circling plains, the still town   
that connects to nothing but cold and space and a few   
stray ribbons of pavement, icy guides to nothing   
but bigger towns and other taverns that glitter and wait   
denver, cheyenne. 

hibernating in the library of the school on the hill   
a few pieces by thomas aquinas or saint teresa 
and the fragmentary explorations of people like alfred   
north whitehead crouch and wait amid research folders   
on energy and military recruitment posters glimpsed   
by the hard stars. the school bus by the door, a yellow   
mound, clangs open and shut as the wind finds a loose   
door and worries it all night, letting the hollow   
students count off and break up and blow away   
over the frozen ground.


aristotle was a little man with 
eyes like a lizard, and he found a streak 
down the midst of things, a smooth place for his feet   
much more important than the carved handles   
on the coffins of the great. 

he said you should put your hand out   
at the time and place of need 
strength matters little, he said, 
nor even speed. 

his pupil, a king's son, died 
at an early age. that aristotle spoke of him   
it is impossible to find--the youth was   
notorious, a conqueror, a kid with a gang,   
but even this aristotle didn't ever say. 

around the farthest forest and along   
all the bed of the sea, aristotle studied   
immediate, local ways. many of which   
were wrong. so he studied poetry.   
there, in pity and fear, he found man. 

many thinkers today, who stand low and grin,   
have little use for anger or power, its palace   
or its prison-- 
but quite a bit for that little man 
with eyes like a lizard.


the green catalpa tree has turned 
all white the cherry blooms once more.   
in one whole year i haven't learned   
a blessed thing they pay you for.   
the blossoms snow down in my hair   
the trees and i will soon be bare. 

the trees have more than i to spare.   
the sleek, expensive girls i teach,   
younger and pinker every year,   
bloom gradually out of reach. 
the pear tree lets its petals drop   
like dandruff on a tabletop. 

the girls have grown so young by now   
i have to nudge myself to stare. 
this year they smile and mind me how   
my teeth are falling with my hair.   
in thirty years i may not get 
younger, shrewder, or out of debt. 

the tenth time, just a year ago,   
i made myself a little list 
of all the things i'd ought to know,   
then told my parents, analyst,   
and everyone who's trusted me   
i'd be substantial, presently. 

i haven't read one book about 
a book or memorized one plot.   
or found a mind i did not doubt. 
i learned one date. and then forgot.   
and one by one the solid scholars   
get the degrees, the jobs, the dollars. 

and smile above their starchy collars. 
i taught my classes whitehead's notions   
one lovely girl, a song of mahler's.   
lacking a source-book or promotions,   
i showed one child the colors of   
a luna moth and how to love. 

i taught myself to name my name, 
to bark back, loosen love and crying   
to ease my woman so she came,   
to ease an old man who was dying.   
i have not learned how often i 
can win, can love, but choose to die. 

i have not learned there is a lie 
love shall be blonder, slimmer, younger   
that my equivocating eye 
loves only by my body's hunger 
that i have forces, true to feel, 
or that the lovely world is real. 

while scholars speak authority 
and wear their ulcers on their sleeves,   
my eyes in spectacles shall see 
these trees procure and spend their leaves.   
there is a value underneath 
the gold and silver in my teeth. 

though trees turn bare and girls turn wives,   
we shall afford our costly seasons 
there is a gentleness survives 
that will outspeak and has its reasons.   
there is a loveliness exists, 
preserves us, not for specialists.


after experience taught me that all the ordinary   
surroundings of social life are futile and vain 

         i'm going to show you something very   
         ugly someday, it might save your life. 

seeing that none of the things i feared contain   
in themselves anything either good or bad 

         what if you get caught without a knife   
         nothing--even a loop of piano wire 

excepting only in the effect they had   
upon my mind, i resolved to inquire 

         take the first two fingers of this hand 
         fork them out--kind of a v for victory-- 

whether there might be something whose discovery   
would grant me supreme, unending happiness. 

         and jam them into the eyes of your enemy.   
         you have to do this hard. very hard. then press 

no virtue can be thought to have priority   
over this endeavor to preserve one's being. 

         both fingers down around the cheekbone   
         and setting your foot high into the chest 

no man can desire to act rightly, to be blessed,   
to live rightly, without simultaneously 

         you must call up every strength you own   
         and you can rip off the whole facial mask. 

wishing to be, to act, to live. he must ask   
first, in other words, to actually exist. 


                           and you, whiner, who wastes your time 
                              dawdling over the remorseless earth,   
                           what evil, what unspeakable crime 
                              have you made your life worth? 



instructions for the visit
admire, when you come here, the glimmering hair   
of the girl praise her pale 
complexion. think well of her dress   
though that is somewhat out of fashion.   
don't try to take her hand, but smile for   
her hesitant gentleness. 
say the old woman is looking strong   
today such hardiness. remark, 
perhaps, how she has dressed herself black   
like a priest, and wears that sufficient air   
that does become the righteous. 
as you approach, she will push back   
her chair, shove away her plate 
and wait, 
sitting squat and direct, before 
the red mahogany chest 
massive as some great 
safe will wait, 
by the table and her greasy plate, 
the bone half-chewed, her wine half-drained   
she will wait. and fix her steady 
eyes on you--the straight stare 
of an old politician. 
try once to meet her eyes. but fail.   
let your sight 
drift--yet never as if hunting for 
the keys you keep imagining hung   
by her belt. they are not there. 
watch, perhaps, that massive chest--the way   
it tries to lean 
forward, toward her, till it seems to rest   
its whole household's weight 
of linens and clothing and provisions   
all on her stiff back. 
it might be strapped there like the monstrous pack   
of some enchanted pedlar. dense, self-contained,   
like mercury in a ball, 
she can support this without strain,   
yet she grows smaller, wrinkling   
like a potato, parched as dung   
it cramps her like a fist. 
ask no one why the chest 
has no knobs. betray 
no least suspicion 
the necessities within 
could vanish at her 
will. try not to think 
that as she feeds, gains 
specific gravity, 
she shrinks, light- 
less as the world's 
hard core 
and the per- 
spective drains 
in her. 
finally, above all, 
you must not ever see, 
or let slip one hint you can see,   
on the other side, the girl's 
cuffs, like cordovan restraints 
forget her bony, tentative wrist, 
the half-fed, worrying eyes, and how   
she backs out, bows, and tries to bow   
out of the scene, grows too ethereal   
to make a shape inside her dress 
and the dress itself is beginning already   
to sublime itself away like a vapor   
that merges into the empty twinkling   
of the air and of the bright wallpaper.


the eyelids glowing, some chill morning. 
o world half-known through opening, twilit lids   
    before the vague face clenches into light 
o universal waters like a cloud, 
    like those first clouds of half-created matter 
o all things rising, rising like the fumes 
    from waters falling, o forever falling 
infinite, the skeletal shells that fall, relinquished, 
    the snowsoft sift of the diatoms, like selves   
downdrifting age upon age through milky oceans 
    o slow downdrifting of the atoms 
o island nebulae and o the nebulous islands 
    wandering these mists like falsefires, which are true,   
bobbing like milkweed, like warm lanterns bobbing 
    through the snowfilled windless air, blinking and passing   
as we pass into the memory of women 
    who are passing. within those depths   
what ravening? what devouring rage? 
    how shall our living know its ends of yielding?   
these things have taken me as the mouth an orange-- 
    that acrid sweet juice entering every cell   
and i am shared out. i become these things 
    these lilies, if these things are water lilies   
which are dancers growing dim across no floor 
    these mayflies whirled dust orbiting in the sun 
this blossoming diffused as rushlights galactic vapors 
    fluorescence into which we pass and penetrate   
o soft as the thighs of women 
    o radiance, into which i go on dying ...


up the reputable walks of old established trees 
they stalk, children of the nouveaux riches chimes 
of the tall clock tower drench their heads in blessing   
i don't wanna play at your house 
i don't like you any more. 
my house stands opposite, on the other hill, 
among meadows, with the orchard fences down and falling   
deer come almost to the door. 
you cannot see it, even in this clearest morning. 
white birds hang in the air between 
over the garbage landfill and those homes thereto adjacent,   
hovering slowly, turning, settling down 
like the flakes sifting imperceptibly onto the little town   
in a waterball of glass. 
and yet, this morning, beyond this quiet scene, 
the floating birds, the backyards of the poor, 
beyond the shopping plaza, the dead canal, the hillside lying tilted in the air, 

tomorrow has broken out today 
riot in algeria, in cyprus, in alabama 
aged in wrong, the empires are declining, 
and china gathers, soundlessly, like evidence. 
what shall i say to the young on such a morning?-- 
mind is the one salvation?--also grammar?-- 
no my little ones lean not toward revolt. they 
are the whites, the vaguely furiously driven, who resist   
their souls with such passivity 
as would make quakers swear. all day, dear lord, all day   
they wear their godhead lightly. 
they look out from their hill and say, 
to themselves, we have nowhere to go but down   
the great destination is to stay. 
surely the nations will be reasonable 
they look at the world--don't they?--the world's way?   
the clock just now has nothing more to say.


for cynthia  when he would not return to fine garments and good food, to his houses and his people, loingseachan told him, your father is dead. i'm sorry to hear it, he said. your mother is dead, said the lad. all pity for me has gone out of the world. your sister, too, is dead. the mild sun rests on every ditch, he said a sister loves even though not loved. suibhne, your daughter is dead. and an only daughter is the needle of the heart. and suibhne, your little boy, who used to call you daddy--he is dead. aye, said suibhne, that's the drop that brings a man to the ground.  he fell out of the yew tree loingseachan closed his arms around him and placed him in manacles.

child of my winter, born 
when the new fallen soldiers froze 
in asia's steep ravines and fouled the snows,   
when i was torn 


by love i could not still, 
by fear that silenced my cramped mind 
to that cold war where, lost, i could not find   
my peace in my will, 

all those days we could keep 
your mind a landscape of new snow 
where the chilled tenant-farmer finds, below,   
his fields asleep 

in their smooth covering, white 
as quilts to warm the resting bed 
of birth or pain, spotless as paper spread   
for me to write, 

and thinks here lies my land 
unmarked by agony, the lean foot 
of the weasel tracking, the thick trapper's boot   
and i have planned 

my chances to restrain 
the torments of demented summer or   
increase the deepening harvest here before   
it snows again. 

 
    late april and you are three today 
         we dug your garden in the yard. 
    to curb the damage of your play, 
strange dogs at night and the moles tunneling,   
    four slender sticks of lath stand guard   
         uplifting their thin string. 

    so you were the first to tramp it down. 
         and after the earth was sifted close   
    you brought your watering can to drown 
all earth and us. but these mixed seeds are pressed   
    with light loam in their steadfast rows. 
         child, we've done our best. 

    someone will have to weed and spread 
         the young sprouts. sprinkle them in the hour   
    when shadow falls across their bed. 
you should try to look at them every day   
    because when they come to full flower 
         i will be away. 

 
the child between them on the street   
comes to a puddle, lifts his feet 
    and hangs on their hands. they start   
at the live weight and lurch together,   
recoil to swing him through the weather, 
    stiffen and pull apart. 

we read of cold war soldiers that 
never gained ground, gave none, but sat   
    tight in their chill trenches. 
pain seeps up from some cavity 
through the ranked teeth in sympathy   
    the whole jaw grinds and clenches 

till something somewhere has to give.   
it's better the poor soldiers live 
    in someone else's hands 
than drop where helpless powers fall   
on crops and barns, on towns where all   
    will burn. and no man stands. 

for good, they sever and divide 
their won and lost land. on each side   
    prisoners are returned 
excepting a few unknown names.   
the peasant plods back and reclaims   
    his fields that strangers burned 

and nobody seems very pleased. 
it's best. still, what must not be seized   
    clenches the empty fist. 
i tugged your hand, once, when i hated   
things less a mere game dislocated   
    the radius of your wrist. 

love's wishbone, child, although i've gone   
as men must and let you be drawn   
    off to appease another, 
it may help that a chinese play 
or solomon himself might say 
    i am your real mother. 

 
         no one can tell you why   
    the season will not wait 
         the night i told you i 
must leave, you wept a fearful rate   
             to stay up late. 

         now that it's turning fall,   
    we go to take our walk 
         among municipal 
flowers, to steal one off its stalk,   
             to try and talk. 

         we huff like windy giants 
    scattering with our breath   
         gray-headed dandelions 
spring is the cold wind's aftermath. 
             the poet saith. 

         but the asters, too, are gray, 
    ghost-gray. last night's cold   
         is sending on their way 
petunias and dwarf marigold, 
             hunched sick and old. 

         like nerves caught in a graph,   
    the morning-glory vines 
         frost has erased by half 
still scrawl across their rigid twines.   
             like broken lines 

         of verses i can't make. 
    in its unraveling loom 
         we find a flower to take, 
with some late buds that might still bloom,   
             back to your room. 

         night comes and the stiff dew.   
    i'm told a friend's child cried   
         because a cricket, who 
had minstreled every night outside   
             her window, died. 

 
winter again and it is snowing   
although you are still three,   
you are already growing 
strange to me. 

you chatter about new playmates, sing   
strange songs you do not know   
hey ding-a-ding-a-ding 
or where i go 

or when i sang for bedtime, fox 
went out on a chilly night, 
before i went for walks 
and did not write 

you never mind the squalls and storms   
that are renewed long since 
outside the thick snow swarms 
into my prints 

and swirls out by warehouses, sealed,   
dark cowbarns, huddled, still, 
beyond to the blank field, 
the fox's hill 

where he backtracks and sees the paw,   
gnawed off, he cannot feel 
conceded to the jaw 
of toothed, blue steel. 

 
         easter has come around 
    again the river is rising 
         over the thawed ground 
    and the banksides. when you come you bring   
         an egg dyed lavender. 
    we shout along our bank to hear 
our voices returning from the hills to meet us.   
    we need the landscape to repeat us. 

         you lived on this bank first. 
    while nine months filled your term, we knew 
         how your lungs, immersed 
    in the womb, miraculously grew 
         their useless folds till 
    the fierce, cold air rushed in to fill 
them out like bushes thick with leaves. you took your hour,   
    caught breath, and cried with your full lung power. 

         over the stagnant bight 
    we see the hungry bank swallow 
         flaunting his free flight 
    still we sink in mud to follow 
         the killdeer from the grass 
    that hides her nest. that march there was 
rain the rivers rose you could hear killdeers flying   
    all night over the mudflats crying. 

         you bring back how the red- 
    winged blackbird shrieked, slapping frail wings,   
         diving at my head-- 
    i saw where her tough nest, cradled, swings   
         in tall reeds that must sway 
    with the winds blowing every way. 
if you recall much, you recall this place. you still   
    live nearby--on the opposite hill. 

         after the sharp windstorm 
    of july fourth, all that summer 
         through the gentle, warm 
    afternoons, we heard great chain saws chirr 
         like iron locusts. crews 
    of roughneck boys swarmed to cut loose 
branches wrenched in the shattering wind, to hack free   
    all the torn limbs that could sap the tree. 

         in the debris lay 
    starlings, dead. near the park's birdrun 
         we surprised one day 
    a proud, tan-spatted, buff-brown pigeon. 
         in my hands she flapped so 
    fearfully that i let her go. 
her keeper came. and we helped snarl her in a net.   
    you bring things i'd as soon forget. 

         you raise into my head 
    a fall night that i came once more 
         to sit on your bed 
    sweat beads stood out on your arms and fore- 
         head and you wheezed for breath, 
    for help, like some child caught beneath 
its comfortable woolly blankets, drowning there.   
    your lungs caught and would not take the air. 

         of all things, only we 
    have power to choose that we should die   
             nothing else is free 
    in this world to refuse it. yet i, 
         who say this, could not raise   
    myself from bed how many days 
to the thieving world. child, i have another wife,   
    another child. we try to choose our life. 

 
here in the scuffled dust 
    is our ground of play. 
i lift you on your swing and must   
    shove you away, 
see you return again, 
    drive you off again, then 

stand quiet till you come. 
    you, though you climb   
higher, farther from me, longer, 
    will fall back to me stronger.   
bad penny, pendulum, 
    you keep my constant time 

to bob in blue july 
    where fat goldfinches fly 
over the glittering, fecund   
    reach of our growing lands. 
once more now, this second, 
    i hold you in my hands. 

 
i thumped on you the best i could   
         which was no use 
you would not tolerate your food   
until the sweet, fresh milk was soured   
         with lemon juice. 

that puffed you up like a fine yeast. 
    the first june in your yard 
like some squat nero at a feast 
you sat and chewed on white, sweet clover.   
         that is over. 

when you were old enough to walk   
         we went to feed 
the rabbits in the park milkweed   
saw the paired monkeys, under lock,   
    consume each other's salt. 

going home we watched the slow   
stars follow us down heaven's vault. 
you said, let's catch one that comes low, 
         pull off its skin 
    and cook it for our dinner. 

    as absentee bread-winner, 
i seldom got you such cuisine 
we ate in local restaurants 
or bought what lunches we could pack   
         in a brown sack 

with stale, dry bread to toss for ducks   
    on the green-scummed lagoons,   
crackers for porcupine and fox, 
life-savers for the footpad coons   
         to scour and rinse, 

snatch after in their muddy pail   

    and stare into their paws. 
when i moved next door to the jail   
         i learned to fry 
omelettes and griddlecakes so i 

could set you supper at my table.   
as i built back from helplessness,   
         when i grew able, 
the only possible answer was   
    you had to come here less. 

this hallowe'en you come one week.   
         you masquerade 
    as a vermilion, sleek, 
fat, crosseyed fox in the parade   
or, where grim jackolanterns leer, 

go with your bag from door to door   
foraging for treats. how queer 
    when you take off your mask 
my neighbors must forget and ask 
         whose child you are. 

of course you lose your appetite,   
    whine and won't touch your plate   
         as local law 
i set your place on an orange crate   
in your own room for days. at night 

you lie asleep there on the bed   
         and grate your jaw. 
assuredly your father's crimes   
         are visited 
on you. you visit me sometimes. 

the time's up. now our pumpkin sees   
    me bringing your suitcase. 
         he holds his grin 
the forehead shrivels, sinking in. 
you break this year's first crust of snow 

off the runningboard to eat. 
    we manage, though for days 
i crave sweets when you leave and know   
they rot my teeth. indeed our sweet 
         foods leave us cavities. 

 
    i get numb and go in 
though the dry ground will not hold 
    the few dry swirls of snow   
and it must not be very cold.   
a friend asks how you've been 
         and i don't know 

    or see much right to ask. 
or what use it could be to know. 
    in three months since you came   
the leaves have fallen and the snow   
your pictures pinned above my desk 
         seem much the same. 

    somehow i come to find 
myself upstairs in the third floor   
    museum's halls, 
walking to kill my time once more   
among the enduring and resigned   
         stuffed animals, 

    where, through a century's 
caprice, displacement and 
    known treachery between 
its wars, they hear some old command   
and in their peaceable kingdoms freeze   
         to this still scene, 

    nature morte. here 
by the door, its guardian, 
    the patchwork dodo stands 
where you and your stepsister ran   
laughing and pointing. here, last year,   
         you pulled my hands 

    and had your first, worst quarrel,   
so toys were put up on your shelves.   
    here in the first glass cage 
the little bobcats arch themselves,   
still practicing their snarl 
         of constant rage. 

    the bison, here, immense,   
shoves at his calf, brow to brow,   
    and looks it in the eye 
to see what is it thinking now.   
i forced you to obedience 
         i don't know why. 

    still the lean lioness 
beyond them, on her jutting ledge   
    of shale and desert shrub, 
stands watching always at the edge,   
stands hard and tanned and envious   
         above her cub 

    with horns locked in tall heather,   
two great olympian elk stand bound,   
    fixed in their lasting hate 
till hunger brings them both to ground.   
whom equal weakness binds together   
    none shall separate. 

    yet separate in the ocean 
of broken ice, the white bear reels 
    beyond the leathery groups   
of scattered, drab arctic seals   
arrested here in violent motion 
    like napoleon's troops. 

    our states have stood so long 
at war, shaken with hate and dread,   
    they are paralyzed at bay 
once we were out of reach, we said,   
we would grow reasonable and strong.   
         some other day. 

    like the cold men of rome, 
we have won costly fields to sow 
    in salt, our only seed.   
nothing but injury will grow. 
i write you only the bitter poems 
         that you can't read. 

    onan who would not breed 
a child to take his brother's bread   
    and be his brother's birth, 
rose up and left his lawful bed,   
went out and spilled his seed   
         in the cold earth. 

    i stand by the unborn, 
by putty-colored children curled 
    in jars of alcohol, 
that waken to no other world,   
unchanging, where no eye shall mourn.   
         i see the caul 

    that wrapped a kitten, dead. 
i see the branching, doubled throat   
    of a two-headed foal 
i see the hydrocephalic goat 
here is the curled and swollen head,   
         there, the burst skull 

    skin of a limbless calf 
a horse's foetus, mummified 
    mounted and joined forever,   
the siamese twin dogs that ride   
belly to belly, half and half, 
         that none shall sever. 

    i walk among the growths, 
by gangrenous tissue, goiter, cysts,   
    by fistulas and cancers, 
where the malignancy man loathes   
is held suspended and persists. 
         and i don't know the answers. 

    the window's turning white. 
the world moves like a diseased heart   
    packed with ice and snow. 
three months now we have been apart   
less than a mile. i cannot fight 
         or let you go. 

 
the vicious winter finally yields   
    the green winter wheat 
the farmer, tired in the tired fields   
    he dare not leave, will eat. 

once more the runs come fresh prevailing   
    piglets, stout as jugs, 
harry their old sow to the railing 
    to ease her swollen dugs 

and game colts trail the herded mares 
    that circle the pasture courses   
our seasons bring us back once more 
    like merry-go-round horses. 

with crocus mouths, perennial hungers,   
    into the park spring comes 
we roast hot dogs on old coat hangers 
    and feed the swan bread crumbs, 

pay our respects to the peacocks, rabbits,   
    and leathery canada goose 
who took, last fall, our tame white habits   
    and now will not turn loose. 

in full regalia, the pheasant cocks 
    march past their dubious hens 
the porcupine and the lean, red fox 
    trot around bachelor pens 

and the miniature painted train   
    wails on its oval track 
you said, i'm going to pennsylvania   
    and waved. and you've come back. 

if i loved you, they said i'd leave   
    and find my own affairs. 
well, once again this april, we've   
    come around to the bears 

punished and cared for, behind bars, 
    the coons on bread and water 
stretch thin black fingers after ours. 
    and you are still my daughter.


sorting out letters and piles of my old 
    canceled checks, old clippings, and yellow note cards   
that meant something once, i happened to find 
    your picture. that picture. i stopped there cold,   
like a man raking piles of dead leaves in his yard 
             who has turned up a severed hand. 

still, that first second, i was glad you stand 
    just as you stood--shy, delicate, slender, 
in that long gown of green lace netting and daisies 
    that you wore to our first dance. the sight of you stunned   
us all. well, our needs were different, then, 
             and our ideals came easy. 

then through the war and those two long years 
    overseas, the japanese dead in their shacks   
among dishes, dolls, and lost shoes i carried 
    this glimpse of you, there, to choke down my fear,   
prove it had been, that it might come back. 
             that was before we got married. 

--before we drained out one another's force   
    with lies, self-denial, unspoken regret 
and the sick eyes that blame before the divorce 
    and the treachery. say it before we met. still,   
i put back your picture. someday, in due course, 
             i will find that it's still there.


as we drove back, crossing the hill, 
the house still 
hidden in the trees, i always thought-- 
a fool's fear--that it might have caught   
fire, someone could have broken in.   
as if things must have been 
too good here. still, we always found   
it locked tight, safe and sound. 

i mentioned that, once, as a joke   
no doubt we spoke 
of the absurdity 
to fear some dour god's jealousy   
of our good fortune. from the farm   
next door, our neighbors saw no harm   
came to the things we cared for here.   
what did we have to fear? 

maybe i should have thought all 
such things rot, fall-- 
barns, houses, furniture. 
we two are stronger than we were 
apart we've grown 
together. everything we own 
can burn we know what counts--some such   
idea. we said as much. 

we'd watched friends driven to betray   
felt that love drained away 
some self they need. 
we'd said love, like a growth, can feed   
on hate we turn in and disguise 
we warned ourselves. that you might despise   
me--hate all we both loved best-- 
none of us ever guessed. 

the house still stands, locked, as it stood   
untouched a good 
two years after you went. 
some things passed in the settlement   
some things slipped away. enough's left   
that i come back sometimes. the theft   
and vandalism were our own. 
maybe we should have known.


is it, then, your opinion 
                      women are putty in your hands?   
                  is this the face to launch upon   
                      a thousand one night stands? 

first, please, would you be so kind 
    as to define your contribution   
to modern verse, the western mind 
    and human institutions? 

                                    where, where is the long, flowing hair,   
                                        the velvet suit, the broad bow tie   
                                    where is the other-worldly air, 
                                        where the abstracted eye? 

describe the influence on your verse 
    of oscar mudwarp's mighty line,   
the theories of susan schmersch 
    or the spondee's decline. 

         you've labored to present us with 
             this mouse-sized volume shall this equal   
         the epic glories of joe smith? 
             he's just brought out a sequel. 

                  where are the beard, the bongo drums, 
                      tattered t-shirt and grubby sandals,   
                  as who, released from iowa, comes 
                      to tell of wondrous scandals? 

have you subversive, out of date,   
    or controversial ideas? 
and can you really pull your weight   
    among such minds as these? 

                                    ah, what avails the tenure race,   
                                        ah, what the ph.d., 
                                    when all departments have a place   
                                        for nincompoops like thee?


after dr. haase gave them shots of morphine, magda gave each child an ampule of potassium cyanide from a spoon.
this is the needle that we give 
soldiers and children when they live   
near the front in primitive 
    conditions or real dangers 
this is the spoon we use to feed   
men trapped in trouble or in need,   
when weakness or bad luck might lead 
    them to the hands of strangers. 

this is the room where you can sleep   
your sleep out, curled up under deep   
layers of covering that will keep 
    you safe till all harm's past. 
this is the bed where you can rest   
in perfect silence, undistressed 
by noise or nightmares, as my breast   
    once held you soft but fast. 

this is the doctor who has brought   
your needle with your special shot   
to quiet you you won't get caught 
    off guard or unprepared.

i nursed you, fed you till you grew   
too big to feed now you're all through 
    fretting or feeling scared. 

this is the glass tube that contains 
calm that will spread down through your veins   
to free you finally from all pains 
    of going on in error. 
this tiny pinprick sets the germ 
inside you that fills out its term 
till you can feel yourself grow firm 
    against all doubt, all terror. 

into this spoon i break the pill   
that stiffens the unsteady will   
and hardens you against the chill 
    voice of a world of lies. 
this amber medicine implants   
steadfastness in your blood this grants   
immunity from greed and chance, 
    and from all compromise. 

this is the serum that can cure 
weak hearts these pure, clear drops insure   
you'll face what comes and can endure   
    the test you'll never falter.

    too firm for you to alter. 

i set this spoon between your tight   
teeth, as i gave you your first bite   
this satisfies your appetite 
    for other nourishment. 
take this on your tongue this do   
remembering your mother who 
so loved her leader she stayed true 
    when all the others went, 

when every friend proved false, in the   
delirium of treachery 
on every hand, when even he 
    had turned his face aside. 
he shut himself in with his whore 
then, though i screamed outside his door,   
said he'd not see me anymore. 
    they both took cyanide. 

open wide, now, little bird 
i who sang you your first word 
soothe away every sound you've heard   
    except your leader's voice. 
close your eyes, now take your death.   
once we slapped you to take breath.   
vengeance is mine, the lord god saith 
    and cancels each last choice. 

once, my first words marked out your mind   
just as our leader's phrases bind 
all hearts to him, building a blind 
    loyalty through the nation, 
we shape you into a pure form. 
trapped, our best soldiers tricked the storm,   
the reds those last hours, they felt warm   
    who stood fast to their station. 

you needn't fear what your life meant 
you won't curse how your hours were spent   
you'll grow like your own monument 
    to all things sure and good, 
fixed like a frieze in high relief 
of granite figures that our chief 
accepts into his true belief, 
    his true blood-brotherhood. 

you'll never bite the hand that fed you,   
won't turn away from those that bred you,   
comforted your nights and led you 
    into the thought of virtue 
you won't be turned from your own bed   
won't turn into that thing you dread   
no new betrayal lies ahead 
    now no one else can hurt you.


on this date, goebbels moved into the lowest level of the bunker, taking a room opposite hitler's.
stand back, make way, you mindless scum,   
squire voland the seducer's come-- 
old bock from babelsberg whose tower   
falls silent now, whose shrunken power   
for lies or lays comes hobbling home   
into this concrete catacomb. 

here's runty joe, the cunt collector   
who grew to greatness, first erector   
of myths and missions, fibs and fables, 
who pulled the wool then turned the tables   
he piped the tunes and called the dance   
where shirtless countries lost their pants. 

goatfooted pan, the nation's gander 
to whom pan-germans all played pander,   
the jovial cob-swan quick to cover   
lida baarova, his check-list lover   
swellfoot the tyrant, he could riddle   
men's minds away, hi-diddle-diddle. 

our little doctor, joe the gimp   
comes back to limpness and his limp   
hephaistos, vulcan the lame smith   
whose net of lies caught one true myth   
his wife, the famous beauty, whored   
by numbskull mars, the dull warlord. 

what if i took my little fling   
at conquest, at adventuring. 
pried the lid of pandora's box off-- 
there's nothing there to bring your rocks off.   
i never saw one fucking day   
so fine i courted it to stay. 

if i got snarled in my own mesh 
of thighs and bellies, who wants flesh?   
i never hankered after matter. 
let hermann swell up, grosser, fatter,   
weighed down by medals, houses, clothing   
they leave me lean, secured in loathing. 

as a young man, i pricked the bubble   
of every creed i saw that rubble 
and offered myself the realms of earth   
just to say yes. but what's it worth?   
no thank you, ma'am. behold the ram   
of god i doubt, therefore i am. 

here i forsake that long pricktease   
of histories, hopes, lusts, luxuries.   
i come back to my first ideal-- 
the vacancy that's always real.   
i sniffed out all life's openings   
i loved only the holes in things. 

so strip down one bare cell for this   
lay brother of the last abyss. 
to me, still, all abstractions smell   
my head and nose clear in this cell   
of concrete, this confession booth   
where liars face up to blank truth. 

my tongue lashed millions to the knife   
here, i'll hold hands with my soiled wife.   
my lies piped men out, hot to slaughter   
here, i'll read stories to my daughter   
then hack off all relations, choose   
only the nothing you can't lose, 

send back this body, fixed in its   
infantile paralysis. 
i was born small i shall grow less   
till i burst into nothingness, 
that slot in time where only pure   
spirit extends, absent and sure. 

i am that spirit that denies, 
high priest of laymen, prince of lies.   
your house is founded on my rock   
truth crows now i deny my cock.   
jock of this walk, i turn down all,   
robbing my peter to play paul. 

i give up all goods i possess 
to build my faith on faithlessness. 
black peter, i belie my lord-- 
you've got to die to spread the word.   
now the last act there's no sequel. 
soon, once more, all things shall be equal.


gring, head of the luftwaffe, once bragged that if one german city were bombed, they could call him meier. at his karinhall estate, he questions himself and his disgrace.
and why, herr reichsmarschall, is italy   
just like schnitzel? if they're beaten   
either one will just get bigger. 
neither cuts too firm a figure. 
still, all this humble pie you've eaten   
lately, fills you out quite prettily. 

why then, herr gring, how can we   
tell you and italy apart? 
italy always wins through losing 
i, just the opposite, by using 
high skills and cunning learned the art   
of flat pratfalls through victory. 

you've led our flying circus how   
could our war ace turn to a clown?   
both pad out over-extended fronts   
both keep alive doing slick stunts   
and, even so, both get shot down.   
but only one's called meier now. 

pray, could an old, soft football be   
much like a man in deep disgrace?   
they don't kick back don't even dare   
look up--the british own the air   
then, stick a needle in someplace   
pump yourself full of vacancy. 

tell us, dear minister for air, 
are warriors, then, like a bad smell? 
neither stays inside its borders 
either's bound to follow ordures 
they both expand and play the swell 
though something's getting spoiled somewhere. 

then answer one more question, which is   
are politicians like whipped cream? 
they both inflate themselves with gas   
also they both puff up your ass 
till you're exposed like some bad dream   
where you've grown too big for your britches. 

herr president, can't we tell apart   
an artful statesman and an ass? 
fat chance one spouts out high ideals   
one makes low rumblings after meals.   
but that's the threat of leaking gas   
which all men fear no that's a fart. 

last, could you give one simple rule   
to tell a medal from a turd? 
no. they both come from those above you   
conveying their opinion of you. 
right here's your new medal, conferred   
for vast achievements april fool


observe the cautious toadstools   
    still on the lawn today 
though they grow over-evening   
    sun shrinks them away. 
pale and proper and rootless,   
    they righteously extort 
their living from the living. 
    i have been their sort. 

see by our blocked foundation   
    the cold, archaic clay, 
stiff and clinging and sterile   
    as children mold at play 
or as the lord god fashioned   
    before he breathed it breath. 
the earth we dig and carry 
    for flowers, is strong in death. 

woman, we are the rich 
    soil, friable and humble,   
where all our murders rot, 
    where our old deaths crumble   
and fortify my reach 
    far from you, wide and free,   
though i have set my root   
    in you and am your tree.


strong ankled, sun burned, almost naked, 
the daughters of california   
educate reluctant humanists 
drive into their skulls with tennis balls 
the unhappy realization 
that nature is still stronger than man. 
the special hellenic privilege   
of the special intellect seeps out   
at last in this irrigated soil. 
sweat of athletes and juice of lovers 
are stronger than socrates' hemlock 
and the games of scrupulous euclid 
vanish in the gymnopaedia.


the summer of nineteen eighteen   
i read the jungle and the 
research magnificent. that fall   
my father died and my aunt   
took me to chicago to live.   
the first thing i did was to take   
a streetcar to the stockyards.   
in the winter afternoon,   
gritty and fetid, i walked 
through the filthy snow, through the   
squalid streets, looking shyly   
into the people's faces, 
those who were home in the daytime.   
debauched and exhausted faces,   
starved and looted brains, faces   
like the faces in the senile   
and insane wards of charity   
hospitals. predatory 
faces of little children. 
then as the soiled twilight darkened,   
under the green gas lamps, and the   
sputtering purple arc lamps,   
the faces of the men coming 
home from work, some still alive with   
the last pulse of hope or courage,   
some sly and bitter, some smart and   
silly, most of them already   
broken and empty, no life,   
only blinding tiredness, worse   
than any tired animal.   
the sour smells of a thousand   
suppers of fried potatoes and   
fried cabbage bled into the street.   
i was giddy and sick, and out   
of my misery i felt rising   
a terrible anger and out 
of the anger, an absolute vow.   
today the evil is clean 
and prosperous, but it is   
everywhere, you don't have to   
take a streetcar to find it, 
and it is the same evil. 
and the misery, and the 
anger, and the vow are the same.


somebody has given my 
baby daughter a box of 
old poker chips to play with.   
today she hands me one while   
i am sitting with my tired   
brain at my desk. it is red.   
on it is a picture of 
an elk's head and the letters   
b.p.o.e.--a chip from 
a small town elks' club. i flip   
it idly in the air and 
catch it and do a coin trick   
to amuse my little girl. 
suddenly everything slips aside.   
i see my father 
doing the very same thing,   
whistling beautiful dreamer,   
his breath smelling richly 
of whiskey and cigars. i can   
hear him coming home drunk   
from the elks' club in elkhart   
indiana, bumping the 
chairs in the dark. i can see   
him dying of cirrhosis 
of the liver and stomach 
ulcers and pneumonia, 
or, as he said on his deathbed, of   
crooked cards and straight whiskey,   
slow horses and fast women.


you were a girl of satin and gauze 
now you are my mountain and waterfall companion.   
long ago i read those lines of po chu i   
written in his middle age. 
young as i was they touched me. 
i never thought in my own middle age   
i would have a beautiful young dancer 
to wander with me by falling crystal waters,   
among mountains of snow and granite,   
least of all that unlike po's girl 
she would be my very daughter. 

the earth turns towards the sun.   
summer comes to the mountains.   
blue grouse drum in the red fir woods   
all the bright long days. 
you put blue jay and flicker feathers   
in your hair. 
two and two violet green swallows   
play over the lake. 
the blue birds have come back 
to nest on the little island. 
the swallows sip water on the wing   
and play at love and dodge and swoop 
just like the swallows that swirl   
under and over the ponte vecchio.   
light rain crosses the lake 
hissing faintly. after the rain 
there are giant puffballs with tortoise shell backs   
at the edge of the meadow. 
snows of a thousand winters 
melt in the sun of one summer.   
wild cyclamen bloom by the stream.   
trout veer in the transparent current. 
in the evening marmots bark in the rocks. 
the scorpion curls over the glimmering ice field. 
a white crowned night sparrow sings as the moon sets.   
thunder growls far off. 
our campfire is a single light 
amongst a hundred peaks and waterfalls. 
the manifold voices of falling water 
talk all night. 
wrapped in your down bag   
starlight on your cheeks and eyelids 
your breath comes and goes 
in a tiny cloud in the frosty night. 
ten thousand birds sing in the sunrise. 
ten thousand years revolve without change. 
all this will never be again.


an attempt to explain the former changes of the earth's surface by causes now in operation 
        subtitle of lyell  principles of geology
the mountain road ends here,   
broken away in the chasm where   
the bridge washed out years ago.   
the first scarlet larkspur glitters   
in the first patch of april 
morning sunlight. the engorged creek   
roars and rustles like a military   
ball. here by the waterfall,   
insuperable life, flushed 
with the equinox, sentient   
and sentimental, falls away 
to the sea and death. the tissue   
of sympathy and agony 
that binds the flesh in its nessus' shirt   
the clotted cobweb of unself   
and self sheds itself and flecks   
the sun's bed with darts of blossom   
like flagellant blood above   
the water bursting in the vibrant   
air. this ego, bound by personal   
tragedy and the vast 
impersonal vindictiveness 
of the ruined and ruining world,   
pauses in this immortality, 
as passionate, as apathetic, 
as the lava flow that burned here once   
and stopped here and said, 'this far   
and no further.' and spoke thereafter   
in the simple diction of stone. 

naked in the warm april air,   
we lie under the redwoods,   
in the sunny lee of a cliff.   
as you kneel above me i see   
tiny red marks on your flanks 
like bites, where the redwood cones   
have pressed into your flesh.   
you can find just the same marks   
in the lignite in the cliff 
over our heads. sequoia 
langsdorfii before the ice,   
and sempervirens afterwards,   
there is little difference,   
except for all those years. 

here in the sweet, moribund   
fetor of spring flowers, washed,   
flotsam and jetsam together,   
cool and naked together,   
under this tree for a moment,   
we have escaped the bitterness   
of love, and love lost, and love   
betrayed. and what might have been,   
and what might be, fall equally   
away with what is, and leave   
only these ideograms 
printed on the immortal   
hydrocarbons of flesh and stone.

spring, coast range 

the glow of my campfire is dark red and flameless,   
the circle of white ash widens around it. 
i get up and walk off in the moonlight and each time   
i look back the red is deeper and the light smaller.   
scorpio rises late with mars caught in his claw   
the moon has come before them, the light   
like a choir of children in the young laurel trees.   
it is april the shad, the hot headed fish, 
climbs the rivers there is trillium in the damp canyons   
the foetid adder's tongue lolls by the waterfall. 
there was a farm at this campsite once, it is almost gone now.   
there were sheep here after the farm, and fire   
long ago burned the redwoods out of the gulch,   
the douglas fir off the ridge today the soil   
is stony and incoherent, the small stones lie flat   
and plate the surface like scales. 
twenty years ago the spreading gully 
toppled the big oak over onto the house.   
now there is nothing left but the foundations   
hidden in poison oak, and above on the ridge,   
six lonely, ominous fenceposts 
the redwood beams of the barn make a footbridge   
over the deep waterless creek bed 
the hills are covered with wild oats 
dry and white by midsummer. 
i walk in the random survivals of the orchard.   
in a patch of moonlight a mole 
shakes his tunnel like an angry vein 
orion walks waist deep in the fog coming in from the ocean   
leo crouches under the zenith. 
there are tiny hard fruits already on the plum trees.   
the purity of the apple blossoms is incredible.   
as the wind dies down their fragrance 
clusters around them like thick smoke. 
all the day they roared with bees, in the moonlight   
they are silent and immaculate. 


             spring, sierra nevada 

once more golden scorpio glows over the col   
above deadman canyon, orderly and brilliant,   
like an inspiration in the brain of archimedes.   
i have seen its light over the warm sea, 
over the coconut beaches, phosphorescent and pulsing   
and the living light in the water 
shivering away from the swimming hand, 
creeping against the lips, filling the floating hair. 
here where the glaciers have been and the snow stays late,   
the stone is clean as light, the light steady as stone. 
the relationship of stone, ice and stars is systematic and enduring   
novelty emerges after centuries, a rock spalls from the cliffs,   
the glacier contracts and turns grayer, 
the stream cuts new sinuosities in the meadow,   
the sun moves through space and the earth with it,   
the stars change places. 
                                    the snow has lasted longer this year,   
than anyone can remember. the lowest meadow is a lake,   
the next two are snowfields, the pass is covered with snow,   
only the steepest rocks are bare. between the pass   
and the last meadow the snowfield gapes for a hundred feet,   
in a narrow blue chasm through which a waterfall drops,   
spangled with sunset at the top, black and muscular   
where it disappears again in the snow. 
the world is filled with hidden running water   
that pounds in the ears like ether 
the granite needles rise from the snow, pale as steel   
above the copper mine the cliff is blood red,   
the white snow breaks at the edge of it 
the sky comes close to my eyes like the blue eyes   
of someone kissed in sleep. 
                                        i descend to camp, 
to the young, sticky, wrinkled aspen leaves, 
to the first violets and wild cyclamen, 
and cook supper in the blue twilight. 
all night deer pass over the snow on sharp hooves,   
in the darkness their cold muzzles find the new grass   
at the edge of the snow. 


             fall, sierra nevada 

this morning the hermit thrush was absent at breakfast,   
his place was taken by a family of chickadees   
at noon a flock of humming birds passed south,   
whirling in the wind up over the saddle between   
ritter and banner, following the migration lane   
of the sierra crest southward to guatemala. 
all day cloud shadows have moved over the face of the mountain,   
the shadow of a golden eagle weaving between them   
over the face of the glacier. 
at sunset the half-moon rides on the bent back of the scorpion,   
the great bear kneels on the mountain. 
ten degrees below the moon 
venus sets in the haze arising from the great valley. 
jupiter, in opposition to the sun, rises in the alpenglow   
between the burnt peaks. the ventriloquial belling   
of an owl mingles with the bells of the waterfall.   
now there is distant thunder on the east wind.   
the east face of the mountain above me 
is lit with far off lightnings and the sky 
above the pass blazes momentarily like an aurora.   
it is storming in the white mountains, 
on the arid fourteen-thousand-foot peaks 
rain is falling on the narrow gray ranges 
and dark sedge meadows and white salt flats of nevada.   
just before moonset a small dense cumulus cloud,   
gleaming like a grape cluster of metal, 
moves over the sierra crest and grows down the westward slope. 
frost, the color and quality of the cloud, 
lies over all the marsh below my campsite. 
the wiry clumps of dwarfed whitebark pines   
are smoky and indistinct in the moonlight,   
only their shadows are really visible. 
the lake is immobile and holds the stars 
and the peaks deep in itself without a quiver.   
in the shallows the geometrical tendrils of ice   
spread their wonderful mathematics in silence.   
all night the eyes of deer shine for an instant 
as they cross the radius of my firelight. 
in the morning the trail will look like a sheep driveway,   
all the tracks will point down to the lower canyon.   
thus, says tyndall, the concerns of this little place   
are changed and fashioned by the obliquity of the earth's axis, 
the chain of dependence which runs through creation,   
and links the roll of a planet alike with the interests   
of marmots and of men.


for a month now, wandering over the sierras,   
a poem had been gathering in my mind,   
details of significance and rhythm, 
the way poems do, but still lacking a focus.   
last night i remembered the date and it all   
began to grow together and take on purpose. 
   we sat up late while deneb moved over the zenith   
and i told marie all about boston, how it looked   
that last terrible week, how hundreds stood weeping   
impotent in the streets that last midnight. 
i told her how those hours changed the lives of thousands, 
how america was forever a different place   
afterwards for many. 
                              in the morning 
we swam in the cold transparent lake, the blue   
damsel flies on all the reeds like millions   
of narrow metallic flowers, and i thought   
of you behind the grille in dedham, vanzetti, 
saying, who would ever have thought we would make this history? 
crossing the brilliant mile-square meadow   
illuminated with asters and cyclamen,   
the pollen of the lodgepole pines drifting   
with the shifting wind over it and the blue   
and sulphur butterflies drifting with the wind,   
i saw you in the sour prison light, saying,   
goodbye comrade. 
                           in the basin under the crest 
where the pines end and the sierra primrose begins,   
a party of lawyers was shooting at a whiskey bottle.   
the bottle stayed on its rock, nobody could hit it. 
looking back over the peaks and canyons from the last lake,   
the pattern of human beings seemed simpler   
than the diagonals of water and stone.   
climbing the chute, up the melting snow and broken rock, 
i remembered what you said about sacco, 
how it slipped your mind and you demanded it be read into the record. 
traversing below the ragged arte, 
one cheek pressed against the rock 
the wind slapping the other, 
i saw you both marching in an army 
you with the red and black flag, sacco with the rattlesnake banner. 
i kicked steps up the last snow bank and came   
to the indescribably blue and fragrant 
polemonium and the dead sky and the sterile 
crystalline granite and final monolith of the summit.   
these are the things that will last a long time, vanzetti, 
i am glad that once on your day i have stood among them.   
some day mountains will be named after you and sacco.   
they will be here and your name with them, 
when these days are but a dim remembering of the time   
when man was wolf to man. 
i think men will be remembering you a long time   
standing on the mountains 
many men, a long time, comrade.


i don't mind the human race.   
i've got pretty used to them   
in these past twenty-five years.   
i don't mind if they sit next   
to me on streetcars, or eat   
in the same restaurants, if   
it's not at the same table.   
however, i don't approve   
of a woman i respect 
dancing with one of them. i've   
tried asking them to my home   
without success. i shouldn't   
care to see my own sister   
marry one. even if she 
loved him, think of the children.   
their art is interesting,   
but certainly barbarous.   
i'm sure, if given a chance,   
they'd kill us all in our beds.   
and you must admit, they smell.


trees in the old days used to stand   
and shape a shady lane 
where lovers wandered hand in hand   
who came from carentan. 

this was the shining green canal   
where we came two by two   
walking at combat-interval.   
such trees we never knew. 

the day was early june, the ground   
was soft and bright with dew.   
far away the guns did sound, 
but here the sky was blue. 

the sky was blue, but there a smoke   
hung still above the sea 
where the ships together spoke   
to towns we could not see. 

could you have seen us through a glass   
you would have said a walk   
of farmers out to turn the grass,   
each with his own hay-fork. 

the watchers in their leopard suits   
waited till it was time, 
and aimed between the belt and boot   
and let the barrel climb. 

i must lie down at once, there is   
a hammer at my knee. 
and call it death or cowardice,   
don't count again on me. 

everything's all right, mother,   
everyone gets the same   
at one time or another.   
it's all in the game. 

i never strolled, nor ever shall,   
down such a leafy lane. 
i never drank in a canal, 
nor ever shall again. 

there is a whistling in the leaves   
and it is not the wind, 
the twigs are falling from the knives   
that cut men to the ground. 

tell me, master-sergeant,   
the way to turn and shoot.   
but the sergeant's silent   
that taught me how to do it. 

o captain, show us quickly   
our place upon the map.   
but the captain's sickly 
and taking a long nap. 

lieutenant, what's my duty,   
my place in the platoon? 
he too's a sleeping beauty,   
charmed by that strange tune. 

carentan o carentan 
before we met with you 
we never yet had lost a man   
or known what death could do.


i dreamed that in a city dark as paris   
i stood alone in a deserted square.   
the night was trembling with a violet   
expectancy. at the far edge it moved   
and rumbled on that flickering horizon   
the guns were pumping color in the sky. 

there was the front. but i was lonely here,   
left behind, abandoned by the army.   
the empty city and the empty square   
was my inhabitation, my unrest.   
the helmet with its vestige of a crest,   
the rifle in my hands, long out of date,   
the belt i wore, the trailing overcoat   
and hobnail boots, were those of a poilu.   
i was the man, as awkward as a bear. 

over the rooftops where cathedrals loomed   
in speaking majesty, two aeroplanes 
forlorn as birds, appeared. then growing large,   
the german taube and the nieuport scout, 
they chased each other tumbling through the sky,   
till one streamed down on fire to the earth. 

these wars have been so great, they are forgotten   
like the egyptian dynasts. my confrere   
in whose thick boots i stood, were you amazed   
to wander through my brain four decades later   
as i have wandered in a dream through yours? 

the violence of waking life disrupts 
the order of our death. strange dreams occur,   
for dreams are licensed as they never were.


a siren sang, and europe turned away 
from the high castle and the shepherd's crook.   
three caravels went sailing to cathay 
on the strange ocean, and the captains shook   
their banners out across the mexique bay. 

and in our early days we did the same.   
remembering our fathers in their wreck 
we crossed the sea from palos where they came   
and saw, enormous to the little deck,   
a shore in silence waiting for a name. 

the treasures of cathay were never found.   
in this america, this wilderness 
where the axe echoes with a lonely sound,   
the generations labor to possess 
and grave by grave we civilize the ground.


my father in the night commanding no 
has work to do. smoke issues from his lips   
      he reads in silence. 
the frogs are croaking and the street lamps glow. 

and then my mother winds the gramophone   
the bride of lammermoor begins to shriek-- 
      or reads a story-- 
about a prince, a castle, and a dragon. 

the moon is glittering above the hill. 
i stand before the gateposts of the king-- 
      so runs the story 
of thule, at midnight when the mice are still. 

and i have been in thule it has come true-- 
the journey and the danger of the world,   
      all that there is 
to bear and to enjoy, endure and do. 

landscapes, seascapes ... where have i been led?   
the names of cities--paris, venice, rome-- 
      held out their arms. 
a feathered god, seductive, went ahead. 

here is my house. under a red rose tree   
a child is swinging another gravely plays.   
      they are not surprised 
that i am here they were expecting me. 

and yet my father sits and reads in silence,   
my mother sheds a tear, the moon is still,   
      and the dark wind 
is murmuring that nothing ever happens. 

beyond his jurisdiction as i move 
do i not prove him wrong? and yet, it's true   
      they will not change 
there, on the stage of terror and of love. 

the actors in that playhouse always sit   
in fixed positions--father, mother, child 
      with painted eyes. 
how sad it is to be a little puppet 

their heads are wooden. and you once pretended   
to understand them shake them as you will,   
      they cannot speak. 
do what you will, the comedy is ended. 

father, why did you work? why did you weep,   
mother? was the story so important? 
      listen the wind 
said to the children, and they fell asleep.


on the lawn at the villa-- 
that's the way to start, eh, reader? 
we know where we stand--somewhere expensive-- 
you and i imperturbes, as walt would say, 
before the diversions of wealth, you and i engags. 

on the lawn at the villa 
sat a manufacturer of explosives,   
his wife from paris, 
and a young man named bruno, 

and myself, being american, 
willing to talk to these malefactors, 
the manufacturer of explosives, and so on, 
but somehow superior. by that i mean democratic. 
it's complicated, being an american, 
having the money and the bad conscience, both at the same time.   
perhaps, after all, this is not the right subject for a poem. 

we were all sitting there paralyzed 
in the hot tuscan afternoon, 
and the bodies of the machine-gun crew were draped over the balcony. 
so we sat there all afternoon.


the man who married magdalene   
had not forgiven her. 
god might pardon every sin ...   
love is no pardoner. 

her hands were hollow, pale, and blue,   
her mouth like watered wine. 
he watched to see if she were true   
and waited for a sign. 

it was old harlotry, he guessed,   
that drained her strength away,   
so gladly for the dark she dressed,   
so sadly for the day. 

their quarrels made her dull and weak   
and soon a man might fit 
a penny in the hollow cheek 
and never notice it. 

at last, as they exhausted slept,   
death granted the divorce,   
and nakedly the woman leapt   
upon that narrow horse. 

but when he woke and woke alone   
he wept and would deny 
the loose behavior of the bone   
and the immodest thigh.


the dark streets are deserted,   
with only a drugstore glowing   
softly, like a sleeping body 

with one white, naked bulb   
in the back, that shines   
on suicides and abortions. 

who lives in these dark houses?   
i am suddenly aware   
i might live here myself. 

the garage man returns 
and puts the change in my hand,   
counting the singles carefully.


swing and sway with sammy kaye
everyone at lake kearney had a nickname   
there was a bumstead, a tonto, a tex,   
and, from the slogan of a popular orchestra,   
two sisters, swing and sway. 

swing jitterbugged, hopping around 
on the dance floor, working up a sweat. 
sway was beautiful. my heart went out to her   
when she lifted her heavy rack of dishes   
and passed through the swinging door. 

she was engaged, to an enlisted man   
who was stationed at fort dix. 
he came once or twice on weekends 
to see her. i tried talking to him, 
but he didn't answer ... out of stupidity   
or dislike, i could not tell which. 
in real life he was a furniture salesman.   
this was the hero on whom she had chosen   
to bestow her affections. 

i told her of my ambition 
to write novels conveying the excitement   
of life ... the main building lit up 
like a liner on saturday night 
the sound of the band ... clarinet,   
saxophone, snare drum, piano. 
he who would know your heart america   
must seek it in your songs. 

and the contents of your purse ...   
among kleenex, aspirin,   
chewing gum wrappers, combs, et cetera. 

don't stop, she said, i'm listening.   
here it is flourishing her lighter. 

          

in the afternoon when the dishes were washed   
and tables wiped, we rowed out on the lake.   
i read aloud ... the duino elegies, 
while she reclined, one shapely knee up,   
trailing a hand in the water. 

she had chestnut-colored hair. 
her eyes were changing like the surface   
with ripples and the shadows of clouds. 

beauty, i read to her, is nothing 
but beginning of terror we're still just able to bear. 

          

she came from jersey, the industrial wasteland   
behind which manhattan suddenly rises.   
i could visualize the street where she lived,   
and see her muffled against the cold,   
in galoshes, trudging to school.   
running about in tennis shoes   
all through the summer ...   
i could hear the porch swing squeak   
and see into the parlor. 
it was divided by a curtain or screen ...   

that's it, she said, all but the screen.   
there isn't any. 

when she or her sister had a boyfriend   
their mother used to stay in the parlor,   
pretending to sew, and keeping an eye on them   
like fate. 

at night she would lie awake 
looking at the sky, spangled over. 
her thoughts were as deep and wide as the sky.   
as time went by she had a feeling 
of missing out ... that everything 
was happening somewhere else. 
some of the kids she grew up with 
went crazy ... like a car turning over and over. 
one of her friends had been beaten   
by the police. some vital fluid   
seemed to have gone out of him. 
his arms and legs shook. busted springs. 

          

she said, when you're a famous novelist   
will you write about me? 

i promised ... and tried to keep my promise. 

recently, looking for a toolbox, 
i came upon some typewritten pages, 
all about her. there she is 
in a canoe ... a gust of wind 
rustling the leaves along the shore. 
playing tennis, running up and down the baseline.   
down by the boathouse, listening to the orchestra   
playing sleepy lagoon. 

then the trouble begins. i can never think of anything   
to make the characters do. 
we are still sitting in the moonlight 
while she finishes her cigarette. 
two people go by, talking in low voices. 
a car door slams. driving off ...   

i suppose we ought to go,   
i say. 
                   and she says, not yet.


vandergast to his neighbors-- 
the grinding of a garage door 
and hiss of gravel in the driveway. 

he worked for the insurance company   
whose talisman is a phoenix 
rising in flames ... non omnis moriar. 
from his desk he had a view of the street-- 

translucent raincoats, and umbrellas,   
fluorescent plate-glass windows.   
a girl knelt down, arranging 
underwear on a female dummy-- 

sea waves and, on the gale,   
venus, these busy days, 
poised in her garter belt and stockings. 

          

the next day he saw her eating 
in the restaurant where he usually ate. 

soon they were having lunch together   
elsewhere. 
                she came from dallas. 
this was only a start, she was ambitious,   
twenty-five and still unmarried. 
green eyes with silver spiricles ... 
red hair ... 
                  when he held the car door open   
her legs were smooth and slender. 

i was wondering, 
she said, when you'd get round to it,   
and laughed. 

          

vandergast says he never intended   
having an affair. 
                           and was that what this was?   
the names that people give to things ... 
what do definitions and divorce-court proceedings   
have to do with the breathless reality? 

o little lamp at the bedside 
with views of venice and the bay of naples,   
you understood lactona toothbrush 
and suitcase bought in a hurry, 
you were the witnesses of the love 
we made in bed together. 

schrafft's chocolate cherries, surely you remember   
when she said she'd be true forever, 

and, watching dark storm, we decided   
there is something to be said, after all, 
for soap opera, if it makes people happy. 

          

the vandergasts are having some trouble   
finding a buyer for their house. 

when i go for a walk with tippy   
i pass the unweeded tennis court, 
the empty garage, windows heavily shuttered. 

mrs. vandergast took the children   
and went back to her family. 

and vandergast moved to new jersey,   
where he works for an insurance company   
whose emblem is the rock of gibraltar-- 
the rest of his life laid out 
with the child-support and alimony payments. 

as for the girl, she vanished. 

was it worth it? ask vandergast. 
you'd have to be vandergast, looking through his eyes   
at the house across the street, in orange, new jersey.   
maybe on wet days umbrellas and raincoats 
set his heart thudding. 
                                  maybe 
he talks to his pillow, and it whispers,   
moving red hair. 

in any case, he will soon be forty. 



look from my window there's a view   
of city streets 
where only lives as dry as tortoises   
can crawl--the gallapagos of desire. 

there is the day of negroes with red hair 
and the day of insane women on the subway   
there is the day of the word trieste 
and the night of the blind man with the electric guitar. 

but i have no profession. like a spy 
i read the papers--situations wanted.   
surely there is a secret 
which, if i knew it, would change everything 

i have the poor man's nerve-tic, irony. 
i see through the illusions of the age 
the bell tolls, and the hearse advances, 
and the mourners follow, for my entertainment. 

i tread the burning pavement, 
the streets where drunkards stretch   
like photographs of civil death 
and trumpets strangle in electric shelves. 

the mannequins stare at me scornfully.   
i know they are pretending 
all day to be in earnest. 
and can it be that love is an illusion? 

when darkness falls on the enormous street   
the air is filled with eros, whispering.   
eyes, mouths, contrive to meet 
in silence, fearing they may be prevented. 

o businessmen like ruins,   
bankers who are bastilles, 
widows, sadder than the shores of lakes, 
then you were happy, when you still could tremble 

but all night long my window 
sheds tears of light. 
i seek the word. the word is not forthcoming.   
o syllables of light ... o dark cathedral ...


i wake and feel the city trembling. 
yes, there is something unsettled in the air   
and the earth is uncertain. 

and so it was for the tenor caruso. 
he couldn't sleep--you know how the ovation   
rings in your ears, and you re-sing your part. 

and then the ceiling trembled 
and the floor moved. he ran into the street.   
never had naples given him such a reception 

the air was darker than vesuvius.   
o mamma mia, 
he cried, i've lost my voice 

at that moment the hideous voice of culture,   
hysterical woman, thrashing her arms and legs,   
shrieked from the ruins. 

at that moment everyone became a performer.   
otello and don giovanni   
and figaro strode on the midmost stage. 

in the high window of a burning castle   
lucia raved. black horses 
plunged through fire, dragging the wild bells. 

the curtains were wrapped in smoke. tin swords   
were melting masks and ruffs 
burned--and the costumes of the peasants' chorus. 

night fell. the white moon rose   
and sank in the pacific. the tremors   
passed under the waves. and death rested. 

now, as we stand idle, 
watching the silent, bowler-hatted man, 
the engineer, who writes in the smoking field 

now as he hands the paper to a boy, 
who takes it and runs to a group of waiting men,   
and they disperse and move toward their wagons, 

mules bray and the wagons move-- 
wait before you start 
already the wheels are rattling on the stones 

say, did your fathers cross the dry sierras   
to build another london? 
do americans always have to be second-rate? 

wait for there are spirits 
in the earth itself, or the air, or sea.   
where are the aboriginal american devils? 

cloud shadows, pine shadows 
falling across the bright pacific bay ...    
already they have nailed rough boards together 

wait only for the wind 
that rustles in the eucalyptus tree.   
wait only for the light 

that trembles on the petals of a rose. 
the mortar sets--banks are the first to stand   
wait for a rose, and you may wait forever. 

the silent man mops his head and drinks   
cold lemonade. san francisco   
is a city second only to paris. 

every night, at the end of america 
we taste our wine, looking at the pacific.   
how sad it is, the end of america 

while we were waiting for the land   
they'd finished it--with gas drums 
on the hilltops, cheap housing in the valleys 

where lives are mean and wretched.   
but the banks thrive and the realtors   
rejoice--they have their america. 

still, there is something unsettled in the air.   
out there on the pacific   
there's no america but the marines. 

whitman was wrong about the people, 
but right about himself. the land is within. 
at the end of the open road we come to ourselves. 

though mad columbus follows the sun   
into the sea, we cannot follow. 
we must remain, to serve the returning sun, 

and to set tables for death. 
for we are the colonists of death-- 
not, as some think, of the english. 

and we are preparing thrones for him to sit,   
poems to read, and beds   
in which it may please him to rest. 

this is the land 
the pioneers looked for, shading their eyes   
against the sun--a murmur of serious life.


in the clear light that confuses everything   
only you, dark laurel,   
shadow my house, 

lifting your arms in the anguish   
of nature at the stake. 
and at night, quivering with tears, 

you are like the tree called tasso's.   
crippled, and hooped with iron,   
it stands on peter's hill. 

when the lovers prop their bicycles   
and sit on the high benches   
that look across to eternity, 

that tree makes their own torsion 
seem natural. and so, they're comforted. 

one of the local philosophers ...   
he says, in california 
we have the old anarchist tradition. 

what can he mean? is there an anarchist tradition?   
and why would an anarchist want one?   
o california, 

is there a tree without opinions?   
come, let me clasp you   
let me feel the idea breathing. 

i too cry o for a life of sensations   
rather than thoughts-- 
the sayling pine, the cedar proud and tall. 

like the girls in our neighborhood,   
they're beautiful and silent. 

as i was digging in the back yard   
i thought of a man in china. 
a lifetime, it seemed, we gazed at each other. 

i could see and hear his heartbeats   
like a spade hurling clods. 
he pointed behind him, and i saw 

that the hills were covered with armed men,   
and they were all on the other side   
of the life that i held dear. 

he said, we are as various   
as the twigs of a tree, 
but now the tree moves as one man. 

it walks. and the earth trembles   
when a race of slaves is leaving. 

i said, yet, all these people   
will fall down as one man 
when the entrails of a bomb are breathing. 

when we came down from chosin   
carrying the guns in dainty snow-wear   
and all the dead we had to, 

it was a time of forgetfulness,   
like a plucked string.   
it was a river of darkness. 

was it not so on your side, when you came   
to the sea that was covered with ships?   
let us speak to each other, 

let the word rise, making dark strokes in the air.   
that bird flies over the heads of the armed men. 

one part of the tree grows outward.   
the other i saw when, with a light, 
i explored the cellar--shattering roots. 

they had broken through the wall, 
as though there were something in my rubbish   
that life would have at last. 

i must be patient with shapes 
of automobile fenders and ketchup bottles.   
these things are the beginning 

of things not visible to the naked eye.   
it was so in the time of tobit-- 
the dish glowed when the angel held it. 

it is so that spiritual messengers   
deliver their meaning.


a man stood in the laurel tree 
adjusting his hands and feet to the boughs.   
he said, today i was breaking stones   
on a mountain road in asia, 

when suddenly i had a vision 
of mankind, like grass and flowers,   
the same over all the earth. 
we forgave each other we gave ourselves   
wholly over to words. 
and straightway i was released   
and sprang through an open gate. 

i said, into a meadow? 

he said, i am impervious to irony.   
i thank you for the word ...   
i am standing in a sunlit meadow.   
know that everything your senses reject   
springs up in the spiritual world. 

i said, our scientists have another opinion.   
they say, you are merely phenomena. 

he said, over here they will be angels   
singing, holy holy be his name 
and also, it works in reverse. 
things which to us in the pure state are mysterious,   
are your simplest articles of household use-- 
a chair, a dish, and meaner even than these,   
the very latest inventions. 
machines are the animals of the americans-- 
tell me about machines. 

i said, i have suspected 
the mixmaster knows more than i do,   
the air conditioner is the better poet. 
my right front tire is as bald as odysseus-- 
how much it must have suffered 
then, as things have a third substance   
which is obscure to both our senses, 
let there be a perpetual coming and going   
between your house and mine.


a man walks beside them   
with a whip that he cracks.   
the cart they draw is painted   
with saracens and crusaders, 
fierce eyes and ranks of spears. 

they are on the steep road   
that goes up the mountain.   
their neat-stepping hoofs   
appear to be flickering   
in the sun, raising dust. 

they are higher than the roofs 
on which striped gourds and melons   
lie ripening. they move 
among the dark green olives 
that grow on the rocks. 

they dwindle as they climb ...   
vanish around a corner 
and reappear walking on the edge   
of a precipice. they enter 
the region of mist and darkness. 

i think i can see them still   
a pair of yoked oxen 
the color of ivory 
or smoke, with red tassels,   
in the gathering dusk.


a love supreme, a love supreme  a love supreme, a love supreme
sex fingers toes 
in the marketplace 
near your father's church 
in hamlet, north carolina-- 
witness to this love 
in this calm fallow 
of these minds, 
there is no substitute for pain   
genitals gone or going, 
seed burned out, 
you tuck the roots in the earth,   
turn back, and move 
by river through the swamps, 
singing a love supreme, a love supreme 
what does it all mean? 
loss, so great each black 
woman expects your failure 
in mute change, the seed gone. 
you plod up into the electric city-- 
your song now crystal and   
the blues. you pick up the horn   
with some will and blow 
into the freezing night 
a love supreme, a love supreme-- 

dawn comes and you cook   
up the thick sin 'tween   
impotence and death, fuel 
the tenor sax cannibal 
heart, genitals, and sweat 
that makes you clean-- 
a love supreme, a love supreme-- 

why you so black? 
cause i am 
why you so funky? 
cause i am 
why you so black? 
cause i am 
why you so sweet? 
cause i am 
why you so black? 
cause i am 
a love supreme, a love supreme 

so sick 
you couldn't play naima, 
so flat we ached 
for song you'd concealed 
with your own blood, 
your diseased liver gave 
out its purity, 
the inflated heart 
pumps out, the tenor kiss, 
tenor love 
a love supreme, a love supreme-- 
a love supreme, a love supreme--



in  my grandfather's 
neighbors surrounded his house 
near the dayline he ran 
on the hudson 
in catskill, ny 
and thought they'd burn 
his family out

and be rid of his kind

or so they thought. 
his ' waiter gait 
quenched the white jacket smile 
he'd brought back from watered

on the turning seats, 
and he asked his neighbors 
up on his thatched porch 
for the first blossom of fire 
that would bring him down. 
they went away, his nation, 
spittooning their torched necks 
in the shadows of the riverboat 
they'd seen, posse decomposing 
and i see him on sutter 
with white bag from your 
restaurant, challenged by his first 
grandson to a foot-race 
he will win in white clothes. 

i see him as he buys galoshes 
for his railed yard near mineo's 
metal shop, where roses jump 
as the el circles his house 
toward brooklyn, where his rain fell 
and i see cigar smoke in his eyes, 
chocolate madison square garden chews 
he breaks on his set teeth, 
stitched up after cancer, 
the great white nation immovable 
as his weight wilts 
and he is on a porch 
that won't hold my arms, 
or the legs of the race run 
forwards, or the film 
played backwards on his grandson's eyes.

the wrinkles on the brown face   
of the carrying case 
conform to the buttocks, 
on which the streaks of water   
from a five-gallon can 
dribble on the tailfront 
of the borrowed shirt 
he would wear if he could 
drain the pus from his swaddling   
bandages, striations of skin 
tunneling into the photograph. 

this is no simple mug shot 
of a runaway boy in a training   
film, soweto's pummeled wire,   
though the turrets of light   
glisten in smoke, the soft   
coal hooding his platform   
entrance, dull and quiet. 

his father's miner's shoes   
stand in puddles of polish,   
the black soot baked 
into images of brittle torso,   
an inferno of bullets laid   
out in a letter bomb, 
the frontispiece of one sergeant- 
major blackening his mustache. 

on the drive to evaton 
a blank pass away from sharpeville   
where the freehold morgans 
were bought by a black bishop 
from ontario, canada, on a trek 
northward from the cape in , 
i speak to myself as the woman 
riding in the backseat talks 
of this day, her husband's 
death, twenty-three years ago, 
run over by an afrikaner in the wrong   
passing lane the passbook on the shoulder   
of the road leading to evaton 
is not the one i have in my hand, 
and the photograph is not of my great- 
grandfather, who set sail for philadelphia   
in the war year of . 
he did not want a reception, his letters   
embarking on a platform at queenstown   
where his eloquence struck two zulu warriors   
pledged to die in the homelands 
because they could not spin their own gold. 

these threaded heads weigh down the ears   
in design of the warrior, shaka, 
indifferent to the ruthless offerings 
over the dead bodies of his wives, 
childless in the campaigns with the british,   
who sit on the ships of the indian ocean   
each kraal shuddering near the borders 

her lips turn in profile 
to the dust rising over a road   
where his house once stood   
one could think of the women   
carrying firewood as an etching   
in remembrance to the silence,   
commencing at sharpeville, 
but this is evaton, where he would come 
from across the galleyship of spears   
turning in his robes to a bookmark 
it is a good book, the picture of words   
in the gloss of a photograph, 
the burned image of the man who wears   
this image on the tongue of a child,   
who might hold my hand 
as we walk in late afternoon 
into the predestined sun. 

the press of wrinkles on the blanketed   
voice of the man who took the train   
from johannesburg 
is flattened in cape town,   
and the history of this book   
is on a trestle where gandhi   
worshipped in natal, 
and the zulu lullaby 
i cannot sing in bantu 
is this song in the body   
of a passbook 
and the book passes 
into a shirt 
and the back that wears it.


those four black girls blown up   
in that alabama church 
remind me of five hundred   
middle passage blacks, 
in a net, under water 
in charleston harbor 
so redcoats wouldn't find them.   
can't find what you can't see   
can you?


we reconstruct lives in the intensive   
care unit, pieced together in a buffet   
dinner two widows with cancerous breasts   
in their balled hands a -year-old man   
in a three-month coma 
from a buick and a brick wall 
a woman who bleeds off and on from her gullet 
a prominent socialite, our own nurse,   
shrieking for twins, her bump gone   
the gallery of veterans, succored, 
awake, without valves, some lungs gone. 

splicing the meats with fluids 
seasoned on the dressing room 
table, she sings the bump gone 
refrain in this -degree oven, 
unstuffing her twin yolks 
carved from the breast, the dark meat   
wrapped in tinfoil and clean newspaper 
the half black registered nurse   
hums her six years in an orphanage,   
her adopted white family, 
breaded and primed in a posse, 
rising in clan for their dinner. 

we reload our brains as the cameras,   
the film overexposed 
in the x-ray light, 
locked with our double door 
light meters race and sex 
spooled and rungs in a hobby 
we take our bundle and go home.


for sandy and henry carlile  some great musicians got no place to play
above the freeway, over the music, 
we speak of the strategy of poems, 
bleeding wives who ulcerate 
our voices rhythming in the cut-heat 
portland stink from the willamette river 
arteries of smog fixate this place 
in each recording, music, music, on impulse.   
this little racist community has few friends   
thousands of deerslayers hum into beaverton,   
the one talk show driven out for their talk 
as the liberals dig in to kgo out of san francisco   
we troop toward the lloyd center for the ice-skating, 
the colorette bloomered dream merchants on rented skates,   
and the sunday chronicle near the big hotel. 

the poets, man and wife, write in the dimming air, 
their daughter in the toy rooms connecting them, 
the typewriter tacking the nails and snaps of her gown.   
this image of separation begins in adoption 
her mother adopted out in san jose her father 
disowned, abandoned, torn out of the will her name phoebe. 

and the sun does shine on them for this visit   
in squat pigeontoes, and this beach ball sings.

whatever city or country road   
you two are on 
there are nettles, 
and the dark invisible 
elements cling to your skin 
though you do not cry 
and you do not scratch 
your arms at forty-five degree angles   
as the landing point of a swan 
in the ohio, the detroit river 

at the paradise theatre 
you named the cellist 
with the fanatical fingers 
of the plumber, the exorcist, 
and though the gimmicky at wrist   
and kneecaps could lift the seance   
table, your voice was real 
in the gait and laughter of uncle   
henry, who could dance on either   
leg, wooden or real, to the sound   
of the troop train, megaphone,   
catching the fine pitch of a singer   
on the athletic fields of virginia. 

at the radisson hotel, 
we once took a fine angel 
of the law to the convention center,   
and put her down as an egret 
in the subzero platform of a friend-- 
this is minneapolis, the movies 
are all of strangers, holding themselves   
in the delicacy of treading water,   
while they wait for the trumpet   
of the th century limited 
over the bluff or cranny. 
you two men like to confront. 
the craters of history and spillage,   
our natural infections of you   
innoculating blankets and fur,   
ethos of cadaver and sunflower. 

i hold the dogwood blossom, 
eat the pear, and watch the nettle   
swim up in the pools 
of the completed song 
of leadbelly and little crow   
crooning the buffalo and horse   
to the changes and the bridge   
of a twelve-string guitar, 
the melody of irene 
this is really goodbye-- 
i can see the precious stones 
of embolism and consumption 
on the platinum wires of the mouth 
in the flowing rivers, in the public baths   
of ohio and michigan.


 
nose only above water   
an hour in the ice melt 
paw in a beaver trap, 
northern leaping through-- 
the outlet sieving, setter- 
retriever staked to her trip,   
the stake of her young   
life run to nose level. 

farmers adjacent to the lake   
call 'round for the owner   
at least they call around,   
and a man in a pickup 
pulls her out, her crushed   
paw limp in the blazing sun. 

shivering on our pantry floor, 
wrapped in a snowsuit, 
i see her dam the clamped paw 
staked to the sleeve,   
licking for breaks, 
a light trickle of blood   
spilling from a torn nail. 

 
next spring she will tramp   
down our wire, 
stamp on six goslings,   
swim for teal, 
run down blackbirds, 
drag deer bones in our garden. 

she limps on the compost pile, 
shakes at the vet, 
fishes under makeshift docks, 
ferrets out mink, 
frog, green snake, 
any animal scrimmage without stakes   
listen to her spayed name-- 
warned, thwarted, disregarded, beautiful-- 
last of her line. 



all night the sound had   
come back again, 
and again falls 
this quiet, persistent rain. 

what am i to myself 
that must be remembered,   
insisted upon 
so often? is it 

that never the ease,   
even the hardness,   
of rain falling 
will have for me 

something other than this,   
something not so insistent-- 
am i to be locked in this 
final uneasiness. 

love, if you love me,   
lie next to me. 
be for me, like rain,   
the getting out 

of the tiredness, the fatuousness, the semi- 
lust of intentional indifference. 
be wet 
with a decent happiness.


my embarrassment at his nakedness,   
at the pool's edge, 
and my wife, with his, 
standing, watching-- 

this was a freedom   
not given me who am   
more naked, 
less contained 

by my own white flesh 
and the ability   
to take quietly   
what comes to me. 

the sense of myself   
separate, grew 
a white mirror 
in the quiet water 

he breaks with his hands   
and feet, kicking, 
pulls up to land 
on the edge by the feet 

of these women   
who must know   
that for each 
man is a speech 

describes him, makes 
the day grow white 
and sure, a quietness of water   
in the mind, 

lets hang, descriptive   
as a risk, something 
for which he cannot find   
a means or time.


as i sd to my   
friend, because i am   
always talking,--john, i 

sd, which was not his   
name, the darkness sur- 
rounds us, what 

can we do against 
it, or else, shall we & 
why not, buy a goddamn big car, 

drive, he sd, for   
christ's sake, look   
out where yr going.


the man sits in a timelessness   
with the horse under him in time   
to a movement of legs and hooves   
upon a timeless sand. 

distance comes in from the foreground   
present in the picture as time 
he reads outward from 
and comes from that beginning. 

a wind blows in 
and out and all about the man   
as the horse ran 
and runs to come in time. 

a house is burning in the sand.   
a man and horse are burning.   
the wind is burning. 
they are running to arrive.


the first retainer   
he gave to her   
was a golden 
wedding ring. 

the second--late at night   
he woke up, 
leaned over on an elbow,   
and kissed her. 

the third and the last-- 
he died with 
and gave up loving 
and lived with her.


comes the time when it's later 
and onto your table the headwaiter   
puts the bill, and very soon after 
rings out the sound of lively laughter-- 

picking up change, hands like a walrus,   
and a face like a barndoor's, 
and a head without any apparent size,   
nothing but two eyes-- 

so that's you, man, 
or me. i make it as i can,   
i pick up, i go 
faster than they know-- 

out the door, the street like a night,   
any night, and no one in sight,   
but then, well, there she is, 
old friend liz-- 

and she opens the door of her cadillac,   
i step in back, 
and we're gone. 
she turns me on-- 

there are very huge stars, man, in the sky, 
and from somewhere very far off someone hands me a slice of apple pie, 
with a gob of white, white ice cream on top of it,   
and i eat it-- 

slowly. and while certainly 
they are laughing at me, and all around me is racket   
of these cats not making it, i make it 

in my wicker basket.


the galloping collection of boards   
are the house which i afforded   
one evening to walk into 
just as the night came down. 

dark inside, the candle 
lit of its own free will, the attic   
groaned then, the stairs 
led me up into the air. 

from outside, it must have seemed   
a wonder that it was 
the inside he as me saw 
in the dark there.


he wants to be 
a brutal old man, 
an aggressive old man, 
as dull, as brutal 
as the emptiness around him, 

he doesn't want compromise,   
nor to be ever nice 
to anyone. just mean, 
and final in his brutal, 
his total, rejection of it all. 

he tried the sweet,   
the gentle, the oh, 
let's hold hands together 
and it was awful, 
dull, brutally inconsequential. 

now he'll stand on 
his own dwindling legs.   
his arms, his skin,   
shrink daily. and 
he loves, but hates equally.


i dreamt last night 
the fright was over, that 
the dust came, and then water,   
and women and men, together   
again, and all was quiet 
in the dim moon's light. 

a paean of such patience-- 
laughing, laughing at me,   
and the days extend over 
the earth's great cover, 
grass, trees, and flower- 
ing season, for no clear reason.


for anselm hollo
go out into brightened   
space out there the fainter   
yellowish place it 
makes for eye to enter out   
to greyed penumbra all the   
way to thoughtful searching   
sight of all beyond that 
solid red both brick and seeming   
metal roof or higher black   
beyond the genial slope i   
look at daily house top on   
my own way up to heaven. 

          

same roof, light's gone   
down back of it, behind   
the crying end of day, i   
need something to do, it's   
been again those other   
things, what's out there,   
sodden edge of sea's   
bay, city's graveyard, park   
deserted, flattened aspect,   
leaves gone colored fall   
to sidewalk, street, the end   
of all these days but   
still this regal light. 

          

trees stripped, rather shed 
of leaves, the black solid trunks up 
to fibrous mesh of smaller   
branches, it is weather's window,   
weather's particular echo, here   
as if this place had been once,   
now vacant, a door that had had   
hinges swung in air's peculiar   
emptiness, greyed, slumped elsewhere,   
asphalt blank of sidewalks, line of   
linearly absolute black metal fence. 

          

old sky freshened with cloud bulk   
slides over frame of window the   
shadings of softened greys a light   
of air up out of this dense high   
structured enclosure of buildings   
top or pushed up flat of bricked roof   
frame i love i love the safety of   
small world this door frame back   
of me the panes of simple glass yet   
airy up sweep of birch trees sit in   
flat below all designation declaration   
here as clouds move so simply away. 

          

windows now lit close out the   
upper dark the night's a face   
three eyes far fainter than   
the day all faced with light   
inside the room makes eye re- 
flective see the common world   
as one again no outside coming   
in no more than walls and post- 
card pictures place faces across   
that cautious dark the tree no   
longer seen more than black edge   
close branches somehow still between. 

          

he was at the edge of this 
reflective echo the words blown   
back in air a bubble of suddenly   
apparent person who walked to 
sit down by the familiar brook and   
thought about his fading life 
all fading life in tremulous airy   
perspect saw it hover in the surface   
of that moving darkness at the edge   
of sun's passing water's sudden depth   
his own hands' knotted surface the   
sounding in himself of some other. 

          

one forty five afternoon red   
car parked left hand side   
of street no distinguishing   
feature still wet day a bicycle   
across the way a green door- 
way with arched upper window   
a backyard edge of back wall 
to enclosed alley low down small   
windows and two other cars green   
and blue parked too and miles   
and more miles still to go. 

          

this early still sunless morning when a chair's   
creak translates to cat's cry a blackness still 
out the window might be apparent night when the 
house still sleeping behind me seems a bag of   
immense empty silence and i feel the children   
still breathing still shifting their dreams an   
enigma will soon arrive here and the loved one   
centers all in her heavy sleeping arm out the   
leg pushed down bedclothes this body unseen un- 
known placed out there in night i can feel all   
about me still sitting in this small spare pool of   
light watching the letters the words try to speak. 

          

classic emptiness it 
sits out there edge of   
hierarchic roof top it 
marks with acid fine edge   
of apparent difference it   
is there here here that 
sky so up and out and where   
it wants to be no birds no   
other thing can for a   
moment distract it be   
beyond its simple space.


he comes here 
by whatever way he can,   
not too late, 
not too soon. 

he sits, waiting. 
he doesn't know   
why he should 
have such a patience.

inside my head 

inside my head a common room,   
a common place, a common tune, 
a common wealth, a common doom 

inside my head. i close my eyes.   
the horses run. vast are the skies, 
and blue my passing thoughts' surprise 

inside my head. what is this space   
here found to be, what is this place 
if only me? inside my head, whose face? 


the tools 

first there, it proves to be still here.   
distant as seen, it comes then to be near.   
i found it here and there unclear. 

what if my hand had only been   
extension of an outside reaching in 
to work with common means to change me then? 

all things are matter, yet these seem   
caught in the impatience of a dream,   
locked in the awkwardness they mean. 


the swan 

peculiar that swan should mean a sound? 
i'd thought of gods and power, and wounds. 
but here in the curious quiet this one has settled down. 

all day the barking dogs were kept at bay.   
better than dogs, a single swan, they say,   
will keep all such malignant force away 

and so preserve a calm, make pond a swelling lake-- 
sound through the silent grove a shattering spate   
of resonances, jarring the mind awake. 


the rose 

into one's self come in again, 
here as if ever now to once again begin 
with beauty's old, old problem never-ending-- 

go, lovely rose ... so was that story told 
in some extraordinary place then, once upon a time so old   
it seems an echo now as it again unfolds. 

i point to me to look out at the world. 
i see the white, white petals of this rose unfold.   
i know such beauty in the world grows cold. 


the skull 

come closer. now there is nothing left   
either inside or out to gainsay death,   
the skull that keeps its secrets saith. 

the ways one went, the forms that were   
empty as wind and yet they stirred 
the heart to its passion, all is passed over. 

lighten the load. close the eyes.   
let the mind loosen, the body die,   
the bird fly off to the opening sky. 


the star 

such space it comes again to be,   
a room of such vast possibility,   
a depth so great, a way so free. 

life and its person, thinking to find 
a company wherewith to keep the time   
a peaceful passage, a constant rhyme, 

stumble perforce, must lose their way,   
know that they go too far to stay   
stars in the sky, children at play.


sixty-two, sixty-three, i most remember   
as time w. c. williams dies and we are   
back from a hard two years in guatemala   
where the meager provision of being   
schoolmaster for the kids of the patrones 
of two coffee plantations has managed   
neither a life nor money. leslie dies in   
horror of bank giving way as she and her   
sister and their friends tunnel in to make   
a cubby. we live in an old cement brick   
farmhouse already inside the city limits   
of albuquerque. or that has all really   
happened and we go to vancouver where,   
thanks to friends warren and ellen tallman,   
i get a job teaching at the university of british   
columbia. it's all a curious dream, a rush   
to get out of the country before the sad   
invasion of the bay of pigs, that bleak use   
of power. one of my british colleagues   
has converted the assets of himself and   
his wife to gold bullion and keeps the   
ingots in a sturdy suitcase pushed under   
their bed. i love the young, at least i   
think i do, in their freshness, their attempt   
to find ways into canada from the western   
reaches. otherwise the local country seems   
like a faded edwardian sitcom. a stunned   
stoned woman runs one saturday night up   
and down the floors of the hydro electric   
building on pender with the rcmp in hot 
pursuit where otherwise we stood in long   
patient lines, extending often several blocks   
up the street. we were waiting to get our   
hands stamped and to be given a  pack   
of molson's. i think, i dream, i write the   
final few chapters of the island, the despairs   
gathering at the end. i read richard brautigan's   
trout fishing in america but am too uptight   
to enjoy his quiet, bright wit. then that   
summer there is the great vancouver poetry   
festival, allen comes back from india, olson   
from gloucester, beloved robert duncan   
from stinson beach. denise reads hypocrite   
women to the burnaby ladies and gary snyder,   
philip whalen, and margaret avison are there   
too along with a veritable host of the young.   
then it's autumn again. i've quit my job   
and we head back to albuquerque   
and i teach again at the university, and   
sometime just about then i must have   
seen myself as others see or saw me,   
even like in a mirror, but could not quite   
accept either their reassuring friendship   
or their equally locating anger. selfish,   
empty, i kept at it. thirty-eight years later   
i seem to myself still much the same,   
even if i am happier, i think, and older.


for m.h.
friend, remember how you showed us beasts love beauty?   
we were wading in your lake with bluegills and you said,   
be careful, you will lose your beauty marks 

to their little jaws. we were a delicacy. from us they purchased 
the darkest part of the skin, only what contrasts on us.   
and it was more than a pinch or sting, 

it's a sensation of hunger 
that makes us spring off the bottom and swim out deep   
and safe. no blue stripes on cheeks no red on fins 

old individual's belly coppery red or brassy.   
as others see you, i think these indicate, 
who would have you all one shade then wouldn't have you. 

at your full table later, over muskellunge and lemon,   
we read in the book the fish that liked us 
has certain maxillaries wholly wanting. your gourmet bluegill 

it lives in the eye of the beholder, it swims the vitreous   
humor, would eat even your blind spot   
but we think we can paddle out there until all 

goes dark, and we are wholly desirable, and too much.


the child i left your class to have   
later had a habit of sleeping   
with her arms around a globe 
she'd unscrewed, dropped, and dented. 
i always felt she could possess it,   
the pink countries and the mauve 
and the ocean which got to keep its blue. 
coming from the southern hemisphere to teach,   
which you had never had to do, you took 
a bare-walled room, alone, its northern   
windowscapes as gray as walls. 
to decorate, you'd only brought a black madonna. 
i thought you must have skipped summer that year,   
southern winter, southern spring, then north 
for winter over again. still, it pleased you 
to take credit for introducing us, 
and later to bring our daughter a small flipbook 
of partners dancing, and a ring   
with a secret whistle. --all are 
broken now like her globe, but she remembers   
them as i recall the black madonna   
facing you across the room so that   
in a way you had the dark fertile life   
you were always giving gifts to.   
your smaller admirer off to school,   
i take the globe and roll it away where   
on it now is someone like you?


heads were rolling down the highway in high slat trucks.   
i knew it was time to buy you and found you, 
the last sphere unscarred and undistorted in the store,   
big as my own head. 

it was time too to leave you uncut and full-featured,   
like the grandpa of twenty-five pumpkins in my past,   
khrushchev-cheeked and dwelling on yourself,   
great knee of my childhood. 

i plainly thought you would rot. 
i remembered the fetor of other pumpkins, 
their blue populations coming out of hiding as if at the end   
of some apocalypse. 

i devoted a day to reading up on minor cucurbits   
i learned your dozen names in african 
and came home ready to raise or raze you,   
positive of change. 

but so far--eternity. i think i would not like   
eternity, after i had used my senses up, 
as i've tried with you--fingertips dragging over your world   
pole to pole 

till they go dead like explorers, nostril cilia 
detecting your fragrance more delicate than they-- 
and my patience. it's christmas, it's a new year   
and i hear 

of a family who's kept you for four ... 
you endure like matter manufactured 
and indeed your stem seems punched into your orange gathers 
like a button in a mattress. 

shall i give you a room or a shrine? and shall i   
purchase you a mate and family, 
when ours is so inadequate, fixed upon your window   
deathbed as we are, 

centered upon a time and birth, new holiday, new friends,   
new pumpkins, celebrating when all 
that has failed us has passed away. 
you have not failed.


the man vending needles at our door   
was lucky to greet you. 
he looked poor but you acted needle-poor   
where i'd have said, i don't need ... 

he sells needles to prick your heart   
and they'll take small bites 
out of my finger in a layer of skin   
where my feelings are thin. 

the old thread knitting together his many wools   
might last another trudge 
to our porch he came last year but i 
refused and barely looked him in the eye. 

i've lost how many needles since then?   
besides he is mute 
and would see how dumb we are to buy   
three hundred needles for relief. 

but he supplied us to the end of life. 
i'll give away some. 
and you might never use these points 
that push through cloth, cut to be made one.


the names of things--sparks 
i ran on them like a component   
henries, microhenries, blue   
beavers, wee wee ductors   
biographer of small lives, 
of a plug and his girl named jack,   
of utopian colonies which worked-- 
steel, germanium, brass, aluminum, 
replaceables. 
                   outside, afloat, my words 
swung an arm charting the woman 
who was the river bottom. 

we tried, beyond work, at work,   
to keep what we loved. near 
christmas i remember the office 
women trimming their desperately   
glittering holy day trees. and, 
just as i left, the company 
talent show, the oils and sentiment   
thick on still lifes and seacoasts, 
the brush strokes tortured as a child's   
first script. someone 
had studied driftwood another man,   
the spray of a wave, the mania 
of waters above torpedoes.


lions don't need your help. in the serengeti,   
for instance, one thousand like the very rich 

hold sway over more than connecticut. the mane   
of the lion, like the hooked jaw of the male salmon, 

acts as a shield for defense and is the gift 
of sexual selection. his eyes are fathomless amber. 

the lion is the most social of the big cats. 
pride members are affectionate among themselves. 

they rub cheeks when they meet. they rest 
and hunt together. and cubs suckle indiscriminately. 

but strangers or members of a neighboring pride are not   
usually accepted. if a pride male meets a strange female 

he may greet her in a friendly fashion   
and even mate with her 

but the pride females will drive her off. 
male lions, usually depicted as indolent freeloaders 

who let the lionesses do all the hunting, are not mere   
parasites. they maintain the integrity of the territory. 

lions eat communally but completely lack table manners.   
indeed, lions give the impression that their evolution 

toward a social existence is incomplete--that cooperation   
in achieving a task does not yet include 

the equal division of the spoils. 
more bad news lions are not good parents. 

but prowess, that they have. their courage comes   
from being built, like an automobile, 

for power. a visible lion is usually a safe lion,   
but one should never feel safe 

because almost always there is something one can't see.   
given protection and power 

a lion does not need to be clever. 
now, lions are not the most likable kind of animal 

unless you are a certain type of person, 
that is, not necessarily leonine in the sense of manly 

or ferocious, but one who wouldn't mind resting twenty   
of twenty-four hours a day and who is not beyond 

stealing someone else's kill   
about half the time. 

lions are not my favorite kind of animal,   
gazelles seem nicer, 

a zebra has his own sort of appealing pathos,   
especially when he is sure prey for the lion. 

lions have little to offer the spirit. 
if we made of ourselves parks and placed the lion 

in the constituent he most resembled   
he would be in our blood.


retired ballerinas on winter afternoons   
          walking their dogs 
                      in central park west 
    or their cats on leashes-- 
       the cats themselves old highwire artists   
the ballerinas 
                leap and pirouette 
                           through columbus circle   
         while winos on park benches 
               laid back like drunken goudonovs   
            hear the taxis trumpet together 
               like horsemen of the apocalypse   
                               in the dusk of the gods   
it is the final witching hour 
                when swains are full of swan songs   
    and all return through the dark dusk   
                to their bright cells 
                                  in glass highrises 
      or sit down to oval cigarettes and cakes   
                              in the russian tea room   
    or climb four flights to back rooms 
                                 in westside brownstones   
               where faded playbill photos 
                        fall peeling from their frames   
                            like last year's autumn leaves


people getting divorced 
          riding around with their clothes in the car   
   and wondering what happened 
                      to everyone and everything   
                         including their other 
                                                pair of shoes 
         and if you spy one 
             then who knows what happened 
                                             to the other 
                                           with tongue alack   
   and years later not even knowing 
                               if the other ever 
                                        found a mate 
                                  without splitting the seams   
                                     or remained intact 
                                                          unlaced   
    and the sole 
                     ah the soul 
                                     a curious conception   
         hanging on somehow 
                                     to walk again 
                                                   in the free air   
                            once the heel 
                                                 has been replaced


sometime during eternity 
                                                       some guys show up   
and one of them 
                      who shows up real late 
                                                       is a kind of carpenter   
      from some square-type place 
                                              like galilee 
          and he starts wailing 
                                          and claiming he is hip 
            to who made heaven 
                                       and earth 
                                                      and that the cat

                                                 is his dad 

          and moreover 
             he adds 
                         it's all writ down 
                                              on some scroll-type parchments

                a long time ago 
                                       and which you won't even find   
         for a coupla thousand years or so 
                                                 or at least for

                                                   or me 
                                                            for that matter 
          you're hot 
                         they tell him 
          and they cool him 

          they stretch him on the tree to cool 

                         and everybody after that 
                                                               is always making models   
                                          of this tree 
                                                          with him hung up   
          and always crooning his name 
                                     and calling him to come down   
                                 and sit in 
                                                 on their combo 
                           as if he is the king cat 
                                                            who's got to blow   
                      or they can't quite make it 

                      only he don't come down 
                                                         from his tree 
          him just hang there 
                                       on his tree 
          looking real petered out 
                                          and real cool 
                                                             and also 
                   according to a roundup 
                                                    of late world news   
             from the usual unreliable sources 
                                                               real dead


in goya's greatest scenes we seem to see 
                                           the people of the world   
       exactly at the moment when 
             they first attained the title of 
                                                             suffering humanity'   
          they writhe upon the page 
                                        in a veritable rage 
                                                                of adversity   
          heaped up 
                     groaning with babies and bayonets 
                                                       under cement skies   
            in an abstract landscape of blasted trees 
                  bent statues bats wings and beaks 
                               slippery gibbets 
                  cadavers and carnivorous cocks 
            and all the final hollering monsters 
                  of the 
                           imagination of disaster' 
            they are so bloody real 
                                        it is as if they really still existed 

    and they do 

                  only the landscape is changed 

 they still are ranged along the roads   
          plagued by legionnaires 
                     false windmills and demented roosters 
 they are the same people 
                                     only further from home 
      on freeways fifty lanes wide 
                              on a concrete continent 
                                        spaced with bland billboards   
                        illustrating imbecile illusions of happiness 

                        
                        the scene shows fewer tumbrils 
                                                but more strung-out citizens 
                                                                     in painted cars 
                               and they have strange license plates   
                           and engines 
                                           that devour america


don't let that horse 
                              eat that violin 

    cried chagall's mother 

                                     but he   
                      kept right on 
                                     painting 

and became famous 

and kept on painting 
                              the horse with violin in mouth 

and when he finally finished it 
he jumped up upon the horse 
                                        and rode away   
          waving the violin 

and then with a low bow gave it 
to the first naked nude he ran across 


and there were no strings   
                                     attached


in golden gate park that day 
                           a man and his wife were coming along   
         thru the enormous meadow 
                           which was the meadow of the world   
he was wearing green suspenders 
                              and carrying an old beat-up flute 
                                                                        in one hand   
      while his wife had a bunch of grapes 
                                  which she kept handing out 
                                                                         individually   
                                                      to various squirrels 
                                                                           as if each   
                                                             were a little joke 

      and then the two of them came on 
                                                thru the enormous meadow   
which was the meadow of the world 
                                                 and then 
            at a very still spot where the trees dreamed 
         and seemed to have been waiting thru all time 
                                                                            for them   
             they sat down together on the grass 
                                              without looking at each other   
                and ate oranges 
                                    without looking at each other 
                                                            and put the peels   
             in a basket which they seemed 
                                       to have brought for that purpose   
                  without looking at each other 

      and then 
                  he took his shirt and undershirt off   
       but kept his hat on 
                                    sideways 
                                                and without saying anything   
             fell asleep under it 
                                           and his wife just sat there looking   
at the birds which flew about 
   calling to each other 
                           in the stilly air 
      as if they were questioning existence 
                   or trying to recall something forgotten 

but then finally 
                   she too lay down flat 
                                                and just lay there looking up   
                                                                               at nothing   
                        yet fingering the old flute 
                                                                which nobody played 
                            and finally looking over 
                                                                at him 
                  without any particular expression 
                                                               except a certain awful look   
                        of terrible depression


the dove-white gulls 
on the wet lawn in washington square   
in the early morning fog 
each a little ghost in the gloaming 
souls transmigrated maybe 
from hudson's shrouded shores 
across all the silent years-- 
which one's my maybe mafioso father   
in his so white suit and black shoes 
in his real estate office forty-second street   
or at the front table wherever he went-- 
which my dear lost mother with faded smile   
locked away from me in time-- 
which my big brother charley 
selling switching-signals all his life 
on the new york central-- 
and which good guy brother clem 
sweating in sing sing's darkest offices   
deputy-warden thirty years 
watching executions in the wooden armchair   
with leather straps and black hood 
he too gone mad with it in the end-- 
and which my nearest brother harry 
still kindest and dearest in a far suburb-- 
i see them now all turn to me at last   
gull-eyed in the white dawn 
about to call to me 
across the silent grass


airport bus from jfk 
cruising through queens 
passing huge endless cemetery   
by long island's old expressway 
once a dirt path for wheelless indians   
myriad small tombstones tilted up   
gesturing statues on parapets   
stone arms or wings upraised   
lost among illegible inscriptions   
and the setting yellow sun 
painting all of them 
on one side only 
with an ochre brush 
rows and rows and rows and rows   
of small stone slabs 
tilted toward the sun forever   
while on the far horizon 
mannahatta's great stone slabs   
skyscraper tombs and parapets   
casting their own long black shadows   
over all these long-haired graves   
the final restless places 
of old-country potato farmers   
dustbin pawnbrokers 
dead dagos and dublin bouncers   
tinsmiths and blacksmiths and roofers   
house painters and house carpenters   
cabinet makers and cigar makers   
garment workers and streetcar motormen   
railroad switchmen and signal salesmen   
swabbers and sweepers and swampers   
steam-fitters and key-punch operators   
ward heelers and labor organizers   
railroad dicks and smalltime mafiosi   
shopkeepers and saloon keepers and doormen 
icemen and middlemen and conmen   
housekeepers and housewives and dowagers   
french housemaids and swedish cooks   
brooklyn barmaids and bronxville butlers   
opera singers and gandy dancers   
pitchers and catchers

poolroom hustlers and fight promoters   
catholic sisters of charity   
parish priests and irish cops   
viennese doctors of delirium   
now all abandoned in eternity   
parcels in a dead-letter office   
inscrutable addresses on them   
beyond further deliverance   
in an america wheeling past them   
and disappearing oblivious

down the great american drain

in the cry of kids 
in tenement yards at night

               where once upon a midnight then 
            young ti-jean danced with mmre 
                   in the moondrowned light 
and rolled upon the greensward   
    his mother and lover 
         all one with buddha 
                           in his arms 


. 

and then ti-jean jack with joual tongue 
      disguised as an american fullback in plaid shirt   
          crossing and recrossing america 
                                             in speedy cars   
    a dr. sax's shadow shadowing him 
      like a shroudy cloud over the landscape   
       song of the open road sung drunken 
               with whitman and jack london and thomas wolfe 
            still echoing through 
                            a nineteen thirties america   
                            a nineteen forties america   
                            an america now long gone 
               except in broken down dusty old 
                                              greyhound bus stations 
                   in small lost towns 
       ti-jean's vision of america 
                seen from a moving car window 
                      the same as wolfe's lonely 
                                                sweeping vision 
                  glimpsed from a coach-train long ago 
       and thus did he see first the dark land'   
and so jack 
                in an angel midnight bar 
   somewhere west of middle america 
          where one drunk madonna 
                        shades of one on a merrimac corner   
      makes him a gesture with her eyes 
                                                       a blue gesture   
          and ti-jean answers 
                                       only with his eyes   
and the night goes on with them 
       and the light comes up on them 
                      making love in a parking lot 


. 

in the dark of his fellaheen night 
    in the light of the illuminated 
                                 stations of the cross 
               and the illuminated grotto 
                           down behind the funeral home   
                                           by roar of river   
       where now ti-jean alone 
                     returned to lowell 
                        in one more doomed 
                                    wolfian attempt 
                                    to go home again   
    gropes past the twelve stations of the cross 
               reciting aloud the french inscriptions 
                   in his joual accent 
            which makes the plaster french christ 
                                                       laugh and cry 
                  as he hefts his huge cross 
                                        up the eternal hill   
    and a very real tear drops 
                                           in the grotto 
                           from the face 
                                              of the stoned virgin 


. 

         light upon light   
the mountain 
                  keeps still 


. 

         hands over ears   
he steals away 
               with the bell. . . .

away above a harborful 
                                              of caulkless houses   
among the charley noble chimneypots 
                  of a rooftop rigged with clotheslines   
             a woman pastes up sails 
                                          upon the wind 
hanging out her morning sheets 
                                             with wooden pins 
                                  o lovely mammal 
                                             her nearly naked breasts   
                        throw taut shadows 
                                             when she stretches up   
to hang at last the last of her 
                                              so white washed sins   
                  but it is wetly amorous 
                                                   and winds itself about her   
                     clinging to her skin 
                                                   so caught with arms   
                                                                               upraised   
            she tosses back her head 
                                              in voiceless laughter   
    and in choiceless gesture then 
                                                 shakes out gold hair 

while in the reachless seascape spaces 

                           between the blown white shrouds   

         stand out the bright steamers 

                                                to kingdom come


london 

                  crossfigured   
                  creeping with trams 

         and the artists on sundays

                               in the suburbs 

             it 
                could have been anyplace   
                         but it wasn't 
                              it was

                                                and when someone shouted over 

that they had got a model 

                                  i ran out across the court 

                     but then 
                                 when the model started taking off 
                her clothes 
                                 there was nothing underneath 
                                                                           i mean to say   
    she took off her shoes 
                                     and found no feet   
                  took off her top 
                                          and found no tit 
                                                under it 
                  and i must say she did look 
                                                          a bit 
                                                                astounded 
                         just standing there 
                              looking down 
                        at where her legs were 
                                                         not 

         but so very carefully then 
                                                she put her clothes back on   
and as soon as she was dressed again 
                                                      completely 
                      she was completely 
                                                 all right 

                do it again cried someone

                but she was afraid to 

                                       
                                           and gave up modelling   


            and forever after 

                                                
                         slept in her clothes

i am leading a quiet life   
in mike's place every day   
watching the champs 
of the dante billiard parlor   
and the french pinball addicts.   
i am leading a quiet life   
on lower east broadway.   
i am an american. 
i was an american boy. 
i read the american boy magazine   
and became a boy scout   
in the suburbs. 
i thought i was tom sawyer   
catching crayfish in the bronx river 
and imagining the mississippi.   
i had a baseball mit 
and an american flyer bike. 
i delivered the woman's home companion   
at five in the afternoon 
or the herald trib 
at five in the morning. 
i still can hear the paper thump   
on lost porches. 
i had an unhappy childhood.   
i saw lindbergh land. 
i looked homeward 
and saw no angel.

from the five and ten cent store   
the same month i made eagle scout.

and sat on them. 
i landed in normandy 
in a rowboat that turned over. 
i have seen the educated armies 
on the beach at dover. 
i have seen egyptian pilots in purple clouds   
shopkeepers rolling up their blinds   
at midday 
potato salad and dandelions 
at anarchist picnics. 
i am reading lorna doone' 
and a life of john most 
terror of the industrialist 
a bomb on his desk at all times. 
i have seen the garbagemen parade   
in the columbus day parade 
behind the glib 
farting trumpeters. 
i have not been out to the cloisters   
in a long time 
nor to the tuileries 
but i still keep thinking 
of going. 
i have seen the garbagemen parade   
when it was snowing. 
i have eaten hotdogs in ballparks. 
i have heard the gettysburg address

i have been in asia 
with noah in the ark. 
i was in india 
when rome was built. 
i have been in the manger 
with an ass. 
i have seen the eternal distributor   
from a white hill 
in south san francisco 
and the laughing woman at loona park   
outside the fun house 
in a great rainstorm 
still laughing. 
i have heard the sound of revelry   
by night. 
i have wandered lonely 
as a crowd. 
i am leading a quiet life 
outside of mike's place every day   
watching the world walk by 
in its curious shoes. 
i once started out 
to walk around the world 
but ended up in brooklyn. 
that bridge was too much for me.   
i have engaged in silence 
exile and cunning. 
i flew too near the sun 
and my wax wings fell off. 
i am looking for my old man   
whom i never knew. 
i am looking for the lost leader   
with whom i flew. 
young men should be explorers.   
home is where one starts from.   
but mother never told me 
there'd be scenes like this. 
womb-weary 
i rest

where books were trees.   
i have heard the birds   
that sound like bells. 
i have worn grey flannel trousers 
and walked upon the beach of hell. 
i have dwelt in a hundred cities 
where trees were books. 
what subways what taxis what cafes 
what women with blind breasts 
limbs lost among skyscrapers 
i have seen the statues of heroes 
at carrefours. 
danton weeping at a metro entrance 
columbus in barcelona 
pointing westward up the ramblas 
toward the american express   
lincoln in his stony chair   
and a great stone face   
in north dakota. 
i know that columbus   
did not invent america. 
i have heard a hundred housebroken ezra pounds.   
they should all be freed.   
it is long since i was a herdsman. 
i am leading a quiet life   
in mike's place every day   
reading the classified columns. 
i have read the reader's digest 
from cover to cover 
and noted the close identification 
of the united states and the promised land 
where every coin is marked   
in god we trust 
but the dollar bills do not have it 
being gods unto themselves.   
i read the want ads daily   
looking for a stone a leaf   
an unfound door. 
i hear america singing 
in the yellow pages. 
one could never tell

i read the papers every day   
and hear humanity amiss 
in the sad plethora of print.

on the outhouse wall. 
i helped kilroy write it. 
i marched up fifth avenue 
blowing on a bugle in a tight platoon   
but hurried back to the casbah   
looking for my dog. 
i see a similarity 
between dogs and me. 
dogs are the true observers   
walking up and down the world   
thru the molloy country. 
i have walked down alleys   
too narrow for chryslers. 
i have seen a hundred horseless milkwagons   
in a vacant lot in astoria. 
ben shahn never painted them   
but they're there 
askew in astoria. 
i have heard the junkman's obbligato.   
i have ridden superhighways   
and believed the billboard's promises   
crossed the jersey flats 
and seen the cities of the plain 
and wallowed in the wilds of westchester 
with its roving bands of natives 
in stationwagons. 
i have seen them. 
i am the man.   
i was there.   
i suffered 
somewhat. 
i am an american. 
i have a passport. 
i did not suffer in public. 
and i'm too young to die.

i have leaned in drunken doorways. 
i have written wild stories 
without punctuation. 
i am the man. 
i was there.   
i suffered   
somewhat. 
i have sat in an uneasy chair. 
i am a tear of the sun.   
i am a hill 
where poets run. 
i invented the alphabet 
after watching the flight of cranes   
who made letters with their legs. 
i am a lake upon a plain.   
i am a word 
in a tree. 
i am a hill of poetry.   
i am a raid 
on the inarticulate. 
i have dreamt 
that all my teeth fell out   
but my tongue lived   
to tell the tale. 
for i am a still 
of poetry. 
i am a bank of song.   
i am a playerpiano 
in an abandoned casino   
on a seaside esplanade   
in a dense fog 
still playing. 
i see a similarity 
between the laughing woman 
and myself. 
i have heard the sound of summer   
in the rain. 
i have seen girls on boardwalks   
have complicated sensations.   
i understand their hesitations. 
i am a gatherer of fruit.   
i have seen how kisses   
cause euphoria. 
i have risked enchantment.   
i have seen the virgin   
in an appletree at chartres 
and saint joan burn 
at the bella union. 
i have seen giraffes in junglejims 
their necks like love 
wound around the iron circumstances   
of the world. 
i have seen the venus aphrodite   
armless in her drafty corridor.   
i have heard a siren sing   
at one fifth avenue. 
i have seen the white goddess dancing   
in the rue des beaux arts   
on the fourteenth of july   
and the beautiful dame without mercy   
picking her nose in chumley's.   
she did not speak english.   
she had yellow hair 
and a hoarse voice 
i am leading a quiet life   
in mike's place every day   
watching the pocket pool players   
making the minestrone scene   
wolfing the macaronis   
and i have read somewhere   
the meaning of existence   
yet have forgotten 
just exactly where. 
but i am the man 
and i'll be there. 
and i may cause the lips   
of those who are asleep   
to speak. 
and i may make my notebooks   
into sheaves of grass.   
and i may write my own   
eponymous epitaph 
instructing the horsemen   
to pass.


i didn't get much sleep last night 
thinking about underwear 
have you ever stopped to consider   
underwear in the abstract   
when you really dig into it 
some shocking problems are raised   
underwear is something   
we all have to deal with   
everyone wears 
some kind of underwear 
the pope wears underwear i hope 
the governor of louisiana   
wears underwear 
i saw him on tv 
he must have had tight underwear 
he squirmed a lot 
underwear can really get you in a bind 
you have seen the underwear ads 
for men and women 
so alike but so different 
women's underwear holds things up 
men's underwear holds things down   
underwear is one thing   
men and women have in common   
underwear is all we have between us 
you have seen the three-color pictures 
with crotches encircled 
to show the areas of extra strength 
and three-way stretch 
promising full freedom of action 
don't be deceived 
it's all based on the two-party system 
which doesn't allow much freedom of choice   
the way things are set up   
america in its underwear 
struggles thru the night 
underwear controls everything in the end   
take foundation garments for instance   
they are really fascist forms 
of underground government 
making people believe 
something but the truth 
telling you what you can or can't do   
did you ever try to get around a girdle   
perhaps non-violent action 
is the only answer 
did gandhi wear a girdle? 
did lady macbeth wear a girdle? 
was that why macbeth murdered sleep?   
and that spot she was always rubbing-- 
was it really in her underwear? 
modern anglosaxon ladies 
must have huge guilt complexes 
always washing and washing and washing   
out damned spot 
underwear with spots very suspicious   
underwear with bulges very shocking   
underwear on clothesline a great flag of freedom   
someone has escaped his underwear   
may be naked somewhere 
help 
but don't worry 
everybody's still hung up in it 
there won't be no real revolution 
and poetry still the underwear of the soul   
and underwear still covering 
a multitude of faults 
in the geological sense-- 
strange sedimentary stones, inscrutable cracks   
if i were you i'd keep aside 
an oversize pair of winter underwear   
do not go naked into that good night   
and in the meantime 
keep calm and warm and dry 
no use stirring ourselves up prematurely   
over nothing' 
move forward with dignity 
hand in vest 
don't get emotional 
and death shall have no dominion   
there's plenty of time my darling 
are we not still young and easy 
don't shout


in the backyard of our house on norwood,   
there were five hundred steel cages lined up,   
each with a wooden box 
roofed with tar paper 
inside, two stories, with straw 
for a bed. sometimes the minks would pace   
back and forth wildly, looking for a way out 
or else they'd hide in their wooden houses, even when   
we'd put the offering of raw horse meat on their trays, as if   
they knew they were beautiful 
and wanted to deprive us. 
in spring the placid kits 
drank with glazed eyes. 
sometimes the mothers would go mad   
and snap their necks. 
my uncle would lift the roof like a god   
who might lift our roof, look down on us   
and take us out to safety. 
sometimes one would escape. 
he would go down on his hands and knees,   
aiming a flashlight like 
a bullet of light, hoping to catch 
the orange gold of its eyes. 
he wore huge boots, gloves 
so thick their little teeth couldn't bite through.   
they're wild, he'd say. never trust them. 
each afternoon when i put the scoop of raw meat rich   
with eggs and vitamins on their trays,   
i'd call to each a greeting. 
their small thin faces would follow as if slightly curious.   
in fall they went out in a van, returning 
sorted, matched, their skins hanging down on huge metal   
hangers, pinned by their mouths. 
my uncle would take them out when company came 
and drape them over his arm--the sweetest cargo.   
he'd blow down the pelts softly 
and the hairs would part for his breath 
and show the shining underlife which, like   
the shining of the soul, gives us each 
character and beauty.


my mother was not impressed with her beauty 
once a year she put it on like a costume, 
plaited her black hair, slick as cornsilk, down past her hips,   
in one rope-thick braid, turned it, carefully, hand over hand,   
and fixed it at the nape of her neck, stiff and elegant as a crown,   
with tortoise pins, like huge insects, 
some belonging to her dead mother, 
some to my living grandmother. 
sitting on the stool at the mirror, 
she applied a peachy foundation that seemed to hold her down, to trap her, 
as if we never would have noticed what flew among us unless it was weighted and bound in its mask. 
vaseline shined her eyebrows, 
mascara blackened her lashes until they swept down like feathers   
her eyes deepened until they shone from far away. 

now i remember her hands, her poor hands, which, even then were old from scrubbing, 
whiter on the inside than they should have been, 
and hard, the first joints of her fingers, little fattened pads,   
the nails filed to sharp points like old-fashioned ink pens, 
painted a jolly color. 
her hands stood next to her face and wanted to be put away, prayed 
for the scrub bucket and brush to make them useful.   
and, as i write, i forget the years i watched her   
pull hairs like a witch from her chin, magnify 
every blotch--as if acid were thrown from the inside. 

but once a year my mother   
rose in her white silk slip, 
not the slave of the house, the woman, 
took the ironed dress from the hanger--   
allowing me to stand on the bed, so that   
my face looked directly into her face,   
and hold the garment away from her   
as she pulled it down.


every town with black catholics has a st. peter claver's.   
my first was nursery school. 
miss maturin made us fold our towels in a regulation square and nap on army cots. 
no mother questioned no child sassed. 
in blue pleated skirts, pants, and white shirts, 
we stood in line to use the open toilets 
and conserved light by walking in darkness. 
unsmiling, mostly light-skinned, we were the children of the middle class, preparing to take our parents' places in a world that would demand we fold our hands and wait. 
they said it was good for us, the bowl of soup, its pasty whiteness 
i learned to swallow and distrust my senses. 

on holy cards st. peter's face is olive-toned, his hair near kinky 
i thought he was one of us who pass between the rich and poor, the light and dark. 
now i read he was a spanish jesuit priest who labored for the salvation of the african negroes and the abolition of the slave trade. 
i was tricked again, robbed of my patron, 
and left with a debt to another white man.


that time my grandmother dragged me 
through the perfume aisles at saks, she held me up   
by my arm, hissing, stand up, 
through clenched teeth, her eyes 
bright as a dog's 
cornered in the light. 
she said it over and over, 
as if she were jesus, 
and i were dead. she had been 
solid as a tree, 
a fur around her neck, a 
light-skinned matron whose car was parked, who walked on swirling 
marble and passed through 
brass openings--in . 
there was not even a black 
elevator operator at saks. 
the saleswoman had brought velvet   
leggings to lace me in, and cooed, 
as if in the service of all grandmothers.   
my grandmother had smiled, but not   
hungrily, not like my mother 
who hated them, but wanted to please,   
and they had smiled back, as if 
they were wearing wooden collars.   
when my legs gave out, my grandmother   
dragged me up and held me like god   
holds saints by the 
roots of the hair. i begged her 
to believe i couldn't help it. stumbling,   
her face white 
with sweat, she pushed me through the crowd, rushing 
away from those eyes   
that saw through   
her clothes, under 
her skin, all the way down   
to the transparent   
genes confessing.


i. 
tonight, i look, thunderstruck 
at the gold head of my grandchild.   
almost asleep, he buries his feet   
between my thighs 
his little straw eyes 
close in the near dark. 
i smell the warmth of his raw   
slightly foul breath, the new death   
waiting to rot inside him. 
our breaths equalize our heartbeats   
every muscle of the chest uncoils,   
the arm bones loosen in the nest   
of nerves. i think of the peace   
of walking through the house, 
pointing to the name of this, the name of that, 
an educator of a new man. 

mother. grandmother. wise 
snake-woman who will show the way   
spider-woman whose black tentacles 
hold him precious. or will tear off his head,   
her teeth over the little husband, 
the small fist clotted in trust at her breast. 

this morning, looking at the face of his father, 
i remembered how, an infant, his face was too dark,   
nose too broad, mouth too wide. 
i did not look in that mirror 
and see the face that could save me 
from my own darkness. 
did he, looking in my eye, see 
what i turned from 
my own dark grandmother 
bending over gladioli in the field, 
her shaking black hand defenseless   
at the shining cock of flower? 

i wanted that face to die, 
to be reborn in the face of a white child. 

i wanted the soul to stay the same,   
for i loved to death, 
to damnation and god-death,   
the soul that broke out of me. 
i crowed my son my beautiful   
but when i peeked in the basket,   
i saw the face of a black man. 

did i bend over his nose 
and straighten it with my fingers   
like a vine growing the wrong way?   
did he feel my hand in malice? 

generations we prayed and fucked   
for this light child, 
the shining god of the second coming   
we bow down in shame 
and carry the children of the past   
in our wallets, begging forgiveness. 

ii. 
a picture in a book, 
a lynching. 
the bland faces of men who watch   
a christ go up in flames, smiling,   
as if he were a hooked 
fish, a felled antelope, some 
wild thing tied to boards and burned.   
his charring body 
gives off light--a halo 
burns out of him. 
his face scorched featureless 
the hair matted to the scalp 
like feathers. 
one man stands with his hand on his hip,   
another with his arm 
slung over the shoulder of a friend,   
as if this moment were large enough   
to hold affection. 

iii. 
how can we wake 
from a dream 
we are born into, 
that shines around us,   
the terrible bright air? 

having awakened, 
having seen our own bloody hands,   
how can we ask forgiveness, 
bring before our children the real   
monster of their nightmares? 

the worst is true. 
everything you did not want to know. 



the most popular act in 
penn station 
is the three black kids in ratty   
sneakers & t-shirts playing 
two violins and a cello--brahms.   
white men in business suits 
have already dug into their pockets   
as they pass and they toss in   
a dollar or two without stopping.   
brown men in work-soiled khakis   
stand with their mouths open,   
arms crossed on their bellies   
as if they themselves have always   
wanted to attempt those bars.   
one white boy, three, sits 
cross-legged in front of his 
idols--in ecstasy-- 
their slick, dark faces, 
their thin, wiry arms, 
who must begin to look 
like angels 
why does this trembling 
pull us? 
a beneath the surface we are one. 
b amazing i did not think that they could speak this tongue.


a professor invites me to his black lit class they're 
reading larson's passing. one of the black 
students says, sometimes light-skinned blacks 
think they can fool other blacks, 
but i can always tell, looking 
right through me. 
after i tell them i am black, 
i ask the class, was i passing 
when i was just sitting here, 
before i told you? a white woman 
shakes her head desperately, as if 
i had deliberately deceived her. 
she keeps examining my face, 
then turning away 
as if she hopes i'll disappear. why presume 
passing is based on what i leave out 
and not what she fills in? 
in one scene in the book, in a restaurant, 
she's passing, 
though no one checked her at the door-- 
hey, you black? 
my father, who looked white, 
told me this story every year 
when he'd go to get his driver's license, 
the man at the window filling 
out the form would ask, 
white or black? pencil poised, without looking up. 
my father wouldn't pass, but he might 
use silence to trap a devil. 
when he didn't speak, the man 
would look up at my father's face. 
what did he write? 
my father quizzed me.


i love the way the black ants use their dead. 
they carry them off like warriors on their steel 
backs. they spend hours struggling, lifting, 
dragging it is not grisly as it would be for us, 
to carry them back to be eaten, 
so that every part will be of service. i think of 
my husband at his father's grave-- 
the grass had closed 
over the headstone, and the name had disappeared. he took out   
his pocket knife and cut the grass away, he swept it 
with his handkerchief to make it clear. is this the way 
we'll be forgotten? and he bent down over the grave and wept. 



i had a little brother 
and i brought him to my mother 
and i said i want another 
little brother for a change. 
but she said don't be a bother 
so i took him to my father 
and i said this little bother 
of a brother's very strange. 
but he said one little brother 
is exactly like another 
and every little brother 
misbehaves a bit he said. 
so i took the little bother 
from my mother and my father 
and i put the little bother 
of a brother back to bed.


i wondered if the others felt 
as heroic 
and as safe my unmangled family   
slept while i slid uncertain feet ahead   
behind my flashlight's beam. 
stones, thick roots as twisted as   
a ruined body, 
what did i fear? 
i hoped my batteries 
had eight more lives 
than the lost child. 
i feared i'd find something. 

reader, by now you must be sure   
you know just where we are,   
deep in symbolic woods.   
irony, self-accusation,   
someone else's suffering.   
the search is that of art. 

you're wrong, though it's   
an intelligent mistake.   
there was a real lost child.   
i don't want to swaddle it   
in metaphor. 
i'm just a journalist 
who can't believe in objectivity.   
i'm in these poems 
because i'm in my life.   
but i digress. 
a man four volunteers   
to the left of me   
made the discovery. 

we circled in like waves 
returning to the parent shock. 
you've read this far, you might as well   
have been there too. your eyes accuse   
me of false chase. come off it, 
you're the one who thought it wouldn't   
matter what we found. 
though we came with lights 
and tongues thick in our heads, 
the issue was a human life. 
the child was still 
alive. admit you're glad.


did i ever tell you that mrs. mccave 
had twenty-three sons and she named them all dave? 
well, she did.   and that wasn't a smart thing to do. 
you see, when she wants one and calls out, yoo-hoo 
come into the house, dave she doesn't get one. 
all twenty-three daves of hers come on the run 
this makes things quite difficult at the mccaves' 
as you can imagine, with so many daves. 
and often she wishes that, when they were born, 
she had named one of them bodkin van horn 
and one of them hoos-foos.   and one of them snimm. 
and one of them hot-shot.   and one sunny jim. 
and one of them shadrack.   and one of them blinkey. 
and one of them stuffy.   and one of them stinkey. 
another one putt-putt.   another one moon face. 
another one marvin o'gravel balloon face. 
and one of them ziggy.   and one soggy muff. 
one buffalo bill.   and one biffalo buff. 
and one of them sneepy.   and one weepy weed. 
and one paris garters.   and one harris tweed. 
and one of them sir michael carmichael zutt 
and one of them oliver boliver butt 
and one of them zanzibar buck-buck mcfate ... 
but she didn't do it.   and now it's too late.


because we rage inside 
the old boundaries, 
like a young girl leaving the church,   
scared of her parents. 

because we all dream of saving   
the shaggy, dung-caked buffalo,   
shielding the herd with our bodies. 

because grief unites us, 
like the locked antlers of moose   
who die on their knees in pairs. 



a snake is the love of a thumb   
and forefinger. 
other times, an arm 
that has swallowed a bicep. 

the air behind this one   
is like a knot 
in a child's shoelace 
come undone 
while you were blinking. 

it is bearing something away.   
what? what time   
does the next snake leave? 

this one's tail is ravelling   
into its burrow-- 
a rosary returned to a purse. 
the snake is the last time your spine   
could go anywhere alone. 



no day is right for the apocalypse, 
if you ask a housewife in talking 
rock, georgia, or maybe hop river, 
connecticut. she is opening a plastic bag. 
a grotesque parody of the primeval muck 
starts oozing out. and behold, 
the plastic bag is magic 
there is no closing it. soap 
in unsoftened water, sewage, asbestos 
coiled like vermicelli, masonite shavings, 
a liquefied lifetime subscription 
to the new york times delivered all at once. 
empty body stockings, limp, forlorn, 
like collapsed lungs. a blithering slur   
of face creams, an army of photocopies   
travelling on its stomach of acronyms,   
tooth paste tubes wrung rigid and dry.   
also, two hundred and one tons 
of crumpled bumpers wrapped in insurance   
claims, slag, coal dust, plastic trimmings,   
industrial excrementa. lake erie is returning   
our gifts. 

       at first she thought she had won   
something. now it slithers through the house,   
out windows, down the street, spreading   
everywhere but heading, mostly, west.   
maybe heading is the wrong word, 
implying shape and choice. it took 
the shape of the landscape 
it rippled across like the last blanket. 
and it went west because the way lay open   
once again not the same fecund rug 
the earth grew when white people scraped   
their first paths to the pacific 
across the waves of the inland grasses. 

outside ravenswood, west virginia,   
abandoned cars shine in the sun 
like beetlebacks. the ore it took 
to make the iron it took to make the steel   
it took to make the cars, that ore 
would remember the glaciers if it could.   
now comes another grinding, but not-- 
thanks to our new techniques--so slow.   
the amiable cars wait stilly in their pasture.   
three edsels forage in the southeast corner   
like bishops of a ruined church. 
there are fords and dodges, a mercury   
on blocks, four darts and a pierce arrow, 
a choir of silenced chevrolets. 
and, showing their lapsed trademarks   
and proud grilles to a new westward   
expansion, two hudsons, a lasalle 
and a desoto. 

       i was hoping to describe 
the colors of this industrial autumn-- 
rust, a faded purple like the dusty 
skin of a concord grape, flaking moss- 
green paint with primer peeking   
blandly through, the garish macho reds   
insurance companies punish, the greys   
opaque and silvers bright, the snob colors   
e.g. british racing green, the two-tone   
combinations time will spurn like roadkill 
 pink and grey, cornflower 
blue, naval blue, royal blue, stark blue, true 
blue, the blacker blue the diver sees 
beneath him when he plumbs thirty feet-- 
but now they are all covered, 
rolling and churning in the last 
accident, like bubbles in lava. 

and now my cincinnati--the hills   
above the river, the lawn that drained 
toward ricwood ave. like a small valley of uncles, 
the sultry river musk that slid 
like a compromising note through my bedroom window-- 
and indeed all cincinnati seethes. the vats 
at proctor & gamble cease their slick 
congealing, and my beloved birthplace 
is but another whorl of dirt. 

up north near lebanon and troy and rosewood, 
the corn i skulked in as a boy 
lays back its ears like a shamed dog.   
hair along the sow's spine rises. 
the holstein pivots his massive head 
toward where the barn stood the spreading stain 
he sees is his new owner. 

what we imagined was the fire-storm, 
or, failing that, the glacier. 
or we hoped we'd get off easy, 
losing only california. 
with the seismologists and mystics 
we say the last california ridge 
crumble into the ocean. 

and we were read with elegies 

o california, sportswear 
and defense contracts, gasses that induce 
deference, high school girls 
with their own cars, we wanted 
to love you without pain. 

o california, when you were moored to us 
like a vast splinter of melon, 
like a huge and garish gondola, 
then we were happier, although 
we showed it by easy contempt. 
but now you are lost at sea, 
your cargo of mudslides and chardonnays 
lost, the prints of the old movies 
lost, the thick unlighted candles of the redwoods 
snuffed in advance. on the ocean floor 
they lie like hands of a broken clock. 

o california, here we come, 
quoting ecclesiastes, 
ruinous with self-knowledge. 

meanwhile, because the muck won't stop 
for lamentation, kansas succumbs. 
drawn down by anklets of ddt, 
the jayhawk circles lower and lower   
while the sludge moils and crests. 

now we are about to lose our voices 
we remember that tomorrow is our echo.   
o the old songs, the good days 
bad faith and civil disobedience, 
sloppy scholarship and tooth decay.   
now the age of footnotes is ours. 
ibid, ibid, ibid, ibid, ibid. 

while the rivers thickened and fish   
rose like vomit, the students of water   
stamped each fish with its death date.   
don't let a chance like this go by,   
they thought, though it went by   
as everything went by--towers   
of water flecked by a confetti   
of topsoil, clucked tongues, smug   
prayers. what we paid too much for   
and too little attention to, 
our very lives, all jumbled 
now and far too big in aggregate   
to understand or mourn, goes by, 
and all our eloquence places its 
weight on the spare word goodbye.


the only parts of the body the same   
size at birth as they'll always be.   
that's why all babies are beautiful,   
thurber used to say as he grew   
blind--not dark, he'd go on   
to explain, but floating in a pale   
light always, a kind of candlelit   
murk from a sourceless light.   
he needed dark to see 
for a while he drew on black   
paper with white pastel chalk   
but it grew worse. light bored   
into his eyes but where did it go?   
into a sea of phosphenes, 
along the wet fuse of some dead   
nerve, it hid everywhere and couldn't   
be found. i've used up 
three guesses, all of them 
right. it's like scuba diving, going down   
into the black cone-tip that dives   
farther than i can, though i dive   
closer all the time.


eat all you want  but don't swallow it.  --archie moore 
the ruth of soups and balm of sauces 
i renounce equally. what rorschach saw 
in ink i find in the buttery frizzle 
in the saut pan, and i leave it behind,   
and the sweet peat-smoke tang of bananas,   
and cream in clots, and chocolate. i give 
away the satisfactions of food and take 
desire for food i'll be travelling light 

to the heaven of revisions. why be   
adipose an expense, etc., 
in a waste, etc.? something like 
the body of the poet's work, with its 
pale shadows, begins to pare and replace 
the poet's body, and isn't it time?   



hope is the thing with feathers - 
that perches in the soul - 
and sings the tune without the words - 
and never stops - at all - 

and sweetest - in the gale - is heard - 
and sore must be the storm - 
that could abash the little bird 
that kept so many warm - 

i've heard it in the chillest land - 
and on the strangest sea - 
yet - never - in extremity, 
it asked a crumb - of me.


babies do not want to hear about babies they like to be told of giants and castles.  dr. johnson  no one keeps a secret so well as a child  victor hugo
my mother stands at the screen door, laughing.   
out out damn spot, she commands our silly dog.   
i wonder what this means. i rise into adult air 

like a hollyhock, i'm so proud to be loved   
like this. the air is tight to my nervous body. 
i use new clothes and shoes the way the corn-studded   

soil around here uses nitrogen, giddily. 
ohio, ohio, ohio. often i sing 
to myself all day like a fieldful of august   

insects, just things i whisper, really, 
a trance in sneakers. i'm learning 
to read from my mother and soon i'll go to school, 

i hate it when anyone dies or leaves and the air                   
goes slack around my body and i have to hug myself, 
a cloud, an imaginary friend, the stream in the road- 

side park. i love to be called for dinner.   
spot goes out and i go in and the lights 
in the kitchen go on and the dark, 

which also has a body like a cloud's, 
leans lightly against the house. tomorrow 
i'll find the sweatstains it left, little grey smudges.

       here's a sky no higher than a streetlamp, 
and a stack of morning papers cinched by wire.   
it's  a.m. a stout dog, vaguely beagle,   

minces over the dry, fresh-fallen snow 
and here's our sleep-sodden paperboy   
with his pliers, his bike, his matronly dog,   

his unclouding face set for paper route 
like an alarm clock. here's a memory 
in the making, for this could be the morning   

he doesn't come home and his parents   
two hours later drive his route until 
they find him asleep, propped against a streetlamp, 

his papers all delivered and his dirty paper- 
satchel slack, like an emptied lung, 
and he blur-faced and iconic in the morning 

air rinsing itself a paler and paler blue 
through which a last few dandruff-flecks   
of snow meander casually down.   

the dog squeaks in out of the dark, 
snuffling me too me too. and here he goes   
home to memory, and to hot chocolate 

on which no crinkled skin forms like infant ice, 
and to the long and ordinary day, 
school, two triumphs and one severe 

humiliation on the playground, the past 
already growing its scabs, the busride home, 
dinner, and evening leading to sleep 

like the slide that will spill him out, come june,   
into the eye-reddening chlorine waters   
of the municipal pool. here he goes to bed. 

kiss. kiss. teeth. prayers. dark. dark.   
here the dog lies down by his bed,   
and sighs and farts. will he always be 

this skinny, chicken-bones?   
he'll remember like a prayer 
how his mother made breakfast for him 

every morning before he trudged out   
to snip the papers free. just as   
his mother will remember she felt 

guilty never to wake up with him   
to give him breakfast. it was cream 
of wheat they always or never had together. 


it turns out you are the story of your childhood   
and you're under constant revision,   
like a lonely folktale whose invisible folks 

are all the selves you've been, lifelong,   
shadows in fog, grey glimmers at dusk.   
and each of these selves had a childhood 

it traded for love and grudged to give away,   
now lost irretrievably, in storage   
like a set of dishes from which no food, 

no cream of wheat, no rabbit in mustard   
sauce, nor even a single raspberry,   
can be eaten until the afterlife, 

which is only childhood in its last   
disguise, all radiance or all humiliation,   
and so it is forfeit a final time. 

in fact it was awful, you think, or why   
should the piecework of grief be endless?   
only because death is, and likewise loss, 

which is not awful, but only breathtaking.   
there's no truth about your childhood,   
though there's a story, yours to tend, 

like a fire or garden. make it a good one,   
since you'll have to live it out, and all 
its revisions, so long as you all shall live, 

for they shall be gathered to your deathbed,   
and they'll have known to what you and they 
would come, and this one time they'll weep for you. 


the map in the shopping center has an x 
signed you are here. a dream is like that.   
in a dream you are never eighty, though   

you may risk death by other means 
you're on a ledge and memory calls you   
to jump, but a deft cop talks you in 

to a small, bright room, and snickers. 
and in a dream, you're everyone somewhat,   
but not wholly. i think i know how that 

works for twenty-one years i had a father   
and then i became a father, replacing him   
but not really. soon my sons will be fathers. 

surely, that's what middle-aged means,   
being father and son to sons and father.   
that a male has only one mother is another 

story, told wherever men weep wholly.   
though nobody's replaced. in one dream   
i'm leading a rope of children to safety, 

through a snowy farm. the farmer comes out   
and i have to throw snowballs well to him   
so we may pass. even dreaming, i know 

he's my father, at ease in his catcher's   
squat, and that the dream has revived   
to us both an old unspoken fantasy 

we're a battery. i'm young, i'm brash,   
i don't know how to pitch but i can   
throw a lamb chop past a wolf. and he 

can handle pitchers and control a game.   
i look to him for a sign. i'd nod 
for anything. the damn thing is hard to grip 

without seams, and i don't rely only 
on my live, young arm, but throw by all   
the body i can get behind it, and it fluffs 

toward him no faster than the snow   
in the dream drifts down. nothing 
takes forever, but i know what the phrase 

means. the children grow more cold   
and hungry and cruel to each other 
the longer the ball's in the air, and it begins 

to melt. by the time it gets to him we'll be   
our waking ages, and each of us is himself   
alone, and we all join hands and go. 

.       .       . 

       toward dawn, rain explodes on the tin roof   
like popcorn. the pale light is streaked by grey 
and that green you see just under the surface 

of water, a shimmer more than a color.   
time to dive back into sleep, as if into   
happiness, that neglected discipline .... 

in those sixth-grade book reports 
you had to say if the book was optimistic   
or not, and everyone looked at you 

the same way how would he turn out?   
he rolls in his sleep like an otter.   
uncle ed has a neck so fat it's funny, 

and on the way to work he pries the cap 
off a pepsi. damn rain didn't cool one weary   
thing for long it's gonna be a cooker. 

the boy sleeps with a thin chain of sweat   
on his upper lip, as if waking itself,   
becoming explicit, were hard work. 

who knows if he's happy or not?   
a child is all the tools a child has,   
growing up, who makes what he can.


whose woods these are i think i know.   
his house is in the village though   
he will not see me stopping here   
to watch his woods fill up with snow.   

my little horse must think it queer   
to stop without a farmhouse near   
between the woods and frozen lake   
the darkest evening of the year.   

he gives his harness bells a shake   
to ask if there is some mistake.   
the only other sound's the sweep   
of easy wind and downy flake.   

the woods are lovely, dark and deep,   
but i have promises to keep,   
and miles to go before i sleep,   
and miles to go before i sleep.


here come real stars to fill the upper skies, 
and here on earth come emulating flies, 
that though they never equal stars in size, 
and they were never really stars at heart 
achieve at times a very star-like start. 
only, of course, they can't sustain the part.


there's a crack in this glass so fine we can't see it,   
and in the blue eye of the candleflame's needle   
there's a dark fleck, a speck of imperfection 

that could contain, like a microchip, an epic 
treatise on beauty, except it's in the eye of the beheld.   
and at the base of our glass there's nothing 

so big as a tiny puddle, but an ooze, a viscous   
patina like liquefied tarnish. it's like a text 
so short it consists only of the author's signature, 

which has to stand, like the future, for what might   
have been a novel, let's say, thick with ambiguous life.   
its hero forgets his goal as he nears it, so that it's 

like rain evaporating in the very sight of parched   
saharans on the desert floor. there, by chance, he meets   
a thirsty and beautiful woman. what a small world 



the ones his age who shook my hand   
on their way out sent fear along   
my arm like heroin. these weren't   
men mute about their feelings, 
or what's a body language for? 

and i, the glib one, who'd stood 
with my back to my father's body 
and praised the heart that attacked him?   
i'd made my stab at elegy, 
the flesh made word the very spit 

in my mouth was sour with ruth 
and eloquence. what could be worse?   
silence, the anthem of my father's   
new country. and thus this babble,   
like a dial tone, from our bodies. 



amidst the too much that we buy and throw   
away and the far too much we wrap it in,   
the bear found a few items of special 
interest--a honeydew rind, a used tampon,   
the bone from a leg of lamb. he'd rock back   
lightly onto his rear paws and slash 
open a plastic bag, and then his nose-- 
jammed almost with a surfeit of rank 
and likely information, for he would pause-- 
and then his whole dowsing snout would   
insinuate itself a little way 
inside. by now he'd have hunched his weight   
forward slightly, and then he'd snatch it back,   
trailed by some tidbit in his teeth. he'd look   
around. what a good boy am he. 
the guardian of the dump was used 
to this and not amused. he'll drag that shit   
every which damn way, he grumbled 
who'd dozed and scraped a pit to keep that shit   
where the town paid to contain it. 
the others of us looked and looked. city   
folks like you don't get to see this often,   
one year-round resident accused me. 
some winter i'll bring him down to learn   
to love a rat working a length of subway   
track. nope, i replied. just then the bear   
decamped for the woods with a marl of grease   
and slather in his mouth and on his snout,   
picking up speed, not cute nor had he been   
cute before, slavering with greed, his weight   
all sunk to his seated rump and his nose stuck   
up to sift the rich and fetid air, shaped   
like a huge, furry pear, but richly 
fed on the slow-simmering dump, and gone   
into the bug-thick woods and anecdote. 



rather than hold his hands properly   
arched off the keys, like cats 
with their backs up, 
monk, playing block chords, 
hit the keys with his fingertips well   
above his wrists, 

shoulders up, wrists down, scarce   
room for the pencil, ground   
freshly to a point, 
piano teachers love to poke 
into the palms of junior 
pianists with lazy hands. 

what easy villains these robotic   
dullards are in their floral- 
print teaching dresses 
can those mauve blurs be 
peonies?. the teachers' plucky,   
make-do wardrobes suggest, like the wan 

bloom of dust the couch exhaled   
when i scrunched down to wait   
for mrs. oxley, just how we value   
them. she'd launch my predecessor   
home and drink some lemonade,   
then free me from the couch. 

the wisdom in rocky mount, 
north carolina, where monk grew up,   
is that those names, thelonious   
sphere, came later, but nobody's   
sure he made his escape 
by turning himself into a genius 

in broad daylight while nobody   
watched. just a weird little black   
kid one day and next thing anybody   
knew he was inexplicable 
and gone. we don't give lessons   
in that. in fact it's to stave off 

such desertions that we pay 
for lessons. it works for a while.   
think of all the time we spend   
thinking about our kids. 
it's mrs. oxley, the frump 
with a metronome, and mr. mote, 

the bad teacher and secret weeper,   
we might think on, and everyone   
we pay to tend our young, opaque   
and truculent and terrified,   
not yet ready to replace us,   
or escape us, if that be the work. 




when john henry was a little tiny baby 
sitting on his mama's knee, 
he picked up a hammer and a little piece of steel 
saying, hammer's going to be the death of me, lord, lord, 
    hammer's going to be the death of me. 

john henry was a man just six feet high, 
nearly two feet and a half across his breast. 
he'd hammer with a nine-pound hammer all day 
and never get tired and want to rest, lord, lord, 
    and never get tired and want to rest. 

john henry went up on the mountain 
and he looked one eye straight up its side. 
the mountain was so tall and john henry was so small, 
he laid down his hammer and he cried, lord, lord, 
    he laid down his hammer and he cried. 

john henry said to his captain, 
captain, you go to town, 
bring me back a twelve-pound hammer, please, 
and i'll beat that steam drill down, lord, lord, 
    i'll beat that steam drill down. 

the captain said to john henry, 
i believe this mountain's sinking in. 
but john henry said, captain, just you stand aside-- 
it's nothing but my hammer catching wind, lord, lord, 
    it's nothing but my hammer catching wind. 

john henry said to his shaker, 
shaker, boy, you better start to pray, 
'cause if my twelve-pound hammer miss that little piece of steel, 
tomorrow'll be your burying day, lord, lord, 
    tomorrow'll be your burying day. 

john henry said to his captain, 
a man is nothing but a man, 
but before i let your steam drill beat me down, 
i'd die with a hammer in my hand, lord, lord, 
    i'd die with a hammer in my hand. 

the man that invented the steam drill, 
he figured he was mighty high and fine, 
but john henry sunk the steel down fourteen feet 
while the steam drill only made nine, lord, lord, 
    the steam drill only made nine. 

john henry hammered on the right-hand side. 
steam drill kept driving on the left. 
john henry beat that steam drill down. 
but he hammered his poor heart to death, lord, lord, 
    he hammered his poor heart to death. 

well, they carried john henry down the tunnel 
and they laid his body in the sand. 
now every woman riding on a c and o train 
says, there lies my steel-driving man, lord, lord, 
    there lies my steel-driving man.


a peanut sat on a railroad track, 
his heart was all a-flutter. 
the five-fifteen came rushing by--

we who must act as handmaidens   
to our own goddess, turn too fast, 
trip on our hems, to glimpse the muse   
gliding below her lake or sea,   
are left, long-staring after her,   
narcissists by necessity 

or water-carriers of our young 
till waters burst, and white streams flow   
artesian, from the lifted breast   
cupbearers then, to tiny gods,   
imperious table-pounders, who   
are final arbiters of thirst. 

fasten the blouse, and mount the steps   
from kitchen taps to royal barge,   
assume the trident, don the crown,   
command the water music now   
that men bestow on virgin queens   
or goddessing above the waist, 

appear as swan on thames or charles   
where iridescent foam conceals   
the paddle-stroke beneath the glide   
immortal feathers preened in poems   
not our true, intimate nature, stained   
by labor, and the casual tide. 

masters of civilization, you 
who moved to riverbank from cave, 
putting up tents, and deities, 
though every rivulet wander through   
the final, unpolluted glades 
to cinder-bank and culvert-lip, 

and all the pretty chatterers 
still round the pebbles as they pass 
lightly over their watercourse, 
and even the calm rivers flow, 
we have, while springs and skies renew,   
dry wells, dead seas, and lingering drouth. 

water itself is not enough. 
harness her turbulence to work   
for man fill his reflecting pools.   
drained for his cofferdams, or stored   
in reservoirs for his personal use   
turn switches let the fountains play 

and yet these buccaneers still kneel   
trembling at the water's verge   
cool river-goddess, sweet ravine,   
spirit of pool and shade, inspire   
so he needs poultice for his flesh.   
so he needs water for his fire. 

we rose in mists and died in clouds   
or sank below the trammeled soil   
to silent conduits underground,   
joining the blindfish, and the mole.   
a gleam of silver in the shale   
lost murmur subterranean moan 

so flows in dark caves, dries away, 
what would have brimmed from bank to bank,   
kissing the fields you turned to stone, 
under the boughs your axes broke. 
and you blame streams for thinning out,   
plundered by man's insatiate want? 

rejoice when a faint music rises   
out of a brackish clump of weeds,   
out of the marsh at ocean-side,   
out of the oil-stained river's gleam,   
by the long causeways and gray piers   
your civilizing lusts have made. 

discover the deserted beach 
where ghosts of curlews safely wade   
here the warm shallows lave your feet   
like tawny hair of magdalens. 
here, if you care, and lie full-length,   
is water deep enough to drown.


a bridge engineer, mr. crumpett, 
built a bridge for the good river bumpett. 
    a mistake in the plan 
    left a gap in the span, 
but he said, well, they'll just have to jump it.


sing a song of sixpence, 
a pocket full of rye, 
four and twenty blackbirds 
baked in a pie. 

when the pie was opened 
the birds began to sing-- 
wasn't that a dainty dish 
to set before the king? 

the king was in the counting-house 
counting out his money, 
the queen was in the parlor 
eating bread and honey, 

the maid was in the garden 
hanging out the clothes. 
along came a blackbird 
and snipped off her nose.


now i lay me down to rest, 
i pray i pass tomorrow's test. 
if i should die before i wake, 
that's one less test i'll have to take.


i love to do my homework, 
it makes me feel so good. 
i love to do exactly 
as my teacher says i should. 

i love to do my homework, 
i never miss a day. 
i even love the men in white 
who are taking me away.


how much wood could a woodchuck chuck 
if a woodchuck could chuck wood? 
as much wood as a woodchuck could chuck, 
if a woodchuck could chuck wood.


it's raining, it's pouring, 
    the old man's snoring. 
he got into bed 
    and bumped his head 
and couldn't get up in the morning.


quick   quick 
    the cat's been sick. 

where?   where? 
    under the chair. 

hasten   hasten 
    fetch the basin. 

alack   alack 
    it is too late, 
the carpet's in 
    an awful state. 

no   no 
    it's all in vain, 
for she has licked it 
    up again.


i've got a rocket 
in my pocket 
i cannot stop to play. 
away it goes 
i've burned my toes. 
it's independence day.


i eat my peas with honey 
i've done it all my life. 
it makes the peas taste funny, 
but it keeps them on the knife.


don't worry if your job is small, 
and your rewards are few. 
remember that the mighty oak, 
was once a nut like you.


there was a young lady of lynn, 
who was so uncommonly thin 
    that when she essayed 
    to drink lemonade 
she slipped through the straw and fell in.


poor old lady, she swallowed a fly. 
i don't know why she swallowed a fly. 
poor old lady, i think she'll die. 

poor old lady, she swallowed a spider. 
it squirmed and wriggled and turned inside her. 
she swallowed the spider to catch the fly. 
i don't know why she swallowed a fly. 
poor old lady, i think she'll die. 

poor old lady, she swallowed a bird. 
how absurd   she swallowed a bird. 
she swallowed the bird to catch the spider, 
she swallowed the spider to catch the fly, 
i don't know why she swallowed a fly. 
poor old lady, i think she'll die. 

poor old lady, she swallowed a cat. 
thank of that   she swallowed a cat. 
she swallowed the cat to catch the bird. 
she swallowed the bird to catch the spider. 
she swallowed the spider to catch the fly, 
i don't know why she swallowed a fly. 
poor old lady, i think she'll die. 

poor old lady, she swallowed a dog. 
she went the whole hog when she swallowed the dog. 
she swallowed the dog to catch the cat, 
she swallowed the cat to catch the bird, 
she swallowed the bird to catch the spider. 
she swallowed the spider to catch the fly, 
i don't know why she swallowed a fly. 
poor old lady, i think she'll die. 

poor old lady, she swallowed a cow. 
i don't know how she swallowed a cow. 
she swallowed the cow to catch the dog, 
she swallowed the dog to catch the cat, 
she swallowed the cat to catch the bird, 
she swallowed the bird to catch the spider, 
she swallowed the spider to catch the fly, 
i don't know why she swallowed a fly. 
poor old lady, i think she'll die. 

poor old lady, she swallowed a horse. 
she died, of course.


we have a secret, just we three, 
the robin, and i, and the sweet cherry-tree 
the bird told the tree, and the tree told me, 
and nobody knows it but just us three. 

but of course the robin knows it best, 
because she built the--i shan't tell the rest 
and laid the four little--something in it--
i'm afraid i shall tell it every minute. 

but if the tree and the robin don't peep, 
i'll try my best the secret to keep 
though i know when the little birds fly about 
then the whole secret will be out.


i know a funny little man, 
    as quiet as a mouse, 
who does the mischief that is done 
    in everybody's house 
there's no one ever sees his face, 
    and yet we all agree 
that every plate we break was cracked 
    by mr. nobody. 

'tis he who always tears out books, 
    who leaves the door ajar, 
he pulls the buttons from our shirts, 
    and scatters pins afar 
that squeaking door will always squeak, 
    for prithee, don't you see, 
we leave the oiling to be done 
    by mr. nobody. 

the finger marks upon the door 
    by none of us are made 
we never leave the blinds unclosed, 
    to let the curtains fade. 
the ink we never spill   the boots 
    that lying round you see 
are not our boots,--they all belong 
    to mr. nobody.


little robin redbreast 
    sat upon a tree 
up went pussy-cat, 
    down went he. 

down came pussy-cat, 
    and away robin ran 
says little robin redbreast 
    catch me if you can. 

little robin redbreast 
    hopped upon a wall 
pussy-cat jumped after him, 
    and almost got a fall. 

little robin chirped and sang, 
    and what did pussy say? 
pussy-cat said mew, 
    and robin flew away.


'twas brillig, and the slithy toves 
      did gyre and gimble in the wabe 
all mimsy were the borogoves, 
      and the mome raths outgrabe.

beware the jubjub bird, and shun

he took his vorpal sword in hand 
      long time the manxome foe he sought-- 
so rested he by the tumtum tree 
      and stood awhile in thought. 

and, as in uffish thought he stood, 
      the jabberwock, with eyes of flame, 
came whiffling through the tulgey wood, 
      and burbled as it came 

one, two one, two and through and through 
      the vorpal blade went snicker-snack 
he left it dead, and with its head 
      he went galumphing back. 

and hast thou slain the jabberwock? 
      come to my arms, my beamish boy 
o frabjous day callooh callay 
      he chortled in his joy.

the best game the fairies play, 
    the best game of all, 
is sliding down steeples-- 
    you know they're very tall. 
you fly to the weathercock, 
    and when you hear it crow, 
you fold your wings and clutch your things 
    and then let go 
they have a million other games-- 
    cloud-catching's one, 
and mud-mixing after rain 
    is heaps and heaps of fun 
but when you go and stay with them 
    never mind the rest, 
take my advice--they're very nice, 
    but steeple-sliding's best


going to sleep, i cross my hands on my chest.   
they will place my hands like this.   
it will look as though i am flying into myself.


to jk
those scars rooted me. stigmata stalagmite 
i sat at a drive-in and watched the stars 
through a straw while the coke in my lap went 
waterier and waterier. for days on end or 

nights no end i crawled on all fours or in 
my case no fours to worship you amoeba behemoth. 
--then you explained your dna calls for 
meaner genes than mine and since you are merely 

so to speak its external expression etcet 
ergo among your lovers i'll never be ... 
ah that movie was so faraway the stars melting 

made my thighs icy. i see it's not you 
who is not requiting me, it's something in you 
over which you have no say says no to me.


...after my mother's death
here not long enough after the hospital happened   
i find her closet lying empty and stop my play   
and go in and crane up at three blackwire hangers   
which quiver, airy, released. they appear to enjoy 

their new distance, cognizance born of the absence   
of anything else. the closet has been cleaned out   
full-flush as surgeries where the hangers could be   
amiable scalpels though they just as well would be 

themselves, in basements, glovelessly scraping uteri   
but, here, pure, transfigured heavenward, they're 
birds, whose wingspans expand by excluding me. their   
range is enlarged by loss. they'd leave buzzards 

measly as moths and the hatshelf is even higher-- 
as the sky over a prairie, an undotted desert where   
nothing can swoop sudden, crumple in secret. i've fled   
at ambush, tag, age six, must i face this, can 

i have my hide-and-seek hole back now please, the   
clothes, the thicket of shoes, where is it? only   
the hangers are at home here. come heir to this   
rare element, fluent, their skeletal grace sings 

of the ease with which they let go the dress, slip,   
housecoat or blouse, so absolvingly. free, they fly 
trim, triangular, augurs leapt ahead from some geometric   
god who soars stripped of flesh, it is said catnip 

to a brat placated by model airplane kits kids 
my size lack motorskills for, i wind up glue-scabbed,   
pawing goo-goo fingernails, glaze skins fun to peer in as 
frost-i-glass doors ... but the closet has no windows, 

opaque or sheer i must shut my eyes, shrink within   
to peep into this wall. soliciting sleep i'll dream   
mother spilled and cold, unpillowed, the operating- 
table cracked to goad delivery its stirrups slack, 

its forceps closed by it i'll see mobs of obstetrical   
personnel kneel proud, congratulatory, cooing 
and oohing and hold the dead infant up to the dead   
woman's face as if for approval, the prompted 

beholding, tears, a zoomshot kiss. white-masked   
doctors and nurses patting each other on the back,   
which is how in the old west a hangman, if 
he was good, could gauge the heft of his intended ... 

awake, the hangers are sharper, knife-'n'-slice, i jump   
helplessly to catch them to twist them clear,   
mis-shape them whole, sail them across the small air   
space of the closet. i shall find room enough here 

by excluding myself by excluding myself, i'll grow.


is thought to be a confession, won by endless 
torture, but which our interrogators must 
hate to record--all those old code names, dates, 
the standard narrative of sandpaper 
throats, even its remorse, fall ignored. far 

away, a late not lost messenger stares, 
struck by window bargains or is it the gift 
of a sudden solicitude is she going to 
lift up her shadow's weight, shift hers 
onto it? she knows who bears whom. in 

that momentary museum where memory occurs 
more accrue of those torturers' pincers than 
lessened fingernails, eyes teased to a pulp, 
we beg for closeups. ormolus, objets d'art  
a satyr drains an hourglass with one gulp.


homage jacob van hoddis
the cia and the kgb exchange christmas cards 
a blade snaps in two during an autopsy 
the bouquet bluebeard gave his first date reblooms 
many protest the public stoning of a guitar pick 

railroad trains drop off the bourgeois' pointy head 
a martyr sticks a coffeecup out under a firehose 
moviestars make hyenas lick their spaceship 
god's hand descends into a glove held steady by the police 

at their reunion the new faces recognize each other 
a spoiled child sleeps inside a thermometer 
a single misprint in a survival manual kills everyone 
the peace night makes according to the world comes


you could say, i suppose, that he ate his way out,   
like the prisoner who starts a tunnel with a spoon, 
or you could say he was one in whom nothing was lost,   
who took it all in, or that he was big as a bus. 

he would say, and he did, in one of those blurred   
melismatic slaloms his sentences ran--for all 
the music was in his speech swift switches of tempo,   
stop-time, double time he could talk in , 

i just ruined my body. and there, exhibit a,   
it stood, that parthenon of fat, the tenant voice   
lifted, as we say, since words are a weight, and music.   
silence is lighter than air, for the air we know 

rises but to the edge of the atmosphere. 
you have to pick up the bass, as mingus called 
his, with audible capitals, and think of the slow years   
the wood spent as a tree, which might well have been 

enough for wood, and think of the skill the bassmaker   
carried without great thought of it from home   
to the shop and back for decades, and know 
what bassists before you have played, and know 

how much of this is stored in the bass like energy   
in a spring and know how much you must coax out.   
how easy it would be, instead, to pull a sword   
from a stone. but what's inside the bass wants out, 

the way one day you will. religious stories are rich   
in symmetry. you must release as much of this hoard   
as you can, little by little, in perfect time, 
as the work of the body becomes a body of work. 



haze. three student violists boarding   
a bus. a clatter of jackhammers. 
granular light. a film of sweat for primer   
and the heat for a coat of paint. 
a man and a woman on a bench   
she tells him he must be psychic, 
for how else could he sense, even before she knew,   
that she'd need to call it off? a bicyclist   
fumes by with a coach's whistle clamped   
hard between his teeth, shrilling like a teakettle   
on the boil. i never meant, she says.   
but i thought, he replies. two cabs almost   
collide someone yells fuck in farsi.   
i'm sorry, she says. the comforts   
of loneliness fall in like a bad platoon.   
the sky blurs--there's a storm coming   
up or down. a lank cat slinks liquidly   
around a corner. how familiar 
it feels to feel strange, hollower 
than a bassoon. a rill of chill air 
in the leaves. a car alarm. hail. 



the children are hiding among the raspberry canes.   
they look big to one another, the garden small.   
already in their mouths this soft fruit   
that lasts so briefly in the supermarket   
tastes like the past. the gritty wall,   
behind the veil of leaves, is hollow. 
there are yellow wasps inside it. the children know.   
they know the wall is hard, although it hums. 
they know a lot and will not forget it soon. 

when did we forget? but we were never   
children, never found where they were hiding 
and hid with them, never followed   
the wasp down into its nest 
with a fingertip that still tingles. 
we lie in bed at night, thinking about 
the future, always the future, always forgetting 
that it will be the past, hard and hollow,   
veiled and humming, soon enough. 



one girl a full head taller 
than the other--into their sunday dresses.   
first, the slip, hardly a piece of fabric,   
softly stitched and printed with a bud. 
i'm not their mother, and tangle, then untangle   
the whole cloth--on backwards, have to grab it   
round their necks. but they know how to pull   
arms in, a reflex of being dressed, 
and also, a child's faith. the mass of stuff   
that makes the sunday frocks collapses 
in my hands and finds its shape, only because   
they understand the drape of it-- 
these skinny keys to intricate locks.   
the buttons are a problem 
for a surgeon. how would she connect   
these bony valves and stubborn eyelets? 
the filmy dress revolves in my blind fingers.   
the slots work one by one. 
and when they're put together, 
not like puppets or those doll-saints   
that bring tears to true believers, 
but living children, somebody's real daughters,   
they do become more real. 
they say, stop it and give it back   
and i don't want to they'll kiss 
a doll's hard features, whispering, 
i'm sorry. i know just why my mother   
used to worry. your clothes don't keep   
you close--it's nakedness. 
clad in my boots and holster, 
i would roam with my six-gun buddies. 
we dealt fake death to one another, 
fell and rolled in filth and rose, 
grimy with wounds, then headed home. 
but sunday ... what was that tired explanation   
given for wearing clothes that 
scratched and shone and weighed like a slow hour?   
that we should shine--in gratitude. 
so, i give that explanation, undressing them,   
and wait for the result. 
after a day like sunday, such a long one, 
when they lie down, half-dead, 
to be undone, they won't help me. 
they cry, it's not my fault. 




night's afterbirth, last dream before waking,   
holding on with dissolving hands, 
out of it came, not a line of old men, 
but pairs of headlights, delaying morning. 

it felt like tears, like wetted bedsheets,   
and suspended in it like a medicine 
in vapor was the ocean's presence, ghost   
of deep water and the bite of salt. 

here you found your body again, 
the hand before your face and the face it touched,   
eyes floating, feet on invisible ground, 
vagueness like another skin. 

sent out into it anyway, because it was morning,   
to taste it, touch blind hardness 
like marble ruins, and skirt the edges, 
razors in goosedown, hydrants' fists. 

abruptly out of it waves appeared,   
transmuted from hanging silver ore, crafted   
before the eyes into curving metals 
that broke into soup scum, queen anne's lace. 

out of a great nothing, a theology. 
out of the amorphous, an edgeless body   
or one like a hunting mass of tendrils 
that hurried down the sand, moved by hunger. 

i remember a gang of friends 
racing a fog bank's onslaught along the beach.   
seal-slick, warm from the sun 
this thing would eat, they ran laughing. 

the fog came on. and they were beautiful, 
the three boys and one girl, still in her wetsuit,   
and the dissolution overtaking them, 
their stridency, full of faith, still audible. 

all morning bathed in a dovelike brooding.   
the fog satisfied itself by overwhelming 
the meagre dew, watering the doors   
f snails, the leeward mold, and held still. 

and then near noon there was a concentration 
as if the sky tried to find a slippery word   
or remember--that's right--remember 
where it was in an unfamiliar bedroom. 

and knew. and switched the light on. wide awake. 



amazing to believe that nothingness   
surrounds us with delight and lets us be,   
and that the meekness of nonentity,   
despite the friction of the world of sense,   
despite the leveling of violence, 
is all that matters. all the energy 
we force into the matchhead and the city   
explodes inside a loving emptiness. 

not dante's rings, not the zen zero's mouth,   
out of which comes and into which light goes,   
this god recedes from every metaphor,   
turns the hardest data into untruth, 
and fills all blanks with blankness. this love shows   
itself in absence, which the stars adore. 



half asleep in prayer i said the right thing   
and felt a sudden pleasure come into   
the room or my own body. in the dark,   
charged with a change of atmosphere, at first   
i couldn't tell my body from the room.   
and i was wide awake, full of this feeling,   
alert as though i'd heard a doorknob twist,   
a drawer pulled, and instead of terror knew   
the intrusion of an overwhelming joy.   
i had said thanks and this was the response.   
but how i said it or what i said it for   
i still cannot recall and i have tried   
all sorts of ways all hours of the night.   
once was enough to be dissatisfied. 



drunk on the umbrian hills at dusk and drunk   
on one pink cloud that stood beside the moon,   
drunk on the moon, a marble smile, and drunk,   
two young americans, on one another,   
far from home and wanting this forever-- 
who needed god? we had our bodies, bread,   
and glasses of a raw, green, local wine, 
and watched our godless perfect darkness breed   
enormous softly burning ancient stars. 
who needed god? and why do i ask now?   
because i'm older and i think god stirs 
in details that keep bringing back that time,   
details that are just as vivid now-- 
our bodies, bread, a sharp umbrian wine. 




balmy overcast nights of late september 
palms standing out in street light, house light   
full moon penetrating the cloud-film 
with an explosive halo, a ring almost half the sky   
air like a towel draped over shoulders 
lightness or gravity deferred like a moral question   
the incense in the house lit the young people 
moving from the front door into the half-dark 
and back, or up the stairs to glimpse the lovers' shoes   
outside the master bedroom the youngest speculating   
the taste of beer, familiar as salt water 
each window holding a sea view, charcoal 
with shifting bars of white the fog filling in 
like the haze of distance itself, pushing close, blurring. 

as if the passage into life were through such houses,   
surrounded by some version of ocean weather, 
lit beads of fog or wind so stripped it burns the throat   
mildew-spreading, spray-laden breezes and the beach sun   
making each grain of stucco cast a shadow 
an ideal landscape sheared of its nostalgia 
s. with his black hair, buck teeth, unsunned skin,   
joking and disappearing f. doing exactly the same   
but dying, a corkscrew motion through green water   
and c. not looking back from the car door, 
reappearing beside the east river, rich, owned, smiling at last. 

swains. and nymphs. and news that came with the sea damp,   
of steady pipe-corrosions, black corners, 
moisture working through sand lots, through slab floors,   
slowly, with chemical, with molecular intricacy, 
then, bursting alive the shrieked confessions 
of the wild parents the cliff collapse the kidnap 
the cache of photos the letter the weapon the haunted dream 
the sudden close-up of the loved one's degradation. 

weather a part of it all, permeating and sanctifying,   
infiltrating and destroying the sun disc,   
cool behind the veil of afternoon cloud,   
with sun spots like flies crawling across it   
the slow empurpling of skin all summer   
the glorious learned flesh and the rich pallor   
of the untouched places in the first nakedness   
the working of the lesion now in late life,   
soon to be known by the body, even the one   
enduring the bareness of the inland plains,   
the cold fronts out of canada, a sickness   
for home that feels no different from health. 



radiant child of leto, farworking lord apollo, 
with lyre in hand and golden plectrum, you sang to the gods   
on mount olympus almost as soon as you were born. 

you sang, and the muses sang in answer, and together   
your voices so delighted all your deathless elders 
that their perfect happiness was made more perfect still. 

what was it, though, that overwhelmed them, that suffused,   
astonished, even the endless ether? was it the freshest,   
most wonderful stops of breath, the flawless intervals 

and scales whose harmonies were mimicking in sound   
the beauty of the gods themselves, or what you joined   
to that, what you were singing of, our balked desires, 

the miseries we suffer at your indifferent hands,   
devastation and bereavement, old age and death?   
farworking, radiant child, what do you know about us? 

here is my father, half blind, and palsied, at the toilet,   
he's shouting at his penis, piss, you piss piss 
but the penis like the heavenly host to mortal prayers 

is deaf and dumb here, too, my mother with her bad knee,   
on the eve of surgery, hobbling by the bathroom,   
pausing, saying, who are you talking to in there? 

and he replies, no one you would know, sweetheart.   
supernal one, in your untested mastery,   
your easy excellence, with nothing to overcome, 

and needing nothing but the most calamitous   
and abject stories to prove how powerful you are,   
how truly free, watch them as they laugh so briefly, 

godlike, better than gods, if only for a moment 
in which what goes wrong is converted to a rightness,   
if only because now she's hobbling back to bed 

where she won't sleep, if only because he pees at last,   
missing the bowl, and has to get down on his knees   
to wipe it up. you don't know anything about us.


shoes, secret face of my inner life   
two gaping toothless mouths, 
two partly decomposed animal skins   
smelling of mice nests. 

my brother and sister who died at birth   
continuing their existence in you, 
guiding my life 
toward their incomprehensible innocence. 

what use are books to me 
when in you it is possible to read   
the gospel of my life on earth 
and still beyond, of things to come? 

i want to proclaim the religion 
i have devised for your perfect humility   
and the strange church i am building   
with you as the altar. 

ascetic and maternal, you endure 
kin to oxen, to saints, to condemned men,   
with your mute patience, forming 
the only true likeness of myself. 



with only his dim lantern   
to tell him where he is 
and every time a mountain   
of fresh corpses to load up 

take them to the other side 
where there are plenty more 
i'd say by now he must be confused   
as to which side is which 

i'd say it doesn't matter 
no one complains he's got 
their pockets to go through 
in one a crust of bread in another a sausage 

once in a long while a mirror   
or a book which he throws   
overboard into the dark river   
swift and cold and deep


this strange thing must have crept   
right out of hell. 
it resembles a bird's foot 
worn around the cannibal's neck. 

as you hold it in your hand, 
as you stab with it into a piece of meat, 
it is possible to imagine the rest of the bird   
its head which like your fist 
is large, bald, beakless, and blind.


they're waiting to be murdered,   
or evicted. soon 
they expect to have nothing to eat.   
in the meantime, they sit. 

a violent pain is coming, they think. 
it will start in the heart 
and climb into the mouth. 
they'll be carried off in stretchers, howling. 

tonight they watch the window   
without exchanging a word.   
it has rained, and now it looks   
like it's going to snow a little. 

i see him get up to lower the shades.   
if their window stays dark, 
i know his hand has reached hers 
just as she was about to turn on the lights.


how much death works,   
no one knows what a long   
day he puts in. the little   
wife always alone 
ironing death's laundry.   
the beautiful daughters   
setting death's supper table.   
the neighbors playing   
pinochle in the backyard   
or just sitting on the steps   
drinking beer. death,   
meanwhile, in a strange   
part of town looking for   
someone with a bad cough, 
but the address is somehow wrong,   
even death can't figure it out   
among all the locked doors ...    
and the rain beginning to fall.   
long windy night ahead.   
death with not even a newspaper   
to cover his head, not even   
a dime to call the one pining away,   
undressing slowly, sleepily,   
and stretching naked   
on death's side of the bed.


i grew up bent over   
a chessboard. 

i loved the word endgame. 

all my cousins looked worried. 

it was a small house 
near a roman graveyard.   
planes and tanks 
shook its windowpanes. 

a retired professor of astronomy   
taught me how to play. 

that must have been in . 

in the set we were using, 
the paint had almost chipped off   
the black pieces. 

the white king was missing   
and had to be substituted for. 

i'm told but do not believe   
that that summer i witnessed   
men hung from telephone poles. 

i remember my mother   
blindfolding me a lot. 
she had a way of tucking my head   
suddenly under her overcoat. 

in chess, too, the professor told me,   
the masters play blindfolded,   
the great ones on several boards   
at the same time.


great are the hittites. 
their ears have mice and mice have holes. 
their dogs bury themselves and leave the bones 
to guard the house. a single weed holds all their storms   
until the spiderwebs spread over the heavens. 
there are bits of straw in their lakes and rivers   
looking for drowned men. when a camel won't pass   
through the eye of one of their needles, 
they tie a house to its tail. great are the hittites.   
their fathers are in cradles, their newborn make war.   
to them lead floats, a leaf sinks. their god is the size   
of a mustard seed so that he can be quickly eaten. 

they also piss against the wind,   
pour water in a leaky bucket. 
strike two tears to make fire, 
and have tongues with bones in them, 
bones of a wolf gnawed by lambs. 

     

they are also called mound builders,   
they are called asiatic horses 
that will drink on the rhine, they are called 
my grandmother's fortune-telling, they are called   
you can't take it to the grave with you. 

it's that hum in your left ear, 
a sigh coming from deep within you, 
a dream in which you keep falling forever,   
the hour in which you sit up in bed 
as though someone has shouted your name. 

no one knows why the hittites exist,   
still, when two are whispering   
one of them is listening. 

did they catch the falling knife? 
they caught it like a fly with closed mouths.   
did they balance the last egg? 
they struck the egg with a bone so it won't howl.   
did they wait for dead man's shoes? 
the shoes went in at one ear and out the other.   
did they wipe the blood from their mousetraps?   
they burnt the blood to warm themselves.   
are they cold with no pockets in their shrouds?   
if the sky falls, they shall have clouds for supper. 

what do they have for us 
to put in our pipes and smoke? 
they have the braid of a beautiful girl   
that drew a team of cattle 
and the engraving of him who slept   
with dogs and rose with fleas   
searching for its trace in the sky. 

     

and so there are fewer and fewer of them now.   
who wrote their name on paper 
and burnt the paper? who put snake bones   
in their pillows? who threw nail parings   
in their soup? who made them walk 
under the ladder? who stuck pins 
in their snapshots? 

the wart of warts and his brother evil eye.   
bone-lazy and her sister rabbit's-foot.   
cross-your-fingers and their father dog star.   
knock-on-wood and his mother hellfire. 

because the tail can't wag the cow. 
because the woods can't fly to the dove.   
because the stones haven't said their last word.   
because dunghills rise and empires fall. 

     

they are leaving behind 
all the silver spoons 
found inside their throats at birth,   
a hand they bit because it fed them, 

two rats from a ship that is still sinking,   
a collection of various split hairs,   
the leaf they turned over too late. 

     

all that salt cast over the shoulder, 
all that bloody meat traveling under the saddles of nomads ...   

here comes a forest in wolf's clothing,   
the wise hen bows to the umbrella. 

when the bloodshot evening meets the bloodshot night,   
they tell each other bloodshot tales. 

that bare branch over them speaks louder than words.   
the moon is worn threadbare. 

i repeat lean days don't come singly,   
it takes all kinds to make the sun rise. 

the night is each man's castle.   
don't let the castle out of the bag. 

wind in the valley, wind in the high hills,   
practice will make this body fit this bed. 

     

may all roads lead   
out of a sow's ear   
to what's worth   
two in the bush.


it hangs from heaven to earth. 
there are trees in it, cities, rivers,   
small pigs and moons. in one corner 
the snow falling over a charging cavalry,   
in another women are planting rice. 

you can also see 
a chicken carried off by a fox, 
a naked couple on their wedding night, 
a column of smoke, 
an evil-eyed woman spitting into a pail of milk. 

what is behind it? 
--space, plenty of empty space. 

and who is talking now? 
--a man asleep under his hat. 

what happens when he wakes up? 
--he'll go into a barbershop. 
they'll shave his beard, nose, ears, and hair,   
to make him look like everyone else.


on the first page of my dreambook 
it's always evening 
in an occupied country.   
hour before the curfew.   
a small provincial city.   
the houses all dark. 
the storefronts gutted. 

i am on a street corner   
where i shouldn't be.   
alone and coatless 
i have gone out to look 
for a black dog who answers to my whistle.   
i have a kind of halloween mask 
which i am afraid to put on.


a small wheel   
incandescent,   
shivering like 
a pinned butterfly. 

hands thrown up   
in all directions   
the crossroads   
one arrives at 
in a nightmare. 

higher than that 
number  presides 
like a beekeeper 
over the swarming honeycomb   
of the open watch. 

other wheels   
that could fit   
inside a raindrop. 

tools 
that must be splinters   
of arctic starlight. 

tiny golden mills   
grinding invisible   
coffee beans. 

when the coffee's boiling   
cautiously, 
so it doesn't burn us, 
we raise it 
to the lips 
of the nearest 
ear.


they explained to me the bloody bandages 
on the floor in the maternity ward in rochester, n.y.,   
cured the backache i acquired bowing to my old master,   
made me stop putting thumbtacks round my bed. 

they showed me an officer on horseback, 
waving a saber next to a burning farmhouse   
and a barefoot woman in a nightgown, 
throwing stones after him and calling him lucifer. 

i was a straw-headed boy in patched overalls.   
come dark a chicken would roost in my hair.   
some even laid eggs as i played my ukulele   
and my mother and father crossed themselves. 

next, i saw myself inside an abandoned gas station   
constructing a spaceship out of a coffin, 
red traffic cone, cement mixer and ear warmers, 
when a church lady fainted seeing me in my underwear. 

some days, however, they opened door after door,   
always to a different room, and could not find me.   
there'd be only a small squeak now and then,   
as if a miner's canary got caught in a mousetrap.


for larry levis
so it is here, then, after so long, and after all-- 
as the light turns in the leaves in the old golden   
way of fall, 
                   as the small beasts dig to the place 
at the roots where survival waits, cowardly crouching   
in the dark, 
                   as the branches begin to stretch into winter,   
freed of their cheerful burden of green, then 

      it comes home, the flea-ridden bitch of desolation,   
a thin dog with its ribs exposed like a lesson 
in mathematics, in subtraction it comes home, to find its bowl   
empty--then the numberless 
things for which to be grateful dissolve 
like the steam from a fire just doused with water 
on a day of overcast grays, lined 
by a cold slanting rain-- 
                                     it is october, that season when death   
goes public, costumed, when the talking heads 
on the tv screen float up smiling at the terrible 
news, their skin alight with the same strange glow 
fish give off when they have been dead a week or more,   
as the gas company adds odor for warning 
that the lines may be leaking, the sweet smell of disaster   
hanging, invisible, in the air, a moment 
before you strike the match-- 

it is then, brother, that i think of you, of your caravaggio,   
of the head of goliath swung by its hair, 
wearing the artist's own weary expression, 
exhausted of everything but its desire 
for that beautiful david he used to be and i think   
of all the boys walking the streets 
each carrying the severed head of the man 
he will become--and the way i bear it is 
to think of you, grinning, riding high in the cart leaving   
the scene, a pair of huge horses hauling the wagon,   
a fine mist rising from their damp shoulders,   
unconcerned with what hangs, nailed 
to the museum walls--luckily 
the fall of icarus has nothing to do with them,   
nor the ruined goliath who fell like a forest, 
nor the wretched salomes with their blood-splattered   
platters, nor the huge stone griffins sobbing 
at the gates to valhalla as the litters are carried past ... 

the dark eyes of the horses are opaque with wisdom, 
their hoofs strike the pavements with such a musical decision,   
the derisive curl of their lips is so like the mysterious   
smile on the angel at chartres, on kuan yin, on the dolphin,   
as they pull the cart safe through the blizzards   
of main street, the snow slowly swallowing the signs   
though the crossing light beckons-- 
a soft glowing green like some spectral eden   
in the blank white swirl of the storm. 

the stallion neighs once, sends a warm cloud   
of breath into the snow-filled air, 
and the mare isn't scared yet--at least   
she's still pulling. there's a barn out there   
somewhere, as they plow through the light's   
yellow aura of caution, its warm glow 
foretelling what hides in the storm 
a stall full of gold, where the soul-- 
that magician--can wallow 
and winter in straw.


the messenger runs, not carrying the news 
 of victory, or defeat the messenger, unresting, 
   has always been running, the wind before and behind him, 
    across the turning back of earth, leaving 
      his tracks across the plains, his ropes 
       hanging from the ledges of mountains 
         for centuries, millennia, he has been running 
       carrying whatever it is that cannot be 
      put down it is rolled in a tube 
    made of hide, carefully, to keep it dry 
   as he runs, through storms and monsoons, 
sometimes on foot, sometimes poling a boat   
 through a flooded mangrove swamp, or   
   setting stiff sails to cross from island to island 
    running before the wind. in some ages, peasants 
      have helped him--bringing him small cakes 
       of rice wrapped in the weeds of the sea and 
         new sandals woven of hemp for his torn 
       bleeding feet sometimes in the heat of noon 
      they would offer a drink of rosewater, sometimes 
   a coat of fur against the winter snows   
and sometimes at night, he would rest 
 by a fire where voices wove with the music 
   of gut-strings, or with mountain pipes whose 
    sound was like wind through the bones 
      of creation--and he would be cheered 
       by the company of others, the firelit glow 
         of their faces like a bright raft afloat in the dark 
       at times, rumors spread of his death, scholars 
      analyzed his obsession, dated his bones, his prayer bundle 
   but at dawn, he always arose, in the mists, 
in the blur of so many mornings, so many shoes 
 worn into scraps and discarded, so many   
   the cities that burned as he passed 
    them, so many the skulls abandoned 
      by armies, so many whose blood 
       stained the threads of their prayer rugs,   
         so many, so many, so many-- 
      oh, 
    and that green, sunlit hill that kept 
   rising from the dark waters of flood, outlined bright   
 against the sky, the odds, the evidence-- 
and he, the messenger, 
 running through history, carries this small tube, 
   its durable hide--carries it, not like   
    a torch, no, nothing so blazing 
      not like the brass lamp that summons 
       a genie, no magic wishes 
      not like the candles that hope sets aflame 
    and a breath can extinguish ... 

no. 
 he carried it like 
   what has no likeness, 
    what is curled up inside and 
      he swore he could feel it, though 
       perhaps he had dreamed it, still 
         at times, stopping under some tree 
       or other, when the night was warm, 
      so close the stars seemed to breathe in   
   the branches, he would lie quiet,   
 then it would seem 
that whatever it was in there 
 would pulse softly with light, a code   
   only the heart could break 
    but of course he couldn't say 
      for he was only the messenger-- 
    and at sunrise, wearily, he would rise   
      to his feet and trudge on, sometimes   
       running, sometimes stumbling, 
         carrying whatever it was that could not 
          be put down, would not be cast aside-- 
         and besides, he would chide himself,   
       weren't they all as tired as he, 
      and hadn't they helped him, time 
    and again, on his way?


all around the altar, huge lianas 
curled, unfurled the dark green 
of their leaves to complement the red 
of blood spilled there--a kind of christmas   
decoration, overhung with heavy vines 
and over them, the stars. 
when the angels came, messengers like birds   
but with the oiled flesh of men, they hung   
over the scene with smoldering swords,   
splashing the world when they beat 
their rain-soaked wings against the turning sky. 

the child was bright in his basket 
as a lemon, with a bitter smell from his wet   
swaddling clothes. his mother bent   
above him, singing a lullaby 
in the liquid tongue invented 
for the very young--short syllables   
like dripping from an eave 
mixed with the first big drops of rain   
that fell, like tiny silver pears, from 
the glistening fronds of palm. the three   
who gathered there--old kings uncrowned   
the cockroach, condor, and the leopard, lords 
of the cracks below the ground, the mountain   
pass and the grass-grown plain--were not   
adorned, did not bear gifts, had not   
come to adore they were simply drawn   
to gawk at this recurrent, awkward son   
whom the wind had said would spell   
the end of earth as it had been. 

somewhere north of this familiar scene   
the polar caps were melting, the water was   
advancing in its slow, relentless 
lines, swallowing the old 
landmarks, swelling the 
seas that pulled 
the flowers and the great steel cities down.   
the dolphins sport in the rising sea,   
anemones wave their many arms like hair   
on a drowned gorgon's head, her features   
softened by the sea beyond all recognition. 

on the desert's edge where the oasis dies 
in a wash of sand, the sphinx seems to shift 
on her haunches of stone, and the rain, as it runs down,   
completes the ruin of her face. the nile 
merges with the sea, the waters rise 
and drown the noise of earth. at the forest's 
edge, where the child sleeps, the waters gather-- 
as if a hand were reaching for the curtain 
to drop across the glowing, lit tableau. 

when the waves closed over, completing the green   
sweep of ocean, there was no time for mourning.   
no final trump, no thunder to announce 
the silent steal of waters how soundlessly 
it all went under the little family 
and the scene so easily mistaken 
for an adoration. above, more clouds poured in   
and closed their ranks across the skies 
the angels, who had seemed so solid, turned   
quicksilver in the rain. 
                                     now, nothing but the wind   
moves on the rain-pocked face 
of the swollen waters, though far below 
where giant squid lie hidden in shy tangles,   
the whales, heavy-bodied as the angels,   
their fins like vestiges of wings, 
sing some mighty epic of their own-- 

a great day when the ships would all withdraw,   
the harpoons fail of their aim, the land   
dissolve into the waters, and they would swim   
among the peaks of mountains, like eagles   
of the deep, while far below them, the old   
nightmares of earth would settle 
into silt among the broken cities, the empty   
basket of the child would float 
abandoned in the seaweed until the work of water   
unraveled it in filaments of straw, 
till even that straw rotted 
in the planetary thaw the whales prayed for,   
sending their jets of water skyward   
in the clear conviction they'd spill back   
to ocean with their will accomplished   
in the miracle of rain and the earth   
was without form and void, and darkness   
was upon the face of the deep. and 
the spirit moved upon the face of the waters.


for vivian schatz
here, in our familiar streets, the day   
is brisk with winter's business. 
the reassuring rows of brick faades,   
litter baskets overflowing 
with the harvest of the streets 
and, when the light turns, the people   
move in unison, the cars miraculously   
slide to a stop, no one is killed,   
the streets, for some reason, do not   
show the blood that is pouring   
like a tide, on other shores. 

         martinez, the last peasant left alive   
         in his village, refuses to run, hopes   
         that god, el salvador, 
         will let him get the harvest in. 
         can a fish live out of water? he says   
         for why he stays, and weeds 
         another row, ignoring the fins   
         of sharks that push up 
         through the furrows. 

here, it is said, we live 
in the belly of the beast. ahab sits 
forever at the helm, his skin 
white wax, an effigy. the whale carries   
him, lashed to its side by the ropes 
from his own harpoon. his eyes 
are dead. his ivory leg 
juts from the flank of leviathan 
like a useless tooth. 

         one more time, the distant sail appears,   
         a cloud forms, an old icon for mercy   
         turned up in a dusty corner 
         of the sky, preparing rain 
         for the parched land, rachel 
         weeping for her children. can a fish   
         live out of water? he asks 
         and the rain answers, in spanish,   
         manitas de plata 
         little hands of silver on his brow.


nights, by the light of whatever would burn   
tallow, tinder and the silken rope 
of wick that burns slow, slow 
we wove the baskets from the long gold strands   
of wheat that were another silk worm soul 
spun the one, yellow seed in the dark soil, the other. 

the fields lay fallow, swollen with frost,   
expectant winter. mud clung to the edges 
of our gowns we had hung back like shadows 
on the walls of trees and watched. in the little circles   
that our tapers threw, murdered men rose red   
in their clanging armor, muttered 
words that bled through the bars 
of iron masks the lord 
who sold us to the glory fields, lied. 

trumpets without tongues, we wove lilies   
into the baskets. when they asked us 
what we meant by these, we'd say mary, mary   
and be still. we lined the baskets on the sill   
in the barn, where it is always dusk 
and the cows smell sweet. now the snow 

sifts through the trees, dismembered   
lace, the white dust of angels, angels.   
and the ringing of keys that hang 
in bunches at our waists, and the sound of silk   
whispering, whispering. 
there is nothing in the high windows   
but swirling snow, 

the glittering milk of winter. 
the halls grow chill. the candles flicker. 
let them wait who will and think what they want.   
the lord has gone with the hunt, and the snow,   
the snow grows thicker. well he will keep   
till spring thaw comes. head, hand, and heart-- 
baskets of wicker, baskets of straw.


the unicorn is an easy prey its horn 
in the maiden's lap is an obvious 
twist, a tamed figure--like the hawk 
that once roamed free, but sits now, fat and hooded,   
squawking on the hunter's wrist. it's easy   
to catch what no longer captures 
the mind, long since woven in, 
a faded tapestry on a crumbling wall 
made by the women who wore keys 
at their waists and in their sleep came 
hot dreams of wounded knights left bleeding 
in their care, who would wake the next morning   
groaning from the leftover lance in the groin,   
look up into the round blond face beaming down   
at them thinking mine, and say angel.   
such beasts are easy to catch their dreams   
betray them. but the hard prey is the one   
that won't come bidden. 

by these signs you will know it 
when you lift your lure 
out of the water, the long plastic line 
will be missing its end the lure and the hook   
will be gone, and the line will swing free   
in the air, so light it will be without 
bait or its cunning 
sharp curl of silver. or when you pull 
your net from the stream, it will be eaten   
as if by acid, its fine mesh sodden shreds. 

or when you go at dawn to check your traps,   
their great metal jaws will be wrenched 
open, the teeth blunt with rust 
as if they had lain for years in the rain. 
or when the thunderstorm suddenly breaks   
in the summer, next morning 
the computer's memory will be blank. 

look then for the blank card, the sprung trap,   
the net's dissolve, the unburdened   
line that swings free in the air. 
there. by day, go empty-handed to the hunt   
and come home the same way   
in the dark. 



by the stream, where the ground is soft 
and gives, under the slightest pressure--even   
the fly would leave its footprint here   
and the paw of the shrew the crescent   
of its claws like the strokes of a chisel   
in clay where the lightest chill, lighter   
than the least rumor of winter, sets the reeds   
to a kind of speaking, and a single drop of rain   
leaves a crater to catch the first silver   
glint of sun when the clouds slide away   
from each other like two tired lovers,   
and the light returns, pale, though brightened   
by the last chapter of late autumn   
copper, rusted oak, gold aspen, and the red 
pages of maple, the wind leafing through to the end   
the annals of beech, the slim volumes   
of birch, the elegant script of the ferns ... 

for the birds, it is all 
notations for a coda, for the otter   
an invitation to the river, 
and for the deer--a dream 
in which to disappear, light-footed   
on the still open book of earth,   
adding the marks of their passage,   
adding it all in, waiting only 
for the first thick flurry of snowflakes   
for cover, soft cover that carries   
no title, no name.


whose woods these are i think i know ...
the landings had gone wrong white silk,   
like shrouds, covered the woods. 
the trees had trapped the flimsy fabric 
in their web--everywhere the harnessed bodies   
hung--helpless, treading air 
like water. 
                  we thought to float down 
easily--a simple thing 
like coming home feet first, 
a welcome from the waiting fields, 
a gentle fall in clover. 

we hadn't counted on this 
wilderness, the gusts of wind 
that took us over we were surprised   
by the tenacity of branching wood,   
its reach, and how impenetrable 
the place we left, and thought we knew,   
could be. 
               sometimes now, as we sway, unwilling   
pendulums that mark the time,   
we still can dream 
someone will come and cut us down.   
there is nothing here but words, the calls   
we try the dark with--hoping for a human   
ear, response, a rescue party. 
but all we hear is other 
voices like our own, other bodies   
tangled in the lines, 
the repetition of a cry from every tree 

i can't help you, help me.


the cave looked much like any other   
from a little distance but 
as we approached, came almost 
to its mouth, we saw its walls within   
that slanted up into a dome 
were beating like a wild black lung-- 
it was plastered and hung with   
the pulsing bodies of bats, the organ   
music of the body's deep 
interior, alive, the sacred cave 
with its ten thousand gleaming eyes   
near the clustered rocks 
where the sea beat with the leather   
wings of its own dark waves. 

below the bat-hung, throbbing walls,   
an altar stood, glittering with guano,   
a stucco sculpture like a gaudi 
church, berserk 
baroque, stone translated into 
flux--murk and mud and the floral   
extravagance of wet sand dripped   
from a giant hand, giving back 
blessing, excrement--return 
for the first fruits offered to the gods. 

we stayed outside, superior 
with fear, like tourists 
peering through a door, whose hanging   
beads rattle in the air from 
one who disappeared into the dim 
interior we thought of the caves 
of marabar, of a writer who entered   
and never quite emerged-- 
the caves' echoing black 
emptiness a tunnel in the english   
soul where he is wandering still. so   
the bat cave on the bali coast, not far 
from denpasar, holds us off, and beckons ... 

standing there now, at the mouth   
of the cave--this time we enter, feel   
inside the flutter of those 
many hearts, the radiant heat of pumping   
veins, the stretch of wing on bone   
like a benediction, and the familiar   
faces of this many-headed god,   
benevolent as night is 
to the weary--the way at dark   
the cave releases them all, 
how they must lift like the foam   
on a wave breaking, how many   
they are as they enter 
the starlit air, and scatter 
in wild wide arcs 
in search of fruit, the sweet bites   
of mosquito ... 

while the great domes of our   
own kind slide open, the eye   
that watches, tracks the skies, 
and the huge doors roll slowly back   
on the hangars, the planes   
push out their noses of steel,   
their wings a bright alloy 
of aluminum and death, they roar   
down the runways, tear into 
the night, their heavy bodies fueled   
from sucking at the hidden 
veins of earth they leave a trail of fire   
behind them as they scar   
the air, filling the dreams   
of children, sleeping--anywhere,   
chicago, baghdad--with blood, 
as the bombs drop, as the world 
splits open, as the mothers   
reach for their own 
in the night of the falling   
sky, madness in 
method, nature gone   
into reverse ... 

here, nearly unperturbed, 
the bats from the sacred cave   
fill the night with their calls,   
high-pitched, tuned to the solid world   
as eyes to the spectrum of light, gnats   
to the glow of a lamp--the bats   
circle, the clouds wheel, 
the earth turns 
pulling the dome of stars 
among the spinning trees, blurring   
the sweet globes of fruit, shaped   
exactly to desire--dizzy, we swing   
back to the cave on our stiff dark   
wings, the sweet juice of papaya   
drying on our jaws, home 
to the cave, to attach ourselves   
back to the pulsing dome, until, 
hanging there, sated and sleepy, 
we can see what was once our world   
upside down as it is 
and wonder whose altars 
those are, white, 
encrusted with shit. 



to turn a stone 
with its white squirming 
underneath, to pry the disc 
from the sun's eclipse--white heat 
coiling in the blinded eye to these malign   
necessities we come 
from the dim time of dinosaurs 
who crawled like breathing lava 
from the earth's cracked crust, and swung   
their tiny heads above the lumbering tons   
of flesh, brains no bigger than a fist 
clenched to resist the white flash 
in the sky the day the sun-flares 
pared them down to relics for museums,   
turned glaciers back, seared sinai's 
meadows black--the ferns withered, the swamps   
were melted down to molten mud, the cells   
uncoupled, recombined, and madly 
multiplied, huge trees toppled to the ground,   
the slow life there abandoned hope, 
a caterpillar stiffened in the grass. 
two apes, caught in the act of coupling,   
made a mutant child 
who woke to sunlight wondering, his mother   
torn by the huge new head 
that forced the narrow birth canal. 

as if compelled to repetition   
and to unearth again 
white fire at the heart of matter--fire 
we sought and fire we spoke, 
our thoughts, however elegant, were fire 
from first to last--like sentries set to watch   
at argos for the signal fire 
passed peak to peak from troy 
to nagasaki, triumphant echo of the burning   
city walls and prologue to the murders   
yet to come--we scan the sky 
for that bright flash, 
our eyes stared white from watching   
for the signal fire that ends 
the epic--a cursed line 
with its caesura, a pause 
to signal peace, or a rehearsal 
for the silence.


what torture lurks within a single thought   
when grown too constant and however kind,   
however welcome still, the weary mind 
aches with its presence. dull remembrance taught   
remembers on unceasingly unsought   
the old delight is with us but to find   
that all recurring joy is pain refined,   
become a habit, and we struggle, caught.   
you lie upon my heart as on a nest,   
folded in peace, for you can never know   
how crushed i am with having you at rest   
heavy upon my life. i love you so 
you bind my freedom from its rightful quest.   
in mercy lift your drooping wings and go. 




i want no horns to rouse me up to-night,   
and trumpets make too clamorous a ring   
to fit my mood, it is so weary white   
i have no wish for doing any thing. 

a music coaxed from humming strings would please   
not plucked, but drawn in creeping cadences   
across a sunset wall where some marquise 
picks a pale rose amid strange silences. 

ghostly and vaporous her gown sweeps by   
the twilight dusking wall, i hear her feet   
delaying on the gravel, and a sigh, 
briefly permitted, touches the air like sleet 

and it is dark, i hear her feet no more.   
a red moon leers beyond the lily-tank.   
a drunken moon ogling a sycamore,   
running long fingers down its shining flank. 

a lurching moon, as nimble as a clown, 
cuddling the flowers and trees which burn like glass. 
red, kissing lips, i feel you on my gown-- 
kiss me, red lips, and then pass--pass. 

music, you are pitiless to-night. 
and i so old, so cold, so languorously white. 



cold, wet leaves 
floating on moss-coloured water   
and the croaking of frogs-- 
cracked bell-notes in the twilight. 




gushing from the mouths of stone men 
to spread at ease under the sky 
in granite-lipped basins, 
where iris dabble their feet 
and rustle to a passing wind, 
the water fills the garden with its rushing, 
in the midst of the quiet of close-clipped lawns. 

damp smell the ferns in tunnels of stone,   
where trickle and plash the fountains,   
marble fountains, yellowed with much water. 

splashing down moss-tarnished steps   
it falls, the water 
and the air is throbbing with it 
with its gurgling and running 
with its leaping, and deep, cool murmur. 

and i wished for night and you. 
i wanted to see you in the swimming-pool,   
white and shining in the silver-flecked water. 

while the moon rode over the garden,   
high in the arch of night, 
and the scent of the lilacs was heavy with stillness. 

night and the water, and you in your whiteness, bathing 



when i go away from you 
the world beats dead 
like a slackened drum. 
i call out for you against the jutted stars   
and shout into the ridges of the wind.   
streets coming fast, 
one after the other, 
wedge you away from me, 
and the lamps of the city prick my eyes 
so that i can no longer see your face. 
why should i leave you, 
to wound myself upon the sharp edges of the night? 




pale, with the blue of high zeniths, shimmered over with silver, brocaded 
in smooth, running patterns, a soft stuff, with dark knotted fringes, it lies there, 
warm from a woman's soft shoulders, and my fingers close on it, caressing. 
where is she, the woman who wore it? the scent of her lingers and drugs me. 
a languor, fire-shotted, runs through me, and i crush the scarf down on my face, 
and gulp in the warmth and the blueness, and my eyes swim in cool-tinted heavens. 
around me are columns of marble, and a diapered, sun-flickered pavement. 
rose-leaves blow and patter against it. below the stone steps a lute tinkles. 
a jar of green jade throws its shadow half over the floor. a big-bellied 
frog hops through the sunlight, and plops in the gold-bubbled water of a basin, 
sunk in the black and white marble. the west wind has lifted a scarf 
on the seat close beside me the blue of it is a violent outrage of colour. 
she draws it more closely about her, and it ripples beneath her slight stirring. 
her kisses are sharp buds of fire and i burn back against her, a jewel 
hard and white, a stalked, flaming flower till i break to a handful of cinders, 
and open my eyes to the scarf, shining blue in the afternoon sunshine. 

how loud clocks can tick when a room is empty, and one is alone


for csar chvez
field 

the wind sprays pale dirt into my mouth 
the small, almost invisible scars 
on my hands.

the pores in my throat and elbows
have taken in a seed of dirt of their own.

after a day in the grape fields near rolinda 
a fine silt, washed by sweat, 
has settled into the lines 
on my wrists and palms.

already i am becoming the valley, 
a soil that sprouts nothing. 
for any of us.

wind 

a dry wind over the valley
peeled mountains, grain by grain, 
to small slopes, loose dirt
where red ants tunnel.

the wind strokes
the skulls and spines of cattle 
to white dust, to nothing,

covers the spiked tracks of beetles, 
of tumbleweed, of sparrows 
that pecked the ground for insects.

evenings, when i am in the yard weeding, 
the wind picks up the breath of my armpits
like dust, swirls it 
miles away

and drops it
on the ear of a rabid dog, 
and i take on another life.

wind 

when you got up this morning the sun 
blazed an hour in the sky,

a lizard hid
under the curled leaves of manzanita 
and winked its dark lids.

later, the sky grayed,
and the cold wind you breathed
was moving under your skin and already far 
from the small hives of your lungs.

stars 

at dusk the first stars appear.
not one eager finger points toward them. 
a little later the stars spread with the night 
and an orange moon rises
to lead them, like a shepherd, toward dawn.

sun 

in june the sun is a bonnet of light 
coming up,
little by little,
from behind a skyline of pine.

the pastures sway with fiddle-neck, 
tassels of foxtail.

at piedra
a couple fish on the river's edge, 
their shadows deep against the water. 
above, in the stubbled slopes,
cows climb down
as the heat rises
in a mist of blond locusts,
returning to the valley.

rain 

when autumn rains flatten sycamore leaves, 
the tiny volcanos of dirt
ants raised around their holes,
i should be out of work.

my silverware and stack of plates will go unused 
like the old, my two good slacks
will smother under a growth of lint
and smell of the old dust
that rises
when the closet door opens or closes.

the skin of my belly will tighten like a belt 
and there will be no reason for pockets.

harvest 

east of the sun's slant, in the vineyard that never failed, 
a wind crossed my face, moving the dust 
and a portion of my voice a step closer to a new year.

the sky went black in the ninth hour of rolling trays, 
and in the distance ropes of rain dropped to pull me 
from the thick harvest that was not mine.

fog 

if you go to your window
you will notice a fog drifting in.

the sun is no stronger than a flashlight. 
not all the sweaters 
hung in closets all summer

could soak up this mist. the fog
a mouth nibbling everything to its origin, 
pomegranate trees, stolen bicycles,

the string of lights at a used-car lot, 
a pontiac with scorched valves.

in fresno the fog is passing
the young thief prying a window screen, 
graying my hair that falls
and goes unfound, my fingerprints 
slowly growing a fur of dust--

one hundred years from now
there should be no reason to believe 
i lived.

daybreak 

in this moment when the light starts up 
in the east and rubs 
the horizon until it catches fire,

we enter the fields to hoe,
row after row, among the small flags of onion, 
waving off the dragonflies 
that ladder the air.

and tears the onions raise
do not begin in your eyes but in ours, 
in the salt blown
from one blister into another

they begin in knowing
you will never waken to bear
the hour timed to a heart beat,
the wind pressing us closer to the ground.

when the season ends,
and the onions are unplugged from their sleep, 
we won't forget what you failed to see, 
and nothing will heal
under the rain's broken fingers.


i walk down the garden paths, 
and all the daffodils 
are blowing, and the bright blue squills.   
i walk down the patterned garden paths   
in my stiff, brocaded gown. 
with my powdered hair and jewelled fan,   
i too am a rare 
pattern. as i wander down 
the garden paths. 

my dress is richly figured,   
and the train 
makes a pink and silver stain   
on the gravel, and the thrift   
of the borders. 
just a plate of current fashion, 
tripping by in high-heeled, ribboned shoes. 
not a softness anywhere about me,   
only whale-bone and brocade.   
and i sink on a seat in the shade   
of a lime tree. for my passion   
wars against the stiff brocade.   
the daffodils and squills 
flutter in the breeze 
as they please. 
and i weep 
for the lime tree is in blossom 
and one small flower has dropped upon my bosom. 

and the splashing of waterdrops   
in the marble fountain 
comes down the garden paths.   
the dripping never stops.   
underneath my stiffened gown 
is the softness of a woman bathing in a marble basin, 
a basin in the midst of hedges grown 
so thick, she cannot see her lover hiding, 
but she guesses he is near, 
and the sliding of the water 
seems the stroking of a dear 
hand upon her. 
what is summer in a fine brocaded gown 
i should like to see it lying in a heap upon the ground.   
all the pink and silver crumpled up on the ground. 

i would be the pink and silver as i ran along the paths,   
and he would stumble after, 
bewildered by my laughter. 
i should see the sun flashing from his sword-hilt and the buckles on his shoes. 
i would choose 
to lead him in a maze along the patterned paths, 
a bright and laughing maze for my heavy-booted lover,   
till he caught me in the shade, 
and the buttons of his waistcoat bruised my body as he clasped me, 
aching, melting, unafraid. 
with the shadows of the leaves and the sundrops,   
and the plopping of the waterdrops, 
all about us in the open afternoon 
i am very like to swoon 
with the weight of this brocade, 
for the sun sifts through the shade. 

underneath the fallen blossom 
in my bosom, 
is a letter i have hid. 
it was brought to me this morning by a rider from the duke.   
madam, we regret to inform you that lord hartwell   
died in action thursday sen'night. 
as i read it in the white, morning sunlight, 
the letters squirmed like snakes. 
any answer, madam, said my footman. 
no, l told him. 
see that the messenger takes some refreshment. 
no, no answer. 
and i walked into the garden, 
up and down the patterned paths, 
in my stiff, correct brocade. 
the blue and yellow flowers stood up proudly in the sun,   
each one. 
i stood upright too, 
held rigid to the pattern 
by the stiffness of my gown.   
up and down i walked,   
up and down. 

in a month he would have been my husband.   
in a month, here, underneath this lime,   
we would have broke the pattern 
he for me, and i for him, 
he as colonel, i as lady, 
on this shady seat. 
he had a whim 
that sunlight carried blessing. 
and i answered, it shall be as you have said.   
now he is dead. 

in summer and in winter i shall walk 
up and down 
the patterned garden paths   
in my stiff, brocaded gown.   
the squills and daffodils 
will give place to pillared roses, and to asters, and to snow.   
i shall go 
up and down, 
in my gown. 
gorgeously arrayed, 
boned and stayed. 
and the softness of my body will be guarded from embrace   
by each button, hook, and lace. 
for the man who should loose me is dead, 
fighting with the duke in flanders, 
in a pattern called a war. 
christ what are patterns for?


study in whites 
wax-white-- 
floor, ceiling, walls.   
ivory shadows 
over the pavement   
polished to cream surfaces 
by constant sweeping. 
the big room is coloured like the petals 
of a great magnolia,   
and has a patina   
of flower bloom 
which makes it shine dimly 
under the electric lamps. 
chairs are ranged in rows 
like sepia seeds   
waiting fulfilment. 
the chalk-white spot of a cook's cap 
moves unglossily against the vaguely bright wall-- 
dull chalk-white striking the retina like a blow 
thru the wavering uncertainty of steam. 
vitreous-white of glasses with green reflections, 
ice-green carboys, shifting--greener, bluer--with the jar of moving water. 
jagged green-white bowls of pressed glass 
rearing snow-peaks of chipped sugar 
above the lighthouse-shaped castors 
of grey pepper and grey-white salt. 
grey-white placards oyster stew, cornbeef hash, frankfurters 
marble slabs veined with words in meandering lines.   
dropping on the white counter like horn notes 
through a web of violins, 
the flat yellow lights of oranges, 
the cube-red splashes of apples, 
in high plated pergnes. 
the electric clock jerks every half-minute 
coming--past 
three beef-steaks and a chicken-pie, 
bawled through a slide while the clock jerks heavily. 
a man carries a china mug of coffee to a distant chair. 
two rice puddings and a salmon salad 
are pushed over the counter 
the unfulfilled chairs open to receive them. 
a spoon falls upon the floor with the impact of metal striking stone, 
and the sound throws across the room 
sharp, invisible zigzags 
of silver.


as i sit here in the quiet summer night, 
suddenly, from the distant road, there comes 
the grind and rush of an electric car. 
and, from still farther off, 
an engine puffs sharply, 
followed by the drawn-out shunting scrape of a freight train.   
these are the sounds that men make 
in the long business of living. 
they will always make such sounds, 
years after i am dead and cannot hear them. 

sitting here in the summer night, 
i think of my death. 
what will it be like for you then? 
you will see my chair 
with its bright chintz covering 
standing in the afternoon sunshine, 
as now. 
you will see my narrow table 
at which i have written so many hours. 
my dogs will push their noses into your hand,   
and ask--ask-- 
clinging to you with puzzled eyes. 

the old house will still be here, 
the old house which has known me since the beginning.   
the walls which have watched me while i played   
soldiers, marbles, paper-dolls, 
which have protected me and my books. 
the front-door will gaze down among the old trees   
where, as a child, i hunted ghosts and indians   
it will look out on the wide gravel sweep 
where i rolled my hoop, 
and at the rhododendron bushes 
where i caught black-spotted butterflies. 

the old house will guard you, 
as i have done. 
its walls and rooms will hold you, 
and i shall whisper my thoughts and fancies   
as always, 
from the pages of my books. 

you will sit here, some quiet summer night,   
listening to the puffing trains, 
but you will not be lonely, 
for these things are a part of me. 
and my love will go on speaking to you 
through the chairs, and the tables, and the pictures,   
as it does now through my voice, 
and the quick, necessary touch of my hand. 



this afternoon was the colour of water falling through sunlight 
the trees glittered with the tumbling of leaves 
the sidewalks shone like alleys of dropped maple leaves, 
and the houses ran along them laughing out of square, open windows. 
under a tree in the park, 
two little boys, lying flat on their faces, 
were carefully gathering red berries 
to put in a pasteboard box. 
some day there will be no war, 
then i shall take out this afternoon 
and turn it in my fingers, 
and remark the sweet taste of it upon my palate, 
and note the crisp variety of its flights of leaves. 
to-day i can only gather it 
and put it into my lunch-box, 
for i have time for nothing 
but the endeavour to balance myself 
upon a broken world.


because there are avenues
of traffic lights, a phone book 
of brothers and lawyers,
why should you think your purse 
will not be tugged from your arm 
or the screen door
will remain latched
against the man
who hugs and kisses
his pillow
in the corridor of loneliness?

there is a window of light
a sprinkler turning
as the earth turns,
and you do not think of the hills 
and of the splintered wrists it takes 
to give you
the heat rising toward the ceiling.

you expect your daughter
to be at the door any moment 
and your husband to arrive 
with the night
that is suddenly all around. 
you expect the stove to burst

a collar of fire
when you want it,
the siamese cats
to move against your legs, purring.

but remember this
because blood revolves from one lung to the next, 
why think it will
after tonight?


lilacs, 
false blue, 
white, 
purple, 
color of lilac, 
your great puffs of flowers 
are everywhere in this my new england.   
among your heart-shaped leaves 
orange orioles hop like music-box birds and sing   
their little weak soft songs 
in the crooks of your branches 
the bright eyes of song sparrows sitting on spotted eggs   
peer restlessly through the light and shadow   
of all springs. 
lilacs in dooryards 
holding quiet conversations with an early moon   
lilacs watching a deserted house 
settling sideways into the grass of an old road 
lilacs, wind-beaten, staggering under a lopsided shock of bloom 
above a cellar dug into a hill. 
you are everywhere. 
you were everywhere. 
you tapped the window when the preacher preached his sermon, 
and ran along the road beside the boy going to school. 
you stood by the pasture-bars to give the cows good milking,   
you persuaded the housewife that her dishpan was of silver.   
and her husband an image of pure gold.   
you flaunted the fragrance of your blossoms   
through the wide doors of custom houses-- 
you, and sandal-wood, and tea, 
charging the noses of quill-driving clerks   
when a ship was in from china. 
you called to them goose-quill men, goose-quill men,   
may is a month for flitting. 
until they writhed on their high stools 
and wrote poetry on their letter-sheets behind the propped-up ledgers. 
paradoxical new england clerks, 
writing inventories in ledgers, reading the song of solomon at night, 
so many verses before bed-time, 
because it was the bible. 
the dead fed you 
amid the slant stones of graveyards. 
pale ghosts who planted you 
came in the nighttime 
and let their thin hair blow through your clustered stems.   
you are of the green sea, 
and of the stone hills which reach a long distance. 
you are of elm-shaded streets with little shops where they sell kites and marbles, 
you are of great parks where every one walks and nobody is at home. 
you cover the blind sides of greenhouses 
and lean over the top to say a hurry-word through the glass   
to your friends, the grapes, inside. 

lilacs, 
false blue, 
white, 
purple, 
color of lilac, 
you have forgotten your eastern origin,   
the veiled women with eyes like panthers, 
the swollen, aggressive turbans of jeweled pashas. 
now you are a very decent flower,   
a reticent flower, 
a curiously clear-cut, candid flower,   
standing beside clean doorways, 
friendly to a house-cat and a pair of spectacles,   
making poetry out of a bit of moonlight   
and a hundred or two sharp blossoms. 
maine knows you, 
has for years and years 
new hampshire knows you, 
and massachusetts 
and vermont. 
cape cod starts you along the beaches to rhode island   
connecticut takes you from a river to the sea.   
you are brighter than apples, 
sweeter than tulips, 
you are the great flood of our souls 
bursting above the leaf-shapes of our hearts,   
you are the smell of all summers, 
the love of wives and children, 
the recollection of gardens of little children,   
you are state houses and charters 
and the familiar treading of the foot to and fro on a road it knows. 
may is lilac here in new england, 
may is a thrush singing sun up on a tip-top ash tree,   
may is white clouds behind pine-trees   
puffed out and marching upon a blue sky.   
may is a green as no other, 
may is much sun through small leaves,   
may is soft earth, 
and apple-blossoms, 
and windows open to a south wind.   
may is full light wind of lilac 
from canada to narragansett bay. 

lilacs, 
false blue, 
white, 
purple, 
color of lilac. 
heart-leaves of lilac all over new england,   
roots of lilac under all the soil of new england,   
lilac in me because i am new england, 
because my roots are in it, 
because my leaves are of it, 
because my flowers are for it,   
because it is my country 
and i speak to it of itself 
and sing of it with my own voice   
since certainly it is mine.


					
					the day is fresh-washed and fair, and there is a smell of tulips and narcissus in the air.        the sunshine pours in at the bath-room window and bores through the water in the bath-tub in lathes and planes of greenish-white. it cleaves the water into flaws like a jewel, and cracks it to bright light.        little spots of sunshine lie on the surface of the water and dance, dance, and their reflections wobble deliciously over the ceiling a stir of my finger sets them whirring, reeling. i move a foot and the planes of light in the water jar. i lie back and laugh, and let the green-white water, the sun-flawed beryl water, flow over me. the day is almost too bright to bear, the green water covers me from the too bright day. i will lie here awhile and play with the water and the sun spots. the sky is blue and high. a crow flaps by the window, and there is a whiff of tulips and narcissus in the air.
				

 

when the sun's whiteness closes around us 
like a noose,

it is noon, and molina squats
in the uneven shade of an oleander.

he unfolds a map and, with a pencil, 
blackens panama

into a bruise
he dots rain over bogot, the city of spiders,

and x's in a mountain range that climbs 
like a thermometer

above the stone fence
the old never thought to look over.

a fog presses over lima.
brazil is untangled of its rivers.

where there is a smudge,
snow has stitched its cold into the field.

where the river orinoco cuts east, 
a new river rises nameless

from the open grasses,
and molina calls it his place of birth.


wedding night
graciela bled lightly--
but enough to stain his thighs--
and left an alphabet
of teeth marks on his arm. 
at this, he was happy.
they drank mescal
in bed like the rich
and smoked cigarettes.
she asleep
and the bottle empty, he hid 
a few coins in her left shoe, 
earrings in the right.
they worked long hours
hoeing crooked rows of maize. 
evenings she wove rugs
and embroidered curtains 
to market in taxco.
in short they lived well. 
however in the seventh month 
with child, her belly
rising like a portion of the sun, 
something knotted inside her. 
the ribs ached. a fever climbed. 
manuel summoned the partera 
and though she burned pepper, 
and tied belts around
the stretched belly,
the child did not ease out. 
days later she turned
onto her belly
and between her legs
unraveled a spine of blood.


listen, nephew.
when i opened the cantina
at noon
a triangle of sunlight
was stretched out
on the floor
like a rug
like a tired cat.
it flared in
from the window 
through a small hole 
shaped like a yawn. 
strange i thought 
and placed my hand 
before the opening, 
but the sunlight 
did not vanish. 
i pulled back
the shutters
and the room glowed,
but this pyramid 
of whiteness
was simply brighter.
the sunlight around it 
appeared soiled 
like the bed sheet 
of a borracho.
amazed, i locked the door, 
closed the windows. 
workers, in from 
the fields, knocked 
to be let in,
children peeked 
through the shutters,
but i remained silent.
i poured a beer, 
at a table
shuffled a pack 
of old cards,
and watched it 
cross the floor, 
hang on the wall 
like a portrait 
like a calendar 
without numbers. 
when a fly settled 
in the sunlight 
and disappeared
in a wreath of smoke,
i tapped it with the broom, 
spat on it.
the broom vanished.
the spit sizzled.
it is the truth, little one.
i stood eye to blank eye 
and by misfortune
this finger
this pink stump 
entered the sunlight, 
snapped off 
with a dry sneeze,
and fell to the floor
as a gift
to the ants
who know me
for what i gave.


it's a ', rhinehardt said, and slammed 
the screen door, then worked his way around 
the dog turds in the yard
to the buick gutted from fire--the gears 
teething rust, the fenders sloped
like the shoulders of a fired worker 
out of beer. he circled the car
kicking the tires, eyeing
the grille that still grinned the ribbed wings 
of a sparrow. he looked inside and flies 
lifted like patted dust, settling
into a loose knot on the visor.
yeh, you're right as right ... it's a ', 
rhinehardt spat, his tongue rolling
a false tooth into place. it's got no
running board. he pressed a buck
into his son's hand and retired to the porch 
where he towel-flicked
his wife from a chair
and as evening came on watched beyond 
the street, a kennel of trees,
where--as he had dreamed--a plane would drop 
and bloom fire. two bucks on that one.


today it's going to cost us twenty dollars 
to live. five for a softball. four for a book,
a handful of ones for coffee and two sweet rolls, 
bus fare, rosin for your mother's violin. 
we're completing our task. the tip i left 
for the waitress filters down
like rain, wetting the new roots of a child 
perhaps, a belligerent cat that won't let go 
of a balled sock until there's chicken to eat.
as far as i can tell, daughter, it works like this 
you buy bread from a grocery, a bag of apples 
from a fruit stand, and what coins
are passed on helps others buy pencils, glue, 
tickets to a movie in which laughter 
is thrown into their faces.
if we buy a goldfish, someone tries on a hat.
if we buy crayons, someone walks home with a broom. 
a tip, a small purchase here and there, 
and things just keep going. i guess.


my chalk is no longer than a chip of fingernail, 
chip by which i must explain this monday 
night the verbs to get to wear, to cut. 
i'm not given much, these tired students, 
knuckle-wrapped from work as roofers, 
sour from scrubbing toilets and pedestal sinks. 
i'm given this room with five windows, 
a coffee machine, a piano with busted strings, 
the music of how we feel as the sun falls, 
exhausted from keeping up. 
                                       i stand at 
the blackboard. the chalk is worn to a hangnail, 
nearly gone, the dust of some educational bone. 
by and by i'm cantiflas, the comic 
busybody in front. i say, i get the coffee. 
i pick up a coffee cup and sip. 
i click my heels and say, i wear my shoes. 
i bring an invisible fork to my mouth 
and say, i eat the chicken. 
suddenly the class is alive-- 
each one putting on hats and shoes, 
drinking sodas and beers, cutting flowers 
and steaks--a pantomime of sumptuous living. 

at break i pass out cookies. 
augustine, the guatemalan, asks in spanish, 
teacher, what is tally-ho'? 
i look at the word in the composition book. 
i raise my face to the bare bulb for a blind answer. 
i stutter, then say, es como adelante. 
augustine smiles, then nudges a friend 
in the next desk, now smarter by one word. 
after the cookies are eaten, 
we move ahead to prepositions-- 
under, over, and between, 
useful words when la migra opens the doors 
of their idling vans. 
at ten to nine, i'm tired of acting, 
and they're tired of their roles. 
when class ends, i clap my hands of chalk dust, 
and two students applaud, thinking it's a new verb. 
i tell them adelante, 
and they pick up their old books. 
they smile and, in return, cry, tally-ho. 
as they head for the door.


these alternate nights and days, these seasons   
somehow fail to convince me. it seems   
i have the sense of infinity 

in your dreams, o crew of columbus,   
o listeners over the sea 
for the surf that breaks upon nothing-- 

once i was waked by the nightingales in the garden.   
i thought, what time is it? i thought,   
time--is it time still?--now is it time? 

tell me your dreams, o sailors   
tell me, in sleep did you climb   
the tall masts, and before you-- 

at night the stillness of old trees   
is a leaning over and the inertness   
of hills is a kind of waiting. 

in sleep, in a dream, did you see   
the world's end? did the water 
break--and no shore--did you see? 

strange faces come through the streets to me   
like messengers and i have been warned   
by the moving slowly of hands at a window. 

oh, i have the sense of infinity--   
but the world, sailors, is round.   
they say there is no end to it. 



the incoherent rushing of the train   
dulls like a drugged pain 

numbs 
to an ether throbbing of inaudible drums 

unfolds 
hush within hush until the night withholds 

only its darkness. 
                            from the deep   
dark a voice calls like a voice in sleep 

slowly a strange name in a strange tongue.   

among 

the sleeping listeners a sound 
as leaves stir faintly on the ground 

when snow falls from a windless sky-- 
a stir    a sigh


the star dissolved in evening--the one star   
the silently 
                   and night o soon now, soon   
and still the light now 
                                    and still now the large   
relinquishing 
                     and through the pools of blue   
still, still the swallows 
                                       and a wind now 
                                                            and the tree   
gathering darkness 
                              i was small. i lay   
beside my mother on the grass, and sleep   
came-- 

          slow hooves and dripping with the dark   
the velvet muzzles, the white feet that move   
in a dream water 
                        and o soon now soon 
sleep and the night. 

                              and i was not afraid.   
her hand lay over mine. her fingers knew   
darkness,--and sleep--the silent lands, the far   
far off of morning where i should awake.


and here face down beneath the sun   
and here upon earth's noonward height   
to feel the always coming on 
the always rising of the night 

to feel creep up the curving east   
the earthy chill of dusk and slow   
upon those under lands the vast   
and ever climbing shadow grow 

and strange at ecbatan the trees   
take leaf by leaf the evening strange   
the flooding dark about their knees   
the mountains over persia change 

and now at kermanshah the gate   
dark empty and the withered grass   
and through the twilight now the late   
few travelers in the westward pass 

and baghdad darken and the bridge   
across the silent river gone 
and through arabia the edge 
of evening widen and steal on 

and deepen on palmyra's street 
the wheel rut in the ruined stone   
and lebanon fade out and crete 
high through the clouds and overblown 

and over sicily the air 
still flashing with the landward gulls   
and loom and slowly disappear   
the sails above the shadowy hulls 

and spain go under and the shore   
of africa the gilded sand 
and evening vanish and no more   
the low pale light across that land 

nor now the long light on the sea 

and here face downward in the sun   
to feel how swift how secretly 
the shadow of the night comes on ...   



i speak this poem now with grave and level voice   
in praise of autumn, of the far-horn-winding fall. 

i praise the flower-barren fields, the clouds, the tall   
unanswering branches where the wind makes sullen noise. 

i praise the fall it is the human season. 
                                                                  now 
no more the foreign sun does meddle at our earth,   
enforce the green and bring the fallow land to birth,   
nor winter yet weigh all with silence the pine bough, 

but now in autumn with the black and outcast crows   
share we the spacious world the whispering year is gone   
there is more room to live now the once secret dawn   
comes late by daylight and the dark unguarded goes. 

between the mutinous brave burning of the leaves   
and winter's covering of our hearts with his deep snow   
we are alone there are no evening birds we know   
the naked moon the tame stars circle at our eaves. 

it is the human season. on this sterile air 
do words outcarry breath the sound goes on and on.   
i hear a dead man's cry from autumn long since gone. 

i cry to you beyond upon this bitter air.


seora, it is true the greeks are dead. 

it is true also that we here are americans 
that we use the machines that a sight of the god is unusual   
that more people have more thoughts that there are 

progress and science and tractors and revolutions and   
marx and the wars more antiseptic and murderous   
and music in every home there is also hoover. 

does the lady suggest we should write it out in the word?   
does madame recall our responsibilities? we are   
whores, frulein poets, frulein, are persons of 

known vocation following troops they must sleep with   
stragglers from either prince and of both views. 
the rules permit them to further the business of neither. 

it is also strictly forbidden to mix in maneuvers. 
those that infringe are inflated with praise on the plazas-- 
their bones are resultantly afterwards found under newspapers. 

preferring life with the sons to death with the fathers,   
we also doubt on the record whether the sons 
will still be shouting around with the same huzzas-- 

for we hope lady to live to lie with the youngest.   
there are only a handful of things a man likes,   
generation to generation, hungry or 

well fed the earth's one life's   
one mister morgan is not one. 

there is nothing worse for our trade than to be in style. 

he that goes naked goes further at last than another.   
wrap the bard in a flag or a school and they'll jimmy his   
door down and be thick in his bed--for a month 

who recalls the address now of the imagists?   
but the naked man has always his own nakedness.   
people remember forever his live limbs. 

they may drive him out of the camps but one will take him.   
they may stop his tongue on his teeth with a rope's argument-- 
he will lie in a house and be warm when they are shaking. 

besides, tovarishch, how to embrace an army?   
how to take to one's chamber a million souls? 
how to conceive in the name of a column of marchers? 

the things of the poet are done to a man alone 
as the things of love are done--or of death when he hears the   
step withdraw on the stair and the clock tick only. 

neither his class nor his kind nor his trade may come near him   
there where he lies on his left arm and will die, 
nor his class nor his kind nor his trade when the blood is jeering 

and his knee's in the soft of the bed where his love lies. 

i remind you, barinya, the life of the poet is hard--   
a hardy life with a boot as quick as a fiver 

is it just to demand of us also to bear arms? 




					
					first there is the wind but not like the familiar wind but long and without lapses or falling away or surges of air as is usual but rather like the persistent pressure of a river or a running tide.     this wind is from the other side and has an odor unlike the odor of the winds with us but like time if time had odor and were cold and carried a bitter and sharp taste like rust on the taste of snow or the fragrance of thunder.     when the air has this taste of time the frontiers are not far from us.     then too there are the animals. there are always animals under the small trees. they belong neither to our side nor to theirs but are wild and because they are animals of such kind that wildness is unfamiliar in them as the horse for example or the goat and often sheep and dogs and like creatures their wandering there is strange and even terrifying signaling as it does the violation of custom and the subversion of order.     there are also the unnatural lovers the distortion of images the penetration of mirrors and the inarticulate meanings of the dreams. the dreams are in turmoil like a squall of birds.     finally there is the evasion of those with whom we have come. it is at the frontiers that the companions desert us--that the girl returns to the old country     that we are alone.
				

 

think of our blindness where the water burned   
are we so certain that those wings, returned   
and turning, we had half discerned   
before our dazzled eyes had surely seen   
the bird aloft there, did not mean?--   
our hearts so seized upon the sign 

think how we sailed up-wind, the brine 
tasting of daphne, the enormous wave   
thundering in the water cave-- 
thunder in stone. and how we beached the skiff   
and climbed the coral of that iron cliff 
and found what only in our hearts we'd heard--   
the silver screaming of that one, white bird   
the fabulous wings, the crimson beak 
that opened, red as blood, to shriek 
and clamor in that world of stone, 
no voice to answer but its own. 

what certainty, hidden in our hearts before,   
found in the bird its metaphor? 



when liberty is headlong girl 
and runs her roads and wends her ways   
liberty will shriek and whirl 
her showery torch to see it blaze. 

when liberty is wedded wife 
and keeps the barn and counts the byre   
liberty amends her life. 
she drowns her torch for fear of fire. 



for learned and augustus hand
you, my friends, and you strangers, all of you, 
stand with me a little by the walls   
or where the walls once were. 
the bridge was here, the city further   
now there is neither bridge nor town--   
a doorway where the roof is down   
opens on a foot-worn stair 
that climbs by three steps into empty air.   
what foot went there? 
nothing in this town that had a thousand steeples 
lives now but these flocks of sheep 
grazing the yellow grasses where the bricks lie dead beneath   
dogs drive them with their brutal teeth. 

can none but sheep live where the walls go under?   
is man's day over and the sheep's begun? 
and shall we sit here like the mourners on a dunghill   
shrilling with melodious tongue-- 
disfiguring our faces with the nails of our despair?   
what dust is this we sift upon our hair? 
because a world is taken from us as the camels from the man of uz 
shall we sit weeping for the world that was   
and curse god and so perish? 
shall monuments be grass and sheep inherit them?   
shall dogs rule in the rubble of the arches? 

consider, oh consider what we are   
consider what it is to be a man-- 
he who makes his journey by the glimmer of a candle 
who discovers in his mouth, between his teeth, a word   
whose heart can bear the silence of the stars-- that burden   
who comes upon his meaning in the blindness of a stone--   
a girl's shoulder, perfectly harmonious 

even the talk of it would take us days together. 
marvels men have made, oh marvels--and our breath 
brief as it is our death waiting--   
marvels upon marvels works of state--   
the imagination of the shape of order   
works of beauty--the cedar door   
perfectly fitted to the sill of basalt   
works of grace-- 
the ceremony at the entering of houses, 
at the entering of lives the bride among the torches in the shrill carouse 

works of soul-- 
pilgrimages through the desert to the sacred boulder   
through the mid night to the stroke of one   
works of grace works of wonder 
all this have we done and more-- 
and seen--what have we not seen?-- 

a man beneath the sunlight in his meaning   
a man, one man, a man alone. 

in the sinks of the earth that wanderer has gone down.   
the shadow of his mind is on the mountains.   
the word he has said is kept in the place beyond   
as the seed is kept and the earth ponders it. 
stones--even the stones remember him 
even the leaves--his image is in them. 
and now because the city is a ruin in the waste of air 
we sit here and despair 
because the sheep graze in the dying grove   
our day is over 
we must end 
because the talk around the table in the dusk has ended,   
because the fingers of the goddesses are found   
like marble pebbles in the gravelly ground   
and nothing answers but the jackal in the desert,--   
because the cloud proposes, the wind says 

because the sheep are pastured where the staring statues lie   
we sit upon the sand in silence   
watching the sun go and the shadows change 

listen, my friends, and you, all of you, strangers,   
listen, the work of man, the work of splendor   
never has been ended or will end. 
even where the sheep defile the ruined stair   
and dogs are masters--even there 
one man's finger in the dust shall trace the circle. 

even among the ruins shall begin the work, 
large in the level morning of the light 
and beautiful with cisterns where the water whitens,   
rippling upon the lip of stone, and spills 
by cedar sluices into pools, and the young builders   
string their plumb lines, and the well-laid course   
blanches its mortar in the sun, and all the morning   
smells of wood-smoke, rope-tar, horse-sweat, pitch-pine,   
men and the trampled mint leaves in the ditch. 

one man in the sun alone 
walks between the silence and the stone   
the city rises from his flesh, his bone. 




to pull the metal splinter from my palm 
my father recited a story in a low voice. 
i watched his lovely face and not the blade. 
before the story ended, he'd removed 
the iron sliver i thought i'd die from. 

i can't remember the tale, 
but hear his voice still, a well 
of dark water, a prayer. 
and i recall his hands, 
two measures of tenderness 
he laid against my face, 
the flames of discipline 
he raised above my head. 

had you entered that afternoon 
you would have thought you saw a man 
planting something in a boy's palm, 
a silver tear, a tiny flame. 
had you followed that boy 
you would have arrived here, 
where i bend over my wife's right hand. 

look how i shave her thumbnail down 
so carefully she feels no pain. 
watch as i lift the splinter out. 
i was seven when my father 
took my hand like this, 
and i did not hold that shard 
between my fingers and think, 
metal that will bury me, 
christen it little assassin, 
ore going deep for my heart. 
and i did not lift up my wound and cry, 
death visited here 
i did what a child does 
when he's given something to keep. 
i kissed my father.


in sixth grade mrs. walker 
slapped the back of my head 
and made me stand in the corner   
for not knowing the difference   
between persimmon and precision.   
how to choose 

persimmons. this is precision. 
ripe ones are soft and brown-spotted.   
sniff the bottoms. the sweet one 
will be fragrant. how to eat 
put the knife away, lay down newspaper.   
peel the skin tenderly, not to tear the meat.   
chew the skin, suck it, 
and swallow. now, eat 
the meat of the fruit, 
so sweet, 
all of it, to the heart. 

donna undresses, her stomach is white.   
in the yard, dewy and shivering 
with crickets, we lie naked, 
face-up, face-down. 
i teach her chinese. 
crickets chiu chiu. dew i've forgotten.   
naked   i've forgotten. 
ni, wo   you and me. 
i part her legs, 
remember to tell her 
she is beautiful as the moon. 

other words 
that got me into trouble were 
fight and fright, wren and yarn. 
fight was what i did when i was frightened,   
fright was what i felt when i was fighting.   
wrens are small, plain birds,   
yarn is what one knits with. 
wrens are soft as yarn. 
my mother made birds out of yarn.   
i loved to watch her tie the stuff   
a bird, a rabbit, a wee man. 

mrs. walker brought a persimmon to class   
and cut it up 
so everyone could taste 
a chinese apple. knowing 
it wasn't ripe or sweet, i didn't eat 
but watched the other faces. 

my mother said every persimmon has a sun   
inside, something golden, glowing,   
warm as my face. 

once, in the cellar, i found two wrapped in newspaper,   
forgotten and not yet ripe. 
i took them and set both on my bedroom windowsill,   
where each morning a cardinal 
sang, the sun, the sun. 

finally understanding   
he was going blind, 
my father sat up all one night   
waiting for a song, a ghost.   
i gave him the persimmons,   
swelled, heavy as sadness,   
and sweet as love. 

this year, in the muddy lighting 
of my parents' cellar, i rummage, looking   
for something i lost. 
my father sits on the tired, wooden stairs,   
black cane between his knees, 
hand over hand, gripping the handle. 
he's so happy that i've come home. 
i ask how his eyes are, a stupid question.   
all gone, he answers. 

under some blankets, i find a box. 
inside the box i find three scrolls. 
i sit beside him and untie 
three paintings by my father 
hibiscus leaf and a white flower. 
two cats preening. 
two persimmons, so full they want to drop from the cloth. 

he raises both hands to touch the cloth,   
asks, which is this? 

this is persimmons, father. 

oh, the feel of the wolftail on the silk,   
the strength, the tense 
precision in the wrist. 
i painted them hundreds of times   
eyes closed. these i painted blind.   
some things never leave a person 
scent of the hair of one you love,   
the texture of persimmons, 
in your palm, the ripe weight. 
 



from blossoms comes 
this brown paper bag of peaches 
we bought from the boy 
at the bend in the road where we turned toward   
signs painted peaches. 

from laden boughs, from hands, 
from sweet fellowship in the bins, 
comes nectar at the roadside, succulent 
peaches we devour, dusty skin and all, 
comes the familiar dust of summer, dust we eat. 

o, to take what we love inside, 
to carry within us an orchard, to eat 
not only the skin, but the shade, 
not only the sugar, but the days, to hold 
the fruit in our hands, adore it, then bite into   
the round jubilance of peach. 

there are days we live 
as if death were nowhere 
in the background from joy 
to joy to joy, from wing to wing, 
from blossom to blossom to 
impossible blossom, to sweet impossible blossom. 



. 
through the night   
the apples 
outside my window   
one by one let go   
their branches and   
drop to the lawn. 
i can't see, but hear 
the stem-snap, the plummet 
through leaves, then 
the final thump against the ground. 

sometimes two   
at once, or one   
right after another. 
during long moments of silence 
i wait 
and wonder about the bruised bodies,   
the terror of diving through air, and   
think i'll go tomorrow 
to find the newly fallen, but they 
all look alike lying there 
dewsoaked, disappearing before me. 

. 
i lie beneath my window listening   
to the sound of apples dropping in 

the yard, a syncopated code i long to know, 
which continues even as i sleep, and dream i know 

the meaning of what i hear, each dull   
thud of unseen apple- 

body, the earth   
falling to earth 

once and forever, over   
and over. 




that scraping of iron on iron when the wind   
rises, what is it? something the wind won't   
quit with, but drags back and forth. 
sometimes faint, far, then suddenly, close, just   
beyond the screened door, as if someone there   
squats in the dark honing his wares against   
my threshold. half steel wire, half metal wing,   
nothing and anything might make this noise   
of saws and rasps, a creaking and groaning 
of bone-growth, or body-death, marriages of rust,   
or ore abraded. tonight, something bows 
that should not bend. something stiffens that should   
slide. something, loose and not right,   
rakes or forges itself all night. 



in the steamer is the trout   
seasoned with slivers of ginger, 
two sprigs of green onion, and sesame oil.   
we shall eat it with rice for lunch,   
brothers, sister, my mother who will    
taste the sweetest meat of the head,   
holding it between her fingers   
deftly, the way my father did   
weeks ago. then he lay down   
to sleep like a snow-covered road   
winding through pines older than him,   
without any travelers, and lonely for no one. 



at the edge of the city the pickerel   
vomits and dies. the river 
with its white hair staggers to the sea. 

my life lay crumpled like a smashed car. 

windows barred, ivy, square stone.   
lines gather at mouth and at eyes   
like cracks in a membrane. 
eyeballs and tongue spill on the floor   
in a puddle of yolks and whites. 

the intact  
under the clear wave, the sun shining. 

the playhouse of my grandfather's mother   
stands north of the shed spiders 
and the dolls' teacups of dead women.   
in ohio the k mart shrugs 
it knows it is going to die. 

a stone, the closed eye of the dirt. 

outside before dawn 
houses sail up 
like wrecks from the bottom of the sea.   
a door clicks a light opens. 

if the world is a dream, 
so is the puffed stomach of juan, 
and the rich in connecticut are dreamers. 

there are bachelors 
who live in shacks made of oil cans 
and broken doors, who stitch their shirts   
until the cloth disappears under stitches,   
who collect nails in ball jars. 

a trolley car comes out of the elms, 
the tracks laid through an acre of wheat stubble,   
slanting downhill. i board it, 
and cross the field into the new pine. 



at pet stores in detroit, you can buy   
frozen rats 
for seventy-five cents apiece, to feed   
your pet boa constrictor 
back home in grosse pointe, 
or in grosse pointe park, 

while the free nation of rats 
in detroit emerges 
from alleys behind pet shops, from cellars   
and junked cars, and gathers 
to flow at twilight 
like a river the color of pavement, 

and crawls over bedrooms and groceries   
and through broken 
school windows to eat the crayon   
from drawings of rats-- 
and no one in detroit understands   
how rats are delicious in dearborn. 

if only we could communicate, if only   
the boa constrictors of southfield   
would slither down i-, 
turn north on the lodge expressway,   
and head for eighth street, to eat   
out for a change. instead, tomorrow, 

a man from birmingham enters   
a pet shop in detroit 
to buy a frozen german shepherd   
for six dollars and fifty cents   
to feed his pet cheetah, 
guarding the compound at home. 

oh, they arrive all day, in their   
locked cars, buying 
schoolyards, bridges, buses,   
churches, and ethnic festivals   
they buy a frozen texaco station 
for eighty-four dollars and fifty cents 

to feed to an imported london taxi   
in huntington woods 
they buy tiger stadium, 
frozen, to feed to the little league   
in grosse ile. they bring everything   
home, frozen solid 

as pig iron, to the six-car garages 
of harper woods, grosse pointe woods,   
farmington, grosse pointe 
farms, troy, and grosse arbor-- 
and they ingest 
everything, and fall asleep, and lie 

coiled in the sun, while the city   
thaws in the stomach and slides 
to the small intestine, where enzymes   
break down molecules of protein   
to amino acids, which enter 
the cold bloodstream.


august, goldenrod blowing. we walk   
into the graveyard, to find 
my grandfather's grave. ten years ago   
i came here last, bringing 
marigolds from the round garden   
outside the kitchen. 
i didn't know you then. 
                                  we walk 
among carved names that go with photographs 
on top of the piano at the farm 
keneston, wells, fowler, batchelder, buck.   
we pause at the new grave 
of grace fenton, my grandfather's   
sister. last summer 
we called on her at the nursing home,   
eighty-seven, and nodding 
in a blue housedress. we cannot find   
my grandfather's grave. 
                                  back at the house 
where no one lives, we potter   
and explore the back chamber 
where everything comes to rest spinning wheels,   
pretty boxes, quilts, 
bottles, books, albums of postcards.   
then with a flashlight we descend   
firm steps to the root cellar--black,   
cobwebby, huge, 
with dirt floors and fieldstone walls,   
and above the walls, holding the hewn   
sills of the house, enormous 
granite foundation stones. 
past the empty bins 
for squash, apples, carrots, and potatoes, 
we discover the shelves for canning, a few 
pale pints 
of tomato left, and--what 
is this?--syrup, maple syrup   
in a quart jar, syrup 
my grandfather made twenty-five   
years ago 
for the last time. 
                           i remember 
coming to the farm in march 
in sugaring time, as a small boy. 
he carried the pails of sap, sixteen-quart   
buckets, dangling from each end   
of a wooden yoke 
that lay across his shoulders, and emptied them   
into a vat in the saphouse   
where fire burned day and night   
for a week. 
                now the saphouse   
tilts, nearly to the ground,   
like someone exhausted 
to the point of death, and next winter 
when snow piles three feet thick   
on the roofs of the cold farm, 
the saphouse will shudder and slide   
with the snow to the ground. 
                                          today 
we take my grandfather's last   
quart of syrup 
upstairs, holding it gingerly, 
and we wash off twenty-five years   
of dirt, and we pull 
and pry the lid up, cutting the stiff,   
dried rubber gasket, and dip our fingers 
in, you and i both, and taste 
the sweetness, you for the first time, 
the sweetness preserved, of a dead man   
in the kitchen he left 
when his body slid 
like anyone's into the ground.


twelve people, most of us strangers, stand in a room   
in ann arbor, drinking cribari from jars. 
then two young men, who cooked him, 
carry him to the table 
on a large square of plywood his body 
striped, like a tiger cat's, from the basting, 
his legs long, much longer than a cat's,   
and the striped hide as shiny as vinyl. 

now i see his head, as he takes his place 
at the center of the table, 
his wide pig's head and he looks like the javelina 
that ran in front of the car, in the desert outside tucson,   
and i am drawn to him, my brother the pig,   
with his large ears cocked forward, 
with his tight snout, with his small ferocious teeth   
in a jaw propped open 
by an apple. how bizarre, this raw apple clenched   
in a cooked face then i see his eyes, 
his eyes cramped shut, his no-eyes, his eyes like x's 
in a comic strip, when the character gets knocked out. 

this afternoon they read directions 
from a book the eyeballs must be removed 
or they will burst during roasting. so they hacked them out.   
i nearly fainted, says someone. 
i never fainted before, in my whole life. 
then they gutted the pig and stuffed him, 
and roasted him five hours, basting the long body. 

                          

now we examine him, exclaiming, and we marvel at him-- 
but no one picks up a knife. 

then a young woman cuts off his head. 
it comes off so easily, like a detachable part.   
with sudden enthusiasm we dismantle the pig,   
we wrench his trotters off, we twist them 
at shoulder and hip, and they come off so easily.   
then we cut open his belly and pull the skin back. 

for myself, i scoop a portion of left thigh,   
moist, tender, falling apart, fat, sweet. 
we forage like an army starving in winter 
that crosses a pass in the hills and discovers 
a valley of full barns-- 
cattle fat and lowing in their stalls, 
bins of potatoes in root cellars under white farmhouses.   
barrels of cider, onions, hens squawking over eggs-- 
and the people nowhere, with bread still warm in the oven. 

maybe, south of the valley, refugees pull their carts   
listening for stukas or elephants, carrying 
bedding, pans, and silk dresses, 
old men and women, children, deserters, young wives. 

no, we are here, eating the pig together. 

                          

in ten minutes, the destruction is total. 

his tiny ribs, delicate as birds' feet, lie crisscrossed.   
or they are like crosshatching in a drawing,   
lines doubling and redoubling on each other. 

bits of fat and muscle 
mix with stuffing alien to the body, 
walnuts and plums. his skin, like a parchment bag   
soaked in oil, is pulled back and flattened, 
with ridges and humps remaining, like a contour map,   
like the map of a defeated country. 

the army consumes every blade of grass in the valley,   
every tree, every stream, every village, 
every crossroad, every shack, every book, every graveyard. 

his intact head 
swivels around, to view the landscape of body   
as if in dismay. 

for sixteen weeks i lived. for sixteen weeks 
i took into myself nothing but the milk of my mother   
who rolled on her side for me, 
for my brothers and sisters. only five hours roasting,   
and this body so quickly dwindles away to nothing. 

                          

by itself, isolated on this plywood, 
among this puzzle of foregone possibilities,   
his intact head seems to want affection. 
without knowing that i will do it, 
i reach out and scratch his jaw, 
and i stroke him behind his ears, 
as if he might suddenly purr from his cooked head. 

when i stroke your pig's ears, 
and scratch the striped leather of your jowls,   
the furrow between the sockets of your eyes,   
i take into myself, and digest, 
wheat that grew between 
the tigris and the euphrates rivers. 

and i take into myself the flint carving tool, 
and the savannah, and hairs in the tail   
of eohippus, and fingers of bamboo, 
and hannibal's elephant, and hannibal, 
and everything that lived before us, everything born,   
exalted, and dead, and historians who carved in the old kingdom   
when the wall had not heard about china. 

i speak these words 
into the ear of the stone age pig, the abraham   
pig, the ocean pig, the achilles pig, 
and into the ears 
of the fire pig that will eat our bodies up. 

fire, brother and father, 
twelve of us, in our different skins, older and younger,   
opened your skin together 
and tore your body apart, and took it 
into our bodies. 



in october of the year, 
he counts potatoes dug from the brown field,   
counting the seed, counting   
the cellar's portion out,   
and bags the rest on the cart's floor. 

he packs wool sheared in april, honey 
in combs, linen, leather   
tanned from deerhide,   
and vinegar in a barrel 
hooped by hand at the forge's fire. 

he walks by his ox's head, ten days 
to portsmouth market, and sells potatoes,   
and the bag that carried potatoes, 
flaxseed, birch brooms, maple sugar, goose   
feathers, yarn. 

when the cart is empty he sells the cart.   
when the cart is sold he sells the ox,   
harness and yoke, and walks 
home, his pockets heavy 
with the year's coin for salt and taxes, 

and at home by fire's light in november cold   
stitches new harness 
for next year's ox in the barn, 
and carves the yoke, and saws planks   
building the cart again.


ruminant pillows gregarious soft boulders 

if one of you found a gap in a stone wall, 
the rest of you--rams, ewes, bucks, wethers, lambs   
mothers and daughters, old grandfather-father,   
cousins and aunts, small bleating sons-- 
followed onward, stupid 
as sheep, wherever 
your leader's sheep-brain wandered to. 

my grandfather spent all day searching the valley   
and edges of ragged mountain, 
calling ke-day as if he brought you salt,   
ke-day ke-day 

                   

when the shirt wore out, and darns in the woolen   
shirt needed darning, 
a woman in a white collar 
cut the shirt into strips and braided it,   
as she braided her hair every morning. 

in a hundred years 
the knees of her great-granddaughter 
crawled on a rug made from the wool of sheep   
whose bones were mud, 
like the bones of the woman, who stares   
from an oval in the parlor. 

                   

i forked the brambly hay down to you 
in nineteen-fifty. i delved my hands deep   
in the winter grass of your hair. 

when the shearer cut to your nakedness in april   
and you dropped black eyes in shame, 
hiding in barnyard corners, unable to hide,   
i brought grain to raise your spirits, 
and ten thousand years 
wound us through pasture and hayfield together,   
threads of us woven 
together, three hundred generations 
from africa's hills to new hampshire's. 

                   

you were not shrewd like the pig.   
you were not strong like the horse.   
you were not brave like the rooster. 

yet none of the others looked like a lump of granite   
that grew hair, 
and none of the others 
carried white fleece as soft as dandelion seed   
around a black face, 
and none of them sang such a flat and sociable song. 

                   


now the black-faced sheep have wandered and will not return,   
even if i should search the valleys   
and call ke-day, as if i brought them salt. 
now the railroad draws 
a line of rust through the valley. birch, pine, and maple   
lean from cellarholes 
and cover the dead pastures of ragged mountain   
except where machines make snow 
and cables pull money up hill, to slide back down. 

                   

at south danbury church twelve of us sit-- 
cousins and aunts, sons-- 
where the great-grandfathers of the forty-acre farms   
filled every pew. 
i look out the window at summer places, 
at boston lawyers' houses 
with swimming pools cunningly added to cowsheds,   
and we read an old poem aloud, about israel's sheep,   
old lumps of wool, and we read 

that the rich farmer, though he names his farm for himself,   
takes nothing into his grave 
that even if people praise us, because we are successful,   
we will go under the ground 
to meet our ancestors collected there in the darkness   
that we are all of us sheep, and death is our shepherd,   
and we die as the animals die.


between pond and sheepbarn, by maples and watery birches,   
rebecca paces a double line of rust 
in a sandy trench, striding on black 
creosoted eight-by-eights. 
                                       in nineteen-forty-three, 
wartrains skidded tanks, 
airframes, dynamos, searchlights, and troops 
to montreal. she counted cars 
from the stopped hayrack at the endless crossing   
ninety-nine, one hundred and her grandfather ben's   
voice shaking with rage and oratory told 
how the mighty boston and maine 
kept the statehouse in its pocket. 
                                                   today rebecca walks   
a line that vanishes, in solitude 
bypassed by wars and commerce. she remembers the story   
of the bunting'd day her great-great-great- 
grandmother watched the first train roll and smoke   
from potter place to gale 
with fireworks, cider, and speeches. then the long rail   
drove west, buzzing and humming the hive of rolling stock   
extended a thousand-car'd perspective 
from ohio to oregon, where men who left stone farms   
rode rails toward gold. 
                                  on this blue day she walks   
under a high jet's glint of swooped aluminum pulling   
its feathery contrail westward. she sees ahead   
how the jet dies into junk, and highway wastes   
like railroad. beside her the old creation retires,   
hayrack sunk like a rowboat 
under its fields of hay. she closes her eyes 
to glimpse the vertical track that rises 
from the underworld of graves, 
soul's ascension connecting dead to unborn, rails   
that hum with a hymn of continual vanishing   
where tracks cross. 
                            for she opens her eyes to read   
on a solitary gravestone next to the rails 
the familiar names of ruth and matthew bott, born   
in a norfolk parish, who ventured 
the immigrant's passionate exodus westward to labor   
on their own land. here love builds 
its mortal house, where today's wind carries   
a double scent of heaven and cut hay.


.   baseball, i warrant, is not the whole   
occupation of the aging boy. 
far from it there are cats and roses   
there is her water body. she fills 
the skin of her legs up, like water   
under her blouse, water assembles,   
swelling lukewarm her mouth is water,   
her cheekbones cool water water flows   
in her rapid hair. i drink water 

.   from her body as she walks past me   
to open a screen door, as she bends   
to weed among herbs, or as she lies   
beside me at five in the morning   
in submarine light. curt davis threw   
a submarine ball, terrifying 
to right-handed batters. another   
pleasure, thoroughly underrated,   
is micturition, which is even 

.   commoner than baseball. it begins   
by announcing itself more slowly   
and less urgently than sexual 
desire, but confusingly in the 
identical place. ignorant men 
therefore on occasion confuse beer- 
drinking with love but i have discussed   
adultery elsewhere. we allow 
this sweet release to commence itself, 

.   addressing a urinal perhaps,   
perhaps poised over a white toilet   
with feet spread wide and head tilted back   
oh, what'delicious permission what   
luxury of letting go what luxe   
yellow curve of mildest ecstasy   
granted we may not compare it to   
poignant and crimson bliss, it is as   
voluptuous as rain all night long 

.   after baseball in august's parch. the   
jade plant's trunk, as thick as a man's wrist,   
urges upward thrusting from packed dirt,   
with chinese vigor spreading limbs out   
that bear heavy leaves--palpable, dark,   
juicy, green, profound they suck, the way   
bleacher fans claim inhabitants of 
box seats do. the fourth of july we   
exhaust stars from sparklers in the late 

.   twilight. we swoop ovals of white-gold   
flame, making quick signatures against 
an imploding dark. the five-year-old   
girl kisses the young dog goodbye and   
chases the quick erratic kitten.   
when she returns in a few years as   
a tall shy girl, she will come back to   
a dignified spreading cat and a 
dog ash-gray on the muzzle. sparklers 

.   expel quickly this night of farewell   
if they didn't burn out, they wouldn't   
be beautiful. kurt, may i hazard   
an opinion on expansion? last 
winter meetings, the major leagues al- 
ready meager in ability, 
scanty in starting pitchers voted 
to add two teams. therefore minor league   
players will advance all too quickly, 

.   with boys in the bigs who wouldn't have   
made double-a forty years ago. 
directors of player personnel 
will search like poets scrambling in old   
notebooks for unused leftover lines, 
but when was the last time anyone 
cut back when he or she could expand?   
kurt, i get the notion that you were 
another who never discarded 

.   anything, a keeper from way back.   
you smoked cigarettes, in inflation- 
times rolled from chopped-up banknotes, billions   
inhaled and exhaled as cancerous   
smoke. when commerce woke, men was awake.   
if you smoked a cigar, the cigar   
band discovered itself glued into   
collage. ongoing life became the   
material of kurtschwittersball. 



each morning i made my way   
among gangways, elevators,   
and nurses' pods to jane's room   
to interrogate the grave helpers   
who tended her through the night   
while the ship's massive engines   
kept its propellers turning. 
week after week, i sat by her bed   
with black coffee and the globe.   
the passengers on this voyage   
wore masks or cannulae 
or dangled devices that dripped   
chemicals into their wrists.   
i believed that the ship 
traveled to a harbor 
of breakfast, work, and love.   
i wrote when the infusions   
are infused entirely, bone 
marrow restored and lymphoblasts   
remitted, i will take my wife,   
bald as michael jordan, 
back to our dog and day. today,   
months later at home, these   
words turned up on my desk   
as i listened in case jane called   
for help, or spoke in delirium,   
ready to make the agitated 
drive to emergency again 
for readmission to the huge 
vessel that heaves water month   
after month, without leaving   
port, without moving a knot,   
without arrival or destination,   
its great engines pounding. 



   i am the smoke king 
   i am black
i am swinging in the sky,
i am wringing worlds awry
i am the thought of the throbbing mills,
i am the soul of the soul-toil kills,
wraith of the ripple of trading rills
up i'm curling from the sod, 
i am whirling home to god
   i am the smoke king
   i am black.

   i am the smoke king, 
   i am black
i am wreathing broken hearts,
i am sheathing love's light darts
   inspiration of iron times 
   wedding the toil of toiling climes,
   shedding the blood of bloodless crimes--
lurid lowering 'mid the blue, 
torrid towering toward the true,
   i am the smoke king, 
   i am black.

   i am the smoke king,
   i am black
i am darkening with song,
i am hearkening to wrong
   i will be black as blackness can--
   the blacker the mantle, the mightier the man 
   for blackness was ancient ere whiteness began. 
i am daubing god in night,
i am swabbing hell in white
   i am the smoke king
   i am black.

   i am the smoke king
   i am black
i am cursing ruddy morn,
i am hearsing hearts unborn
   souls unto me are as stars in a night,
   i whiten my black men--i blacken my white 
   what's the hue of a hide to a man in his might? 
hail great, gritty, grimy hands--
sweet christ, pity toiling lands
   i am the smoke king
   i am black.


					
					of course you have faced the dilemma it is announced, they all smirk and rise. if they are ultra, they remove their hats and look ecstatic then they look at you. what shall you do? noblesse oblige you cannot be boorish, or ungracious and too, after all it is your country and you do love its ideals if not all of its realities. now, then, i have thought of a way out arise, gracefully remove your hat, and tilt your head. then sing as follows, powerfully and with deep unction. they'll hardly note the little changes and their feelings and your conscience will thus be saved  my country tis of thee, late land of slavery,          of thee i sing. land where my father's pride   slept where my mother died,   from every mountain side          let freedom ring  my native country thee land of the slave set free,          thy fame i love. i love thy rocks and rills and o'er thy hate which chills,   my heart with purpose thrills,            to rise above.  let laments swell the breeze   and wring from all the trees           sweet freedom's song.   let laggard tongues awake,   let all who hear partake,   let southern silence quake,          the sound prolong.  our fathers' god to thee   author of liberty,          to thee we sing soon may our land be bright,   with freedom's happy light   protect us by thy might,          great god our king.
				

 

dedicated to kwame nkrumah
i was a little boy, at home with strangers.   
i liked my playmates, and knew well,   
whence all their parents came 
from england, scotland, royal france   
from germany and oft by chance 
the humble emerald isle. 

but my brown skin and close-curled hair 
was alien, and how it grew, none knew 
few tried to say, some dropped a wonderful word or stray 
some laughed and stared. 

and then it came i dreamed.   
i placed together all i knew 
all hints and slurs together drew.   
i dreamed. 

i made one picture of what nothing seemed   
i shuddered in dumb terror 
in silence screamed, 
for now it seemed this i had dreamed 

how up from hell, a land had leaped 
a wretched land, all scorched and seamed   
covered with ashes, chained with pain   
streaming with blood, in horror lain   
its very air a shriek of death 
and agony of hurt. 

anon i woke, but in one corner of my soul   
i stayed asleep. 
forget i could not, 
but never would i remember   
that hell-hoist ghost   
of slavery and woe. 

i lived and grew, i worked and hoped 
i planned and wandered, gripped and coped   
with every doubt but one that slept   
yet clamoured to awaken. 
i became old old, worn and gray   
along my hard and weary way 
rolled war and pestilence, war again   
i looked on poverty and foul disease   
i walked with death and yet i knew 
there stirred a doubt were all dreams true?   
and what in truth was africa? 

one cloud-swept day a seer appeared,   
all closed and veiled as me he hailed 
and bid me make three journeys to the world   
seeking all through their lengthened links   
the endless riddle of the sphinx. 

i went to moscow ignorance grown wise taught me wisdom 
i went to peking poverty grown rich 
showed me the wealth of work 
i came to accra. 

here at last, i looked back on my dream   
i heard the voice that loosed 
the long-looked dungeons of my soul 
i sensed that africa had come 
not up from hell, but from the sum of heaven's glory. 

i lifted up mine eyes to ghana 
and swept the hills with high hosanna 
above the sun my sight took flight   
till from that pinnacle of light 
i saw dropped down this earth of crimson, green and gold 
roaring with color, drums and song. 

happy with dreams and deeds worth more than doing   
around me velvet faces loomed   
burnt by the kiss of everlasting suns 
under great stars of midnight glory   
trees danced, and foliage sang 

the lilies hallelujah rang 
where robed with rule on golden stool   
the gold-crowned priests with duty done   
pour high libations to the sun 
and danced to gods. 

red blood flowed rare 'neath close-clung hair   
while subtle perfume filled the air   
and whirls and whirls of tiny curls   
crowned heads. 

yet ghana shows its might and power   
not in its color nor its flower   
but in its wondrous breadth of soul   
its joy of life 
its selfless role 
of giving. 
school and clinic, home and hall   
road and garden bloom and call   
socialism blossoms bold 
on communism centuries old. 

i lifted my last voice and cried   
i cried to heaven as i died 
o turn me to the golden horde   
summon all western nations   
toward the rising sun. 

from reeking west whose day is done,   
who stink and stagger in their dung   
toward africa, china, india's strand   
where kenya and himalaya stand   
and nile and yang-tze roll 
turn every yearning face of man. 

come with us, dark america 
the scum of europe battened here   
and drowned a dream 
made fetid swamp a refuge seem 

enslaved the black and killed the red   
and armed the rich to loot the dead   
worshipped the whores of hollywood   
where once the virgin mary stood 
and lynched the christ. 

awake, awake, o sleeping world   
honor the sun 

worship the stars, those vaster suns   
who rule the night 
where black is bright 
and all unselfish work is right   
and greed is sin. 

and africa leads on   
pan africa


spooky summer on the horizon i'm gazing at 
from my window into the streets 
that's where it's going to be where everyone is 
walking around, looking around out in the open 
suspecting each other's heart to open fire 
all over the streets 
                              like streets you read about every day 
who are the network we travel through on the way to the center   
which is energy filling life 
and bursting with joy all over the screen 
                                                             i can't sit still any longer 

i want to go where i'm not feeling so bad 
get off this little island before the bridges break   
my heart is a sore thing too 
no i want to sit in the middle watching movies   
then go to bed in my head 
someone is banging on it with a heavy stick like the enemy 
who is he going to be turns into a face you can't recognize 
then vanishes behind a window behind a gun   
like the lonely hero stalking the main street   
cries out where are you? i just want to know 
all the angles of death possible under the american sky 

i can hardly see for all the buildings polluting the sky   
until it changes into a barrage of bottles 
then clears up for a second while you breathe 
and you realize you'e still as alive as ever and want to be   
but would like to be somewhere else perhaps africa   
start all over again as the race gets darker and darker   
and the world goes on the way i always thought it would 
for the winner is someone we recognize out of our collective past   
which is turning over again in the grave 

                                    it is so important when one dies you replace her   
                                    and never waste a minute


awake in a giant night 
is where i am 
                   there is a river where my soul,   
hungry as a horse drinks beside me 

an hour of immense possibility flies by   
and i do nothing but sit in the present   
which keeps changing moment to moment 

how can i tell you my mind is a blanket? 

it is an amazing story you won't believe   
and a beautiful land 
where something is always doing in the barns   
especially in autumn 
                         sliding down the hayrick 

by march the sun is lingering and the land turns wet 

brooks grow loud 
the eddies fill with green scum   
crocuses lift their heads to say hello 

soon it is good to be planting 
by then the woods are overflowing 
with dogwood, redbud, hickory, red and white oaks,   
hazelnut bushes, violets, jacks-in-the-pulpit,   
skunk cabbages, pawpaws and may apples 
whose names thrill you because you can name them 

there are quail and rabbits too--but i go on too long 

like the animal, i must stop by the water's edge   
to have a drink and think things over 

 

that was good. the drink i mean 
i feel refreshed and ready for anything 
though i'm not in vermont or kentucky unfortunately   
but in new york city, the toughest place in the world 

and it's december 

here someone is always weeping, including me 
though i tend to cry in monster waves then turn into a fish   
wallowing in my own salty 
                         puddle look out 
if you aren't wearing boots you'll be sorry 
and soggy too 

 

this season's cruelty hurts me 
and others, i'm sure, who'd rather be elsewhere but can't   
because of their jobs, families, friends, money 
it's rough anyway you look at it 

but what can you do? 

it's worse elsewhere, i'm sure   

take vietnam 

no thanks 

i think about vietnam a lot, however   
and wonder if i'll ever see it   
the way i've seen europe, i mean 

those pretty dutch girls   
they all ride bicycles 

in venice you travel by boat or foot 

the metro and the underground register like the names   
in connection with them 

hugo, stephen, stuart, larry, lee, harry, david, maxine   

what does it all mean? 
i never ask that, being shy 

in this apartment in which i dwell these thoughts pass by   

i hope you won't mind the mess when you do too   

 

you just walk in up a flight and you're in paradise 

a cup of coffee, an easy chair, a loving person waiting for you   
who's washing the dishes, reading a book 

outside someone's worrying about love and not sitting down either 

he's probably freezing his ass off right now 
and other vital parts which would feel great in the country,   
taking a walk, a hike, shoveling snow 

though you can do that right here 

 

the hub of the universe is where i am in a night whose promise   
grows with me, unlike the snow melting in the gutter 

whatever i do, it is beside me 

i look out the window, there is night 
i sit in this lighted room knowing this night   
night night i wish you'd go so i could go 
to the post office, the bank, the supermarket 

why aren't they open at night? i wonder   
then realize i'm not the only person who's   
considered in the grand scope of daily living 

there are those fast asleep who want to be and would be horrified   
if the post office, the bank, and the supermarket 
were only open at night 
for you can't be all there all the time 
i myself am only here part of the time   
which is enough 
                  for there are other places to run to 

uptown, for example, where energy rushes you   
like some hideous but intriguing chemical 
you can't ignore 
and you want to absorb the wisdom these buildings have 

how do they feel so high up like that? 

pretty good, they seem to say in their absolute way   
but it's the people inside who turn us on 

by then you are gone off in a cab   
and you are not alone 

                        i am beside you 

the streets are familiar from just traveling through   
we rarely stop and when we do there's a reason 

which is too bad 
we miss a lot for this same reason 

 

they're probably feeding the chickens about this time   
the smell of chicken feed overwhelms me 
the rooster crows on a th street fire escape 
breakfast is ready 
                         there is a forest by the river near the barn   
where things are happening, 
a whole new world on the edge of dawn 

 

my little world goes on st. mark's place   

to be not tired, but elated, i sing this song 

i think of the beatles and the beach boys   
and the songs they sing 

it is a different thing to be behind the sound   
then leave it forever 
and it goes on without them, needing only you and me 

here i am, though you are asleep 

the morning of december rd dawns on me   
in the shape of a poem called giant night 

it must end before it is too late 

all over the world children will celebrate christmas 
and families will gather together to give and take this season 

other religions and customs will prevail in their own separate ways   
having nothing to do with christmas 

soldiers will cease fire 

some won't know the difference but might be able to sense it   
    in the air 

the smell of holly, pine, eggnog 
the friendly faces of santa and his elves 

all these will add up to something and be gone forever   

just like what is here one minute and not the next.


eviction people arrive to haunt me 
      with descriptions of summer's wildflowers   
            how they are carpet of fierce colors 

i bet you hate to see us they say and yes 
      i do hate to have to move again especially from here   
            destruction brought to place of love 

the uneven smiles that win she's a business woman   
      blond tints that glow at sunset as profits rise   
            alas what labor i employ 

but to ensure a moment's joy 
      sets branches trembling & arms chilled   
            dear one long returning home, come to 

clammy feverish details, muffed sorrow 
      i turn to throw a tear of rage in the pot 
            never remorse but hint of scruples i'd hope for 

it is error it is speculation it is real estate 
      it is the villain and comic slippery words 
            the work of despotic wills to make money 

i scream take it take your money make your money   
      go on it's only money, here's a wall of dry rot 
            here's an unfinished ceiling, just a little sunlight 

peeks through this lark, no luminance exquisite st. etienne   
      stove doesn't work icebox either too hot or frozen   
            firescreen tumbling down 

kitchen insulation droops is ugly & a mess 
      ah but love it here, only surface appearances   
            to complain of, nothing does justice 

to shape of actual events i love   
      but a fight against artificiality 
            its inherent antagonism, bald hatred of moving 

and problem of thirsty fig tree in burroughs 
      apartment wakes me i don't want to go down there yet   
            & how to orchestrate the summer properly 

the problem of distress & not denying pride from it   
      too atomized to make pleasure of melancholy 
            & an uncontrollable enthusiasm for throne & altar 

i want to sit high want simple phalanx 
      of power independent of everything but free will   
            & one long hymn in praise of the cabin 

it is a confession in me impenetrably walled in   
      like aesthetics like cosmos an organ of 
            metaphysics and o this book gives me a headache 

dear weston la barre let's have an argument   
      because i see too clearly how rational i must be &   
            the kernel of my faith corrupted 

because you have no reliance on the shaman & outlaw   
      or how depth of mind might be staggering   
            everywhere except in how important science is 

science? no he won't he fooled by visions 
      whereas i wait for dazzling ufos they announce   
            will arrive high in these mountains 

i repair the portal even invite stray horses in   
      have a little toy receiving station   
            that sits by the bed 

at the edge of night all thoughts to place of love   
      all worries to this place of love   
            all gestures to the place of love 

all agonies to place of love, thaws to place   
      of love, swarthy valley sealed   
            in wood, log burst into flame 

in home of love, all heart's dints   
      and machinations, all bellows & pungency   
            antemundane thoughts to palace of love 

all liberties, singularity, all imaginings 
      i weep for, jack's sweet almond-eyed daughter to   
            place of love, & heavy blankets 

and terracing & yard work & patch work   
      & tenacity & the best in you 
            surround me work in me to place my love 

dear cirques, clear constraint, dissenting 
      inclinations of a man and a woman, metonic cycle   
            all that sweats in rooms, lives in nature 

requiems & momentum & trimmings of bushes   
      dried hibiscus & hawks & shyness   
            brought to this place of love 

trees rooted fear rooted all roots brought 
      to place of love, mystery to heart of love   
            & fibers 

and fibers in sphere of love a whole world makes   
      spectators of slow flowering of spring 
            & summer when you walk to town for eggs 

and continuous hammerings as new people   
      arrive & today we notice for first time 
            a white-crowned sparrow out by the feeder 

with the chickadees & juncos & i missed   
      that airplane-dinosaur in dream nervous   
            to travel again, miss buds pop open 

to shudder in breeze, their tractability   
      makes sudden rise of sensibility you are   
            shuddering too & your boy laugh 

comes less frequent now you're drawn into   
      accountability, will i return to find all   
            stuff tidy in silver truck 

ready to go? it's you in this place i lose   
      most because it's here in you i forget 
            where i am, this place for supernaturals 

perched high in sky & wind, held by wind in stationary   
      motion as bluebird we observe over meadow or caught   
            up with jetstream dipping in valley's soft cradle 

power & light & heat & radiance of head it takes 
      power & light & heat & radiance of head it takes to   
            make it work while 

down there someone building replicas of what 
      it feels like to be a human multitude, fantasy   
            molded clumsily, spare my loves 

and love of glorious architecture when you really put   
      outside in, the feeling of cloud or mountain   
            or stone 

having developed an idea of idyllic private life   
      & sovereignty of spirit over common   
            empirical demand 

i tell you about renunciation, i tell you holy   
      isolation like a river nears ocean to   
            dissolve 

and cabin becomes someone's idea of a good place   
      discretion you pay for it wasn't mine either   
            but sits on me imprints on me 

forever splendor of fog, snow shut strangers out   
      gradual turn of season, ground stir, pine 
            needle tickle your shoulder, peak curve, fresh air.


i wore a garland of the briar that put me now in awe   

i wore a garland of the brain that was whole   

it commanded me, done babbling 

and i no more blabbed, spare no lie 

tell womanhood she shake off pity 

tell the man to give up tumult for the while   

to wonder at the sight of baby's beauty 

ne let the monsters fray us with things that not be   

from a high tower poem issuing 

everything run along in creation till i end the song   

ne none fit for so wild beasts 

ne none so joyous, ne none no give no lie 

tell old woes to leave off here 

i sing this into a scallop shell with face of a pearl   

& leave all sorrow bye & bye. 



i am putting makeup on empty space 
all patinas convening on empty space 
rouge blushing on empty space 
i am putting makeup on empty space 
pasting eyelashes on empty space 
painting the eyebrows of empty space 
piling creams on empty space 
painting the phenomenal world 
i am hanging ornaments on empty space 
gold clips, lacquer combs, plastic hairpins on empty space   
i am sticking wire pins into empty space 
i pour words over empty space, enthrall the empty space   
packing, stuffing jamming empty space 
spinning necklaces around empty space 
fancy this, imagine this painting the phenomenal world   
bangles on wrists 
pendants hung on empty space 
i am putting my memory into empty space 
undressing you 
hanging the wrinkled clothes on a nail 
hanging the green coat on a nail 
dancing in the evening it ended with dancing in the evening   
i am still thinking about putting makeup on empty space   
i want to scare you the hanging night, the drifting night, 
the moaning night, daughter of troubled sleep i want to scare you   
you 
i bind as far as cold day goes 
i bind the power of  husky men 
i bind the seductive colorful women, all of them   
i bind the massive rock 
i bind the hanging night, the drifting night, the   
moaning night, daughter of troubled sleep 
i am binding my debts, i magnetize the phone bill   
bind the root of my pointed tongue 
i cup my hands in water, splash water on empty space   
water drunk by empty space 
look what thoughts will do   look what words will do   
from nothing to the face 
from nothing to the root of the tongue 
from nothing to speaking of empty space   
i bind the ash tree 
i bind the yew 
i bind the willow 
i bind uranium 
i bind the uneconomical unrenewable energy of uranium   
dash uranium to empty space 
i bind the color red i seduce the color red to empty space   
i put the sunset in empty space 
i take the blue of his eyes and make an offering to empty space   
renewable blue 
i take the green of everything coming to life, it grows &   
climbs into empty space 
i put the white of the snow at the foot of empty space   
i clasp the yellow of the cat's eyes sitting in the   
black space i clasp them to my heart, empty space 
i want the brown of this floor to rise up into empty space   
take the floor apart to find the brown, 
bind it up again under spell of empty space 
i want to take this old wall apart i am rich in my mind thinking   
of this, i am thinking of putting makeup on empty space   
everything crumbles around empty space 
the thin dry weed crumbles, the milkweed is blown into empty space   
i bind the stars reflected in your eye 
from nothing to these typing fingers 
from nothing to the legs of the elk 
from nothing to the neck of the deer 
from nothing to porcelain teeth 
from nothing to the fine stand of pine in the forest   
i kept it going when i put the water on 
when i let the water run 
sweeping together in empty space 
there is a better way to say empty space 
turn yourself inside out and you might disappear   
you have a new definition in empty space 
what i like about impermanence is the clash   
of my big body with empty space 
i am putting the floor back together again   
i am rebuilding the wall 
i am slapping mortar on bricks 
i am fastening the machine together with delicate wire 
there is no eternal thread, maybe there is thread of pure gold 
i am starting to sing inside about the empty space 
there is some new detail every time 
i am taping the picture i love so well on the wall 
moonless black night beyond country-plaid curtains 
everything illuminated out of empty space 
i hang the black linen dress on my body 
the hanging night, the drifting night, the moaning night 
daughter of troubled sleep 
this occurs to me 
i hang up a mirror to catch stars, everything occurs to me out in the   
night in my skull of empty space 
i go outside in starry ice 
i build up the house again in memory of empty space 
this occurs to me about empty space   
that it is nevered to be mentioned again   
fancy this 
imagine this 
painting the phenomenal world 
there's talk of dressing the body with strange adornments 
to remind you of a vow to empty space 
there's talk of the discourse in your mind like a silkworm 
i wish to venture into a not-chiseled place 
i pour sand on the ground 
objects and vehicles emerge from the fog 
the canyon is dangerous tonight   
suddenly there are warning lights 
the patrol is helpful in the manner of guiding 
there is talk of slowing down   
there is talk of a feminine deity   
i bind her with a briar 
i bind with the tooth of a tiger   
i bind with my quartz crystal   
i magnetize the worlds 
i cover myself with jewels 
i drink amrita 
there is some new detail 
there is a spangle on her shoe   
there is a stud on her boot 
the tires are studded for the difficult climb 
i put my hands to my face 
i am putting makeup on empty space 
i wanted to scare you with the night that scared me 
the drifting night, the moaning night 
someone was always intruding to make you forget empty space   
you put it all on 
you paint your nails 
you put on scarves 
all the time adorning empty space 
whatever-your-name-is i tell you empty space 
with your fictions with dancing come around to it 
with your funny way of singing come around to it 
with your smiling come to it 
with your enormous retinue & accumulation come around to it   
with your extras come round to it 
with your good fortune, with your lazy fortune come round to it   
when you look most like a bird, that is the time to come around to it   
when you are cheating, come to it 
when you are in your anguished head 
when you are not sensible 
when you are insisting on the 
praise from many tongues 
it begins with the root of the tongue 
it begins with the root of the heart 
there is a spinal cord of wind 
singing & moaning in empty space 



that all these dyings may be life in death
i was living in san francisco   
my heart was in manhattan 
it made no sense, no reference point   
hearing the sad horns at night,   
fragile evocations of female stuff   
the  tones the last most resonant 
were like warnings, haiku-muezzins at dawn 
the call came in the afternoon   
frank, is that really you? 

i'd awake chilled at dawn 
in the wooden house like an old ship   
stay bundled through the day 
sitting on the stoop to catch the sun 
i lived near the park whose deep green   
over my shoulder made life cooler   
was my spirit faltering, grown duller? 
i want to be free of poetry's ornaments,   
its duty, free of constant irritation,   
me in it, what was grander reason   
for being? do it, why? why, frank?   
to make the energies dance etc. 

my coat a cape of horrors 
i'd walk through town or 
impending earthquake. was that it?   
ominous days. street shiny with   
hallucinatory light on sad dogs, 
too many religious people, or a woman   
startled me by her look of indecision   
near the empty stadium 
i walked back spooked by 
my own darkness 
then frank called to say 
what? not done complaining yet?   
can't you smell the eucalyptus, 
have you never neared the pacific?   
while frank and freecall for 
musick while your veins swell'   
he sang, quoting a metaphysician   
don't you know the secret, how to   
wake up and see you don't exist, but   
that does, don't you see phenomena   
is so much more important than this?   
i always love that. 
always? i cried, wanting to believe him   
yes. but say more how can you if   
it's sad & dead? but that's just it   
if it isn't. it doesn't want to be 
do you want to be? he was warming to his song   
of course i don't have to put up with as   
much as you do these days. these years.   
but i do miss the color, the architecture,   
the talk. you know, it was the life   
and dying is such an insult. after all   
i was in love with breath and i loved   
embracing those others, the lovers,   
with my body. he sighed & laughed   
he wasn't quite as i'd remembered him   
not less generous, but more abstract   
did he even have a voice now, i wondered   
or did i think it up in the middle   
of this long day, phone in hand now   
dialing manhattan


art begins with a lie 
      the separation is you plus me plus what we make   
            look into lightbulb, blink, sun's in your eye 

i want a rare sky 
      vantage point free from misconception   
            art begins with a lie 

nothing to lose, spontaneous rise   
      of reflection, paint the picture 
            of a lightbulb, or eye the sun 

how to fuel the world, then die   
      distance yourself from artfulness   
            how? art begins with a lie 

the audience wants to cry 
      when the actors are real & passionate 
            look into footlight, then feed back to eye 

you fluctuate in an artful body 
      you try to imitate the world's glory 
            art begins with a lie 
                  that's the story, sharp speck in the eye.


i turned quivering yellow stars in blackness   
i wept how speech may save a woman 
the picture changes & promises the heroine   
that nighttime & meditation are a mirage 

to discuss pro & contra here is mute 
do i not love you, day? 
a pure output of teleological intentions 
& she babbles, developing a picture-theory of language 

do i not play the delicate game of language?   
yes, & it is antecedent to the affairs of the world   
the dish, the mop, the stove, the bed, the marriage   
& surges forth the world in which i love 

i and i and i and i and i and i, infinitely reversible   
yet never secure in the long morning texture 
a poor existing woman-being, accept her broken heart   
& yet the earth is divinity, the sky is divinity 
the nomads walk & walk. 



after the clash of elevator gates 
and the long sinking, she emerges where, 
a slight thing in the morning's crosstown glare,   
she looks up toward the window where he waits,   
then in a fleeting taxi joins the rest 
of the huge traffic bound forever west. 

on such grand scale do lovers say good-bye-- 
even this other pair whose high romance   
had only the duration of a dance, 
and who, now taking leave with stricken eye,   
see each in each a whole new life forgone. 
for them, above the darkling clubhouse lawn, 

bright perseids flash and crumble while for these   
who part now on the dock, weighed down by grief   
and baggage, yet with something like relief,   
it takes three thousand miles of knitting seas   
to cancel out their crossing, and unmake 
the amorous rough and tumble of their wake. 

we are denied, my love, their fine tristesse   
and bittersweet regrets, and cannot share   
the frequent vistas of their large despair,   
where love and all are swept to nothingness   
still, there's a certain scope in that long love   
which constant spirits are the keepers of, 

and which, though taken to be tame and staid,   
is a wild sostenuto of the heart, 
a passion joined to courtesy and art 
which has the quality of something made,   
like a good fiddle, like the rose's scent, 
like a rose window or the firmament.


when you come, as you soon must, to the streets of our city,   
mad-eyed from stating the obvious, 
not proclaiming our fall but begging us 
in god's name to have self-pity, 

spare us all word of the weapons, their force and range,   
the long numbers that rocket the mind 
our slow, unreckoning hearts will be left behind,   
unable to fear what is too strange. 

nor shall you scare us with talk of the death of the race.   
how should we dream of this place without us?-- 
the sun mere fire, the leaves untroubled about us,   
a stone look on the stone's face? 

speak of the world's own change. though we cannot conceive   
of an undreamt thing, we know to our cost 
how the dreamt cloud crumbles, the vines are blackened by frost,   
how the view alters. we could believe, 

if you told us so, that the white-tailed deer will slip   
into perfect shade, grown perfectly shy, 
the lark avoid the reaches of our eye, 
the jack-pine lose its knuckled grip 

on the cold ledge, and every torrent burn 
as xanthus once, its gliding trout 
stunned in a twinkling. what should we be without   
the dolphin's arc, the dove's return, 

these things in which we have seen ourselves and spoken?   
ask us, prophet, how we shall call 
our natures forth when that live tongue is all 
dispelled, that glass obscured or broken 

in which we have said the rose of our love and the clean   
horse of our courage, in which beheld 
the singing locust of the soul unshelled, 
and all we mean or wish to mean. 

ask us, ask us whether with the worldless rose   
our hearts shall fail us come demanding   
whether there shall be lofty or long standing   
when the bronze annals of the oak-tree close.


the eyes open to a cry of pulleys, 
and spirited from sleep, the astounded soul   
hangs for a moment bodiless and simple   
as false dawn. 
                     outside the open window   
the morning air is all awash with angels. 

    some are in bed-sheets, some are in blouses,   
some are in smocks but truly there they are.   
now they are rising together in calm swells   
of halcyon feeling, filling whatever they wear   
with the deep joy of their impersonal breathing 

    now they are flying in place, conveying 
the terrible speed of their omnipresence, moving   
and staying like white water and now of a sudden   
they swoon down into so rapt a quiet 
that nobody seems to be there. 
                                             the soul shrinks 

    from all that it is about to remember, 
from the punctual rape of every blessd day, 
and cries, 
               oh, let there be nothing on earth but laundry,   
nothing but rosy hands in the rising steam 
and clear dances done in the sight of heaven. 

    yet, as the sun acknowledges 
with a warm look the world's hunks and colors,   
the soul descends once more in bitter love   
to accept the waking body, saying now 
in a changed voice as the man yawns and rises,   
    bring them down from their ruddy gallows 
let there be clean linen for the backs of thieves   
let lovers go fresh and sweet to be undone,   
and the heaviest nuns walk in a pure floating   
of dark habits, 
                      keeping their difficult balance.


after the last bulletins the windows darken   
and the whole city founders readily and deep,   
sliding on all its pillows 
to the thronged atlantis of personal sleep, 

and the wind rises. the wind rises and bowls   
the day's litter of news in the alleys. trash   
tears itself on the railings, 
soars and falls with a soft crash, 

tumbles and soars again. unruly flights   
scamper the park, and taking a statue for dead   
strike at the positive eyes, 
batter and flap the stolid head 

and scratch the noble name. in empty lots   
our journals spiral in a fierce noyade   
of all we thought to think, 
or caught in corners cramp and wad 

and twist our words. and some from gutters flail   
their tatters at the tired patrolman's feet, 
like all that fisted snow 
that cried beside his long retreat 

damn you damn you to the emperor's horse's heels.   
oh none too soon through the air white and dry   
will the clear announcer's voice 
beat like a dove, and you and i 

from the heart's anarch and responsible town   
return by subway-mouth to life again,   
bearing the morning papers, 
and cross the park where saintlike men, 

white and absorbed, with stick and bag remove   
the litter of the night, and footsteps rouse   
with confident morning sound 
the songbirds in the public boughs.


i. 

five soldiers fixed by mathew brady's eye   
stand in a land subdued beyond belief.   
belief might lend them life again. i try 
like orphaned hamlet working up his grief 

to see my spellbound fathers in these men   
who, breathless in their amber atmosphere,   
show but the postures men affected then   
and the hermit faces of a finished year. 

the guns and gear and all are strange until   
beyond the tents i glimpse a file of trees   
verging a road that struggles up a hill.   
they're sycamores. 
                            the long-abated breeze 

flares in those boughs i know, and hauls the sound   
of guns and a great forest in distress. 
fathers, i know my cause, and we are bound   
beyond that hill to fight at wilderness. 


             ii. 

but trick your eyes with birnam wood, or think   
how fire-cast shadows of the bankside trees   
rode on the back of simois to sink 
in the wide waters. reflect how history's 

changes are like the sea's, which mauls and mulls   
its salvage of the world in shifty waves, 
shrouding in evergreen the oldest hulls 
and yielding views of its confounded graves 

to the new moon, the sun, or any eye   
that in its shallow shoreward version sees 
the pebbles charging with a deathless cry   
and carageen memorials of trees. 

             iii. 

now, old man of the sea,   
i start to understand 
the will will find no stillness 
back in a stilled land. 

the dead give no command   
and shall not find their voice   
till they be mustered by   
some present fatal choice. 

let me now rejoice 
in all impostures, take 
the shape of lion or leopard, 
boar, or watery snake, 

or like the comber break,   
yet in the end stand fast   
and by some fervent fraud   
father the waiting past, 

resembling at the last 
the self-established tree 
that draws all waters toward   
its live formality.


for dore and adja
under the bronze crown 
too big for the head of the stone cherub whose feet   
      a serpent has begun to eat, 
sweet water brims a cockle and braids down 

            past spattered mosses, breaks 
on the tipped edge of a second shell, and fills   
      the massive third below. it spills 
in threads then from the scalloped rim, and makes 

            a scrim or summery tent 
for a faun-mnage and their familiar goose.   
      happy in all that ragged, loose 
collapse of water, its effortless descent 

            and flatteries of spray, 
the stocky god upholds the shell with ease, 
      watching, about his shaggy knees, 
the goatish innocence of his babes at play 

            his fauness all the while 
leans forward, slightly, into a clambering mesh   
      of water-lights, her sparkling flesh 
in a saecular ecstasy, her blinded smile 

            bent on the sand floor 
of the trefoil pool, where ripple-shadows come 
      and go in swift reticulum, 
more addling to the eye than wine, and more 

            interminable to thought 
than pleasure's calculus. yet since this all   
      is pleasure, flash, and waterfall,   
must it not be too simple? are we not 

            more intricately expressed 
in the plain fountains that maderna set 
      before st. peter's--the main jet   
struggling aloft until it seems at rest 

            in the act of rising, until   
the very wish of water is reversed, 
      that heaviness borne up to burst   
in a clear, high, cavorting head, to fill 

            with blaze, and then in gauze   
delays, in a gnatlike shimmering, in a fine 
      illumined version of itself, decline, 
and patter on the stones its own applause? 

            if that is what men are 
or should be, if those water-saints display   
      the pattern of our aret, 
what of these showered fauns in their bizarre, 

            spangled, and plunging house? 
they are at rest in fulness of desire 
      for what is given, they do not tire 
of the smart of the sun, the pleasant water-douse 

            and riddled pool below, 
reproving our disgust and our ennui   
      with humble insatiety. 
francis, perhaps, who lay in sister snow 

            before the wealthy gate 
freezing and praising, might have seen in this   
      no trifle, but a shade of bliss-- 
that land of tolerable flowers, that state 

            as near and far as grass 
where eyes become the sunlight, and the hand   
      is worthy of water the dreamt land 
toward which all hungers leap, all pleasures pass.


now winter downs the dying of the year,   
and night is all a settlement of snow 
from the soft street the rooms of houses show   
a gathered light, a shapen atmosphere,   
like frozen-over lakes whose ice is thin   
and still allows some stirring down within. 

i've known the wind by water banks to shake 
the late leaves down, which frozen where they fell   
and held in ice as dancers in a spell   
fluttered all winter long into a lake   
graved on the dark in gestures of descent,   
they seemed their own most perfect monument. 

there was perfection in the death of ferns   
which laid their fragile cheeks against the stone   
a million years. great mammoths overthrown   
composedly have made their long sojourns,   
like palaces of patience, in the gray 
and changeless lands of ice. and at pompeii 

the little dog lay curled and did not rise   
but slept the deeper as the ashes rose 
and found the people incomplete, and froze   
the random hands, the loose unready eyes   
of men expecting yet another sun 
to do the shapely thing they had not done. 

these sudden ends of time must give us pause.   
we fray into the future, rarely wrought 
save in the tapestries of afterthought. 
more time, more time. barrages of applause   
come muffled from a buried radio. 
the new-year bells are wrangling with the snow.


still, citizen sparrow, this vulture which you call   
unnatural, let him but lumber again to air   
over the rotten office, let him bear 
the carrion ballast up, and at the tall 

tip of the sky lie cruising. then you'll see 
that no more beautiful bird is in heaven's height,   
no wider more placid wings, no watchfuller flight   
he shoulders nature there, the frightfully free, 

the naked-headed one. pardon him, you   
who dart in the orchard aisles, for it is he   
devours death, mocks mutability, 
has heart to make an end, keeps nature new. 

thinking of noah, childheart, try to forget   
how for so many bedlam hours his saw   
soured the song of birds with its wheezy gnaw,   
and the slam of his hammer all the day beset 

the people's ears. forget that he could bear   
to see the towns like coral under the keel, 
and the fields so dismal deep. try rather to feel   
how high and weary it was, on the waters where 

he rocked his only world, and everyone's.   
forgive the hero, you who would have died   
gladly with all you knew he rode that tide   
to ararat all men are noah's sons.


one wading a fall meadow finds on all sides   
the queen anne's lace lying like lilies 
on water it glides 
so from the walker, it turns 
dry grass to a lake, as the slightest shade of you   
valleys my mind in fabulous blue lucernes. 

the beautiful changes as a forest is changed   
by a chameleon's tuning his skin to it   
as a mantis, arranged 
on a green leaf, grows 
into it, makes the leaf leafier, and proves   
any greenness is deeper than anyone knows. 

your hands hold roses always in a way that says   
they are not only yours the beautiful changes   
in such kind ways,   
wishing ever to sunder 
things and things' selves for a second finding, to lose   
for a moment all that it touches back to wonder.


lord egremont speaks
it was a way of punishing the house, setting it ablaze 
in ruddy, golden flames smoke 
in billows up the front stairs walls 
cringing like leaves.   
i say, i am afraid 
in my own house. do not believe 
i started this, it was 
that man, who was to portray the park alone, mind you, 
but then became 
enamored of the music room. 
and now what have we floods 
of fire rolling from room to room, furniture wrecked 
in seethe, my wife   
lady amelia turned 
wraith, god knows what fish 
and drowning slaves cast up in the tide 
along with pocket bibles, snuffboxes, antimacassars, the   
familiar bric-a-brac of the well-kept house. 
where are edward, lavinia, jane? why 
is no one crying, fire fire? am i 
alone? 
         the man has no sense of proportion. 
he had himself lashed to the mast, once, it is said, 
on a steamboat off the harbor mouth 
in full blizzard sailors blinded by snow, the boat 
crippled, led by the lead, they damn near died to a man, and he-- 
he was observing the light at sea, he said. 
the painting? soapsuds and whitewash,   
the critics described it so. 

but here, in our house, it is catastrophe   
of flame, not weather, he loosed. 
he is a man 
in love with last things, clearly, 
the last things, but 
never understood the first, it seems to me,   
and certainly not the genial medias res 
of decorous, daily life. 
what tea-times we've known in these chambers, what sonatinas, 
lieder of an evening, whist, 
emmeline embroidering, the hounds calm at the hearth, now all 
dissolved. 
               perhaps there are no flames.   
a bloody haze arises, it could be 
my own eyes that fail. 
i hear nothing, but fear 
the upstairs rooms, cramped rooms 
i have not entered in ages, only remember 
the draughts, creakings, grime in closet corners,   
windows too tight to lean from, the smell   
of antique damp. and now, who knows   
what acts unroll 
on narrow beds, on floorboards warped askew? 
as steam is rising, rising? as heat 
buoys the house up into an atmosphere   
all of its own creation? 
who are 
the participants? where has amelia gone?   
why, in this furnace, can i hear no sound,   
or feel my own skin begin to peel?


i. 

when his dogs leapt on actaeon, he   
cried did he cry out?--he flung 

his arm to command, they tore his hand   
from the wrist stump, tore 

guts from his belly through the tunic, ripped   
the cry from his throat. 

that's how we know a god, when the facts   
leap at the tenderest innards, and we know 

the god is what we can't change. you 
stood over me as i woke, i opened my eyes, i saw 

that i'd seen and that it was too   
late the seeing 

of you in the doorway with weak electric light 
fanning behind you in the hall, and my room and narrow pallet steeped in shadow 

were what i couldn't change, and distantly   
i wanted you, and, as distantly, 

i heard the dogs, baying. 


    ii. 

and yet the fountain spends itself, and it is   
in the clear 

light of its losing that we seem   
to take delight 

you dipped your hand in its running braid   
to sprinkle my forehead, my lips. 

garden deities observed us three nymphs 
with moss staining their haunches, a pug-nosed faun. 

the wound in water closed 
perfectly around your gesture, erasing it, 

so that only the glimmer, swiftly   
drying, on my face recalled 

our interruption 
of the faultless, cold, passionate, perpetual 

idea of the stream's descent-- 
which, unlike ours, would always be renewed. 


    iii. 

i kissed a flame, what did i expect. 

those days, you painted in fire. tangerine, gold   
one would have had to be a pilgrim to walk   
through that wall of molten glass. 

and purification 
could be conceived, if not   
attained, only after many years, 

in autumn, in a fire greater than yours, 
though menstrual blood still tinged the threshold 
and our ex-votos were sordid--scraps of blistered flesh 

taped to kitsch prayer cards--and neither of us knew   
the object of this exercise, except   
having, inadvertently, each of us, burned 

we recognized the smell 
of wood smoke, the slow swirl 
flakes of wood ash make in heavy air 

and we were ready, each in a private way, to make   
the gifts the season required.   
mine was the scene 

of my young self in your arms, 
eyes in your eyes, clutched in the effort 
to give each other away--when i glimpsed 

behind your pleasure, fear behind   
fear, anger and knew   
in a bolt some gifts 

conceal a greater gift. 
i have kept it. now i am ready to give it back   
into darker flame 

in this season of goldenrod, the ardent weed,   
and queen anne's lace in its mantilla of ash.   
and yet, how lumpishly, how stupidly i stand. 

how much that is human will never burn. 


    iv. 

and if you should answer? 
i listened, years before i knew you, to the whine 
of wind through the high stony pastures above my childhood village 

i breathed lavender and thyme and burned my bare legs   
on nettles, scraped them on thistles, and rubbed   
the sore skin till it reddened all the more. when we 

walked the uplands together, you burned your hand 
and i kissed the crimsoning nettle-rash. we are the lords of need, 
you said hafiz said, 

and i believed you, and we were. 
in the rugs of your country, carmine is crushed   
from insects, cochineal saffron gold 

is boiled from crocus stamens and indigo 
of heaven and fountain pools is soaked, hours upon hours,   
from indigo leaves. like the angel harut, 

you said, we are in the calamity of love-desire. 
the angel is chained by neck and knees, head down, in the pit of babel 
for falling in love. your carpets 

told a different story scarlet and saffron   
blush as in paradise, and god reveals himself 
in wine, flame, tulips, and the light in a mortal eye. 

all night you held me, sleepless, on my childhood cot in the stone house 
all night the wind seethed through crags and twisted olive trees,   
high on the scents of thyme and goat droppings. all night, 

hafiz sang, i hope the breeze of dawn will cherish the lovers.   
but the breeze of dawn is the angel of death.   
you are in your far landscape now, i am in mine 

the wind complains and i can't understand the words.   
and if you should answer?   
you, ten years away, in a different wind. 

we are in the calamity, hafiz sang. but tell the tale   
of the minstrel and of wine, and leave time alone. time   
is a mystery no skill will solve. we should 

thread words like pearls, you said, and the grateful sky   
would scatter the pleiades upon us   
though we couldn't see, and that was long ago. 


    v. 

the carpet is not a story. it is a place,   
garden of crisscrossed pathways, labyrinth,   
fountain, pool, and stream. 

as though the fabric had ripped at the vanishing point   
at the top of the street 
of ashen faades and slate-sloped roofs, you stepped 

through the gap, out of your own world.   
i had already lost my world.   
we met in a torn design 

which we tore further, pulling the tall warp, 
thread wrapped tightly around our fingers until it bit the flesh   
and the rue de lille unravelled. 

i know about design it's my job, 
arranging other people's letters in star charts 
that phosphoresce in the dark between the closed covers of books. 

you knew about design from the holes   
blown through your country. 
we spoke in a language of no country on earth. 

you moved slowly, in shadow, teaching the shadows   
to echo my name. you ripped my shirt at the neck.   
was it the beloved i held, holding you? 

down the middle of the carpet the river 
weaves a thousand gray glimmers into the deeper green.   
the river knows about mourning that's its job. 

how many years has it practiced? with such fleet fingers. a man   
woke me at dawn this morning, sobbing and cursing in the street,   
reeling from sidewalk to gutter and back again. 

on my long gray street, the rue de lille, where i still live.


in the still morning when you move   
toward me in sleep for love,   
i dream of 

an island where long-stemmed cranes,   
serious weather vanes,   
turn slowly on one 

foot. there the dragonfly folds   
his mica wings and rides   
the tall reed 

close as a handle. the hippo yawns,   
nods to thick pythons, 
slack and drowsy, who droop down 

like untied sashes 
from the trees. the brash   
hyenas do not cackle 

and run but lie with their paws   
on their heads like dogs.   
the lazy crow's caw 

falls like a sigh. in the field   
below, the fat moles build   
their dull passage with an old 

instinct that needs 
no light or waking its slow beat   
turns the hand in sleep 

as we turn toward each other   
in the ripe air of summer,   
before the change of weather, 

before the heavy drop   
of the apples.


the bone-man lives in a stucco   
house. he ticks his heels 

on the cold terrazzo floor.   
he parks his ragtruck 

in the yard, instructs his crew   
on the white telephone. 

i am training my dog 
to attack the red-capped hunter 

bearing his long package. 
i am training the tethered jay 

to cry out against 
the killer who cracks the latch. 

on the open map, the road 
to my house bulges like a vein. 

he takes a train, he rents   
a car, he lurches in 

with an open fly. sweet eve   
was just the farmer's daughter, 

he wooed her with a wormy apple.   
he's a dirty joke, he's 

always everybody's last   
lover, he's a regular 

can of worms--you wry medusa, 
i am a mongoose staring you down.


in the bavarian steeple, on the hour, 
two figures emerge from their scalloped house   
carrying sledges that they clap, in turn,   
against the surface of the bell. by legend   
they are summer and winter, youth and age,   
as though the forces of plenty and of loss   
played equally on the human soul, extracted   
easily the same low bronze note spreading   
upward from the encumbrance of the village,   
past alluvial fields to the pocked highland   
where cattle shift their massive heads   
at this dissonance, this faint redundant   
pressure in the ears, in the air. 

from the village, the mountain seems 
a single stone, a single blank completion.   
seeing the summit pierce the abstract heavens,   
we reconstruct the valley on the mountain-- 
a shepherd propped against his crook, birds   
enthralled on a branch, the branch feathering   
the edge of the canvas--transposing   
such forms as can extend the flawed earth   
and embody us, intact, unaltering, among   
the soft surprising trees of childhood, 
mimosa, honey locust and willow. 

wood in the midst of woods, the village   
houses are allied in a formal shape   
beside a stream, the streets concluding 
at the monument. again the ravishing moment   
of the bell the townspeople, curious 
or accustomed, stop to count the strokes,   
odd or even--the confectioner counting out   
the lavendar candies for his customer, 
the butcher, the greengrocer, the surgeon   
and the constable--as the housewife 
stands on the stoop, shaking her mop, 
and sees the dust briefly veil the air, 
an algebra of swirling particles.


up there on the mountain road, the fireworks 
blistered and subsided, for once at eye level 
spatter of light like water flicked from the fingers 
the brief emergent pattern and after the afterimage bled   
from the night sky, a delayed and muffled thud   
that must have seemed enormous down below, 
the sound concomitant with the arranged 
threat of fire above the bleachers. 
i stood as tall and straight as possible, 
trying to compensate, trying not to lean in my friend's   
direction. beside me, correcting height, he slouched   
his shoulders, knees locked, one leg stuck out 
to form a defensive angle with the other. 
thus we were most approximate 
and most removed. 
                         in the long pauses 
between explosions, he'd signal conversation   
by nodding vaguely toward the ragged pines.   
i said my children would have loved the show. 
he said we were watching youth at a great distance,   
and i thought how the young 
are truly boring, unvaried as they are 
by the deep scar of doubt, the constant afterimage 
of regret--no major tension in their bodies, no tender   
hesitation, they don't yet know 
that this is so much work, scraping 
from the self its multiple desires don't yet know   
fatigue with self, the hunger for obliteration 
that wakes us in the night at the dead hour 
and fuels good sex. 

                            of course i didn't say it. 
i realized he watched the fireworks 
with the cool attention he had turned on women   
dancing in the bar, a blunt uninvested gaze   
calibrating every moving part, thighs,   
breasts, the muscles of abandon. 
i had wanted that gaze on me. 
and as the evening dwindled to its nub, 
its puddle of tallow, appetite without object,   
as the men peeled off to seek 
the least encumbered consolation 
and the women grew expansive with regard-- 
how have i managed so long to stand among the paired   
bodies, the raw pulsing music driving   
loneliness into the air like scent, 
and not be seized by longing, 
not give anything to be summoned 
into the larger soul two souls can make?   
watching the fireworks with my friend,   
so little ease between us, 
i see that i have armed myself 
fire changes everything it touches. 

perhaps he has foreseen this impediment.   
perhaps when he holds himself within himself,   
a sheathed angular figure at my shoulder,   
he means to be protective less of him 
than me, keeping his complicating rage   
inside his body. and what would it solve   
if he took one hand from his pocket, 
risking touch, risking invitation-- 
if he took my hand it would not alter   
this explicit sadness. 
                                 the evening stalls, 
the fireworks grow boring at this remove. 
the traffic prowling the highway at our backs,   
the couples, the families scuffling on the bank   
must think us strangers to each other. or, 
more likely, with the celebrated fireworks thrusting   
their brilliant repeating designs above the ridge,   
we simply blur into the foreground,   
like the fireflies dragging among the trees   
their separate, discontinuous lanterns.


like words put to a song, the bunched tobacco leaves   
are strung along a stick, the women 
standing in the august heat for hours--since first light-- 
under the pitched tin roof, barefoot, and at their feet   
the babies, bare-assed, dirty, eating dirt. 
the older children hand the leaves from the slide,   
three leaves at a time, stalks upright, three handers 
for each stringer, and three more heaped canvas slides   
waiting in what little shade there is it's ten o'clock,   
almost dinnertime. they pull the pails of cold lunch   
and mason jars of tea out of the spring 
when they see the farmer coming from the field, their men   
stripped to the waist, polished by sweat and tired as mules.   
by afternoon, the loose cotton dresses, even   
the headrags are dark with sweat. 
still their fingers never miss a stitch, 
though they're paid not by the stick but by the day, 
and the talk--unbroken news of cousins and acquaintances-- 
unwinding with the ball of twine, a frayed snuff-twig   
bouncing on one lip, the string paying out 
through their calluses, the piles of wide green leaves   
diminishing, until the men appear with the last slide   
and clamber up the rafters of the barn 
to line the loaded sticks along the tiers. it's friday 

the farmer pays with a wad of ones and fives,   
having turned the mule out to its feed and water,   
hung up the stiffened traces and the bit. he checks   
again the other barns, already fired, crude ovens   
of log and mud where the crop is cured 
in that hot dry acrid air, spreads a yellowing leaf   
across his palm, rolls an edge in his fingers,   
gauging by its texture and its smell 
how high to drive the fire. 
his crew is quiet in the pickup truck--did you think 
they were singing? they are much too tired to even speak,   
can barely lick salt from the back of a hand, brush at flies,   
hush a baby with a sugartit. and the man 
who owns this land is also tired. 
everyday this week he's meant to bring home pears   
from the old tree by the barn, but now he sees 
the fruit has fallen, sees the yellow jackets feeding there.   
he lights a lucky, frames a joke for his wife--he'll say   
their banker raised a piss-poor field this year. 
and she will lean against the doorjamb 
while he talks, while he scrubs his hands at the tin basin   
with a split lemon and a pumice stone, rubs them raw   
trying to cut the gummy resin, that stubborn 
black stain within the green.

... mindful of the unhonored dead --thomas gray
here they stood, whom the kecoughtan first believed 
gods from another world, one pair of longjohns 
each, bad-yellow, knotted with lice,   
the godless, bandy-legged runts   
with ear bit off, or eye gouged, 
                                     who killed and prayed 
over whatever flew, squatted, or swam. 

in huts hacked from mulberry, pine, and swamp cyprus,   
they huddled ripe as hounds. 
at cockcrow scratched, shuffled marsh paths,   
took skiffs and ferried to dead-rise scows,   
twenty-footers dutifully designed and of right draft   
for oysters, crabs, and croakers. 
                                     they were seaworthy. 

according to diaries hand-scrawled, and terse court records,   
our ancestors barbarous, habitual, virginians. 

some would not sail, came ashore, walked on the land,   
kept faces clenched, lay seed and family, 
moved often, and are gone. of them 
this harbor says nothing. 
of the sea's workmen, not much, 
no brass plate of honor, no monument in the square,   
no square, merely the wreckage of a place. 

                                          but they stood-- 
proud, black and white, surly in mist 
at the hovel of the boatwright, arm pointed 
                     build me one like that yonder 
meaning the gray hull i see across a cove, 
bottom up, canting, nameless now as the hard,   
long arm, daddy's or granddaddy's, that points, but   
known to the one said to crush clams in his palms, thus   
got paid, always, who built the derelicts, and who,   
barring feud, took stick in hand here, made 
that grave gouged line of a keel, 

                               then his broad brow 

lifted seaward, in silence, sometimes 
summoning a shape in memory, and it hove up, and was   
changed some, they whined, but god knows 
all they wanted, all he made for them was 
to be a little unlike the drab hulls 
of the dead ones, but not too much. 
                                              like that one yonder 

this was the image he gave them to dream of change,   
tomorrow only a guess, the sea's story their 
life-stink and bow-slam and stillness, and they   
saw how the fair ones grew, quick riddle-riders   
our fathers feared, schools that gave us 
a message sewn on chest, bible, slate, 
and this worm-holed future entered 

blindly as i now have entered his place, feeling   
for log-char, back-flung gates of light,   
and the builder. 
                         like that one ... 
the lies begin, each inventing why 
he should rise up, he should hack out 
the joy they dream, his pitch boiled, black   
as mud seaming their legs. 

                                       suddenly, i see 
and take up a cap left as worthless on a stump, its   
stained round fitting my head like water. 

merely to wait where the builder heaved shards and chips   
and abortive clots to the tide's tongue-lap 
is to feel the unconceived shape pulse 
down his arm, into fingers 
that took up that stick to let loose 
the ingathered wilderness 
of dreams loon, crow, osprey, gull, the man 
who cannot believe what he sees, but still sees it. 

                                                an immense shadow   
making over water. 

                      stick in hand, eyes squint. and 

                      there it is,                                 
                                                                      the wind cradling 


of an eagle, wing-sails, unfurled, bow-chopping 
white water head on, a creature now there, now gone.   
a man, i have to hold my face up, study how   
air heats, builds a rising push until the high 
circle of sight skids out everywhere. 

                                                dreaming change, 

i understand, almost, the problem is he not harnessed,   
himself, this light flyer, this father 
designed to sail like a small god, to screech 
down upon pine-huddled, hungry chicks he must   
send off with his lethal, air-buoyed shape? 
nothing in him asks what is 
      over the wave-edge 
                         where our brothers float and sink,   
lovely shadows, by the millions. 
putting my back to the sea-worn trunk 
they have left me, i pull the stick through 
the dirt, and remember the long line, 
man-weight in it, and dark-buoyed. 

                                           it grows 
with freckling light, with the answering of birds   
crying out the only speech we all have 
above our unfinished country   
that looms still in the soul,   
that would bear us hence,   
out of the water that beats in, 
out of the water that bore us all here.


he can only drink tea now, screwed and filed. 
she is dead, in metal flecks.

 years old and look like a bad nail 
by god they yanked me out 
i can tell you
 

soon as the hurt come son shut up 
it don't mean nothing
 

but listen you got time for a ride?
 

habit's put the glass in his hands, the brown 
tasteless tea, slime, and cigarettes.
every sunday the same, old dog
fat at his feet.

ain't so much me i'm asking for 
dog like to get out and piss 
think they remember.
 

near the main gate of gary steel i stop.
the amber light pours out of stacked horizons, 
monstrous cranes hang over suburbs.

she think that piss mean something 
it don't mean nothing.
 

turning back in the dark, headlights flash 
on our faces, bent, light of a woman's hair.


the sun frets, a fat wafer falling like a trap of failed mesh.
i watch the pin-glare of a mockingbird's eye cut sharply, descend 
on the blank water, then emerge from himself naked
as a girl who shimmered here, once, for me.

if we come back like penitents to kneel over water, bass swirling, 
scattering the mayflies that often, in silence, graze

lips, what is the word floating out from the mouth unbearable 
as a bird's black grin or a madman's lust?

the word is not we, but me. giving it again and again

brings no one out of the willows and i, willing to believe 
like a sap in whatever dives or rises hear no voice 
but the mist sizzling on stones. i lift my head

for echoes out of trees, for the flashed recoil of flesh hung 
cheap and gaudy, wingless, above the stab of water 
that crunched her like a beer can. toads honk

the only answer. among them, a boy, i felt

the grotesque pull of the moon all night, peeled and went slowly 
down in terror, rising, falling through the pulpy leaves 
until the sun caught me, drained, and i was no one
wanted, so walked away from all knowing,

walked into town and drank, calmly, an illegal beer, then slept.

the hooks, in hairy hands, clawed it smooth as a dish, a super-
human search by flood and fire light. what could they find? 
like many, i have been out of town a long time.

i wish the face floating above the chill at my knees opened 
the door of a drab hotel. i wish it said go to hell 
or do you know what time it is, anything

that, if i heard it, i could kneel to and swear to be faithful.


in her hand the knife, brisk, brilliant as moon-claw, 
shaves the flesh. it grazes the white
belly just over the heart.
underneath, the coiled fingers
are cradling a soft flesh
as if it were the jowls of the aged

man propped for a while on the bench in the park. 
the head is not severed, the eyes not out.
blue, they appear to flash odd ways
where a tree makes a live shadow.
mostly the eyes are dead.
nothing is in them

except the intense blue of sky the tree allows.
there is no conspiring of nerves,
no least event recalled 
by a limb's high arching, 
or even a girl's ascension
from a forgotten distance of water.

but there is something as she lifts the meat. 
it is enough to draw down her gaze.
now her arm rises against
yellow hair fallen
white in a childish face.
she is still as a leaf barely clinging.

i come to her like a cat in the stunned grass 
and touch her to see the startled,
upthrusted gleam of her face.
at brow and each cheek
like gathered beads of mist
scales leap with the sun, and are dead.

no word passes between us, but something electric 
as a flash of steel makes her 
cry out just once. squatting 
at the yard's edge, she
sings beyond any thought.
her knife flies as lethal as love
and cuts quickly in like a hurried kiss.


for john gardner
it was not kindness, but i was only buckle-high in the door.
i let him in because the knock had come, the rain 
clawed each window and wall. i was afraid. 
climbing down the stairs i did not know 
how my country, cunningly, had rotted, 
but hear, now, my steps creak in memory 
and the rocks let go in the blind nightglass 
where you get up, frightened, to reenact 
the irrational logic of flesh.

even now i can't see why it happens, the moment of change, 
but must try to witness each particular index
of landscape and irony of promise. i know
i was a child when the banging began, sleepless
with every light in the house blazing. then
the man whose speech entangled me came in
from the mud-world. he could not
put together the clear words of hope
we dream, only the surge of a river.
he, who said it wasn't a fit thing

for anyone, half-grown, to have to imagine in this godforsaken 
life, said there was a message, the river high,
no chance. i remember the wind at that door
breaking like a father's hand on my face.
such hurting does not cease and maybe
that is why the man went on fumbling
for love, for the loving words
that might be knowledge. he gave me

this message. i took it, and took, without warning, grief's 
language that piece by piece has shown me how 
to connect dreamed moments skidding like rocks 
in the silence of a wyoming midnight.
each of his rainy words, fragments
of the old sickness, passed into me,
then he was gone, miserable and emptied, 
and i had no home but the heart's hut, 
the blistering walls of loneliness,
the world's blue skymiles of longing.

common with drowned fir and uncoiling crocus, then, i 
walked in ignorance and entered this terrible life 
that was always a dream of the future 
in the relentless unsleep of those 
who cannot remember the last thing they wanted
to say that love exists. and in darkness 
you have dreamed me into your world 
with their message, their words
whispering an hour before black, sudden knocking

that, even as i recall it, begins in your heart's meat 
to reverberate, oh, its noise is going
to wake you like a dove's desire.
this is the dream of the soft buckling
of flesh, the beautiful last erosions,
and i swear i would give up these words
if i could, i would stop the code
of that streetlight just beyond your bed--

but it is too late, for the secret of hope swells in you
and who can stop the news that already screams 
like the roof's edge leaving its nails 
over your child's bed that is, now,
splintered and empty as every moment 
skidding at the back of your neck? leaves 
not a month old hurl out of the storm 
and steady splatter of time, and tomorrow 
will lie still ripening, but only long enough 
for you to catalog, in dream, what was possible

before the rake must drag its scritch-scratch over ground. 
all i ask is that you turn to the child
inside, those words dreaming and changeless
as love's last chance--let them be said
against whatever, crying in the night, 
we still think may be stopped, the black 
historical fact of life's event
crashing, like a wall of water,
over the actuary's lawn and yours.

you have seen me before and would not hear, stung by your 
wife's fierce beauty, when i called your name,
and the day your mother died i begged
your attention and got your dollar.
i followed you once, in new york, like truth,
always to give you the message, and now
on your porch, mud-spattered, i am
knocking to make you see what love is.
call your wife, the police, anyone you like,

for everyone is waiting. we don't mean to be unkind but are 
compelled to deliver, faithfully, the words
that have been fluttering in your ear
like a scream. it is not the wind
waking you, but the low roar of years
fumbling to tell you what has happened,
or will, when the door flies open
and the naked message of love
stands there stuttering in your face,
alive, crying, leaving nothing out.


nobody knows exactly when it fell off the map 
or what the pressures were on its flooding river.
the hedge, the tottering mailbox, were gone. that dimple 
of light from the bicycle that raised itself to creak 
at noon across a clattering bridge names my father. 
his blood silent as a surging wish drags this town 
lost through my body, a place i can get back to only 
by hunch and a train whistle that was right on time.

but time and trains were never right in green springs, 
west virginia. what color could map the coal's grime, 
shacks shored against the river every march, mail 
left to rot because no one answered to occupant? 
farmers low on sugar cursed the heat and left bad cigars 
boys would puff back to clouds where they dreamed 
of girls naked as their hands under outfield flies. 
scores were low. there were no springs for the sick. 
women lined their walls with the sears catalog, but 
the only fur they ever had was a warbled rabbit. 
to get here think of dirt, think of night leaking, 
the tick of waterbugs, a train held in pittsburgh.


there was a fire in the night.
across the street i slept among the others 
as the ashes snowed upon small pines. 
i slept owning nothing, a child ignorant 
of fortune's blistering story, the playful 
flash in the dark, the unseen smolder 
that would leave us revealed, unchanged. 
i said my prayers for luck
but the man trying to live in two houses 
answers me now, losing
neither the old one whose windows burst 
with weariness, nor the one half-built 
whose roofless, green timbers
he would leave unfinished like a vision.
i had climbed there all summer to smoke.

awake, i found him sitting at his stool 
halfway between the houses
where i would go each morning. the story 
of the sea would be upon his tongue, 
his hands weaving the wire to a trap, 
making the careful seams to catch 
a scuttling crab. beyond him, his wife 
already had begun to stretch her wash, 
indifferent in that early light, and a dog 
lapped from the ruts of the fire truck.

i believed little had been changed by fire, 
only his toolshed limp as a black sail
left in a heap, and a new hole
in the landscape. this was an old place 
where no one came, luckless, desperate, 
eternal as guilt. in silence
i greeted that old one. but now i remember
seeing also, as if for the first time, 
the shocking gray face of the sea. 
it loomed up human and beautiful 
as far off the figures of boats crossed, 
worked, and seemed to sink
while they burned in the sullen sun.


at dawn wind out of the north, hailflecks, pebbly 
skates against windows. i lie thinking
the drainspout's drip comes 
again in the basement
faucet where i am crying, 
a child betrayed by death's 
new cardinal and the cat 
yawning on the porch
where my grandmother found me.

risen now, i see the river full-bodied, its white 
wind-knotted hair swirling like hers.
the polar hickory is naked 
as a saber recalled by a girl 
long gone in the gold
sauce of apples.
two leaves that might be 
cardinals returned
tumble in the hard light 
at the brick fence.
nothing moves in boxwood 
where gray soldiers lie.

among the last of them she walked, cupping apples, 
staining her white frock, who took
a boy far back into the haze 
the shenandoah hills held 
where family stallions
might walk aimless ground 
littered with purpling flesh 
beyond the cull of seasons. 
through a gate nailed
with leather belts
in my mind, i pass and enter 
the arthritic orchard
tended by widows. what
i gather wakes me to think

how bright on the tongue was the taste kept 
concealed, sustained, of flesh 
abiding, months beneath 
the wintering house floors. 
to reach this i must go 
down storm-worn stones 
and pick my steps past
the sealed boxes of family 
debris, nightgowns, flannels, 
ribbons, birthspoons, a pair 
of dulled skates, flowers 
pressed in a moldy bible.

why is it we keep what we cannot bear
to use, and can't escape, shoving
ourselves into shrunken rooms
edged with old foolishness 
unforgiven and unforgotten? 
i fumble to the center 
and pull a yellow light 
down the ancient string 
still dependably there 
and stand, in my head, 
as she did, playfully 
asking where they went. 
i know, i know, i say 
back there in the dust 
where i've come again
to look through tiny windows
into skirts of boxwood, a morning

that sends me alive among gray soldiers 
at the house roots. i see also blue 
preserving jars full of slick
pulpy flesh she has put up
in a juice thick as blood.
behind it all in dark eaves,
baskets of apples, split
pine boxes like generations 
steeping, undisturbed
by the tick and groan
of housepipes veining
the overhead i leave. oh 
let me see her light bring 
back those stallion-feeders, 
little red handfuls of joy look

how long i've slept, learning to walk 
straight into a dawn-silvered web 
where secret spiders spin 
ceaseless as the seasons. 
above me ice takes each 
room, i can hear feet 
pacing fretful halls,
yet here i lift my face 
and puff back all the silk 
in the world. i hold every 
core peeled on this slab. 
my fingers claw the meat 
of family stillness,
parting all the way to seeds.

oh widows of the air,
fill me with your
cidery, useless lying,
those bladed hours
you fed me the dark
rotting dreams of your love.


i went for a walk over the dunes again this morning 
to the sea, 
then turned right along 
   the surf 
                         rounded a naked headland 
                         and returned 

   along the inlet shore 

it was muggy sunny, the wind from the sea steady and high,   
crisp in the running sand, 
       some breakthroughs of sun 
   but after a bit 

continuous overcast 

the walk liberating, i was released from forms,   
from the perpendiculars, 
      straight lines, blocks, boxes, binds 
of thought 
into the hues, shadings, rises, flowing bends and blends   
               of sight 

                         i allow myself eddies of meaning   
yield to a direction of significance 
running 
like a stream through the geography of my work   
   you can find 
in my sayings 
                         swerves of action 
                         like the inlet's cutting edge 
               there are dunes of motion, 
organizations of grass, white sandy paths of remembrance   
in the overall wandering of mirroring mind 
but overall is beyond me is the sum of these events 
i cannot draw, the ledger i cannot keep, the accounting 
beyond the account 

in nature there are few sharp lines there are areas of   
primrose 
       more or less dispersed 
disorderly orders of bayberry between the rows 
of dunes, 
irregular swamps of reeds, 
though not reeds alone, but grass, bayberry, yarrow, all ... 
predominantly reeds 

i have reached no conclusions, have erected no boundaries,   
shutting out and shutting in, separating inside 
          from outside i have 
          drawn no lines 
          as 

manifold events of sand 
change the dune's shape that will not be the same shape   
tomorrow, 

so i am willing to go along, to accept   
the becoming 
thought, to stake off no beginnings or ends, establish   
         no walls 

by transitions the land falls from grassy dunes to creek   
to undercreek but there are no lines, though 
       change in that transition is clear 
       as any sharpness but sharpness spread out,   
allowed to occur over a wider range 
than mental lines can keep 

the moon was full last night today, low tide was low   
black shoals of mussels exposed to the risk 
of air 
and, earlier, of sun, 
waved in and out with the waterline, waterline inexact,   
caught always in the event of change   
       a young mottled gull stood free on the shoals 
       and ate 
to vomiting another gull, squawking possession, cracked a crab,   
picked out the entrails, swallowed the soft-shelled legs, a ruddy 
turnstone running in to snatch leftover bits 

risk is full every living thing in 
siege the demand is life, to keep life the small 
white blacklegged egret, how beautiful, quietly stalks and spears 
               the shallows, darts to shore 
                            to stab--what? i couldn't 
       see against the black mudflats--a frightened 
       fiddler crab? 

               the news to my left over the dunes and 
reeds and bayberry clumps was 
               fall thousands of tree swallows 
               gathering for flight 
               an order held 
               in constant change a congregation 
rich with entropy nevertheless, separable, noticeable 
          as one event, 
                      not chaos preparations for 
flight from winter, 
cheet, cheet, cheet, cheet, wings rifling the green clumps, 
beaks 
at the bayberries 
    a perception full of wind, flight, curve, 
    sound 
    the possibility of rule as the sum of rulelessness 
the field of action 
with moving, incalculable center 

in the smaller view, order tight with shape 
blue tiny flowers on a leafless weed carapace of crab 
snail shell 
            pulsations of order 
            in the bellies of minnows orders swallowed,   
broken down, transferred through membranes 
to strengthen larger orders but in the large view, no 
lines or changeless shapes the working in and out, together   
            and against, of millions of events this, 
                         so that i make 
                         no form of 
                         formlessness 

orders as summaries, as outcomes of actions override   
or in some way result, not predictably seeing me gain   
the top of a dune, 
the swallows 
could take flight--some other fields of bayberry   
            could enter fall 
            berryless and there is serenity 

            no arranged terror no forcing of image, plan, 
or thought 
no propaganda, no humbling of reality to precept 

terror pervades but is not arranged, all possibilities   
of escape open no route shut, except in   
   the sudden loss of all routes 

            i see narrow orders, limited tightness, but will   
not run to that easy victory 
            still around the looser, wider forces work 
            i will try 
       to fasten into order enlarging grasps of disorder, widening   
scope, but enjoying the freedom that 
scope eludes my grasp, that there is no finality of vision,   
that i have perceived nothing completely, 
that tomorrow a new walk is a new walk.


for robert duncan
it is hard going to the door 
cut so small in the wall where 
the vision which echoes loneliness   
brings a scent of wild flowers in a wood. 

what i understood, i understand. 
my mind is sometime torment,   
sometimes good and filled with livelihood,   
and feels the ground. 

but i see the door, 
and knew the wall, and wanted the wood,   
and would get there if i could 
with my feet and hands and mind. 

lady, do not banish me   
for digressions. my nature   
is a quagmire of unresolved   
confessions. lady, i follow. 

i walked away from myself, 
i left the room, i found the garden, 
i knew the woman 
in it, together we lay down. 

dead night remembers. in december   
we change, not multiplied but dispersed,   
sneaked out of childhood, 
the ritual of dismemberment. 

mighty magic is a mother, 
in her there is another issue 
of fixture, repeated form, the race renewal,   
the charge of the command. 

the garden echoes across the room.   
it is fixed in the wall like a mirror   
that faces a window behind you   
and reflects the shadows. 

may i go now? 
am i allowed to bow myself down 
in the ridiculous posture of renewal, 
of the insistence of which i am the virtue? 

nothing for you is untoward.   
inside you would also be tall,   
more tall, more beautiful. 
come toward me from the wall, i want to be with you. 

so i screamed to you, 
who hears as the wind, and changes   
multiply, invariably, 
changes in the mind. 

running to the door, i ran down 
as a clock runs down. walked backwards,   
stumbled, sat down 
hard on the floor near the wall. 

where were you. 
how absurd, how vicious. 
there is nothing to do but get up. 
my knees were iron, i rusted in worship, of you. 

for that one sings, one 
writes the spring poem, one goes on walking.   
the lady has always moved to the next town   
and you stumble on after her. 

the door in the wall leads to the garden   
where in the sunlight sit 
the graces in long victorian dresses,   
of which my grandmother had spoken. 

history sings in their faces. 
they are young, they are obtainable,   
and you follow after them also 
in the service of god and truth. 

but the lady is indefinable,   
she will be the door in the wall   
to the garden in sunlight.   
i will go on talking forever. 

i will never get there. 
oh lady, remember me 
who in your service grows older   
not wiser, no more than before. 

how can i die alone. 
where will i be then who am now alone,   
what groans so pathetically 
in this room where i am alone? 

i will go to the garden. 
i will be a romantic. i will sell   
myself in hell, 
in heaven also i will be. 

in my mind i see the door, 
i see the sunlight before me across the floor   
beckon to me, as the lady's skirt 
moves small beyond it.


then fled, o brethren, the wicked juba 
       and wandered wandered far 
from curfew joys in the dismal's night.   
       fool of st. elmo's fire 

in scary night i wandered, praying, 
       lord god my harshener,   
speak to me now or let me die 
       speak, lord, to this mourner. 

and came at length to livid trees   
       where ibo warriors 
hung shadowless, turning in wind   
       that moaned like africa, 

their belltongue bodies dead, their eyes   
       alive with the anger deep 
in my own heart. is this the sign,   
       the sign forepromised me? 

the spirits vanished. afraid and lonely   
       i wandered on in blackness.   
speak to me now or let me die. 
       die, whispered the blackness. 

and wild things gasped and scuffled in   
       the night seething shapes 
of evil frolicked upon the air. 
       i reeled with fear, i prayed. 

sudden brightness clove the preying 
       darkness, brightness that was   
itself a golden darkness, brightness 
       so bright that it was darkness. 

and there were angels, their faces hidden   
       from me, angels at war 
with one another, angels in dazzling   
       combat. and oh the splendor, 

the fearful splendor of that warring. 
       hide me, i cried to rock and bramble.   
hide me, the rock, the bramble cried. . . .   
       how tell you of that holy battle? 

the shock of wing on wing and sword   
       on sword was the tumult of   
a taken city burning. i cannot 
       say how long they strove, 

for the wheel in a turning wheel which is time   
       in eternity had ceased 
its whirling, and owl and moccasin, 
       panther and nameless beast 

and i were held like creatures fixed   
       in flaming, in fiery amber. 
but i saw i saw oh many of   
       those mighty beings waver, 

waver and fall, go streaking down 
       into swamp water, and the water   
hissed and steamed and bubbled and locked   
       shuddering shuddering over 

the fallen and soon was motionless.   
       then that massive light 
began a-folding slowly in 
       upon itself, and i 

beheld the conqueror faces and, lo,   
       they were like mine, i saw 
they were like mine and in joy and terror   
       wept, praising praising jehovah. 

oh praised my honer, harshener 
       till a sleep came over me, 
a sleep heavy as death. and when 
       i awoke at last free 

and purified, i rose and prayed 
       and returned after a time 
to the blazing fields, to the humbleness.   
       and bided my time.

        bells. i cannot sleep, for i am sick 
       with fear, but writing eases fear a little 
       since still my eyes can see these words take shape   
       upon the page & so i write, as one 
       would turn to exorcism.  days scudding, 
       but now the sea is calm again. misfortune 
       follows in our wake like sharks our grinning   
       tutelary gods. which one of us 
       has killed an albatross? a plague among 
       our blacks--ophthalmia blindness--& we   
       have jettisoned the blind to no avail. 
       it spreads, the terrifying sickness spreads. 
       its claws have scratched sight from the capt.'s eyes   
       & there is blindness in the fo'c'sle 
       & we must sail  weeks before we come 
       to port. 

               what port awaits us, davy jones' 
               or home? i've heard of slavers drifting, drifting,   
               playthings of wind and storm and chance, their crews   
               gone blind, the jungle hatred 
               crawling up on deck.

       left the guinea coast 
       with cargo of five hundred blacks and odd   
       for the barracoons of florida 

       that there was hardly room 'tween-decks for half   
       the sweltering cattle stowed spoon-fashion there   
       that some went mad of thirst and tore their flesh   
       and sucked the blood 

       that crew and captain lusted with the comeliest   
       of the savage girls kept naked in the cabins   
       that there was one they called the guinea rose   
       and they cast lots and fought to lie with her 

       that when the bo's'n piped all hands, the flames   
       spreading from starboard already were beyond   
       control, the negroes howling and their chains   
       entangled with the flames 

       that the burning blacks could not be reached,   
       that the crew abandoned ship, 
       leaving their shrieking negresses behind, 
       that the captain perished drunken with the wenches 

       further deponent sayeth not. 

pilot    oh    pilot    me 


       ii 

aye, lad, and i have seen those factories,   
gambia, rio pongo, calabar 
have watched the artful mongos baiting traps   
of war wherein the victor and the vanquished 

were caught as prizes for our barracoons.   
have seen the nigger kings whose vanity 
and greed turned wild black hides of fellatah,   
mandingo, ibo, kru to gold for us. 

and there was one--king anthracite we named him-- 
fetish face beneath french parasols 
of brass and orange velvet, impudent mouth 
whose cups were carven skulls of enemies 

he'd honor us with drum and feast and conjo   
and palm-oil-glistening wenches deft in love,   
and for tin crowns that shone with paste,   
red calico and german-silver trinkets 

would have the drums talk war and send   
his warriors to burn the sleeping villages   
and kill the sick and old and lead the young   
in coffles to our factories. 

twenty years a trader, twenty years, 
for there was wealth aplenty to be harvested   
from those black fields, and i'd be trading still   
but for the fevers melting down my bones.

shuttles in the rocking loom of history,   
the dark ships move, the dark ships move,   
their bright ironical names 
like jests of kindness on a murderer's mouth   
plough through thrashing glister toward   
fata morgana's lucent melting shore,   
weave toward new world littorals that are   
mirage and myth and actual shore. 

voyage through death, 
                               voyage whose chartings are unlove. 

a charnel stench, effluvium of living death   
spreads outward from the hold, 
where the living and the dead, the horribly dying,   
lie interlocked, lie foul with blood and excrement. 

       deep in the festering hold thy father lies,   
       the corpse of mercy rots with him,   
       rats eat love's rotten gelid eyes. 

       but, oh, the living look at you 
       with human eyes whose suffering accuses you,   
       whose hatred reaches through the swill of dark   
       to strike you like a leper's claw. 

       you cannot stare that hatred down 
       or chain the fear that stalks the watches 
       and breathes on you its fetid scorching breath   
       cannot kill the deep immortal human wish,   
       the timeless will. 

               but for the storm that flung up barriers   
               of wind and wave, the amistad, seores, 
               would have reached the port of prncipe in two,   
               three days at most but for the storm we should   
               have been prepared for what befell.   
               swift as the puma's leap it came. there was   
               that interval of moonless calm filled only   
               with the water's and the rigging's usual sounds,   
               then sudden movement, blows and snarling cries   
               and they had fallen on us with machete   
               and marlinspike. it was as though the very   
               air, the night itself were striking us.   
               exhausted by the rigors of the storm, 
               we were no match for them. our men went down   
               before the murderous africans. our loyal   
               celestino ran from below with gun   
               and lantern and i saw, before the cane- 
               knife's wounding flash, cinquez, 
               that surly brute who calls himself a prince,   
               directing, urging on the ghastly work. 
               he hacked the poor mulatto down, and then   
               he turned on me. the decks were slippery 
               when daylight finally came. it sickens me   
               to think of what i saw, of how these apes   
               threw overboard the butchered bodies of 
               our men, true christians all, like so much jetsam.   
               enough, enough. the rest is quickly told   
               cinquez was forced to spare the two of us   
               you see to steer the ship to africa,   
               and we like phantoms doomed to rove the sea   
               voyaged east by day and west by night,   
               deceiving them, hoping for rescue,   
               prisoners on our own vessel, till   
               at length we drifted to the shores of this   
               your land, america, where we were freed   
               from our unspeakable misery. now we   
               demand, good sirs, the extradition of   
               cinquez and his accomplices to la   
               havana. and it distresses us to know   
               there are so many here who seem inclined   
               to justify the mutiny of these blacks.   
               we find it paradoxical indeed 
               that you whose wealth, whose tree of liberty   
               are rooted in the labor of your slaves 
               should suffer the august john quincy adams   
               to speak with so much passion of the right   
               of chattel slaves to kill their lawful masters   
               and with his roman rhetoric weave a hero's   
               garland for cinquez. i tell you that   
               we are determined to return to cuba 
               with our slaves and there see justice done. cinquez-- 
               or let us say the prince'--cinquez shall die. 

       the deep immortal human wish,   
       the timeless will 

               cinquez its deathless primaveral image,   
               life that transfigures many lives. 

       voyage through death 
                                     to life upon these shores.


i 
he dines alone surrounded by reflections   
of himself. then after sleep and benzedrine   
descends the cinquecento stair his magic   
wrought from hypochondria of the well- 
to-do and nagging deathwish of the poor   
swirls on smiling genuflections of 
his liveried chauffeur into a crested   
lilac limousine, the cynosure 
of mousey neighbors tittering behind   
venetian blinds and half afraid of him   
and half admiring his outrageous flair. 

       ii 
meanwhile his mother, priestess in gold lam,   
precedes him to the quondam theater   
now israel temple of the highest alpha,   
where the bored, the sick, the alien, the tired   
await euphoria. with deadly vigor 
she prepares the way for mystery 
and lucre. shouts in blues-contralto, he's   
god's dictaphone of all-redeeming truth. 
oh he's the holyweight champeen who's come   
to give the knockout lick to your bad luck   
say he's the holyweight champeen who's here   
to deal a knockout punch to your hard luck. 

       iii 
reposing on cushions of black leopard skin,   
he telephones instructions for a long 
slow drive across the park that burgeons now   
with spring and sailors. peers questingly   
into the green fountainous twilight, sighs 
and turns the gold-plate dial to music for 
your dining-dancing pleasure. smoking egyptian   
cigarettes rehearses in his mind 
a new device that he must use tonight. 

       iv 
approaching israel temple, mask in place,   
he hears ragtime allegros of a song 
of zion that becomes when he appears   
a hallelujah wave for him to walk. 
his mother and a rainbow-surpliced cordon   
conduct him choiring to the altar-stage, 
and there he kneels and seems to pray before   
a lighted jesus painted sealskin-brown. 
then with a glittering flourish he arises,   
turns, gracefully extends his draperied arms   
israelites, true jews, o found lost tribe   
of israel, receive my blessing now. 
selah, selah. he feels them yearn toward him   
as toward a lover, exults before the image 
of himself their trust gives back. stands as though   
in meditation, letting their eyes caress 
his garments jewelled and chatoyant, cut   
to fall, to flow from his tall figure 
dramatically just so. then all at once 
he sways, quivers, gesticulates as if 
to ward off blows or kisses, and when he speaks   
again he utters wildering vocables, 
hypnotic no-words planned and never failing   
to enmesh his flock in theopathic tension.   
cries of eudaemonic pain attest 
his artistry. behind the mask he smiles.   
and now in subtly altering light he chants 
and sinuously trembles, chants and trembles   
while convulsive energies of eager faith   
surcharge the theater with power of   
their own, a power he has counted on   
and for a space allows to carry him.   
dishevelled antiphons proclaim the moment   
his followers all day have hungered for,   
but which is his alone. 
he signals tambourines begin, frenetic 
drumbeat and glissando. he dances from the altar,   
robes hissing, flaring, shimmering down aisles   
where mantled guardsmen intercept wild hands   
that arduously strain to clutch his vestments,   
he dances, dances, ensorcelled and aloof,   
the fervid juba of god as lover, healer,   
conjurer. and of himself as god.


ray's third new car in half as many years. 
full cooler in the trunk, ray sogging the beer 
as i solemnly chauffeur us through the bush 
and up the backroads, hardly cowpaths and hub-deep in mud.   
all day the sky lowers, clears, lowers again. 
somewhere in the bush near saint john 
there are uncles, a family, one mysterious brother 
who stayed on the land when ray left for the cities. 
one week ray is crocked. we've been through this before.   
even, as a little girl, hands in my dress, 
ah punka, you's my debby, come and ki me. 
 

then the road ends in a yard full of dogs. 
them's indian dogs, ray says, lookit how they know me.   
and they do seem to know him, like i do. his odor-- 
rank beef of fierce turtle pulled dripping from metagoshe,   
and the inflammable mansmell hair tonic, ashes, alcohol.   
ray dances an old woman up in his arms. 
fiddles reel in the phonograph and i sink apart 
in a corner, start knocking the blue ribbons down.   
four generations of people live here. 
no one remembers raymond twobears. 

so what. the walls shiver, the old house caulked with mud   
sails back into the middle of metagoshe. 
a three-foot-long snapper is hooked on a fishline,   
so mean that we do not dare wrestle him in 
but tow him to shore, heavy as an old engine. 
then somehow ray pries the beak open and shoves   
down a cherry bomb. lights the string tongue. 

headless and clenched in its armor, the snapper 
is lugged home in the trunk for tomorrow's soup. 
ray rolls it beneath a bush in the backyard and goes in   
to sleep his own head off. tomorrow i find 
that the animal has dragged itself off. 
i follow torn tracks up a slight hill and over 
into a small stream that deepens and widens into a marsh. 

ray finds his way back through the room into his arms.   
when the phonograph stops, he slumps hard in his hands   
and the boys and their old man fold him into the car 
where he curls around his bad heart, hearing how it knocks   
and rattles at the bars of his ribs to break out. 

somehow we find our way back. uncle ray   
sings an old song to the body that pulls him 
toward home. the gray fins that his hands have become   
screw their bones in the dashboard. his face   
has the odd, calm patience of a child who has always 
let bad wounds alone, or a creature that has lived   
for a long time underwater. and the angels come   
lowering their slings and litters.


home's the place we head for in our sleep.   
boxcars stumbling north in dreams 
don't wait for us. we catch them on the run.   
the rails, old lacerations that we love,   
shoot parallel across the face and break   
just under turtle mountains. riding scars 
you can't get lost. home is the place they cross. 

the lame guard strikes a match and makes the dark   
less tolerant. we watch through cracks in boards   
as the land starts rolling, rolling till it hurts   
to be here, cold in regulation clothes. 
we know the sheriff's waiting at midrun 
to take us back. his car is dumb and warm. 
the highway doesn't rock, it only hums 
like a wing of long insults. the worn-down welts   
of ancient punishments lead back and forth. 

all runaways wear dresses, long green ones, 
the color you would think shame was. we scrub   
the sidewalks down because it's shameful work.   
our brushes cut the stone in watered arcs   
and in the soak frail outlines shiver clear 
a moment, things us kids pressed on the dark   
face before it hardened, pale, remembering 
delicate old injuries, the spines of names and leaves.


he my captor gave me a bisquit, which i put in my pocket, and not daring to eat it, buried it under a log, fearing he had put something in it to make me love him.
--from the narrative of the captivity of mrs. mary rowlandson, who was taken prisoner by the wampanoag when lancaster, massachusetts, was destroyed, in the year 

the stream was swift, and so cold   
i thought i would be sliced in two.   
but he dragged me from the flood   
by the ends of my hair. 
i had grown to recognize his face. 
i could distinguish it from the others.   
there were times i feared i understood   
his language, which was not human,   
and i knelt to pray for strength. 

we were pursued by god's agents   
or pitch devils, i did not know. 
only that we must march. 
their guns were loaded with swan shot. 
i could not suckle and my child's wail   
put them in danger. 
he had a woman 
with teeth black and glittering.   
she fed the child milk of acorns. 
the forest closed, the light deepened. 

i told myself that i would starve 
before i took food from his hands   
but i did not starve. 
one night 
he killed a deer with a young one in her   
and gave me to eat of the fawn. 
it was so tender, 
the bones like the stems of flowers,   
that i followed where he took me.   
the night was thick. he cut the cord   
that bound me to the tree. 

after that the birds mocked. 
shadows gaped and roared 
and the trees flung down 
their sharpened lashes. 
he did not notice god's wrath. 
god blasted fire from half-buried stumps. 
i hid my face in my dress, fearing he would burn us all   
but this, too, passed. 

rescued, i see no truth in things.   
my husband drives a thick wedge   
through the earth, still it shuts   
to him year after year. 
my child is fed of the first wheat.   
i lay myself to sleep 
on a holland-laced pillowbeer.   
i lay to sleep. 
and in the dark i see myself   
as i was outside their circle. 

they knelt on deerskins, some with sticks,   
and he led his company in the noise   
until i could no longer bear 
the thought of how i was. 
i stripped a branch 
and struck the earth, 
in time, begging it to open 
to admit me 
as he was 
and feed me honey from the rock.


we watched from the house 
as the river grew, helpless 
and terrible in its unfamiliar body.   
wrestling everything into it, 
the water wrapped around trees 
until their life-hold was broken. 
they went down, one by one, 
and the river dragged off their covering. 

nests of the herons, roots washed to bones,   
snags of soaked bark on the shoreline   
a whole forest pulled through the teeth   
of the spillway. trees surfacing 
singly, where the river poured off 
into arteries for fields below the reservation. 

when at last it was over, the long removal,   
they had all become the same dry wood.   
we walked among them, the branches   
whitening in the raw sun. 
above us drifted herons, 
alone, hoarse-voiced, broken, 
settling their beaks among the hollows. 
grandpa said, these are the ghosts of the tree people   
moving among us, unable to take their rest. 
 

sometimes now, we dream our way back to the heron dance.   
their long wings are bending the air   
into circles through which they fall.   
they rise again in shifting wheels.   
how long must we live in the broken figures   
their necks make, narrowing the sky.


the antelope are strange people ... they are beautiful to look at, and yet they are tricky. we do not trust them. they appear and disappear they are like shadows on the plains. because of their great beauty, young men sometimes follow the antelope and are lost forever. even if those foolish ones find themselves and return, they are never again right in their heads. 
--pretty shield, medicine woman of the crows transcribed and edited by frank linderman 
all night i am the doe, breathing   
his name in a frozen field, 
the small mist of the word 
drifting always before me. 

and again he has heard it   
and i have gone burning   
to meet him, the jacklight   
fills my eyes with blue fire   
the heart in my chest 
explodes like a hot stone. 

then slung like a sack 
in the back of his pickup, 
i wipe the death scum 
from my mouth, sit up laughing   
and shriek in my speeding grave. 

safely shut in the garage, 
when he sharpens his knife 
and thinks to have me, like that, 
i come toward him, 
a lean gray witch 
through the bullets that enter and dissolve. 

i sit in his house 
drinking coffee till dawn 
and leave as frost reddens on hubcaps, 
crawling back into my shadowy body. 
all day, asleep in clean grasses, 
i dream of the one who could really wound me.   
not with weapons, not with a kiss, not with a look.   
not even with his goodness. 

if a man was never to lie to me. never lie me. 
i swear i would never leave him.


butch once remarked to me how sinister it was   
alone, after hours, in the dark of the shop 
to find me there hunched over two weeks' accounts   
probably smoked like a bacon from all those pall-malls. 

odd comfort when the light goes, the case lights left on   
and the rings of baloney, the herring, the parsley,   
arranged in the strict, familiar ways. 

whatever intactness holds animals up 
has been carefully taken, what's left are the parts.   
just look in the cases, all counted and stacked. 

step-and-a-half waleski used to come to the shop 
and ask for the cheap cut, she would thump, sniff, and finger.   
this one too old. this one here for my supper.   
two days and you do notice change in the texture. 

i have seen them the day before slaughter. 
knowing the outcome from the moment they enter   
the chute, the eye rolls, blood is smeared on the lintel.   
mallet or bullet they lunge toward their darkness. 

but something queer happens when the heart is delivered.   
when a child is born, sometimes the left hand is stronger.   
you can train it to fail, still the knowledge is there.   
that is the knowledge in the hand of a butcher 

that adds to its weight. otto krger could fell 
a dray horse with one well-placed punch to the jaw,   
and yet it is well known how thorough he was. 

he never sat down without washing his hands,   
and he was a maker, his sausage was echt 
so that even waleski had little complaint.   
butch once remarked there was no one so deft   
as my otto. so true, there is great tact involved   
in parting the flesh from the bones that it loves. 

how we cling to the bones. each joint is a web 
of small tendons and fibers. he knew what i meant   
when i told him i felt something pull from the left,   
and how often it clouded the day before slaughter. 

something queer happens when the heart is delivered.


you might come here sunday on a whim.   
say your life broke down. the last good kiss   
you had was years ago. you walk these streets   
laid out by the insane, past hotels   
that didn't last, bars that did, the tortured try   
of local drivers to accelerate their lives.   
only churches are kept up. the jail   
turned  this year. the only prisoner   
is always in, not knowing what he's done. 

the principal supporting business now   
is rage. hatred of the various grays   
the mountain sends, hatred of the mill,   
the silver bill repeal, the best liked girls   
who leave each year for butte. one good   
restaurant and bars can't wipe the boredom out.   
the  boom, eight going silver mines,   
a dance floor built on springs-- 
all memory resolves itself in gaze, 
in panoramic green you know the cattle eat   
or two stacks high above the town,   
two dead kilns, the huge mill in collapse   
for fifty years that won't fall finally down. 

isn't this your life? that ancient kiss 
still burning out your eyes? isn't this defeat 
so accurate, the church bell simply seems 
a pure announcement ring and no one comes?   
don't empty houses ring? are magnesium   
and scorn sufficient to support a town,   
not just philipsburg, but towns 
of towering blondes, good jazz and booze   
the world will never let you have 
until the town you came from dies inside? 

say no to yourself. the old man, twenty   
when the jail was built, still laughs   
although his lips collapse. someday soon,   
he says, i'll go to sleep and not wake up.   
you tell him no. you're talking to yourself.   
the car that brought you here still runs.   
the money you buy lunch with, 
no matter where it's mined, is silver   
and the girl who serves your food 
is slender and her red hair lights the wall.


my father paces the upstairs hall   
a large confined animal 
neither wild nor yet domesticated. 
about him hangs the smell of righteous wrath.   
my mother is meekly seated 
at the escritoire. rosy from my bath   
age eight-nine-ten by now i understand   
his right to roar, hers to defy 
the bill from wanamaker's in his hand   
the bill from strawbridge's held high   
the bill from bonwit teller 
and the all plum-colored blum store. 

his anger smells like dinner parties   
like trays of frothy daiquiris. 
against the pre-world-war-two prime   
standing ribs his carving knife 
flashes a little drunkenly. he charms   
all the other bonwit-bedecked wives   
but something overripe malingers. 
i wear his wide cigar bands on my fingers. 

oh god it is so noisy 
under my bed a secret stair 
a gold and purple escalator 
takes me nightly down under the sea. 
such dancings, such carryings on   
with the prince of this-or-that 
with the duke of ne'er-do-well 
i the plain one, a size too large to tell   
grow tremulous at stickpin and cravat   
i in toe shoes and tutu suddenly   
see shopping is an art form 
a kind of costume ball. 

pap, would we so humbly come   
to the scene in the upstairs hall 
on the first of every month, except 
you chose the mice for footmen, clapped   
to call up the coach and four? 
you sent to paris for the ermine muff   
that says i'm rich. to think twelve poor   
little things had their heads chopped off   
to keep my hands unseemly warm   
when you went fishing down the well   
for fox furs, hats with peacock plumes   
velvet evening capes, what else befell? 

you paid the bills, pap. you cast the spell.


shall i say how it is in your clothes? 
a month after your death i wear your blue jacket.   
the dog at the center of my life recognizes   
you've come to visit, he's ecstatic. 
in the left pocket, a hole. 
in the right, a parking ticket 
delivered up last august on bay state road.   
in my heart, a scatter like milkweed, 
a flinging from the pods of the soul. 
my skin presses your old outline. 
it is hot and dry inside. 

i think of the last day of your life, 
old friend, how i would unwind it, paste   
it together in a different collage, 
back from the death car idling in the garage,   
back up the stairs, your praying hands unlaced,   
reassembling the bits of bread and tuna fish   
into a ceremony of sandwich, 
running the home movie backward to a space   
we could be easy in, a kitchen place 
with vodka and ice, our words like living meat. 

dear friend, you have excited crowds 
with your example. they swell 
like wine bags, straining at your seams.   
i will be years gathering up our words,   
fishing out letters, snapshots, stains, 
leaning my ribs against this durable cloth 
to put on the dumb blue blazer of your death.


the water closing   
over us and the   
going down is all.   
gills are given.   
we convert in a   
town of broken hulls 
and green doubloons. 
o you dead pirates   
hear us there is   
no salvage. all 
you know is the color 
of warm caramel. all 
is salt. see how 
our eyes have migrated 
to the uphill side?   
now we are new round   
mouths and no spines   
letting the water cover. 
it happens over   
and over, me in   
your body and you   
in mine.


it will be an island on strings   
well out to sea and austere   
bobbing as if at anchor 
green with enormous fir trees   
formal as telephone poles. 

we will arrive there slowly 
hand over hand without oars.   
last out, you will snip the fragile   
umbilicus white as a beansprout   
that sewed us into our diaries. 

we will be two bleached hermits   
at home in our patches and tears. 
we will butter the sun with our wisdom.   
our days will be grapes on a trellis   
perfectly oval and furred. 

at night we will set our poems   
adrift in ginger ale bottles   
each with a clamshell rudder   
each with a piggyback spider   
waving them off by dogstar 

and nothing will come from the mainland   
to tell us who cares, who cares 
and nothing will come of our lovelock   
except as our two hearts go soft 
and black as avocado pears.


i dreamed that i was old in stale declension   
fallen from my prime, when company 
was mine, cat-nimbleness, and green invention,   
before time took my leafy hours away. 

my wisdom, ripe with body's ruin, found   
itself tart recompense for what was lost 
in false exchange since wisdom in the ground   
has no apocalypse or pentecost. 

i wept for my youth, sweet passionate young thought, 
and cozy women dead that by my side   
once lay i wept with bitter longing, not   
remembering how in my youth i cried.


do not embrace your mind's new negro friend 
or embarrass the blackballed jew with memberships 
there must be years of atonement first, and even then 
you may still be the blundering raconteur 
with the wrong story, and they may still be free. 

if you are with them, if even mind is friend, 
there will be plenty to do give the liars lessons 
who have heard no rumors of truth for a long time 
but have whatever they hear on good authority, 
whether it concerns chinese women or the arts. 

expose the patrons, some of whose best friends 
are brothers, and who are never now anonymous 
what kind of credit do they expect for that, 
ask them, or better, ask their protested brothers, 
the grateful tenants who can't get their curtsies right. 

finally the injured, who think they have no friend, 
who have been convinced by the repeated names 
that they are jews or negroes or some dark thing 
they must be courted with the lover's touch 
and as guiltily as if yourself had turned them inward. 

if you complete this program, you will have friends 
from all the rich races of your human blood 
meantime, engage in the often friendless struggle. 
a long war, a pygmy war in ways, 
but island by island we must go across.


here at the seashore they use the clouds over & over 

again, like the rented animals in ada.

in the late morning the land breeze

turns and now the extras are driving

all the white elephants the other way.

what language are these children shouting in? 

he is lying on the beach listening.


the sand knocks like glass, struck by bare heels.

he tries to remember snow noise. 

would powder snow ping like that?

but you don't lie with your ear to powder snow.

why doesn't the girl who takes care 

of the children, a yale girl without flaw, 

know the difference between lay and lie?


he tries to remember snow, his season. 

the mind is in charge of things then. 

summer is for animals, the ocean is erotic, 

all that openness and swaying.

no matter how often you make love

in august you're always aware of genitalia, 

your own and the half-naked others'. 

even with the gracefulest bathers

you're aware of their kinship with porpoises, 

mammals disporting themselves in a blue element, 

smelling slightly of fish. porpoise hazard 

watches himself awhile, like a blue movie.


in the other hemisphere now people 

are standing up, at work at their easels. 

there they think about love at night 

when they take off their serious clothes 

and go to bed sandlessly, under blankets.


today the children, his own among them,

are apparently shouting fluently in portuguese,

using the colonial dialect of brazil.

it is just as well, they have all been changed 

into small shrill marginal animals,

he would not want to understand them again 

until after labor day. he just lays there.


outside the hotel window, unenlightened pigeons 

weave and dive like stukas on their prey,

apparently some tiny insect brother.

in india, the attainment of nonviolence

is considered a proper goal for human beings. 

if one of the pigeons should fly into the illusion


of my window and survive the body is no illusion 

when it's hurt he could be taken across town to the bird 

hospital where jains, skilled medical men,

repair the feathery sick and broken victims.

there, in reproof of violence

and of nothing else, live mahavira's brothers and sisters.


to this small, gentle order of monks and nuns

it is bright vishnu and dark shiva who are illusion. 

they trust in faith, cognition, and nonviolence 

to release them from rebirth. they think that birds 

and animals--like us, some predators, some prey--

should be ministered to no less than men and women.


the jains who deal with creatures and with laymen 

wear white, while their more enterprising hermit brothers 

walk naked and are called the sky-clad. jains pray 

to no deity, human kindness being their sole illusion. 

mahavira and those twenty-three other airy creatures

who turned to saints with him, preached the doctrine of ahimsa,


which in our belligerent tongue becomes nonviolence. 

it's not a doctrine congenial to snarers and poultrymen, 

who every day bring to market maimed pheasants. 

numbers of these are brought in by the jain brothers 

and brought, to grow back wing-tips and illusions, 

to one of the hospitals succoring such small quarry.


when strong and feathered again, the lucky victims

get reborn on sunday mornings to the world's violence,

released from the roofs of these temples to illusion.

it is hard for a westerner to speak about men and women 

like these, who call the birds of the air brothers.

we recall the embarrassed fanfare for francis and his flock.


we're poor forked sky-clad things ourselves

and god knows prey to illusion--e.g., i claim these brothers 

and sisters in india, stemming a little violence, among birds.


touching your goodness, i am like a man 
who turns a letter over in his hand 
and you might think this was because the hand 
was unfamiliar but, truth is, the man 
has never had a letter from anyone 
and now he is both afraid of what it means 
and ashamed because he has no other means 
to find out what it says than to ask someone. 

his uncle could have left the farm to him, 
or his parents died before he sent them word, 
or the dark girl changed and want him for beloved. 
afraid and letter-proud, he keeps it with him. 
what would you call his feeling for the words 
that keep him rich and orphaned and beloved?


je vois les effroyables espaces de l'univers qui m'enferment, et je me trouve attach  un coin de cette vaste tendue, sans savoir pourquoi je suis plutt en ce lieu qu'en un autre, ni pourquoi ce peu de temps qui m'est donn  vivre m'est assign  ce point plutt qu' un autre de toute l'ternit qui m'a prcd, et de toute qui me suit.

--pascal, penses sur la religion


the approach of a man's life out of the past is history, and the approach of time out of the future is mystery. their meeting is the present, and it is consciousness, the only time life is alive. the endless wonder of this meeting is what causes the mind, in its inward liberty of a frozen morning, to turn back and question and remember. the world is full of places. why is it that i am here?

--wendell berry, the long-legged house
spared by a car or airplane crash or 

cured of malignancy, people look 

around with new eyes at a newly 

praiseworthy world, blinking eyes like these.


for i've been brought back again from the 

fine silt, the mud where our atoms lie 

down for long naps. and i've also been 

pardoned miraculously for years

by the lava of chance which runs down 

the world's gullies, silting us back.

here i am, brought back, set up, not yet 

happened away.


                     but it's not this random

life only, throwing its sensual 

astonishments upside down on

the bloody membranes behind my eyeballs,

not just me being here again, old 

needer, looking for someone to need, 

but you, up from the clay yourself, 

as luck would have it, and inching 

over the same little segment of earth-

ball, in the same little eon, to

meet in a room, alive in our skins, 

and the whole galaxy gaping there

and the centuries whining like gnats--

you, to teach me to see it, to see

it with you, and to offer somebody 

uncomprehending, impudent thanks.


in plaster, with a bronze wash
a person is very self-conscious about his head. 
it makes one nervous just to know it is cast 
in enduring materials, and that when the real one is dead   
the cast one, if nobody drops it or melts it down, will last. 

we pay more attention to the front end, where the face is,   
than to the interesting and involute interior 
the fissure of rolando and such queer places 
are parks for the passions and fears and mild hysteria. 

the things that go on there erotic movies are shown   
to anyone not accompanied by an adult. 
the marquee out front maintains a superior tone   
documentaries on sharks and the japanese tea cult. 

the fronts of some heads are extravagantly pretty.   
these are the females. men sometimes blow their tops   
about them, launch triremes, sack a whole city.   
the female head is mounted on rococo props. 

judgment is in the head somewhere it keeps sums   
of pleasure and pain and gives belated warning   
this is the first place everybody comes 
with bills, complaints, writs, summons, in the morning. 

this particular head, to my certain knowledge 
has been taught to read and write, make love and money,   
operate cars and airplanes, teach in a college,   
and tell involved jokes, some few extremely funny. 

it was further taught to know and to eschew   
error and sin, which it does erratically. 
this is the place the soul calls home just now.   
one dislikes it of course it is the seat of me.


i. of choice

despair is big with friends i love,

hydrogen and burning jews.

i give them all the grief i have

but i tell them, friends, i choose, i choose,


don't make me say against my glands 

or how the world has treated me. 

though gay and modest give offense 

and people grieve pretentiously,


more than i hoped to do, i do 

and more than i deserve i get 

what little i attend, i know

and it argues order more than not.


my desperate friends, i want to tell 

them, you take too delicate offense

at the stench of time and man's own smell, 

it is only the smell of consequence.


ii. of love

people love each other and the light 

of love gilds but doesn't alter,

people don't change one another, can scarcely

by taking will and thought add a little 

now and then to their own statures 

which, praise them, they do,

so that here we are in all our sizes

flooded in the impartial daylight sometimes, 

spotted sometimes in a light we make ourselves, 

human, the beams of attention 

of social animals at their work 

which is loving and sometimes all dark.


the only correction is

by you of you, by me of me.

people are worth looking at in this light 

and if you listen what they are saying is,

love me sun out there whoever you are, 

chasing me from bed in the morning, 

spooking me all day with shadow, 

surprising me whenever you fall

make me conspicuous as i go here,

spotted by however many beams,

now light, finally dark. i fear

there is meant to be a lot of darkness,

you hear them say, but every last creature

is the one it meant to be.


iii. my acts

the acts of my life swarm down the street like puerto rican kids,

foreign but small and, except for one, unknived. 

they do no harm though their voices slash like reeds

all except one they have evidently been loved.


and down the hill where i've planted spruce and red pine

in a gang of spiked shadows they slouch at night.

i am reasonably brave. i have been, except on one occasion,

myself it is no good trying to be what you are not.


we live among gangs who seem to have no stake

in what we're trying to do, no sense of property or race,

yet if you speak with authority they will halt and break 

and sullenly, one by one, show you a local face.


i dreamt once that they caught me and, holding me down,

burned my genitals with gasoline

in my stupid terror i was telling them names

so my manhood kept and the rest went up in flames.


now, say the world is a fair place,' the biggest one said, 

and because there was no face worse than my own there

i said it and got up. quite a lot of me is charred.

by our code it is fair. we play fair. the world is fair.


i. he thinks of the chinese snake who is the beginning and the end

if you or i should die

that day desire would not renew 

itself in any bed.

the old snake of the world, eternity 

that holds his tail in his mouth, 

would spit it out

and ease off through the grass 

like a piece of music

to we don't know where.


then it would be for the living

to beat the grass and bring him back. 

but would he be set tamely

to sucking his tail again

in that absence?


ii. he marvels at the persistence of passion

like black duennas the hours sit

and read our lips and watch our thighs. 

the years are pederasts they wait 

for boys and will not meet my eyes.


and children are cool astronomers 

who scan us like old galaxies 

and calculate how many years 

before we'll turn to gas or freeze.


and yet sometimes i have to shave 

and brush my teeth at dawn to keep 

my healthy middle-aged alive

hands off you where you lie asleep.


iii. sometimes he contemplates adultery 

i had no insanity to excuse this,

but for a week my heart ran with another love,

imagined another house, down to its books and bed.

my miserable fluttered heart, you understand, chose this. 

now i am led home--cold, grave,

contractual as a dog--by my scurrilous head.


iv. his hands, on a trip to wisconsin

it is night. i am a thousand miles from home.

my hands lie awake and are aware of themselves, 

one on my noisy chest, the other, the right one,

a matter of several pounds, oppressing my forehead. 

it is a week since it fluted the air goodbye.

i think of the path in space the thing has made since then, 

veering and halting of the shapes hands make

washing a car, or in the uses of music.


two shapes it has traced honor this right hand 

the curve that a plane rides out

as it leaves or takes a deck on the scalloped sea 

handily, handily then this two-pound creature 

felt the wired air, let the two monsters kiss, 

the shapes that it graphed then fairer

than the hair of the clouds that watched 

or the sea's own scalloped hair.


and he and his gauche fellow, moving symmetrically,

have described one body so well 

they could dress that shape in air

as they long to do now though they lie 

laced hunks of flesh on my belly--

ahead of them some years of roving

before the white landscape of age checks them, 

your body's disaster, sure to be traced there, 

even so slight a change in a dear shape 

halting them, baffled, lascivious suddenly,

or folded cold, or feeling your hands folded cold.


v. lines from his guest-book

shelley's houses and walks were always a clutter of women,

and god knows what further arrangements he kept in his mind. 

drle de menage, rimbaud said of himself and verlaine,


as if there were any other kind.

in yeats' tower, in all that fakery of ghosts,

some solid women came and slept as mrs. yeats' guests. 

we are most our own strange selves when we are hosts.


here those who have loved or befriended me came to a proof 

they must lodge in my head and in company under one roof. 

keeping house is the instinct of love it is always a little ridiculous. 

yet it is with no light welcome we welcome the friends of the house.


we need the ceremony of one another,

    meals served, more love,

    more handling of one another with love, less 

    casting out of those who are not

    of our own household.


    this turkey is either not cooked 

    enough or it's tough.'


the culture is in late imperial decline. 

    the children don't like dark meat or 

    pepper. they say the mother sometimes 

    deliberately puts pepper on the things 

    the grown-ups like better.


    less casting out of those in our own 

    household with whom we disagree.


the cat will not hear of cat food, 

    he waves it away. he has seen

    the big thrush taken from the cold 

    box, dressed and put in the hot.


    if i set the alarm clock, will you turn 

    on the oven when it goes off?' then 

    she went off to see the profane

    dancers of the afternoon. it was done.


the fact that i don't like his pictures 

    should not obscure the facts 

    that he is a good man

    that many admire his work his canvases 

    threaten my existence and i hope 

    mine his, the intolerant bastard 

    that we are brothers in humanity 

    & the art. often it does, though.


the cat has followed hazard from his studio, 

    he looks mean. he upbraids

    the innocent dog and

    all of us, he casts us out.


    there's pepper in this gravy. we're 

    supposed to eat dry turkey and you've 

    put pepper in the gravy.'


the meal is served, nevertheless

    with felt love, some godless benediction.


the grown ones have wine after the other

    bottle. they cast out a lot. the dancers

    this afternoon were, well, thinky,'

    she says. she toys with her glass.


he is strictly a one-joke painter,'

    he replies, painted that one twenty

    years ago and is still putting pepper

    on it, ha hah. finish your turkey

    you two and leave a little gravy for someone else.'


the cat is taking notes against

    his own household. he watches.

    hazard would like once to see

    things with the cat's eyes, flat.


now it is time to go to bed. hungry 

    and alone most go to bed in this 

    decline and in all others, yet


someone has fed us again and blessed us

    with the manners of bohemia. among barbarians, 

    a lot is expected of us, ceremony-wise.

    we rise to that expectation.


tonight hazard's father and stepmother are having 

jazz for mcgovern. in the old game-room 

the old liberals listen as the quintet builds 

crazy houses out of skin and brass, crumbling 

the house of decorum, everybody likes that.


for decades they have paid for the refurbishing

of america and they have not got their money's worth. 

now they listen, hopeful,

to the hard rock for mcgovern.


the ceiling in this palace needs fixing,

the chalky blue paint is like an old heaven 

but there are holes and flaking.

they had movies here when grandpa was solvent.


hazard desires his wife, the way people

on the trains to the death camps were seized 

by irrational lust. she is the youngest woman 

in the room, he would like to be in bed 

with her now, he would like to be president.


he has not been to his studio

in four days, he asks the bartender,

a college boy with a ponytail, for more gin. 

he stands in the doorway. forsythia and lilac 

have overgrown the porch, there is the rich 

smell of wood-rot. what twenty years will do

to untended shrubbery and america and hazard.


the alternative to flying is cowardice,

and what is said against it excuses, excuses

its want was always heavy in those men's bodies 

who foresaw it in some detail and failing that,

the rest were shown through its skyey heats and eases 

in sleep, awoke uncertain whether their waking cry 

had been falling fear only, or love and falling fear. 

when the sudden way was shown, its possibility 

in terms of the familiar at last shown, 

how absurdly simple the principle after all 

any tyrant should have sensed it was controversial 

instrument of freedom rights, not wrights 

danger should never be given out publicly. 

the men could easily have been disposed of, 

they and their fragile vehicle. then the sky

would perhaps have darkened, earth shaken, nothing more. 

in practice the martyrdom has been quiet, statistical, 

a fair price. this is what airmen believe.


the transition to battle was smooth from here. 

who resents one bond resents another,

and who has unshouldered earth-restraining hand 

is not likely to hear out more reasonable tyrannies.


the woods where he died were dark even at sunup, 

oak and long-needle pine that had come together 

earlier, and waited for the event at the field's edge. 

at sunset when the sky behind was gay

one had seen the lugubrious shapes of the trees, 

bronze and terrible, but had never known the reason, 

never thought they were waiting for someone in particular. 

they took him at night, when they were at their darkest.


how they at last convinced him is not known 

the crafty engine would not fall for their softness,

oh, where were you then, six hundred cunning horses? 

in the end it had torn hungrily through the brush

to lie alone in the desired clearing. nor the wings 

and you, with your wide silver margin of safety? 

they were for the field, surely, where they so often 

had eased their load to ground. no, the invitation 

must have been sent to the aviator in person

perhaps a sly suggestion of carelessness,

a whispered invitation perhaps to death.


he was not badly disfigured compared to some, 

but even a little stream of blood where death is 

will whimper across a forest floor,

run through that whole forest shouting.


him now unpersoned, warm, and quite informal, 

dead as alive, raise softly sober interns

lift gently, god, this wholly airborne one. 

leads out all his life to this violent wood.


note that he had not fought one public battle, 

met any fascist with his skill, but died

as it were in bed, the waste conspicuous

this is a costly wreck and costly to happen on 

praise and humility sound through its siren shrieks, 

and dedication follows in car.


the morning came up foolish with pink clouds 

to say that god counts ours a cunning time,

our losses part of an old secret, somehow no loss.


lost at sea, april , 
i stand on the ledge where rock runs into the river

as the night turns brackish with morning, and mourn the drowned.

here the sea is diluted with river i watch it slaver 

like a dog curing of rabies. its ravening over,

lickspittle ocean nuzzles the dry ground.

but the dream that woke me was worse than the sea's gray 

slip-slap there are no such sounds by day.


this crushing of people is something we live with.

daily, by unaccountable whim

or caught up in some harebrained scheme of death, 

tangled in cars, dropped from the sky, in flame,

men and women break the pledge of breath

and now under water, gone all jetsam and small

in the pressure of oceans collected, a squad of brave men in a hull.


why can't our dreams be content with the terrible facts? 

the only animal cursed with responsible sleep, 

we trace disaster always to our own acts. 

i met a monstrous self trapped in the black deep 

all these years, he smiled, i've drilled at sea 

for this crush of water. then he saved only me.


we invest ships with life. look at a harbor

at first light with better grace than men

in their movements the vessels run to their labors

working the fields that the tide has made green again

their beauty is womanly, they are named for ladies and queens, 

although by a wise superstition these are called

after fish, the finned boats, silent and submarine.

the crushing of any ship has always been held

in dread, like a house burned or a great tree felled.


i think of how sailors laugh, as if cold and wet

and dark and lost were their private, funny derision 

and i can judge then what dark compression

astonishes them now, their sunken faces set

unsmiling, where the currents sluice to and fro

and without humor, somewhere northeast of here and below.


sea-brothers, i lower to you the ingenuity of dreams,

strange lungs and bells to escape in let me stay aboard last--

we amend our dreams in half-sleep. then it seems 

easy to talk to the severe dead and explain the past. 

now they are saying, do not be ashamed to stay alive, 

you have dreamt nothing that we do not forgive. 

and gentlier, study something deeper than yourselves, 

as, how the heart, when it turns diver, delves and saves.


whether we give assent to this or rage

is a question of temperament and does not matter. 

some will has been done past our understanding, 

past our guilt surely, equal to our fears.

dullards, we are set again to the cryptic blank page 

where the sea schools us with terrible water.

the noise of a boat breaking up and its men is in our ears. 

the bottom here is too far down for our sounding 

the ocean was salt before we crawled to tears.


limped out of the hot sky a hurt plane, 

held off, held off, whirring pretty pigeon, 

hit then and scuttled to a crooked stop.

the stranger pilot who emerged--this was the seashore, 

war came suddenly here--talked to the still mechanics 

who nodded gravely. flak had done it, he said, 

from an enemy ship attacked.

                  they wheeled it with love 

into the dark hangar's mouth and tended it. 

coffee and cake for the pilot then who sat alone 

in the restaurant, reading the numbered sheets 

that tell about weather.

                  after, toward dusk,

mended the stranger plane went back to the sky.

his curly-headed picture, and mother's and medal's pictures 

were all we knew of him after he rose again, 

those few electric jewels against the moth and whining sky.




he that had come that morning,   
one after the other, 
over seven hills, 
each of a new color, 

came now by the last tree,   
by the red-colored valley,   
to a gray river 
wide as the sea. 

there at the shingle 
a listing wherry 
awash with dark water   
what should it carry? 

there on the shelving,   
three dark gentlemen.   
might they direct him?   
three gentlemen. 

cable, friend john, john cable,   
when they saw him they said,   
come and be company 
as far as the far side. 

come follow the feet, they said,   
of your family, 
of your old father 
that came already this way. 

but cable said, first i must go   
once to my sister again 
what will she do come spring   
and no man on her garden? 

she will say weeds are alive   
from here to the stream of friday   
i grieve for my brother's plowing,' 
then break and cry. 

lose no sleep, they said, for that fallow   
she will say before summer, 
i can get me a daylong man, 
do better than a brother.'  

cable said, i think of my wife   
dearly she needs consoling   
i must go back for a little 
for fear she die of grieving. 

cable, they said, john cable,   
ask no such wild favor 
still, if you fear she die soon,   
the boat might wait for her. 

but cable said, i remember   
out of charity let me 
go shore up my poorly mother,   
cries all afternoon. 

they said, she is old and far,   
far and rheumy with years,   
and, if you like, we shall take   
no note of her tears. 

but cable said, i am neither   
your hired man nor maid,   
your dog nor shadow 
nor your ape to be led. 

he said, i must go back 
once i heard someone say 
that the hollow stream of friday   
is a rank place to lie 

and this word, now i remember,   
makes me sorry have you   
thought of my own body   
i was always good to? 

the frame that was my devotion   
and my blessing was, 
the straight bole whose limbs   
were long as stories-- 

now, poor thing, left in the dirt   
by the stream of friday 
might not remember me 
half tenderly. 

they let him nurse no worry 
they said, we give you our word   
poor thing is made of patience   
will not say a word. 

cable, friend john, john cable,   
after this they said, 
come with no company 
to the far side. 

to a populous place, 
a dense city 
that shall not be changed   
before much sorrow dry. 

over shaking water 
toward the feet of his father,   
leaving the hills' color 
and his poorly mother 

and his wife at grieving   
and his sister's fallow   
and his body lying   
in the rank hollow, 

now cable is carried   
on the dark river   
nor even a shadow   
followed him over. 

on the wide river   
gray as the sea 
flags of white water   
are his company.


let me call a ghost,   
love, so it be little   
in december we took 
no thought for the weather. 

whom now shall i thank   
for this wealth of water?   
your heart loves harbors   
where i am a stranger. 

where was it we lay 
needing no other 
twelve days and twelve nights   
in each other's eyes? 

or was it at babel 
and the days too small   
we spoke our own tongue   
needing no other? 

if a seed grow green   
set a stone upon it   
that it learn thereby   
holy charity. 

if you must smile 
always on that other, 
cut me from ear to ear   
and we all smile together.


here comes the shadow not looking where it is going,   
and the whole night will fall it is time. 
here comes the little wind which the hour 
drags with it everywhere like an empty wagon through leaves.   
here comes my ignorance shuffling after them 
asking them what they are doing. 

standing still, i can hear my footsteps   
come up behind me and go on 
ahead of me and come up behind me and 
with different keys clinking in the pockets, 
and still i do not move. here comes 
the white-haired thistle seed stumbling past through the branches   
like a paper lantern carried by a blind man. 
i believe it is the lost wisdom of my grandfather 
whose ways were his own and who died before i could ask. 

forerunner, i would like to say, silent pilot,   
little dry death, future, 
your indirections are as strange to me 
as my own. i know so little that anything   
you might tell me would be a revelation. 

sir, i would like to say, 
it is hard to think of the good woman   
presenting you with children, like cakes,   
granting you the eye of her needle,   
standing in doorways, flinging after you   
little endearments, like rocks, or her silence   
like a whole sunday of bells. instead, tell me   
which of my many incomprehensions 
did you bequeath me, and where did they take you? standing 
in the shoes of indecision, i hear them   
come up behind me and go on ahead of me 
wearing boots, on crutches, barefoot, they could never 
get together on any door-sill or destination-- 
the one with the assortment of smiles, the one   
jailed in himself like a forest, the one who comes 
back at evening drunk with despair and turns 
into the wrong night as though he owned it--oh small 
deaf disappearance in the dusk, in which of their shoes 
will i find myself tomorrow?


the way to the river leads past the names of   
ash the sleeves the wreaths of hinges   
through the song of the bandage vendor 

i lay your name by my voice   
as i go 

the way to the river leads past the late 
doors and the games of the children born looking backwards   
they play that they are broken glass 
the numbers wait in the halls and the clouds 
call 
from windows 
they play that they are old they are putting the horizon   
into baskets they are escaping they are 
hiding 

i step over the sleepers the fires the calendars   
my voice turns to you 

i go past the juggler's condemned building the hollow   
windows gallery 
of invisible presidents the same motion in them all   
in a parked cab by the sealed wall the hats are playing   
sort of poker with somebody's 

old snapshots game i don't understand they lose   
the rivers one 
after the other i begin to know where i am   
i am home 

be here the flies from the house of the mapmaker   
walk on our letters i can tell 
and the days hang medals between us 
i have lit our room with a glove of yours be   
here i turn 
to your name and the hour remembers 
its one word 
now 

be here what can we 
do for the dead the footsteps full of money   
i offer you what i have my 
poverty 

to the city of wires i have brought home a handful 
of water i walk slowly 
in front of me they are building the empty 
ages i see them reflected not for long 
be here i am no longer ashamed of time it is too brief its hands   
have no names 
i have passed it i know 

         oh necessity you with the face you with   
         all the faces 

this is written on the back of everything 

but we 
will read it together


when the forests have been destroyed their darkness remains   
the ash the great walker follows the possessors 
forever 
nothing they will come to is real 
nor for long 
over the watercourses 
like ducks in the time of the ducks 
the ghosts of the villages trail in the sky 
making a new twilight 

rain falls into the open eyes of the dead   
again again with its pointless sound 
when the moon finds them they are the color of everything 

the nights disappear like bruises but nothing is healed   
the dead go away like bruises 
the blood vanishes into the poisoned farmlands   
pain the horizon 
remains 
overhead the seasons rock 
they are paper bells 
calling to nothing living 

the possessors move everywhere under death their star   
like columns of smoke they advance into the shadows   
like thin flames with no light 
they with no past 
and fire their only future


every year without knowing it i have passed the day   
when the last fires will wave to me 
and the silence will set out 
tireless traveler 
like the beam of a lightless star 

then i will no longer 
find myself in life as in a strange garment 
surprised at the earth 
and the love of one woman 
and the shamelessness of men 
as today writing after three days of rain 
hearing the wren sing and the falling cease 
and bowing not knowing to what


oh pile of white shirts who is coming 
to breathe in your shapes to carry your numbers   
to appear 
what hearts 
are moving toward their garments here 
their days 
what troubles beating between arms 

you look upward through 
each other saying nothing has happened   
and it has gone away and is sleeping   
having told the same story 
and we exist from within 
eyes of the gods 

you lie on your backs 
and the wounds are not made   
the blood has not heard 
the boat has not turned to stone   
and the dark wires to the bulb 
are full of the voice of the unborn


for wendell berry
each face in the street is a slice of bread   
wandering on 
searching 

somewhere in the light the true hunger   
appears to be passing them by   
they clutch 

have they forgotten the pale caves 
they dreamed of hiding in 
their own caves 
full of the waiting of their footprints 
hung with the hollow marks of their groping   
full of their sleep and their hiding 

have they forgotten the ragged tunnels 
they dreamed of following in out of the light   
to hear step after step 

the heart of bread 
to be sustained by its dark breath   
and emerge 

to find themselves alone   
before a wheat field 
raising its radiance to the moon


all these years behind windows 
with blind crosses sweeping the tables 

and myself tracking over empty ground   
animals i never saw 

i with no voice 

remembering names to invent for them   
will any come back will one 

saying yes 

saying look carefully yes   
we will meet again


in a dream i returned to the river of bees   
five orange trees by the bridge and 
beside two mills my house 
into whose courtyard a blindman followed   
the goats and stood singing 
of what was older 

soon it will be fifteen years 

he was old he will have fallen into his eyes 

i took my eyes 
a long way to the calendars 
room after room asking how shall i live 

one of the ends is made of streets   
one man processions carry through it   
empty bottles their 
image of hope 
it was offered to me by name 

once once and once 
in the same city i was born   
asking what shall i say 

he will have fallen into his mouth   
men think they are better than grass 

i return to his voice rising like a forkful of hay 

he was old he is not real nothing is real   
nor the noise of death drawing water 

we are the echo of the future 

on the door it says what to do to survive   
but we were not born to survive   
only to live


thinking of rain clouds that rose over the city   
on the first day of the year 

in the same month 
i consider that i have lived daily and with 

eyes open and ears to hear 
these years across from st vincent's hospital   
above whose roof those clouds rose 

its bricks by day a french red under 
cross facing south 
blown-up neo-classic facades the tall 
dark openings between columns at 
the dawn of history   
exploded into many windows 
in a mortised face 

inside it the ambulances have unloaded 
after sirens' howling nearer through traffic on   
seventh avenue long 
ago i learned not to hear them 
even when the sirens stop 

they turn to back in 
few passers-by stay to look   
and neither do i 

at night two long blue 
windows and one short one on the top floor   
burn all night 
many nights when most of the others are out   
on what floor do they have 
anything 

i have seen the building drift moonlit through geraniums   
late at night when trucks were few 
moon just past the full 
upper windows parts of the sky 
as long as i looked 
i watched it at christmas and new year 
early in the morning i have seen the nurses ray out through   
arterial streets 
in the evening have noticed internes blocks away 
on doorsteps one foot in the door 

i have come upon the men in gloves taking out   
the garbage at all hours   
piling up mountains of 
plastic bags white strata with green intermingled and 
black 
i have seen one pile 
catch fire and studied the cloud 
at the ends of the jets of the hoses 
the fire engines as near as that 
red beacons and 
machine-throb heard by the whole body 
i have noticed molded containers stacked outside   
a delivery entrance on twelfth street 
whether meals from a meal factory made up with those   
mummified for long journeys by plane 
or specimens for laboratory 
examination sealed at the prescribed temperatures   
either way closed delivery 

and approached faces staring from above   
crutches or tubular clamps 
out for tentative walks 
have paused for turtling wheel-chairs 
heard visitors talking in wind on each corner   
while the lights changed and 
hot dogs were handed over at the curb   
in the middle of afternoon 
mustard ketchup onions and relish 
and police smelling of ether and laundry   
were going back 

and i have known them all less than the papers of our days   
smoke rises from the chimneys do they have an incinerator 
what for 
how warm do they believe they have to maintain the air 
in there 
several of the windows appear   
to be made of tin 
but it may be the light reflected 

i have imagined bees coming and going 
on those sills though i have never seen them 

who was st vincent


matches among other things that were not allowed   
never would be 
lying high in a cool blue box 
that opened in other hands and there they all were   
bodies clean and smooth blue heads white crowns   
white sandpaper on the sides of the box scoring   
fire after fire gone before 

i could hear the scratch and flare   
when they were over 
and catch the smell of the striking 
i knew what the match would feel like   
lighting 
when i was very young 

a fire engine came and parked 
in the shadow of the big poplar tree 
on fourth street one night 
keeping its engine running 
pumping oxygen to the old woman 
in the basement 
when she died the red lights went on burning


back when it took all day to come up 
from the curving broad ponds on the plains 
where the green-winged jaanas ran on the lily pads 

easing past tracks at the mouths of gorges 
crossing villages silted in hollows 
in the foothills 
each with its lime-washed church by the baked square   
of red earth and its 
talkers eating fruit under trees 

turning a corner and catching 
sight at last of inky forests far above 
steep as faces 
with the clouds stroking them and the glimmering   
airy valleys opening out of them 

waterfalls still roared from the folds   
of the mountain 
white and thundering and spray drifted   
around us swirling into the broad leaves   
and the waiting boughs 

once i took a tin cup and climbed 
the sluiced rocks and mossy branches beside   
one of the high falls 
looking up step by step into 
the green sky from which rain was falling 
when i looked back from a ledge there were only   
dripping leaves below me 
and flowers 

beside me the hissing 
cataract plunged into the trees 
holding on i moved closer 
left foot on a rock in the water 
right foot on a rock in deeper water   
at the edge of the fall 
then from under the weight of my right foot   
came a voice like a small bell singing   
over and over one clear treble   
syllable 

i could feel it move 
i could feel it ring in my foot in my skin   
everywhere 
in my ears in my hair 
i could feel it in my tongue and in the hand   
holding the cup 
as long as i stood there it went on 
without changing 

when i moved the cup 
still it went on 
when i filled the cup 
in the falling column 
still it went on 
when i drank it rang in my eyes 
through the thunder curtain 

when i filled the cup again   
when i raised my foot   
still it went on 
and all the way down   
from wet rock to wet rock   
green branch to green branch 
it came with me 

until i stood 
looking up and we drank 
the light water 
and when we went on we could 
still hear the sound 
as far as the next turn on the way over


neither my father nor my mother knew   
the names of the trees   
where i was born 
what is that 
i asked and my 
father and mother did not 
hear they did not look where i pointed   
surfaces of furniture held   
the attention of their fingers   
and across the room they could watch 
walls they had forgotten   
where there were no questions   
no voices and no shade 

were there trees 
where they were children   
where i had not been   
i asked 
were there trees in those places 
where my father and my mother were born   
and in that time did 
my father and my mother see them 
and when they said yes it meant 
they did not remember 
what were they i asked what were they   
but both my father and my mother 
said they never knew


all the way north on the train the sun   
followed me followed me without moving   
still the sun of that other morning 
when we had gone over come on over   
men at the screen door said to my father   
you have to see this it's an ape bring   
the little boy bring the boy along 

so he brought me along to the field 
of dry grass hissing behind the houses   
in the heat that morning and there was   
nothing else back there but the empty day   
above the grass waving as far away 
as i could see and the sight burned my eyes   
white birds were flying off beyond us 

and a raised floor of boards like a house   
with no house on it part way out there   
was shining by itself a color 
of shadow and the voices of the men 
were smaller in the field as we walked on   
something was standing out there on the floor   
the men kept saying come on over 

it's on a chain and my father said 
to me don't get too close i saw it was   
staring down at each of our faces 
one after the other as though it might   
catch sight of something in one of them 
that it remembered i stood watching its eyes   
as they turned away from each of us


then it was the future, though what's arrived   
isn't what we had in mind, all chrome and   
cybernetics, when we set up exhibits 
in the cafeteria for the judges 
to review what we'd made of our hypotheses. 

the class skeptic he later refused to sign   
anyone's yearbook, calling it a sentimental   
degradation of language chloroformed mice,   
weighing the bodies before and after 
to catch the weight of the soul, 

wanting to prove the invisible 
real as a bagful of nails. a girl 
who knew it all made cookies from euglena, 
a one-celled compromise between animal and plant,   
she had cultured in a flask. 

we're smart enough, she concluded, 
to survive our mistakes, showing photos of farmland,   
poisoned, gouged, eroded. no one believed 
he really had built it when a kid no one knew   
showed up with an atom smasher, confirming that 

the tiniest particles could be changed   
into something even harder to break. 
and one whose mother had cancer hard to admit now,   
it was me distilled the tar of cigarettes   
to paint it on the backs of shaven mice. 

she wanted to know what it took, 
a little vial of sure malignancy, 
to prove a daily intake smaller 
than a single aspirin could finish 
something as large as a life. i thought of this 

because, today, the dusky seaside sparrow 
became extinct. it may never be as famous 
as the pterodactyl or the dodo, 
but the last one died today, a resident 
of walt disney world where now its tissue samples 

lie frozen, in case someday we learn to clone 
one from a few cells. like those instant dinosaurs 
that come in a gelatin capsule--just add water   
and they inflate. one other thing this 
brings to mind. the euglena girl won first prize 

both for science and, i think, in retrospect, for hope.


the housework, the factory work, the work
that takes from the body
and does not put back.
the white-collar work and the dirt 
of its profits, the terrible politeness
of the office worker, the work that robs 
the viscera to pay the cool
surfaces of the brain. all the work 
that makes love difficult, brings on 
sleep, drops the body off
at the liquor cabinet. all the work 
that reaches the intestines and sprawls. 
and the compulsive work after the work 
is done, those unfillable spaces
of the calvinist, or certain marriage beds.



night is longing, longing, longing,  beyond all endurance.  --henry miller 
the back roads i've traveled late   
at night, alone, a little drunk,   
wishing i were someone 
on whom nothing is lost, 

are the roads by day i take 
to the car wash in hammonton   
or to blue anchor's 
lawnmower repair shop 
when the self-propel mechanism goes. 

fascinating how the lamplight   
that's beckoned 
from solitary windows 
gives way to white shutters 
and occasionally a woman 
in her yard, bending over 
something conspicuously in bloom. 

so much then is duty, duty, duty,   
and so much 
with the sun visor tilted 
and destination known 
can be endured. 

but at night . . . no, even at night   
so much can be endured. 

i've known only one man   
who left the road, 
followed an intriguing light   
to its source. 
he told me 
that he knocked many times   
before it became clear to him   
he must break down the door. 



the devil's tour of hell did not include   
a factory line where molten lead   
spilled into mouths held wide, 

no electric drill spiraling screws 
into hands and feet, nor giant pliers   
to lower you into simmering vats. 

instead, a circle of light 
opened on your stuffed armchair, 
whose chintz orchids did not boil and change, 

and the devil adjusted   
your new spiked antennae 
almost delicately, with claws curled 

and lacquered black, before he spread   
his leather wings to leap   
into the acid-green sky. 

so your head became a tv hull, 
a gargoyle mirror. your doppelganger   
sloppy at the mouth 

and swollen at the joints   
enacted your days in sinuous   
slow motion, your lines delivered 

with a mocking sneer. sometimes   
the frame froze, reversed, began   
again the red eyes of a friend 

you cursed, your girl child cowered   
behind the drapes, parents alive again   
and puzzled by this new form. that's why 

you clawed your way back to this life.


once warring factions agreed upon the date   
and final form the apocalypse would take,   
and whether dogs and cats and certain trees 
deserved to sail, and if the dead would come or be left   
a forwarding address, then opposing soldiers   
met on ravaged plains to shake hands   
and postulate the exact shade 
of the astral self--some said lavender,   
others gray. and physicists rocketed 
copies of the decree to paradise 
in case god had anything to say, 
the silence that followed being taken   
for consent, and so citizens 
readied for celestial ascent. 

those who hated the idea stayed indoors   
till the appointed day. when the moon   
clicked over the sun like a black lens   
over a white eye, they stepped out   
onto porches and balconies to see   
the human shapes twist and rise   
through violet sky and hear trees uproot   
with a sound like enormous zippers   
unfastening. and when the last grassblades   
filled the air, the lonely vigilants fell   
in empty fields to press their bodies   
hard into dirt, hugging their own outlines. 

then the creator peered down from his perch,   
as the wind of departing souls tore the hair   
of those remaining into wild coronas,   
and he mourned for them as a father   
for defiant children, and he knew that each   
small skull held, if not some vision 
of his garden, then its aroma of basil 
and tangerine washed over by the rotting sea.   
they alone sensed what he'd wanted 
as he first stuck his shovel into clay 
and flung the planets over his shoulder, 
or used his thumbnail to cut smiles and frowns   
on the first blank faces. even as the saints   
arrived to line before his throne singing 
and a wisteria poked its lank blossoms 
through the cloudbank at his feet, 
he trained his gaze on the deflating globe 
where the last spreadeagled xs clung like insects,   
then vanished in puffs of luminous smoke, 

which traveled a long way to sting his nostrils,   
the journey lasting more than ten lifetimes.   
a mauve vine corkscrewed up from the deep   
oblivion, carrying the singed fume 
of things beautiful, noble, and wrong.


stare hard enough at the fabric of night,   
and if you're predisposed to dark--let's say   
the window you've picked is a black 
postage stamp you spend hours at, 
sleepless, drinking gin after the i love   
lucy reruns have gone off--stare 

like your eyes have force, and behind 
any night's taut scrim will come the forms   
you expect pressing from the other side.   
for you a field of skulls, angled jaws 
and eye-sockets, a zillion scooped-out crania.   
they're plain once you think to look. 

you know such fields exist, for criminals 
roam your very block, and even history lists   
monsters like adolf and uncle joe 
who stalk the earth's orb, plus minor baby-eaters   
unidentified, probably in your very midst. perhaps   
that disgruntled mail clerk from your job 

has already scratched your name on a bullet--that's him   
rustling in the azaleas. you caress the thought, 
for it proves there's no better spot for you 
than here, your square-yard of chintz sofa, hearing   
the bad news piped steady from your head. the night   
is black. you stare and furious stare, 

confident there are no gods out there. in this way,   
you're blind to your own eye's intricate machine   
and to the light it sees by, to the luck of birth and all   
your remembered loves. if the skulls are there-- 
let's say they do press toward you 
against night's scrim--could they not stare 
with slack jawed envy at the fine flesh 
that covers your scalp, the numbered hairs,   
at the force your hands hold?


on this first dark day of the year 
      my daddy was born lo 
these eighty-six years ago who now 
      has not drawn breath or held 
bodily mass for some ten years and still   
      i have not got used to it. 
my mind can still form to that chair him   
      whom no chair holds. 
each year on this night on the brink 
      of new circumference i stand and gaze 
towards him, while roads careen with drunks,   
      and my dad who drank himself 
away cannot be found. daddy, i'm halfway   
      to death myself. the millenium 
hurtles towards me, and the boy i bore   
      who bears your fire in his limbs 
follows in my wake. why can you not be   
      reborn all tall to me? if i raise my arms 
here in the blind dark, why can you not   
      reach down now to hoist me up? 
this heavy carcass i derive from yours is   
      tutelage of love, and yet each year 
though older another notch i still cannot stand   
      to reach you, or to emigrate 
from the monolithic shadow you left.


for john holohan
jesus wound up with his body nailed to a tree-- 
a torment he practically begged for,   
or at least did nothing to stop. pilate 

watched the crowd go thumbs down   
and weary, signed the order.   
so centurions laid jesus flat 

on a long beam, arms run along the crosspiece.   
in each palm a long spike was centered,   
a stone chosen to drive it. skin 

tears the bones start to split.   
once the cross got propped up,   
the body hung heavy, a carcass-- 

in carne, the latin poets say, in meat.   
--the breastbone a ship's prow . . .   
at the end the man cried out 

as men cry. tears that fill the eyes   
grow dark drop and by drop one   
cries out. on the third day, 

the stone rolled back, to reveal   
no corpse. history is rife 
with such hoaxes. look at herodotus. 

as to whether he multiplied 
loaves and fishes, that's common enough.   
poke seed-corn in a hole and see if more corn 

doesn't grow. two fish in a pond   
make more fishes. the altar of reason 
supports such extravagance. i don't even know 

how electricity works, but put trust   
in light switches. and the prospect   
of love cheers me up, as gospel. 

that some creator might strap on 
an animal mask to travel our path between birth   
and ignominious death--now that 

makes me less lonely. and the rising up 
at the end into glory--the white circle of bread   
on the meat of each tongue that god 

might enter us. for -near years   
my tribe has lined up at various altars, 
so dumbly i open this mouth for bread and song.


no sooner does the plane angle up 
than i cork off to dream a bomb blast 
a fireball roiling through the cabin in slo-mo,   
seat blown loose from its bolts, 
i hang weightless a nanosecond 
         in blue space 

then jerk awake to ordered rows. 
and there's the silver liquor cart jangling   
its thousand bells, the perfect doses   
of juniper gin and oak-flavored scotch 
         held by a rose-nailed hand. 

i don't miss drinking, don't miss 
driving into shit with more molecular density   
than myself, nor the mission impossible 
reruns i sat before, nor the dead 
space inside only alcohol could fill and then   
         not even. but i miss 

the aftermath, the pure simplicity 
mouth parched, head hissing static. 
how little i asked of myself then--to suck   
the next breath, suffer the next heave, live   
till cocktail hour when i could mix 
         the next sickness. 

i locked the bathroom door, sat   
on the closed commode, shirtless, 
in filmy underpants telling myself that death   
could fit my grasp and be staved off   
while in the smeary shaving glass,   
i practiced the stillness of a soul 
         awaiting birth. 

for the real that swarmed beyond the door 
i was pure scorn, dead center of my stone and starless   
universe, orbited by no one. novitiate obliterate, saint   
absence, duchess of naught . . . 
a stinging ether folded me in mist. 

sometimes landing the head's pressure's enormous.   
when my plane tilts down, houses grow large, streets 
lose their clear geometry. the leafy earth soon fills my portal,   
and in the gray graveyard of cars, a stick figure 
becomes my son in royal blue cap flapping his arms   
as if to rise. thank god for our place 
in this forest of forms, for the gravitas 
that draws me back to him, and for how lightly 
         lightly i touch down.


on the mudroad of plodding american bodies, 
         my son wove like an antelope from stall   
to stall and want to want. i no'ed it all the wind-up 
         killer robot and winged alien knives   
hierarchical in a glass case the blow-up vinyl wolf 
         bobbing from a pilgrim's staff. 
lured as i was by the bar-b-que's black smoke, 
         i got in line. a hog carcass, 
blistered pink on a spit, made its agonized slow roll,   
         a metaphor, i thought, for anyone 
ahead of me--the pasty-faced and broad. i half-longed   
         for the titanium blade i'd just seen 
curved like a falcon's claw. some truth wanted cutting   
         in my neighbors' impermanent flesh. 
or so my poisoned soul announced, as if scorn   
         for the body politic 
weren't some outward form of inner scorn, 
         as if i were fit judge. 
lucky my son found the bumper cars. once i'd hoped   
         only to stand tall enough 
to drive my own. now when the master switch got thrown   
         and sparks skittered overhead 
in a lightning web, i felt like frankenstein or some   
         newly powered monster. 
plus the floor was glossy as ice. even rammed head-on, 
         the rubber bumper bounced you off unhurt 
and into other folks who didn't mind the jolt, whose faces 
         all broke smiles, in fact, 
till the perfect figure-eight i'd started out to execute 
         became itself an interruption. one face   
after another wheeled shining at me from the dark, 
         each bearing the weight of a whole self.   
what pure vessels we are, i thought, once our skulls 
         shut up their nasty talk. 
we drove home past corn at full tassel, colossal silos,   
         a windmill sentinel. summer was starting. 
my son's body slumped like a grain sack against mine.   
         my chest was all thunder. 
on the purple sky in rear view, fireworks unpacked--silver   
         chrysanthemum, another in fuchsia, 
then plum. each staccato boom shook the night. my son 
         jerked in his sleep. i prayed hard to keep   
the frail peace we hurtled through, to want no more 
         than what we had. the road 
rushed under us. our lush planet heaved toward day.   
         inside my hand's flesh, 
anybody's skeleton gripped the wheel.


this dry night, nothing unusual   
about the clip, clop, casual 

iron of his shoes as he stamps death 
like a mint on the innocent coinage of earth. 

i lift the window, watch the ambling feather 
of hock and fetlock, loosed from its daily tether 

in the tinker camp on the enniskerry road,   
pass, his breath hissing, his snuffling head 

down. he is gone. no great harm is done.   
only a leaf of our laurel hedge is torn-- 

of distant interest like a maimed limb,   
only a rose which now will never climb 

the stone of our house, expendable, a mere   
line of defence against him, a volunteer 

you might say, only a crocus, its bulbous head   
blown from growth, one of the screamless dead. 

but we, we are safe, our unformed fear 
of fierce commitment gone why should we care 

if a rose, a hedge, a crocus are uprooted   
like corpses, remote, crushed, mutilated? 

he stumbles on like a rumour of war, huge   
threatening. neighbours use the subterfuge 

of curtains. he stumbles down our short street   
thankfully passing us. i pause, wait, 

then to breathe relief lean on the sill   
and for a second only my blood is still 

with atavism. that rose he smashed frays   
ribboned across our hedge, recalling days 

of burned countryside, illicit braid 
a cause ruined before, a world betrayed.


. 

all knobs and knuckles, hammer knees and elbows   
they were a multitude of two, man and woman   
dwelling as one tight flesh. in hallways,   
on stairs vaguely lit by twilight, in their own   
meager bed they would collide. . . veer off. . . 
collide, like aging children aiming those   
bumper cars, madly in kansas coney islands. 
blue sparks jumped on their ceiling, lit her stockings   
strangling his faucet, his fist plumbing 
her shoulder's depth for blood. until, as it is told, 
they brought the cow into the house, straight from the barn,   
oppressed for years with milk. they tied it,   
lowing, to the icebox, pastured it 
on rubber plants and dusty philodendrons. 
they brought the horse in next, leaving the plow   
like an abandoned aircraft, nose down 
in rusting fields of corn. the pig, the donkey,   
the rooster with its crowd of hens, they even 
brought a neighbor's child complete with spelling words   
and scales that wandered up and down the untuned   
piano searching for roost as the chickens   
searched and the cow, nuzzling the humming   
frigidaire as if it were a calf. 


. 

so they survived with all that cuckoo's brood,   
hearing the horse stamp through the floorboards, 
the donkey chew the welcome mat, and all night long   
through tumbling barricades of sleep the yeasty   
rise and fall of breath. by blue television light   
they milked and gathered, boiled the placid eggs   
that turned up everywhere, laughed with the child,   
fed the pig, and glimpsed each other's rounded limbs 
reflected for a moment in the copper 
washtub or around the feathers of a settling hen.   
and winter passed and spring and summer, 
the child left first, all braided, for the school bus.   
the cow died of old griefs. the horse dreaming   
of harness, the pig of swill, the donkey 
of what magnitude of straw, broke out one night   
and emptied the ark. man and woman leaning   
on brooms stood at the kitchen door and waved,   
saw through a blaze of autumn the cock's comb   
like one last, bright leaf flutter and disappear.   
then jostling a bit, for ceremony's sake, 
they turned and lost themselves in so much space. 



on this first day of spring, snow 
covers the fruit trees, mingling improbably   
with the new blossoms like identical twins   
brought up in different hemispheres.   
it is not what housman meant 
when he wrote of the cherry 
hung with snow, though he also knew   
how death can mistake the seasons,   
and if he made it all sound pretty,   
that was our misreading 
in those high school classrooms 
where, drunk on boredom, we had to recite   
his poems. now the weather is always looming 

in the background, trying to become more   
than merely scenery, and though today   
it is telling us something 
we don't want to hear, it is all 
so unpredictable, so out of control 
that we might as well be children again,   
hearing the voices of thunder 
like baritone uncles shouting 
in the next room as we try to sleep,   
or hearing the silence of snow falling   
soft as a coverlet, even in springtime   
whispering relax, there is nothing   
you can possibly do about any of this. 



yesterday the bird of night did sit, even at noon-day, upon the marketplace, hooting and shrieking.  --william shakespeare 
. 

imagine waking 
to a scene of snow so new   
not even memories 
of other snow 
can mar its silken 
surface. what other innocence   
is quite like this, 
and who can blame me 
for refusing 
to violate such whiteness 
with the booted cruelty 
of tracks? 


. 

though i cannot leave this house,   
i have memorized the view 
from every window-- 
 framed landscapes, containing   
each nuance of weather and light.   
and i know the measure 
of every room, not as a prisoner   
pacing a cell 
but as the embryo knows 
the walls of the womb, free 
to swim as its body tells it, to nudge   
the softly fleshed walls, 
dreading only the moment 
of contraction when it will be forced   
into the gaudy world. 


. 

sometimes i travel as far 
as the last stone 
of the path, but 
every step, 
as in the children's story, 
pricks that tender place 
on the bottom of the foot, 
and like an ebbing tide with all 
the obsession of the moon behind it,   
i am dragged back. 


. 

i have noticed in windy fall 
how leaves are torn from the trees,   
each leaf waving goodbye to the oak   
or the poplar that housed it 
how the moon, pinned 
to the very center of the window, 
is like a moth wanting only to break in.   
what i mean is this house 
follows all the laws of lintel and ridgepole,   
obeys the commandments of broom   
and of needle, custom and grace. 
it is not fear that holds me here but passion   
and the uncrossable moat of moonlight   
outside the bolted doors. 



every city in america is approached 
through a work of art, usually a bridge 
but sometimes a road that curves underneath 
or drops down from the sky. pittsburgh has a tunnel-- 

you don't know it--that takes you through the rivers   
and under the burning hills. i went there to cry   
in the woods or carry my heavy bicycle 
through fire and flood. some have little parks-- 

san francisco has a park. albuquerque   
is beautiful from a distance it is purple 
at five in the evening. new york is egyptian,   
especially from the little rise on the hill 

at -c it has twelve entrances 
like the body of jesus, and easton, where i lived,   
has two small floating bridges in front of it   
that brought me in and out. i said good-bye 

to them both when i was . i'm reading 
joseph wood krutch again--the second time. 
i love how he lived in the desert. i'm looking at the skull   
of georgia o'keeffe. i'm kissing stieglitz good-bye. 

he was a city, stieglitz was truly a city 
in every sense of the word he wore a library   
across his chest he had a church on his knees.   
i'm kissing him good-bye he was, for me, 

the last true city after him there were   
only overpasses and shopping centers,   
little enclaves here and there, a skyscraper   
with nothing near it, maybe a meaningless turf 

where whores couldn't even walk, where nobody sits,   
where nobody either lies or runs either that   
or some pure desert a lizard under a boojum,   
a flower sucking the water out of a rock. 

what is the life of sadness worth, the bookstores   
lost, the drugstores buried, a man with a stick   
turning the bricks up, numbering the shards,   
dream twenty-one, dream twenty-two. i left 

with a glass of tears, a little artistic vial. 
i put it in my leather pockets next 
to my flask of scotch, my golden knife and my keys,   
my joyful poems and my t-shirts. stieglitz is there 

beside his famous number there is smoke 
and fire above his head some bowlegged painter   
is whispering in his ear some lady-in-waiting   
is taking down his words. i'm kissing stieglitz 

good-bye, my arms are wrapped around him, his photos   
are making me cry we're walking down fifth avenue   
we're looking for a pencil there is a girl 
standing against the wall--i'm shaking now 

when i think of her there are two buildings, one   
is in blackness, there is a dying poplar 
there is a light on the meadow there is a man 
on a sagging porch. i would have believed in everything.


how do you like to go up in a swing, 
   up in the air so blue? 
oh, i do think it the pleasantest thing 
   ever a child can do 

up in the air and over the wall, 
   till i can see so wide, 
rivers and trees and cattle and all 
   over the countryside-- 

till i look down on the garden green, 
   down on the roof so brown-- 
up in the air i go flying again, 
   up in the air and down


darkness the rain sluiced down the mire was deep   
it was past twelve on a mid-winter night, 
when peaceful folk in beds lay snug asleep   
there, with much work to do before the light,   
we lugged our clay-sucked boots as best we might   
along the trench sometimes a bullet sang,   
and droning shells burst with a hollow bang   
we were soaked, chilled and wretched, every one   
darkness the distant wink of a huge gun. 

i turned in the black ditch, loathing the storm   
a rocket fizzed and burned with blanching flare,   
and lit the face of what had been a form   
floundering in mirk. he stood before me there   
i say that he was christ stiff in the glare,   
and leaning forward from his burdening task,   
both arms supporting it his eyes on mine   
stared from the woeful head that seemed a mask   
of mortal pain in hell's unholy shine. 

no thorny crown, only a woollen cap 
he wore--an english soldier, white and strong,   
who loved his time like any simple chap,   
good days of work and sport and homely song   
now he has learned that nights are very long,   
and dawn a watching of the windowed sky.   
but to the end, unjudging, he'll endure   
horror and pain, not uncontent to die   
that lancaster on lune may stand secure. 

he faced me, reeling in his weariness, 
shouldering his load of planks, so hard to bear.   
i say that he was christ, who wrought to bless   
all groping things with freedom bright as air,   
and with his mercy washed and made them fair.   
then the flame sank, and all grew black as pitch,   
while we began to struggle along the ditch   
and someone flung his burden in the muck,   
mumbling o christ almighty, now i'm stuck'


soldiers are citizens of death's grey land, 
drawing no dividend from time's to-morrows.   
in the great hour of destiny they stand, 
each with his feuds, and jealousies, and sorrows.   
soldiers are sworn to action they must win   
some flaming, fatal climax with their lives. 
soldiers are dreamers when the guns begin 
they think of firelit homes, clean beds and wives. 

i see them in foul dug-outs, gnawed by rats, 
and in the ruined trenches, lashed with rain,   
dreaming of things they did with balls and bats, 
and mocked by hopeless longing to regain   
bank-holidays, and picture shows, and spats, 
and going to the office in the train. 



tossed on the glittering air they soar and skim,   
whose voices make the emptiness of light   
a windy palace. quavering from the brim   
of dawn, and bold with song at edge of night,   
they clutch their leafy pinnacles and sing   
scornful of man, and from his toils aloof 
whose heart's a haunted woodland whispering   
whose thoughts return on tempest-baffled wing   
who hears the cry of god in everything,   
and storms the gate of nothingness for proof. 



'twas the night before christmas, when all through the house 
not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse 
the stockings were hung by the chimney with care, 
in hopes that st. nicholas soon would be there 
the children were nestled all snug in their beds 
while visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads 
and mamma in her 'kerchief, and i in my cap, 
had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap, 
when out on the lawn there arose such a clatter, 
i sprang from my bed to see what was the matter. 
away to the window i flew like a flash, 
tore open the shutters and threw up the sash. 
the moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow, 
gave a lustre of midday to objects below, 
when what to my wondering eyes did appear, 
but a miniature sleigh and eight tiny rein-deer, 
with a little old driver so lively and quick, 
i knew in a moment he must be st. nick. 
more rapid than eagles his coursers they came, 
and he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name 
now, dasher now, dancer now prancer and vixen 
on, comet on, cupid on, donder and blixen 
to the top of the porch to the top of the wall 
now dash away dash away dash away all 
as leaves that before the wild hurricane fly, 
when they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky 
so up to the housetop the coursers they flew 
with the sleigh full of toys, and st. nicholas too-- 
and then, in a twinkling, i heard on the roof 
the prancing and pawing of each little hoof. 
as i drew in my head, and was turning around, 
down the chimney st. nicholas came with a bound. 
he was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot, 
and his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot 
a bundle of toys he had flung on his back, 
and he looked like a pedler just opening his pack. 
his eyes--how they twinkled his dimples, how merry 
his cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry 
his droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow, 
and the beard on his chin was as white as the snow 
the stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth, 
and the smoke, it encircled his head like a wreath 
he had a broad face and a little round belly 
that shook when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly. 
he was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf, 
and i laughed when i saw him, in spite of myself 
a wink of his eye and a twist of his head 
soon gave me to know i had nothing to dread 
he spoke not a word, but went straight to his work, 
and filled all the stockings then turned with a jerk, 
and laying his finger aside of his nose, 
and giving a nod, up the chimney he rose 
he sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle, 
and away they all flew like the down of a thistle. 
but i heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight-- 
happy christmas to all, and to all a good night


adam, a brown old vulture in the rain,   
shivered below his wind-whipped olive-trees   
huddling sharp chin on scarred and scraggy knees,   
he moaned and mumbled to his darkening brain   
he was the grandest of them all--was cain   
a lion laired in the hills, that none could tire   
swift as a stag a stallion of the plain, 
hungry and fierce with deeds of huge desire.' 

grimly he thought of abel, soft and fair-- 
a lover with disaster in his face, 
and scarlet blossom twisted in bright hair.   
afraid to fight was murder more disgrace? ... 
god always hated cain' ... he bowed his head-- 
the gaunt wild man whose lovely sons were dead.


when i have heard small talk about great men   
i climb to bed light my two candles then 
consider what was said and put aside 
what such-a-one remarked and someone-else replied. 

they have spoken lightly of my deathless friends, 
lamps for my gloom, hands guiding where i stumble,   
quoting, for shallow conversational ends, 
what shelley shrilled, what blake once wildly muttered .... 

how can they use such names and be not humble?   
i have sat silent angry at what they uttered. 
the dead bequeathed them life the dead have said   
what these can only memorize and mumble.


along the grave green downs, this idle afternoon,   
shadows of loitering silver clouds, becalmed in blue,   
bring, like unfoldment of a flower, the best of june. 

shadows outspread in spacious movement, always you   
have dappled the downs and valleys at this time of year,   
while larks, ascending shrill, praised freedom as they flew.   
now, through that song, a fighter-squadron's drone i hear   
from scratchbury camp, whose turfed and cowslip'd rampart seems 
more hill than history, ageless and oblivion-blurred. 

i walk the fosse, once manned by bronze and flint-head spear   
on war's imperious wing the shafted sun-ray gleams   
one with the warm sweet air of summer stoops the bird. 

cloud shadows, drifting slow like heedless daylight dreams,   
dwell and dissolve uncircumstanced they pause and pass.   
i watch them go. my horse, contented, crops the grass.


go your seeking, soul. 
mine the proven path of time's foretelling.   
yours accordance with some mysteried whole.   
i am but your passion-haunted dwelling. 

bring what news you can, 
stranger, loved of body's humbled heart.   
say one whispered word to mortal man   
from that peace whereof he claims you part. 

hither-hence, my guest, 
blood and bone befriend, where you abide   
till withdrawn to share some timeless quest.   
i am but the brain that dreamed and died.


hurt, hurtful, snake-charmed, 
struck white together half an hour we tear   
through the half-dark after 

some sweet core,   
under, over gravity,   
some white shore ... 

spin, hidden one, spin, 
trusted to me laugh sore tooth   
sucked warm, sweet sweet wine 

running cool through new 
dry shrewd turnings of my soul,   
opening veins. 

gull-feathers beating,   
beating gliding. still,   
sidelong eye ... wings beating 

like words against my eyes.   
and your eyes-- 
o brother-animal, mild, 

terrible--your eyes wait, have been waiting,   
knowing, 
unknowable, on that sky shore. 

a life is waiting.   
its webbed hand   
reached out ... 

trust me 
truth- 
telling fish of the sky 

your hand beyond my hand,   
your phosphorous trail   
broken, lost. 



in my sleep 
fell at his feet         wanted to eat him right up   
would have         but 
even better 
he talked to me. 

did i ask you to? 
were those words my blood-sucking too? 

now i will have a body again 
move differently, easier         back to the plan   
a little house         a woman and a man 

crossed against yours my soul will show   
glow through my breastbone 
back down into the kitchen 
yours 

here         i will save you 
others have failed, even died, but i 
will save you         you save me         devour me away   
up 

woke up 
i can cry but i can't wake up 
today again         don't answer the door   
then did         couldn't look at you talk 
couldn't place the bed in the room, or where the room was   
when i closed my eyes 

this is the same old knife         my knife 
i know it as well as i know my own mouth   
it will be lying there on the desk if 

i open my eyes i will know the room very well 
there will be the little thrown-out globe of blood we left   
and every molecule of every object here will swell   
with life. and someone will be at the door. 




people pray to each other. the way i say you to someone else,  respectfully, intimately, desperately. the way someone says  you to me, hopefully, expectantly, intensely ... --huub oosterhuis 
you       who i don't know       i don't know how to talk to you   

--what is it like for you there? 

here ... well, wanting solitude and talk friendship-- 
the uses of solitude. to imagine to hear. 
learning braille. to imagine other solitudes. 
but they will not be mine 
to wait, in the quiet not to scatter the voices-- 

what are you afraid of? 

what will happen. all this leaving. and meetings, yes. but death.   
what happens when you die? 

... not scatter the voices, 

drown out. not make a house, out of my own words. to be quiet in   
another throat other eyes listen for what it is like there. what   
word. what silence. allowing. uncertain to drift, in the 
restlessness ... repose. to run like water-- 

what is it like there, right now? 

listen the crowding of the street the room. everyone hunches in   
against the crowding holding their breath against dread. 

what do you dread? 

what happens when you die? 

what do you dread, in this room, now? 

not listening. now. not watching. safe inside my own skin. 
to die, not having listened. not having asked ... to have scattered   
life. 

yes i know the thread you have to keep finding, over again, to   
follow it back to life i know. impossible, sometimes.


orange peels, burned letters, the car lights shining on the grass, 
everything goes somewhere--and everything we do--nothing
ever disappears. but changes. the roar of the sun in photographs. 
inching shorelines. ice lines. the cells of our skin our meetings, 
our solitudes. our eyes.

a bee careens at the window here flies out, released a life 
without harm, without shame.       that woman, my friend, 
circling against her life, a married life that man, my friend, 
solitary, anarchic, driving away from home them driving, to each 
other--

i know, the hard, half-lost, knowing will the cold first loneliness 
again, outside the commonweal, unmoving

but to say, i know--is there any touch in it?

         the words in my dream actuarial file. actuary, . a registrar or 
         notary, who keeps records of the acts of a court ...

to be there to listen not invade. another solitude ...

i watch her face. the lines of will, kindness, hunger. silence. she 
moves from one thing to another thing in the kitchen, looks out 
the window at the other apartment windows ... a woman moves 
around, across the courtyard, making supper. how many people is 
she making supper for? now the woman waters the plants. what 
is she thinking about. her head, her arm, look peaceful ...

everything that happens, happens once and for all. is this true? 
if so, what then?

yes. your story all of your hope what you do, breaks. changes. 
if so, what then? nothing disappears. and you do last

the words in the open page of her notebook, i'm so cold. my 
head hurts.

come stay here, at my place, a while.--someday we will be able 
to say, i did this thing i did that other thing i was that woman.
someday, we will be able to take it in, that violence, hold it in our 
hands ... and the ones who come after us, maybe they can 
understand us forgive us as we do forgive our parents, our 
grandparents, moving so distantly through their lives ... their 
silences ...
and the ones we were with      maybe our friendship can change, 
can mend ...

come stay here. things change ...

she stays home

not to invade       wait, here, in the quiet


child 
you've boarded me over like a window or a well. 

mother 
it was autumn 
i couldn't hear the students 
only the music coming in the window,   
se tu m'ami 
if you love me 

i went for a week's journey in soft ermine.   
darling, the ovals of your hair ... 
autumn leaves, 
your hair the hue of rain-drenched bark, your voice 

don't ever leave me ... 

and this child, this 
window in my side, 
boarded over all my life, 
--how can i take the boards off, in this wind?   
i will break if i bend ...


part one 

the wind was a torrent of darkness among the gusty trees.   
the moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas.   
the road was a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor,   
and the highwayman came riding-- 
         riding--riding-- 
the highwayman came riding, up to the old inn-door. 

he'd a french cocked-hat on his forehead, a bunch of lace at his chin,   
a coat of the claret velvet, and breeches of brown doe-skin. 
they fitted with never a wrinkle. his boots were up to the thigh.   
and he rode with a jewelled twinkle, 
         his pistol butts a-twinkle, 
his rapier hilt a-twinkle, under the jewelled sky. 

over the cobbles he clattered and clashed in the dark inn-yard. 
he tapped with his whip on the shutters, but all was locked and barred.   
he whistled a tune to the window, and who should be waiting there   
but the landlord's black-eyed daughter, 
         bess, the landlord's daughter, 
plaiting a dark red love-knot into her long black hair. 

and dark in the dark old inn-yard a stable-wicket creaked 
where tim the ostler listened. his face was white and peaked.   
his eyes were hollows of madness, his hair like mouldy hay,   
but he loved the landlord's daughter, 
         the landlord's red-lipped daughter. 
dumb as a dog he listened, and he heard the robber say-- 

one kiss, my bonny sweetheart, i'm after a prize to-night, 
but i shall be back with the yellow gold before the morning light 
yet, if they press me sharply, and harry me through the day,   
then look for me by moonlight, 
         watch for me by moonlight, 
i'll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way. 

he rose upright in the stirrups. he scarce could reach her hand, 
but she loosened her hair in the casement. his face burnt like a brand 
as the black cascade of perfume came tumbling over his breast   
and he kissed its waves in the moonlight, 
         o, sweet black waves in the moonlight 
then he tugged at his rein in the moonlight, and galloped away to the west. 

part two 

he did not come in the dawning. he did not come at noon   
and out of the tawny sunset, before the rise of the moon,   
when the road was a gypsy's ribbon, looping the purple moor,   
a red-coat troop came marching-- 
         marching--marching-- 
king george's men came marching, up to the old inn-door. 

they said no word to the landlord. they drank his ale instead.   
but they gagged his daughter, and bound her, to the foot of her narrow bed. 
two of them knelt at her casement, with muskets at their side   
there was death at every window 
         and hell at one dark window 
for bess could see, through her casement, the road that he would ride. 

they had tied her up to attention, with many a sniggering jest. 
they had bound a musket beside her, with the muzzle beneath her breast 
now, keep good watch and they kissed her. she heard the doomed man say-- 
look for me by moonlight 
         watch for me by moonlight 
i'll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way 

she twisted her hands behind her but all the knots held good 
she writhed her hands till her fingers were wet with sweat or blood   
they stretched and strained in the darkness, and the hours crawled by like years 
till, now, on the stroke of midnight, 
         cold, on the stroke of midnight, 
the tip of one finger touched it the trigger at least was hers 

the tip of one finger touched it. she strove no more for the rest.   
up, she stood up to attention, with the muzzle beneath her breast.   
she would not risk their hearing she would not strive again   
for the road lay bare in the moonlight 
         blank and bare in the moonlight 
and the blood of her veins, in the moonlight, throbbed to her love's refrain. 

tlot-tlot tlot-tlot had they heard it? the horsehoofs ringing clear   
tlot-tlot tlot-tlot, in the distance? were they deaf that they did not hear? 
down the ribbon of moonlight, over the brow of the hill, 
the highwayman came riding-- 
         riding--riding-- 
the red coats looked to their priming she stood up, straight and still. 

tlot-tlot, in the frosty silence tlot-tlot, in the echoing night   
nearer he came and nearer. her face was like a light. 
her eyes grew wide for a moment she drew one last deep breath,   
then her finger moved in the moonlight, 
         her musket shattered the moonlight, 
shattered her breast in the moonlight and warned him--with her death. 

he turned. he spurred to the west he did not know who stood   
bowed, with her head o'er the musket, drenched with her own blood   
not till the dawn he heard it, and his face grew grey to hear   
how bess, the landlord's daughter, 
         the landlord's black-eyed daughter, 
had watched for her love in the moonlight, and died in the darkness there. 

back, he spurred like a madman, shouting a curse to the sky, 
with the white road smoking behind him and his rapier brandished high. 
blood red were his spurs in the golden noon wine-red was his velvet coat 
when they shot him down on the highway, 
         down like a dog on the highway, 
and he lay in his blood on the highway, with a bunch of lace at his throat. 

.       .       . 

and still of a winter's night, they say, when the wind is in the trees, 
when the moon is a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas,   
when the road is a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor,   
a highwayman comes riding-- 
         riding--riding-- 
a highwayman comes riding, up to the old inn-door. 

over the cobbles he clatters and clangs in the dark inn-yard. 
he taps with his whip on the shutters, but all is locked and barred.   
he whistles a tune to the window, and who should be waiting there   
but the landlord's black-eyed daughter, 
         bess, the landlord's daughter, 
plaiting a dark red love-knot into her long black hair. 



i 
the owl and the pussy-cat went to sea 
   in a beautiful pea-green boat, 
they took some honey, and plenty of money, 
   wrapped up in a five-pound note. 
the owl looked up to the stars above, 
   and sang to a small guitar, 
o lovely pussy o pussy, my love, 
    what a beautiful pussy you are, 
         you are, 
         you are 
what a beautiful pussy you are 

ii 
pussy said to the owl, you elegant fowl 
   how charmingly sweet you sing 
o let us be married too long we have tarried 
   but what shall we do for a ring? 
they sailed away, for a year and a day, 
   to the land where the bong-tree grows 
and there in a wood a piggy-wig stood 
   with a ring at the end of his nose, 
             his nose, 
             his nose, 
   with a ring at the end of his nose. 

iii 
dear pig, are you willing to sell for one shilling 
   your ring? said the piggy, i will. 
so they took it away, and were married next day 
   by the turkey who lives on the hill. 
they dined on mince, and slices of quince, 
   which they ate with a runcible spoon   
and hand in hand, on the edge of the sand, 
   they danced by the light of the moon, 
             the moon, 
             the moon, 
they danced by the light of the moon.


from macbeth
double, double toil and trouble 
fire burn and caldron bubble. 
fillet of a fenny snake, 
in the caldron boil and bake 
eye of newt and toe of frog, 
wool of bat and tongue of dog, 
adder's fork and blind-worm's sting, 
lizard's leg and howlet's wing, 
for a charm of powerful trouble, 
like a hell-broth boil and bubble. 

double, double toil and trouble 
fire burn and caldron bubble. 
cool it with a baboon's blood, 
then the charm is firm and good.


in winter i get up at night
and dress by yellow candle-light.
in summer, quite the other way,
i have to go to bed by day.

i have to go to bed and see
the birds still hopping on the tree,
or hear the grown-up people's feet
still going past me in the street.

and does it not seem hard to you,
when all the sky is clear and blue,
and i should like so much to play,
to have to go to bed by day?


when i was down beside the sea
a wooden spade they gave to me
   to dig the sandy shore.
my holes were empty like a cup.
in every hole the sea came up
   till it could come no more.


i have a little shadow that goes in and out with me, 
and what can be the use of him is more than i can see. 
he is very, very like me from the heels up to the head 
and i see him jump before me, when i jump into my bed. 

the funniest thing about him is the way he likes to grow-- 
not at all like proper children, which is always very slow 
for he sometimes shoots up taller like an india-rubber ball, 
and he sometimes gets so little that there's none of him at all. 

he hasn't got a notion of how children ought to play, 
and can only make a fool of me in every sort of way. 
he stays so close beside me, he's a coward you can see 
i'd think shame to stick to nursie as that shadow sticks to me 

one morning, very early, before the sun was up, 
i rose and found the shining dew on every buttercup 
but my lazy little shadow, like an arrant sleepy-head, 
had stayed at home behind me and was fast asleep in bed.


who has seen the wind? 
 neither i nor you 
but when the leaves hang trembling, 
 the wind is passing through. 

who has seen the wind? 
 neither you nor i 
but when the trees bow down their heads, 
 the wind is passing by.


what is pink? a rose is pink 
by a fountain's brink. 
what is red? a poppy's red 
in its barley bed. 
what is blue? the sky is blue 
where the clouds float thro'. 
what is white? a swan is white 
sailing in the light. 
what is yellow? pears are yellow, 
rich and ripe and mellow. 
what is green? the grass is green, 
with small flowers between. 
what is violet? clouds are violet 
in the summer twilight. 
what is orange? why, an orange, 
just an orange


love is no more.
it died as the mind dies the pure desire 
relinquishing the blissful form it wore, 
the ample joy and clarity expire.

regret is vain.
then do not grieve for what you would efface, 
the sudden failure of the past, the pain 
of its unwilling change, and the disgrace.

leave innocence,
and modify your nature by the grief 
which poses to the will indifference 
that no desire is permanent in sense.

take leave of me.
what recompense, or pity, or deceit 
can cure, or what assumed serenity 
conceal the mortal loss which we repeat?

the mind will change, and change shall be relief.




the autumn shade is thin. grey leaves lie faint 
where they will lie, and, where the thick green was, 
light stands up, like a presence, to the sky. 
the trees seem merely shadows of its age. 
from off the hill, i hear the logging crew, 
the furious and indifferent saw, the slow 
response of heavy pine and i recall 
that goddesses have died when their trees died. 
often in summer, drinking from the spring, 
i sensed in its cool breath and in its voice 
a living form, darker than any shade 
and without feature, passionate, yet chill 
with lust to fix in ice the buoyant rim--
ancient of days, the mother of us all. 
now, toward his destined passion there, the strong, 
vivid young man, reluctant, may return 
from suffering in his own experience 
to lie down in the darkness. in this time, 
i stay in doors. i do my work. i sleep. 
each morning, when i wake, i assent to wake. 
the shadow of my fist moves on this page, 
though, even now, in the wood, beneath a bank, 
coiled in the leaves and cooling rocks, the snake 
does as it must, and sinks into the cold.


nights grow colder. the hunter and the bear 
follow their tranquil course outside my window. 
i feel the gentian waiting in the wood, 
blossoms waxy and blue, and blue-green stems 
of the amaryllis waiting in the garden. 
i know, as though i waited what they wait, 
the cold that fastens ice about the root, 
a heavenly form, the same in all its changes, 
inimitable, terrible, and still,
and beautiful as frost. fire warms my room.
its light declares my books and pictures. gently, 
a dead soprano sings mozart and bach. 
i drink bourbon, then go to bed, and sleep 
in the promethean heat of summer's essence.


awakened by some fear, i watch the sky. 
compelled as though by purposes they know, 
the stars, in their blue distance, still affirm 
the bond of heaven and earth, the ancient way. 
this old assurance haunts small creatures, dazed 
in icy mud, though cold may freeze them there 
and leave them as they are all summer long. 
i cannot sleep. passion and consequence, 
the brutal given, and all i have desired 
evade me, and the lucid majesty
that warmed the dull barbarian to life. 
so i lie here, left with self-consciousness, 
enemy whom i love but whom his change 
and his forgetfulness again compel, 
impassioned, toward my lost indifference, 
faithful, but to an absence. who shares my bed? 
who lies beside me, certain of his waking, 
led sleeping, by his own dream, to the day?


if i ask you, angel, will you come and lead 
this ache to speech, or carry me, like a child, 
to riot? ever young, you come of age 
remote, a pledge of distances, this pang 
i notice at dusk, watching you subside
from tree-tops and from fields. mysterious self, 
image of the fabulous alien,
even in sleep you summon me, even there, 
when, under his native tree, odysseus hears 
his own incredible past and future, whispered 
by wisdom, but by wisdom in disguise.


thinking of a bravura deed, a place 
sacred to a divinity, an old
verse that seems new, i postulate a man 
mastered by his own image of himself. 
who is it says, i am? sensuous angel,
vessel of nerve and blood, the impoverished heir 
of an awareness other than his own? 
not these, but one to come? for there he is, 
in a steel helmet, raging, fearing his death, 
carrying bread and water to a quiet, 
placing ten sounds together in one sound 
confirming his election, or merely still, 
sleeping, or in a colloquy with the sun.


snow and then rain. the roads are wet. a car 
slips and strains in the mire, and i remember 
driving in france weapons-carriers and jeeps
our clothes and bodies stiffened by mud our minds 
diverted from fear. we labor. overhead, 
a plane, berlin or frankfurt, now new york. 
the car pulls clear. my neighbor smiles. he is old. 
was this our wisdom, simply, in a chance, 
in danger, to be mastered by a task,
like groping round a chair, through a door, to bed?


a dormant season, and, under the dripping tree, 
not sovereign, ordering nothing, letting the past 
do with me as it will, i savor place 
and weather, air and sun. though hercules 
confronts his nature in his deed, repeats 
his purposes, and is his will, intact, 
magnificent, and memorable, i try 
the simplest forms of our old poverty. 
i seek no end appointed in my absence 
beyond the silence i already share.


i drive home with the books that i will read. 
the streets are harsh with traffic. where i once 
played as a boy amid old stands of pine, 
row after row of houses. lined by the new 
debris of wealth and power, the broken road. 
then miles of red clay bank and frugal ground. 
at last, in the minor hills, my father's place, 
where i can find my way as in a thought-- 
gardens, the trees we planted, all we share.
a cherokee trail runs north to summer hunting. 
i see it, when i look up from the page.


in nameless warmth, sun light in every corner, 
bending my body over my glowing book, 
i share the room. is it with a voice or touch 
or look, as of an absence, learned by love, 
now, merely mine? annunciation, specter
of the worn out, lost, or broken, telling what future. 
what vivid loss to come, you change the room 
and him who reads here. restless, he will stir, 
look round, and see the room renewed and line, 
color, and shape as, in desire, they are, 
not shadows but substantial light, explicit, 
bright as glass, inexhaustible, and true.


o

my shadow moves, until, at noon, i stand 
within its seal, as in the finished past.
but in the place where effect and cause are joined, 
in the warmth or cold of my remembering, 
of love, of partial freedom, the time to be 
trembles and glitters again in windy light. 
for nothing is disposed. the slow soft wind 
tilting the blood-root keeps its gentle edge. 
the intimate cry, both sinister and tender, 
once heard, is heard confined in its reserve. 
my image of myself, apart, informed 
by many deaths, resists me, and i stay 
almost as i have been, intact, aware, 
alive, though proud and cautious, even afraid.


all winter long you listened for the boom 
of distant cannon wheeled into their place. 
sometimes outside beneath a bombers' moon 
you stood alone to watch the searchlights trace

their careful webs against the boding sky, 
while miles away on munich's vacant square 
the bombs lunged down with an unruly cry 
whose blast you saw yet could but faintly hear.

and might have turned your eyes upon the gleam 
of a thousand years of snow, where near the clouds 
the alps ride massive to their full extreme, 
and season after season glacier crowds

the dark, persistent smudge of conifers.
or seen beyond the hedge and through the trees 
the shadowy forms of cattle on the furze,
their dim coats white with mist against the freeze.

or thought instead of other times than these, 
of other countries and of other sights 
eternal venice sinking by degrees
into the very water that she lights

reflected in canals, the lucid dome 
of maria della salute at your feet,
her triple spires disfigured by the foam. 
remembered in berlin the parks, the neat

footpaths and lawns, the clean spring foliage, 
where just short weeks before, a bomb, unaimed, 
released a frightened lion from its cage,
which in the mottled dark that trees enflamed

killed one who hurried homeward from the raid. 
and by yourself there standing in the chill
you must, with so much known, have been afraid 
and chosen such a mind of constant will,

which, though all time corrode with constant hurt, 
remains, until it occupies no space,
that which it is and passionless, inert,
becomes at last no meaning and no place.


i summon up panofskv from his bed   
    among the famous dead 
to build a tomb which, since i am not read,   
suffers the stone's mortality instead 

which, by the common iconographies   
    of simple visual ease, 
usurps the place of the complexities 
of sound survivors once preferred to noise 

monkeys fixed on one bough, an almost holy   
    nightmarish sloth, a tree 
of parrots in a pride of family, 
immortal skunks, unaromatically 

some deaf bats in a cave, a porcupine   
    quill-less, a superfine 
flightless eagle, and, after them, a line   
of geese, unnavigating by design 

dogs in the frozen haloes of their barks,   
    a hundred porous arks 
aground and lost, where elephants like quarks   
ape mother mules or imitation sharks-- 

and each of them half-venerated by   
    a mob, impartially 
scaled, finned, or feathered, all before a dry   
unable mouth, symmetrically awry. 

but how shall i, in my brief space, describe   
    a tomb so vast, a tribe 
so desperately existent for a scribe 
knowingly of the fashions' diatribe, 

i who have sought time's memory afoot,   
    grateful for every root 
of trees that fill the garden with their fruit,   
their fragrance and their shade? even as i do it, 

i see myself unnoticed on the stair 
    that, underneath a clear 
welcome of bells, had promised me a fair   
attentive hearing's joy, sometime, somewhere.


who is apollo? college student
how shall a generation know its story   
if it will know no other? when, among   
the scoffers at the institute, pasteur 
heard one deny the cause of child-birth fever,   
indignantly he drew upon the blackboard,   
for all to see, the streptococcus chain.   
his mind was like odysseus and plato   
exploring a new cosmos in the old   
as if he wrote a poem--his enemy 
suffering, disease, and death, the battleground   
his introspection. science and peace, he said,   
will win out over ignorance and war,   
but then, the virus mutant in his vein, 
death to the prussian and revenge, revenge 

how shall my generation tell its story?   
their fathers jobless, boys for the ccc 
and nya, the future like a stairwell 
to floors without a window or a door, 
and then the army bayonet drill and foxhole   
bombing to rubble cities with textbook names   
later to bulldoze streets for their green bodies   
drowned in the greener surfs of rumored france. 
my childhood friend, george humphreys, whom i still see 
still ten years old, his uncombed hair and grin   
moment by moment in the hrtgen dark   
until the one step full in the sniper's sight,   
his pastor father emptied by the grief.   
clark harrison, at nineteen a survivor,   
never to walk or have a child or be   
a senator or governor. herr wegner,   
who led his little troop, their standards high   
and sabers drawn, against a panzer corps,   
emerging from among the shades at dachau 
stacked like firewood for someone else to burn   
and gerd radomski, listening to broadcasts   
of names, a yearlong babel of the missing, 
to find his wife and children. then they came home,   
near middle age at twenty-two, to find   
a new reunion of the church and state,   
cynical constantines who need no name,   
domestic tranquility beaten to a sword,   
sons wasted by another lie in asia,   
or strangeloves they had feared that august day   
and they like runners, stung, behind a flag,   
running within a circle, bereft of joy. 

hearing of the disaster at sedan 
and the retreat worse than the one from moscow,   
their son among the missing or the dead,   
pasteur and his wife mary hired a carriage   
and, traveling to the east where he might try   
his way to paris, stopping to ask each youth   
and comfort every orphan of the state's   
irascibility, found him at last 
and, unsurprised, embraced and took him in.   
two wars later, the prussian, once again   
the son of mars, in paris, joseph meister-- 
the first boy cured of rabies, now the keeper   
of pasteur's mausoleum--when commanded   
to open it for them, though over seventy,   
lest he betray the master, took his life. 

i like to think of pasteur in elysium   
beneath the sunny pine of ripe provence   
tenderly raising black sheep, butterflies,   
silkworms, and a new culture, for delight,   
teaching his daughter to use a microscope 
and musing through a wonder--sacred passion,   
practice and metaphysic all the same. 
and, each year, honor three births valry,   
humbling his pride by trying to write well,   
mozart, who lives still, keeping my attention   
repeatedly outside the reach of pride,   
and him whose mark i witness as a trust.   
others he saves but could not save himself-- 
socrates, galen, hippocrates--the spirit   
fastened by love upon the human cross.


with their harsh leaves old rhododendrons fill 
the crevices in grave plots' broken stones. 
the bees renew the blossoms they destroy, 
while in the burning air the pines rise still, 
commemorating long forgotten biers.
their roots replace the semblance of these bones.

the weight of cool, of imperceptible dust 
that came from nothing and to nothing came 
is light within the earth and on the air.
the change that so renews itself is just.
the enormous, sundry platitude of death
is for these bones, bees, trees, and leaves the same.

and splayed upon the ground and through the trees 
the mountains' shadow fills and cools the air, 
smoothing the shape of headstones to the earth. 
the rhododendrons suffer with the bees 
whose struggles loose ripe petals to the earth, 
the heaviest burden it shall ever bear.

our hard earned knowledge fits us for such sleep. 
although the spring must come, it passes too 
to form the burden suffered for what comes. 
whatever we would give our souls to keep 
is merely part of what we call the soul
what we of time would threaten to undo

all time in its slow scrutiny has done.
for on the grass that starts about the feet 
the body's shadow turns, to shape in time, 
soon grown preponderant with creeping shade, 
the final shadow that is turn of earth
and what seems won paid for as in defeat.


her unawed face, whose pose so long assumed 
is touched with what reality we feel,
bends to itself and, to itself resumed,
restores a tender fiction to the real.

and in her artful posture movement lies 
whose timeless motion flesh must so conceal 
yet what her pose conceals we might surmise 
and might pretend to gather from her eyes

the final motion flesh gives up to art. 
but slowly, if we watch her long enough,
the nerves grow subtler, and she moves apart

into a space too dim with time and blood 
for our set eyes to follow true enough,
or nerves to guess about her, if they would.


bavaria, 
the clairvoyante, a major general's wife, 
the secretaries' sibyl, read the letters
they brought her from their gi soldier-lovers, 
interpreting the script. i went along
one afternoon with writing of my own. 
this writing is by one you cannot trust, 
she frowned, and all the secretaries smiled.
but when she took my palm, she read the brown 
fingers for too much smoking and the lines 
of time and fate for a long and famous life.
soon you will take a trip by land and sea. 
across the hall, her husband, half asleep 
and propped high on his pillows, when i bent 
to shake his hand, seeing my uniform, 
called in a whisper as if he still dreamed, 
i told him not to go to russia then, 
remembering the woman at my jeep,
among the smoking tanks and half-tracks, crying, 
my husband fell in russia i thought i saw 
for him the summer uniforms in snow, 
partisans, savage reprisals, day-long strafing, 
long lines of prisoners never to return, 
comrades armless, legless, and blind. but he, 
clutching my sleeve to pull me closer, whispered, 
it was the ss did it, not my men.
the week before the armistice, they took 
three just-conscripted boys who were afraid
and hanged them, german children, the sky green 
above the uniforms too big for them, 
as we saw when we found and cut them down. 
it was then that i despaired to live or die. 
the secretaries waiting with their coats on, 
she thanked me for my visit, and, next week 
bring cigarettes and coffee, please, she said.


walking back to the office after lunch,
i saw hans. mister isham, mister isham,
he called out in his hurry, herr wegner needs you. 
a woman waiting for a border pass
took poison, she is dead, and the police 
are there to take the body. in the hall, 
the secretaries stood outside their doors 
silently waiting with wegner. sir, he said, 
it was her answer on the questionnaire, 
a clerk for the gestapo. so it was.
within the outer office, by the row
of wooden chairs, one lying on its side, 
on the discolored brown linoleum floor 
under a gi blanket was the lost
unmoving shape uncovered, from a fold, 
a dirty foot half out of a dirty shoe,
once white, heel bent, the sole worn through, the skin 
bruised red and calloused, uncut toenails curved 
and veined like an old ivory. no one spoke. 
police stood at attention by a stretcher. 
after an empty moment, suddenly
bent over as if taken by a cramp,
i sobbed out loud and, on my uniform, 
vomited up my lunch--over the tie,
the polished buttons and insignia,
the little strips of color and the green 
eisenhower jacket with its eagle patch,
the taut pants in a crease, the glistening jump-boots--
vomiting and still sobbing, like a child 
awakened in the night, and sick. wegner and hans 
held me, murmuring, ach, dear sir, the war 
is over and not over, such things happen.
while no one else moved, frau schmidt brought a towel
to clean me off before hans walked me back,
my arm across his shoulders and i retelling 
the story of how, near zell am see, we found, 
hung from a tree in leaf, the final sack
of bones, in rotted wehrmacht green. in the house 
an ss lord had furnished for his mistress-- 
deep sofas, persian rugs, and velvet drapes--
frau knig took my clothes. in my own room, 
wearing the gucci robe bouchard had taken 
from a fine house before we got to ulm,
instead of lying down to rest, i studied
the book i read for german with frau schmidt, 
goethe's italian journey. through the window,
the watchman's upper slopes were shadows, green 
and purple with the afternoon, its snows
melting, its double peaks the victory sign.


. 

if that someone who's me yet not me yet who judges me is always with me,    
as he is, shouldn't he have been there when i said so long ago that thing i said?   

if he who rakes me with such not trivial shame for minor sins now were there then,   
shouldn't he have warned me he'd even now devastate me for my unpardonable affront?   

i'm a child then, yet already i've composed this conscience-beast, who harries me   
is there anything else i can say with certainty about who i was, except that i, that he,   

could already draw from infinitesimal transgressions complex chords of remorse,   
and orchestrate ever undiminishing retribution from the hapless rest of myself?   

 

the son of some friends of my parents has died, and my parents, paying their call,   
take me along, and i'm sent out with the dead boy's brother and some others to play.   

we're joking around, and some words come to my mind, which to my amazement are said.   
how do you know when you can laugh when somebody dies, your brother dies? 

is what's said, and the others go quiet, the backyard goes quiet, everyone stares,   
and i want to know now why that someone in me who's me yet not me let me say it.   

shouldn't he have told me the contrition cycle would from then be ever upon me,   
it didn't matter that i'd really only wanted to know how grief ends, and when?   

 

i could hear the boy's mother sobbing inside, then stopping, sobbing then stopping.   
was the end of her grief already there? had her someone in her told her it would end?   

was her someone in her kinder to her, not tearing at her, as mine did, still does, me,   
for guessing grief someday ends? is that why her sobbing stopped sometimes?   

she didn't laugh, though, or i never heard her. how do you know when you can laugh? 
why couldn't someone have been there in me not just to accuse me, but to explain?   

the kids were playing again, i was playing, i didn't hear anything more from inside.   
the way now sometimes what's in me is silent, too, and sometimes, though never really, forgets.   


on the metro, i have to ask a young woman to move the packages beside her to make room for me
she's reading, her foot propped on the seat in front of her, and barely looks up as she pulls them to her.
i sit, take out my own book--cioran, the temptation to exist--and notice her glancing up from hers
to take in the title of mine, and then, as gombrowicz puts it, she affirms herself physically, that is,
becomes present in a way she hadn't been before though she hasn't moved, she's allowed herself
to come more sharply into focus, be more accessible to my sensual perception, so i can't help but remark
her strong figure and very tan skin--how literally golden young women can look at the end of summer.
she leans back now, and as the train rocks and her arm brushes mine she doesn't pull it away
she seems to be allowing our surfaces to unite the fine hairs on both our forearms, sensitive, alive,
achingly alive, bring news of someone touched, someone sensed, and thus acknowledged, known.

i understand that in no way is she offering more than this, and in truth i have no desire for more,
but it's still enough for me to be taken by a surge, first of warmth then of something like its opposite
a memory--a girl i'd mooned for from afar, across the table from me in the library in school now,
our feet i thought touching, touching even again, and then, with all i craved that touch to mean,
my having to realize it wasn't her flesh my flesh for that gleaming time had pressed, but a table leg.
the young woman today removes her arm now, stands, swaying against the lurch of the slowing train,
and crossing before me brushes my knee and does that thing again, asserts her bodily being again,
gombrowicz again, then quickly moves to the door of the car and descends, not once looking back,
to my relief not looking back, and i allow myself the thought that though i must be to her again
as senseless as that table of my youth, as wooden, as unfeeling, perhaps there was a moment i was not.


diluvian, draggled and derelict posse, this 
barnacled pod so pales 
next to everything we hear of red tides and pilot whales 
that a word like drama makes me sound remiss 

except that there 
was a kind of littoral drama in the way the shells 
silently, sans the heraldry of bells, 
neatly, sans an astrological affair, 

and swiftly, sans a multitude of feet, flat-out arrived-- 
an encrusted school of twenty-four 
gabriellan trumpets at my beach house door 
and barely half-alive. 

oh, you can bet 
i picked them up, waded right up to my ankles in 
there among 'em, hefted 'em up to my ears to hear the din 
of all things oceanwise and wet, 

but every of the ancient, bearded, anthracite, 
salt-water-logged spirals, 
every of the massive and unwieldy, magisterial 
mollusks shut tight-- 

no din, no horns roaring reveille, no warning, no beat, no taps, 
no coral corpus, 
no porpoise purpose 
except it was a secret purpose kept strictly under wraps. 

a fine christmas gift indeed, this 
obscure migration, 
this half-dead conch confederation 
which would have smelled yon tannenbaum like fish-- 

a fine set of unwrappable presents 
and no receipt by which i could redeem them. 
i lifted one up by its stem 
and thought of how, by increments, 

all twenty-four 
must have lugged those preassembled bodies here 
sans santa, sleigh, and eight little reindeer, 
to my drasty stretch of shore. 

and, no other explanation being offered for the situation, 
i thought that i might understand 
how one could argue that the impulse driving them to land 
was a sort of evolutionary one-- 

misguided, yes, redundant, a million years too late, 
a needless, maybe rogue and almost campy 
demonstration of how history, 
even in the world of the invertebrate, 

repeats itself--breaker 
crashing down on breaker in the gulf, gulf war 
coming after gulf war. 
o maker, 

there is so much slug inside these shells, 
here, at the end of december, 
at the edge of a world i couldn't blame if you did not remember. 
miracles sell well, 

but lord, it can be numbing 
to a people who cannot 
tell between a second nature and a second thought, 
a second chance, or a second coming.


pawnbroker, scavenger, cheapskate, 
come creeping from your pigeon-filled backrooms, 
past guns and clocks and locks and cages, 
past pockets emptied and coins picked from the floor 
come sweeping with the rainclouds down the river 
through the brokenblack windows of factories 
to avenues where movies whisk through basement projectors 
and children peel up into the supplejack twilight-- 
there a black-eyed straight-backed drag queen 
preens, fusses, fixes her hair in a shop window on prince, 
a young businessman jingles his change 
and does his travis bickle for a long-faced friend, 
there on the corner i laughed at a joke jim made. 
in the bedroom the moon is a dented spoon, 
cold, getting colder, so hurry sleep, 
come creep into bed, let's get it over with 
lay me down and close my eyes 
and tell me whip, tell me winnow 
tell me sweet tell me skittish 
tell me no tell me no such thing 
tell me straw into gold tell me crept into fire 
tell me lost all my money tell me hoarded, verboten, 
but promise tomorrow i will be profligate, 
stepping into the sun like a trophy.


although most are totally naked   
and too scant for even the slightest    
color and although they have no voice    
that i've ever heard for cry or song, they are,    
nevertheless, more than mirage, more    
than hallucination, more than falsehood.   

they have confronted sulfuric    
boiling black sea bottoms and stayed,      
held on under ten tons of polar ice,    
established themselves in dense salts    
and acids, survived eating metal ions.    
they are more committed than oblivion,    
more prolific than stars.   

far too ancient for scripture, each   
one bears in its one cell one text--   
the first whit of alpha, the first    
jot of bearing, beneath the riling    
sun the first nourishing of self.      

too lavish for saints, too trifling    
for baptism, they have existed    
throughout never gaining girth enough    
to hold a firm hope of salvation.   
too meager in heart for compassion,   
too lean for tears, less in substance   
than sacrifice, not one has ever    
carried a cross anywhere.   

and not one of their trillions    
has ever been given a tombstone.    
i've never noticed a lessening    
of light in the ceasing of any one    
of them. they are more mutable    
than mere breathing and vanishing,    
more mysterious than resurrection,    
too minimal for death.

the barrows of my ancestors have spilled their bones   
across the singing ear in hear or shell   
as wreck or wrack may be in daring   
there were giants on the earth in those days   
feasts then on hill and fort 
all night the borders of my bed 
carve paths across my face 
and i always forget to leave my address   
frightened by the way that midnight

all male quincys are now dead, excepting one.  john wheelwright, gestures to the dead 
 
vast oblong space 
dwindled to one solitary rock. 

on 
it i saw a heap of hay   
impressed with the form   
of a man. 

beleaguered captain stork   
with his cane 

on some quixotic skirmish. 

deserters arrived from fort necessity   

all hope was gone. 

howe carrying a white flag of truce   
went toward the water. 

an apostle in white 
stood on a pavement of scarlet 

around him 
stretched in deep sleep 

lay the dark forms of warriors. 

he was turned away   
gazing on a wide waste. 

his cry of alarm   
astonished everyone. 

a council of war   
in battle array 
after some siege. 

i ran to them   
shouting as i ran   
victory 

night closed in   
weedy with flies. 

the moon slid 
between moaning pines   
and tangled vines. 

neutrals collected bones 

or journeyed behind on foot 

shouting at invisible doors   

to open. 

there were guards who approached   

stealthy as linxes 

always fresh footprints in the forest 

we closed a chasm 

then trod the ground firm 

i carried your name 

like a huge shield. 

because dreams were oracles   
agile as wild-cats 
we leapt on a raft of ice. 

children began a wail of despair   
we carried them on our shoulders. 

a wave 
thrust our raft of ice   
against a northern shore. 

an indian trail 
led through wood and thicket 

light broke on the forest 

the hostile town   
was close at hand. 

we screamed our war-cry   
and rushed in. 

it was him 
power of the clouds   
judge of the dead 
the sheep on his right   
the goats on his left   
and all the angels. 

but from the book 
backward on their knees 
crawled neolithic adventurers known only to themselves.   
they blazed with artifice 
no pin, or kernel, or grain too small to pick up. 
a baby with a broken face lay on the leaves 
hannibal--a rough looking man 
rushed by with a bundle of sticks. 
ah, this is fortunate, cried forebear 
and helped himself to me. 

god is an animal figure   
clearly headless. 
he bewitches his quarry   
with ambiguous wounds   
the wolf or poor ass   
had only stolen straw. 

o sullen silence 
nail two sticks together 
and tell resurrection stories. 

there on the deck, child in her arms   
was the girl i had been before 

she waved 

then threw her child to me   

and jumped 

but she missed the edge and swirled away. 

i left you in a group of grownup children and went in search   
wandered sandhills snowy nights   
calling mother, father 

a dauphin sat down to dine on dust   
alone in his field of wheat 

one war-whoop toppled a state. 

i thought we were in the right country   
but the mountains were gone. 

we saw five or six people coming toward us   

who were savages. 

alhough my pen was leaky as a sieve   
i scribbled arm, arm 

ear. barked the moon. 

we paddled with hands, planks, and a pencil 

listen--the people surrender 
i don't remember the rest but it was beautiful. 

we were led ashore by captain snow   
i'll meet you soon-- he said   
and vanished in the fog. 

we cooked trout and perch on forked sticks.   
fire crackled in the forest stillness 
fire forms stood out against the gloom   
ancient trunks with wens and deformities   
moss bearded ancients--and thin saplings   
the strong, the weak, the old, the young-- 

now and then some sleeper would get up 
warm her hands at the fire 
and listen to the whisper of a leaf   
or the footfall of an animal 
i kept my gun-match burning when it rained-- 

holding hands with my skin   
i walked the wintry strand.   
tickle yourself with my stroke 
ticked the wiseacre clock. 

the river sang-- 
pelucid dark and deep my waters-- 
come and cross me alone. 

the final ruins ahead 
revealed two figures timidly engraved on one another. 

i built a house 
that faced the east 
i never ventured west   
for fear of murder. 

eternity dawned. 

solitary watcher   
of what rose 
and set 
i saw only   
a golgotha   
of corpses. 

experience teaches   
the savage revenge 
an enemy always takes   
on forerunners 
who follow. 

you were a little army   
of unarmed children-- 
a newborn infant 
sat in the hollow 
of my pillow. 

the house was a model of harmony. 

children coiled like hedgehogs   
or lay on their backs. 

a doll uttered mysterious oracles   
put on the kettle.   
get up and go home. 

the clock was alive   
i asked what it ate. 

a cross large enough to crucify us all.   
and so on. 

blankets congealed   
into icicles 

we practiced 
trips, falls, dives into snowdrifts. 

with a snowshoe for a shovel   
i opened the clock 

and we searched for peace in its deep and private present.   

outside, the world swarmed with sorcerers.

ii. conversion 
 

i like to be stationary. 
                      --bartleby 
 

who is not a wild enthusiast   

in a green meadow   

furious and fell 

arriving on the stage of history   
i saw madness of the world 

stripped of falsification   
and corruption 

anthems were singing in authorem 

father and the father 
by my words will i be justified 

autobiography i saw 

legal righteousness makes us servants   
all good hearers 

opposers or despisers 
night page torn word missing 

the family silence   
gave up the ghost 

i feared the fall of my child   

resting quietly with some hopes   

as a bird before any

as silent as a mirror is believed 
realities plunge in silence by ... 

i am not ready for repentance 
nor to match regrets. for the moth 
bends no more than the still 
imploring flame. and tremorous 
in the white falling flakes 
kisses are,-- 
the only worth all granting. 

it is to be learned-- 
this cleaving and this burning, 
but only by the one who 
spends out himself again. 

twice and twice 
again the smoking souvenir, 
bleeding eidolon and yet again. 
until the bright logic is won 
unwhispering as a mirror 
is believed. 

then, drop by caustic drop, a perfect cry 
shall string some constant harmony,-- 
relentless caper for all those who step 
the legend of their youth into the noon.


we make our meek adjustments, 
contented with such random consolations 
as the wind deposits 
in slithered and too ample pockets. 

for we can still love the world, who find 
a famished kitten on the step, and know 
recesses for it from the fury of the street, 
or warm torn elbow coverts. 

we will sidestep, and to the final smirk 
dally the doom of that inevitable thumb 
that slowly chafes its puckered index toward us, 
facing the dull squint with what innocence 
and what surprise 

and yet these fine collapses are not lies 
more than the pirouettes of any pliant cane 
our obsequies are, in a way, no enterprise. 
we can evade you, and all else but the heart 
what blame to us if the heart live on. 

the game enforces smirks but we have seen 
the moon in lonely alleys make 
a grail of laughter of an empty ash can, 
and through all sound of gaiety and quest 
have heard a kitten in the wilderness.


the willows carried a slow sound,

a sarabande the wind mowed on the mead. 

i could never remember

that seething, steady leveling of the marshes 

till age had brought me to the sea.


flags, weeds. and remembrance of steep alcoves 

where cypresses shared the noon's

tyranny they drew me into hades almost.

and mammoth turtles climbing sulphur dreams 

yielded, while sun-silt rippled them

asunder ...


how much i would have bartered the black gorge 

and all the singular nestings in the hills 

where beavers learn stitch and tooth. 

the pond i entered once and quickly fled--

i remember now its singing willow rim.


and finally, in that memory all things nurse

after the city that i finally passed

with scalding unguents spread and smoking darts 

the monsoon cut across the delta 

at gulf gates ... there, beyond the dykes


i heard wind flaking sapphire, like this summer, 

and willows could not hold more steady sound.




and so we may arrive by talmud skill and profane greek to raise the building up of helen's house against the ismaelite, king of thogarma, and his habergeons brimstony, blue and fiery and the force of king abaddon, and the beast of cittim which rabbi david kimchi, onkelos, and aben ezra do interpret rome.  --the alchemist.

the mind has shown itself at times 
too much the baked and labeled dough 
divided by accepted multitudes. 
across the stacked partitions of the day-- 
across the memoranda, baseball scores, 
the stenographic smiles and stock quotations 
smutty wings flash out equivocations. 

the mind is brushed by sparrow wings 
numbers, rebuffed by asphalt, crowd 
the margins of the day, accent the curbs, 
convoying divers dawns on every corner 
to druggist, barber and tobacconist, 
until the graduate opacities of evening 
take them away as suddenly to somewhere 
virginal perhaps, less fragmentary, cool. 

         there is the world dimensional for 
       those untwisted by the love of things 
       irreconcilable ... 

and yet, suppose some evening i forgot 
the fare and transfer, yet got by that way 
without recall,--lost yet poised in traffic. 
then i might find your eyes across an aisle, 
still flickering with those prefigurations-- 
prodigal, yet uncontested now, 
half-riant before the jerky window frame. 

there is some way, i think, to touch 
those hands of yours that count the nights 
stippled with pink and green advertisements. 
and now, before its arteries turn dark 
i would have you meet this bartered blood. 
imminent in his dream, none better knows 
the white wafer cheek of love, or offers words 
lightly as moonlight on the eaves meets snow. 

reflective conversion of all things 
at your deep blush, when ecstasies thread 
the limbs and belly, when rainbows spread 
impinging on the throat and sides ...    
inevitable, the body of the world 
weeps in inventive dust for the hiatus 
that winks above it, bluet in your breasts. 

the earth may glide diaphanous to death 
but if i lift my arms it is to bend 
to you who turned away once, helen, knowing 
the press of troubled hands, too alternate 
with steel and soil to hold you endlessly. 
i meet you, therefore, in that eventual flame 
you found in final chains, no captive then-- 
beyond their million brittle, bloodshot eyes 
white, through white cities passed on to assume 
that world which comes to each of us alone. 
accept a lone eye riveted to your plane, 
bent axle of devotion along companion ways 
that beat, continuous, to hourless days-- 
one inconspicuous, glowing orb of praise. 


       ii 

brazen hypnotics glitter here 
glee shifts from foot to foot, 
magnetic to their tremulo. 
this crashing opera bouffe, 
blest excursion this ricochet 
from roof to roof-- 
know, olympians, we are breathless 
while nigger cupids scour the stars 

a thousand light shrugs balance us 
through snarling hails of melody. 
white shadows slip across the floor 
splayed like cards from a loose hand 
rhythmic ellipses lead into canters 
until somewhere a rooster banters. 

greet naively--yet intrepidly 
new soothings, new amazements 
that cornets introduce at every turn-- 
and you may fall downstairs with me 
with perfect grace and equanimity. 
or, plaintively scud past shores 
where, by strange harmonic laws 
all relatives, serene and cool, 
sit rocked in patent armchairs. 

o,i have known metallic paradises 
where cuckoos clucked to finches 
above the deft catastrophes of drums. 
while titters hailed the groans of death 
beneath gyrating awnings i have seen 
the incunabula of the divine grotesque. 
this music has a reassuring way. 

the siren of the springs of guilty song-- 
let us take her on the incandescent wax 
striated with nuances, nervosities 
that we are heir to she is still so young, 
we cannot frown upon her as she smiles, 
dipping here in this cultivated storm 
among slim skaters of the gardened skies. 


       iii 

capped arbiter of beauty in this street 
that narrows darkly into motor dawn,-- 
you, here beside me, delicate ambassador 
of intricate slain numbers that arise 
in whispers, naked of steel 
                                       religious gunman 
who faithfully, yourself, will fall too soon, 
and in other ways than as the wind settles 
on the sixteen thrifty bridges of the city 
let us unbind our throats of fear and pity. 

                                             we even, 
who drove speediest destruction 
in corymbulous formations of mechanics,-- 
who hurried the hill breezes, spouting malice 
plangent over meadows, and looked down 
on rifts of torn and empty houses 
like old women with teeth unjubilant 
that waited faintly, briefly and in vain 

we know, eternal gunman, our flesh remembers 
the tensile boughs, the nimble blue plateaus, 
the mounted, yielding cities of the air 

that saddled sky that shook down vertical 
repeated play of fire--no hypogeum 
of wave or rock was good against one hour. 
we did not ask for that, but have survived, 
and will persist to speak again before 
all stubble streets that have not curved 
to memory, or known the ominous lifted arm 
that lowers down the arc of helen's brow 
to saturate with blessing and dismay. 

a goose, tobacco and cologne 
three winged and gold-shod prophecies of heaven, 
the lavish heart shall always have to leaven 
and spread with bells and voices, and atone 
the abating shadows of our conscript dust. 

anchises' navel, dripping of the sea,-- 
the hands erasmus dipped in gleaming tides, 
gathered the voltage of blown blood and vine 
delve upward for the new and scattered wine, 
o brother-thief of time, that we recall. 
laugh out the meager penance of their days 
who dare not share with us the breath released, 
the substance drilled and spent beyond repair 
for golden, or the shadow of gold hair. 

distinctly praise the years, whose volatile 
blamed bleeding hands extend and thresh the height 
the imagination spans beyond despair, 
outpacing bargain, vocable and prayer.


often beneath the wave, wide from this ledge 
the dice of drowned men's bones he saw bequeath 
an embassy. their numbers as he watched, 
beat on the dusty shore and were obscured. 

and wrecks passed without sound of bells, 
the calyx of death's bounty giving back 
a scattered chapter, livid hieroglyph, 
the portent wound in corridors of shells. 

then in the circuit calm of one vast coil, 
its lashings charmed and malice reconciled, 
frosted eyes there were that lifted altars 
and silent answers crept across the stars. 

compass, quadrant and sextant contrive 
no farther tides ... high in the azure steeps 
monody shall not wake the mariner. 
this fabulous shadow only the sea keeps.


how many dawns, chill from his rippling rest 
the seagull's wings shall dip and pivot him, 
shedding white rings of tumult, building high 
over the chained bay waters liberty-- 

then, with inviolate curve, forsake our eyes    
as apparitional as sails that cross 
some page of figures to be filed away 
--till elevators drop us from our day ... 

i think of cinemas, panoramic sleights 
with multitudes bent toward some flashing scene 
never disclosed, but hastened to again, 
foretold to other eyes on the same screen 

and thee, across the harbor, silver paced 
as though the sun took step of thee yet left 
some motion ever unspent in thy stride,-- 
implicitly thy freedom staying thee 

out of some subway scuttle, cell or loft 
a bedlamite speeds to thy parapets, 
tilting there momently, shrill shirt ballooning, 
a jest falls from the speechless caravan. 

down wall, from girder into street noon leaks, 
a rip-tooth of the sky's acetylene 
all afternoon the cloud flown derricks turn ... 
thy cables breathe the north atlantic still. 

and obscure as that heaven of the jews, 
thy guerdon ... accolade thou dost bestow 
of anonymity time cannot raise 
vibrant reprieve and pardon thou dost show. 

o harp and altar, of the fury fused, 
how could mere toil align thy choiring strings 
terrific threshold of the prophet's pledge, 
prayer of pariah, and the lover's cry, 

again the traffic lights that skim thy swift 
unfractioned idiom, immaculate sigh of stars, 
beading thy path--condense eternity 
and we have seen night lifted in thine arms. 

under thy shadow by the piers i waited 
only in darkness is thy shadow clear. 
the city's fiery parcels all undone, 
already snow submerges an iron year ... 

o sleepless as the river under thee, 
vaulting the sea, the prairies' dreaming sod,          
unto us lowliest sometime sweep, descend 
and of the curveship lend a myth to god.


the swift red flesh, a winter king--

who squired the glacier woman down the sky?

she ran the neighing canyons all the spring

she spouted arms she rose with maize--to die.


and in the autumn drouth, whose burnished hands

with mineral wariness found out the stone

where prayers, forgotten, streamed the mesa sands?

he holds the twilight's dim, perpetual throne,


mythical brows we saw retiring--loth,

disturbed and destined, into denser green.

greeting they sped us, on the arrow's oath

now lie incorrigibly what years between . .


there was a bed of leaves, and broken play 

there was a veil upon you, pocahontas, bride-- 

o princess whose brown lap was virgin may 

and bridal flanks and eyes hid tawny pride.


i left the village for dogwood. by the canoe 

tugging below the mill-race, i could see

your hair's keen crescent running, and the blue 

first moth of evening take wing stealthily.


what laughing chains the water wove and threw. 

i learned to catch the trout's moon whisper i 

drifted how many hours i never knew,

but, watching, saw that fleet young crescent die,--


and one star, swinging, take its place, alone, 

cupped in the larches of the mountain pass--

until, immortally, it bled into the dawn. 

i left my sleek boat nibbling margin grass . . .


i took the portage climb, then chose

a further valley-shed i could not stop. 

feet nozzled wat'ry webs of upper flows 

one white veil gusted from the very top.


o appalachian spring i gained the ledge 

steep, inaccessible smile that eastward bends 

and northward reaches in that violet wedge 

of adirondacks--wisped of azure wands,


over how many bluffs, tarns, streams i sped

--and knew myself within some boding shade--

grey tepees-tufting the blue knolls ahead,

smoke swirling through the yellow chestnut glade . . .


a distant cloud, a thunder-bud--it grew, 

that blanket of the skies the padded foot 

within,--i heard it 'til its rhythm drew, 

--siphoned the black pool from the heart's hot root


a cyclone threshes in the turbine crest,

swooping in eagle feathers down your back 

know, maquokeeta, greeting know death's best 

--fall, sachem, strictly as the tamarack


a birch kneels. all her whistling fingers fly. 

the oak grove circles in a crash of leaves 

the long moan of a dance is in the sky. 

dance, maquokeeta pocahontas grieves . . .


and every tendon scurries toward the twangs 

of lightning deltaed down your saber hair. 

now snaps the flint in every tooth red fangs 

and splay tongues thinly busy the blue air . . .


dance, maquokeeta snake that lives before,

that casts his pelt, and lives beyond sprout, horn 

spark, tooth medicine-man, relent, restore--

lie to us,--dance us back the tribal morn


spears and assemblies black drums thrusting on--

o yelling battlements,--i, too, was liege

to rainbows currying each pulsant bone

surpassed the circumstance, danced out the siege


and buzzard-circleted, screamed from the stake 

i could not pick the arrows from my side. 

wrapped in that fire, i saw more escorts wake--

flickering, sprint up the hill groins like a tide.


i heard the hush of lava wrestling your arms, 

and stag teeth foam about the raven throat 

flame cataracts of heaven in seething swarms 

fed down your anklets to the sunset's moat.


, like the lizard in the furious noon, 

that drops his legs and colors in the sun, 

--and laughs, pure serpent, time itself, and moon 

of his own fate, i saw thy change begun


and saw thee dive to kiss that destiny

like one white meteor, sacrosanct and blent 

at last with all that's consummate and free 

there, where the first and last gods keep thy tent.


                           .         .         .         .


thewed of the levin, thunder-shod and lean,

lo, through what infinite seasons dost thou gaze--

across what bivouacs of thine angered slain, 

and see'st thy bride immortal in the maize


totem and fire-gall, slumbering pyramid--

though other calendars now stack the sky, 

thy freedom is her largesse, prince, and hid 

on paths thou knewest best to claim her by.


high unto labrador the sun strikes free

her speechless dream of snow, and stirred again, 

she is the torrent and the singing tree 

and she is virgin to the last of men . . .


west, west and south winds over cumberland 

and winds across the liana grass resume

her hair's warm sibilance. her breasts are fanned 

o stream by slope and vineyard--into bloom


and when the caribou slant down for salt

do arrows thirst and leap? do antlers shine 

alert, star-triggered in the listening vault

of dusk?--and are her perfect brows to thine?


we danced,  brave, we danced beyond their farms. 

in cobalt desert closures made our vows . . . 

now is the strong prayer folded in thine arms, 

the serpent with the eagle in the boughs.


i wanted you, nameless woman of the south, 

no wraith, but utterly--as still more alone 

the southern cross takes night

and lifts her girdles from her, one by one--

high, cool,

               wide from the slowly smoldering fire 

of lower heavens,--       

                         vaporous scars


eve magdalene

                        or mary, you?


whatever call--falls vainly on the wave. 

o simian venus, homeless eve,

unwedded, stumbling gardenless to grieve 

windswept guitars on lonely decks forever 

finally to answer all within one grave


and this long wake of phosphor,

                                          iridescent

furrow of all our travel--trailed derision 

eyes crumble at its kiss. its long-drawn spell 

incites a yell. slid on that backward vision

the mind is churned to spittle, whispering hell.


i wanted you . . . the embers of the cross 

climbed by aslant and huddling aromatically. 

it is blood to remember it is fire

to stammer back . . . it is

god--your namelessness. and the wash--         


all night the water combed you with black 

insolence. you crept out simmering, accomplished. 

water rattled that stinging coil, your

rehearsed hair--docile, alas, from many arms. 

yes, eve--wraith of my unloved seed


the cross, a phantom, buckled--dropped below the dawn. 

light drowned the lithic trillions of your spawn.


perspective never withers from their eyes   
they keep that docile edict of the spring 
that blends march with august antarctic skies   
these are but cows that see no other thing   
than grass and snow, and their own inner being   
through the rich halo that they do not trouble   
even to cast upon the seasons fleeting 
though they should thin and die on last year's stubble. 

and they are awkward, ponderous and uncoy . . .    
while we who press the cider mill, regarding them-- 
we, who with pledges taste the bright annoy   
of friendship's acid wine, retarding phlegm, 
shifting reprisals 'til who shall tell us when 
the jest is too sharp to be kindly? boast 
much of our store of faith in other men 
who would, ourselves, stalk down the merriest ghost. 

above them old mizzentop, palatial white   
hostelry--floor by floor to cinquefoil dormer   
portholes the ceilings stack their stoic height.   
long tiers of windows staring out toward former   
faces--loose panes crown the hill and gleam   
at sunset with a silent, cobwebbed patience . . .    

see them, like eyes that still uphold some dream   
through mapled vistas, cancelled reservations 

high from the central cupola, they say 
one's glance could cross the borders of three states   
but i have seen death's stare in slow survey   
from four horizons that no one relates . . .   
weekenders avid of their turf-won scores, 
here three hours from the semaphores, the czars 
of golf, by twos and threes in plaid plusfours   
alight with sticks abristle and cigars. 

this was the promised land, and still it is 
to the persuasive suburban land agent 
in bootleg roadhouses where the gin fizz 
bubbles in time to hollywood's new love-nest pageant.   
fresh from the radio in the old meeting house   
now the new avalon hotel volcanoes roar 
a welcome to highsteppers that no mouse 
who saw the friends there ever heard before. 

what cunning neighbors history has in fine   
the woodlouse mortgages the ancient deal   
table that powitzky buys for only nine-   
ty-five at adams' auction,--eats the seal,   
the spinster polish of antiquity . . .   
who holds the lease on time and on disgrace?   
what eats the pattern with ubiquity? 
where are my kinsmen and the patriarch race? 

the resigned factions of the dead preside.   
dead rangers bled their comfort on the snow   
but i must ask slain iroquois to guide 
me farther than scalped yankees knew to go   
shoulder the curse of sundered parentage,   
wait for the postman driving from birch hill   
with birthright by blackmail, the arrant page   
that unfolds a new destiny to fill . . . .   

so, must we from the hawk's far stemming view,   
must we descend as worm's eye to construe   
our love of all we touch, and take it to the gate 
as humbly as a guest who knows himself too late, 
his news already told? yes, while the heart is wrung, 
arise--yes, take this sheaf of dust upon your tongue 
in one last angelus lift throbbing throat-- 
listen, transmuting silence with that stilly note 

of pain that emily, that isadora knew 
while high from dim elm-chancels hung with dew, 
that triple-noted clause of moonlight-- 
yes, whip-poor-will, unhusks the heart of fright, 
breaks us and saves, yes, breaks the heart, yet yields 
that patience that is armour and that shields 
love from despair--when love forsees the end-- 
leaf after autumnal leaf 
                                    break off, 
                                                   descend-- 
                                                               descend--


performances, assortments, rsums-- 
up times square to columbus circle lights 
channel the congresses, nightly sessions, 
refractions of the thousand theatres, faces-- 
mysterious kitchens. . . . you shall search them all. 
someday by heart you'll learn each famous sight 
and watch the curtain lift in hell's despite 
you'll find the garden in the third act dead, 
finger your knees--and wish yourself in bed 
with tabloid crime-sheets perched in easy sight. 

            then let you reach your hat 
            and go. 
            as usual, let you--also 
            walking down--exclaim 
            to twelve upward leaving 
            a subscription praise 
            for what time slays. 

or can't you quite make up your mind to ride 
a walk is better underneath the l a brisk 
ten blocks or so before? but you find yourself 
preparing penguin flexions of the arms,-- 
as usual you will meet the scuttle yawn 
the subway yawns the quickest promise home. 

be minimum, then, to swim the hiving swarms 
out of the square, the circle burning bright-- 
avoid the glass doors gyring at your right, 
where boxed alone a second, eyes take fright 
--quite unprepared rush naked back to light 
and down beside the turnstile press the coin 
into the slot. the gongs already rattle. 
                
            and so 
            of cities you bespeak 
            subways, rivered under streets 
            and rivers. . . . in the car

whose body smokes along the bitten rails, 
bursts from a smoldering bundle far behind 
in back forks of the chasms of the brain,-- 
puffs from a riven stump far out behind 
in interborough fissures of the mind . . . ? 

and why do i often meet your visage here, 
your eyes like agate lanterns--on and on 
below the toothpaste and the dandruff ads? 
--and did their riding eyes right through your side, 
and did their eyes like unwashed platters ride? 
and death, aloft,--gigantically down 
probing through you--toward me, o evermore 
and when they dragged your retching flesh, 
your trembling hands that night through baltimore-- 
that last night on the ballot rounds, did you, 
shaking, did you deny the ticket, poe?

the platform hurries along to a dead stop. 

the intent escalator lifts a serenade 
stilly 
of shoes, umbrellas, each eye attending its shoe, then 
bolting outright somewhere above where streets 
burst suddenly in rain. . . . the gongs recur 
elbows and levers, guard and hissing door. 
thunder is galvothermic here below. . . . the car 
wheels off. the train rounds, bending to a scream, 
taking the final level for the dive 
under the river-- 
and somewhat emptier than before,

daemon, demurring and eventful yawn 
whose hideous laughter is a bellows mirth

--a sound of waters bending astride the sky 
unceasing with some word that will not die . . .

a tugboat, wheezing wreaths of steam, 
lunged past, with one galvanic blare stove up the river. 
i counted the echoes assembling, one after one, 
searching, thumbing the midnight on the piers. 
lights, coasting, left the oily tympanum of waters 
the blackness somewhere gouged glass on a sky. 
and this thy harbor, o my city, i have driven under, 
tossed from the coil of ticking towers. . . . tomorrow, 
and to be. . . . hereby the river that is east-- 
here at the waters' edge the hands drop memory 
shadowless in that abyss they unaccounting lie. 
how far away the star has pooled the sea-- 
or shall the hands be drawn away, to die? 

kiss of our agony thou gatherest,

through the bound cable strands, the arching path   
upward, veering with light, the flight of strings,-- 
taut miles of shuttling moonlight syncopate   
the whispered rush, telepathy of wires. 
up the index of night, granite and steel-- 
transparent meshes--fleckless the gleaming staves-- 
sibylline voices flicker, waveringly stream   
as though a god were issue of the strings. . . .   

and through that cordage, threading with its call 
one arc synoptic of all tides below-- 
their labyrinthine mouths of history   
pouring reply as though all ships at sea   
complighted in one vibrant breath made cry,-- 
make thy love sure--to weave whose song we ply   
--from black embankments, moveless soundings hailed,   
so seven oceans answer from their dream. 

and on, obliquely up bright carrier bars   
new octaves trestle the twin monoliths 
beyond whose frosted capes the moon bequeaths   
two worlds of sleep o arching strands of song-- 
onward and up the crystal-flooded aisle   
white tempest nets file upward, upward ring   
with silver terraces the humming spars,   
the loft of vision, palladium helm of stars. 

sheerly the eyes, like seagulls stung with rime-- 
slit and propelled by glistening fins of light-- 
pick biting way up towering looms that press   
sidelong with flight of blade on tendon blade   
--tomorrows into yesteryear--and link 
what cipher-script of time no traveller reads 
but who, through smoking pyres of love and death,   
searches the timeless laugh of mythic spears. 

like hails, farewells--up planet-sequined heights   
some trillion whispering hammers glimmer tyre   
serenely, sharply up the long anvil cry 
of inchling aeons silence rivets troy. 
and you, aloft there--jason hesting shout   
still wrapping harness to the swarming air   
silvery the rushing wake, surpassing call, 
beams yelling aeolus splintered in the straits 

from gulfs unfolding, terrible of drums,   
tall vision-of-the-voyage, tensely spare-- 
bridge, lifting night to cycloramic crest   
of deepest day--o choir, translating time   
into what multitudinous verb the suns   
and synergy of waters ever fuse, recast   
in myriad syllables,--psalm of cathay 
o love, thy white, pervasive paradigm . . .  

we left the haven hanging in the night 
sheened harbor lanterns backward fled the keel.   
pacific here at time's end, bearing corn,-- 
eyes stammer through the pangs of dust and steel.   
and still the circular, indubitable frieze 
of heaven's meditation, yoking wave 
to kneeling wave, one song devoutly binds-- 
the vernal strophe chimes from deathless strings 

o thou steeled cognizance whose leap commits   
the agile precincts of the lark's return 
within whose lariat sweep encinctured sing   
in single chrysalis the many twain,-- 
of stars thou art the stitch and stallion glow 
and like an organ, thou, with sound of doom-- 
sight, sound and flesh thou leadest from time's realm   
as love strikes clear direction for the helm. 

swift peal of secular light, intrinsic myth 
whose fell unshadow is death's utter wound,-- 
o river-throated--iridescently upborne 
through the bright drench and fabric of our veins   
with white escarpments swinging into light,   
sustained in tears the cities are endowed 
and justified conclamant with ripe fields 
revolving through their harvests in sweet torment. 

forever deity's glittering pledge, o thou   
whose canticle fresh chemistry assigns   
to wrapt inception and beatitude,-- 
always through blinding cables, to our joy,   
of thy white seizure springs the prophecy   
always through spiring cordage, pyramids   
of silver sequel, deity's young name   
kinetic of white choiring wings . . . ascends. 

migrations that must needs void memory, 
inventions that cobblestone the heart,-- 
unspeakable thou bridge to thee, o love. 
thy pardon for this history, whitest flower, 
o answerer of all,--anemone,-- 
now while thy petals spend the suns about us, hold-- 
o thou whose radiance doth inherit me   
atlantis,--hold thy floating singer late 

so to thine everpresence, beyond time,   
like spears ensanguined of one tolling star 
that bleeds infinity--the orphic strings,   
sidereal phalanxes, leap and converge   
--one song, one bridge of fire is it cathay,   
now pity steeps the grass and rainbows ring   
the serpent with the eagle in the leaves. . . . ?   
whispers antiphonal in azure swing.


moonmoth and grasshopper that flee our page 

and still wing on, untarnished of the name 

we pinion to your bodies to assuage

our envy of your freedom--we must maim


because we are usurpers, and chagrined--

and take the wing and scar it in the hand. 

names we have, even, to clap on the wind 

but we must die, as you, to understand.


i dreamed that all men dropped their names, and sang 

as only they can praise, who build their days 

with fin and hoof, with wing and sweetened fang 

struck free and holy in one name always.


those intervals   
between the day's   
five calls to prayer 

the women of the house   
pulling thick threads   
through vegetables 

rosaries of ginger   
of rustling peppers 
in autumn drying for winter 

in those intervals this rug   
part of grandma's dowry   
folded 

so the devil's shadow   
would not desecrate   
mecca scarlet-woven 

with minarets of gold   
but then the sunset   
call to prayer 

the servants 
their straw mats unrolled   
praying or in the garden 

in summer on grass   
the children wanting   
the prayers to end 

the women's foreheads   
touching abraham's   
silk stone of sacrifice 

black stone descended   
from heaven 
the pilgrims in white circling it 

this year my grandmother   
also a pilgrim   
in mecca she weeps 

as the stone is unveiled   
she weeps holding on   
to the pillars

my crossed-out lines.

red rose, proud rose, sad rose of all my days   
come near me, while i sing the ancient ways   
cuchulain battling with the bitter tide   
the druid, grey, wood-nurtured, quiet-eyed, 
who cast round fergus dreams, and ruin untold 
and thine own sadness, whereof stars, grown old   
in dancing silver-sandalled on the sea,   
sing in their high and lonely melody.   
come near, that no more blinded by man's fate, 
i find under the boughs of love and hate, 
in all poor foolish things that live a day,   
eternal beauty wandering on her way. 

come near, come near, come near--ah, leave me still 
a little space for the rose-breath to fill 
lest i no more hear common things that crave   
the weak worm hiding down in its small cave,   
the field-mouse running by me in the grass,   
and heavy mortal hopes that toil and pass   
but seek alone to hear the strange things said 
by god to the bright hearts of those long dead,   
and learn to chaunt a tongue men do not know.   
come near i would, before my time to go,   
sing of old eire and the ancient ways   
red rose, proud rose, sad rose of all my days. 



i will arise and go now, and go to innisfree, 
and a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles made 
nine bean-rows will i have there, a hive for the honey-bee, 
and live alone in the bee-loud glade. 

and i shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow, 
dropping from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings 
there midnight's all a glimmer, and noon a purple glow, 
and evening full of the linnet's wings. 

i will arise and go now, for always night and day 
i hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore 
while i stand on the roadway, or on the pavements grey, 
i hear it in the deep heart's core. 



the brawling of a sparrow in the eaves,   
the brilliant moon and all the milky sky,   
and all that famous harmony of leaves,   
had blotted out man's image and his cry. 

a girl arose that had red mournful lips 
and seemed the greatness of the world in tears,   
doomed like odysseus and the labouring ships   
and proud as priam murdered with his peers 

arose, and on the instant clamorous eaves,   
a climbing moon upon an empty sky,   
and all that lamentation of the leaves,   
could but compose man's image and his cry. 



when you are old and grey and full of sleep, 
and nodding by the fire, take down this book, 
and slowly read, and dream of the soft look 
your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep 

how many loved your moments of glad grace, 
and loved your beauty with love false or true, 
but one man loved the pilgrim soul in you, 
and loved the sorrows of your changing face 

and bending down beside the glowing bars, 
murmur, a little sadly, how love fled 
and paced upon the mountains overhead 
and hid his face amid a crowd of stars. 



the jester walked in the garden   
the garden had fallen still   
he bade his soul rise upward   
and stand on her window-sill. 

it rose in a straight blue garment,   
when owls began to call 
it had grown wise-tongued by thinking   
of a quiet and light footfall 

but the young queen would not listen   
she rose in her pale night-gown   
she drew in the heavy casement   
and pushed the latches down. 

he bade his heart go to her, 
when the owls called out no more   
in a red and quivering garment   
it sang to her through the door. 

it had grown sweet-tongued by dreaming   
of a flutter of flower-like hair 
but she took up her fan from the table   
and waved it off on the air. 

'i have cap and bells,' he pondered,   
'i will send them to her and die'   
and when the morning whitened   
he left them where she went by. 

she laid them upon her bosom, 
under a cloud of her hair, 
and her red lips sang them a love-song   
till stars grew out of the air. 

she opened her door and her window,   
and the heart and the soul came through,   
to her right hand came the red one,   
to her left hand came the blue. 

they set up a noise like crickets,   
a chattering wise and sweet,   
and her hair was a folded flower   
and the quiet of love in her feet. 



we sat together at one summer's end, 
that beautiful mild woman, your close friend,   
and you and i, and talked of poetry. 
i said, a line will take us hours maybe 
yet if it does not seem a moment's thought,   
our stitching and unstitching has been naught.   
better go down upon your marrow-bones   
and scrub a kitchen pavement, or break stones   
like an old pauper, in all kinds of weather   
for to articulate sweet sounds together 
is to work harder than all these, and yet   
be thought an idler by the noisy set 
of bankers, schoolmasters, and clergymen   
the martyrs call the world.' 
                                          and thereupon 
that beautiful mild woman for whose sake   
there's many a one shall find out all heartache   
on finding that her voice is sweet and low   
replied, to be born woman is to know-- 
although they do not talk of it at school-- 
that we must labour to be beautiful.' 
i said, it's certain there is no fine thing   
since adam's fall but needs much labouring. 
there have been lovers who thought love should be   
so much compounded of high courtesy   
that they would sigh and quote with learned looks   
precedents out of beautiful old books   
yet now it seems an idle trade enough.' 

we sat grown quiet at the name of love   
we saw the last embers of daylight die,   
and in the trembling blue-green of the sky   
a moon, worn as if it had been a shell   
washed by time's waters as they rose and fell   
about the stars and broke in days and years. 

i had a thought for no one's but your ears   
that you were beautiful, and that i strove   
to love you in the old high way of love 
that it had all seemed happy, and yet we'd grown   
as weary-hearted as that hollow moon.


the fascination of what's difficult 
has dried the sap out of my veins, and rent   
spontaneous joy and natural content 
out of my heart. there's something ails our colt   
that must, as if it had not holy blood   
nor on olympus leaped from cloud to cloud,   
shiver under the lash, strain, sweat and jolt 
as though it dragged road metal. my curse on plays   
that have to be set up in fifty ways, 
on the day's war with every knave and dolt,   
theatre business, management of men.   
i swear before the dawn comes round again   
i'll find the stable and pull out the bolt. 



suddenly i saw the cold and rook-delighting heaven 
that seemed as though ice burned and was but the more ice,   
and thereupon imagination and heart were driven   
so wild that every casual thought of that and this 
vanished, and left but memories, that should be out of season   
with the hot blood of youth, of love crossed long ago   
and i took all the blame out of all sense and reason,   
until i cried and trembled and rocked to and fro,   
riddled with light. ah when the ghost begins to quicken,   
confusion of the death-bed over, is it sent   
out naked on the roads, as the books say, and stricken   
by the injustice of the skies for punishment? 



the trees are in their autumn beauty,   
the woodland paths are dry, 
under the october twilight the water   
mirrors a still sky 
upon the brimming water among the stones   
are nine-and-fifty swans. 

the nineteenth autumn has come upon me   
since i first made my count 
i saw, before i had well finished, 
all suddenly mount 
and scatter wheeling in great broken rings   
upon their clamorous wings. 

i have looked upon those brilliant creatures,   
and now my heart is sore. 
all's changed since i, hearing at twilight,   
the first time on this shore, 
the bell-beat of their wings above my head,   
trod with a lighter tread. 

unwearied still, lover by lover, 
they paddle in the cold 
companionable streams or climb the air   
their hearts have not grown old 
passion or conquest, wander where they will,   
attend upon them still. 

but now they drift on the still water,   
mysterious, beautiful   
among what rushes will they build, 
by what lake's edge or pool 
delight men's eyes when i awake some day   
to find they have flown away? 



turning and turning in the widening gyre   
the falcon cannot hear the falconer 
things fall apart the centre cannot hold 
mere anarchy is loosed upon the world, 
the blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere   
the ceremony of innocence is drowned 
the best lack all conviction, while the worst   
are full of passionate intensity. 

surely some revelation is at hand 
surely the second coming is at hand.   
the second coming hardly are those words out   
when a vast image out of spiritus mundi 
troubles my sight somewhere in sands of the desert   
a shape with lion body and the head of a man,   
a gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,   
is moving its slow thighs, while all about it   
reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.   
the darkness drops again but now i know   
that twenty centuries of stony sleep 
were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,   
and what rough beast, its hour come round at last,   
slouches towards bethlehem to be born? 



i. 

smilers, smirkers, chucklers, grinners,   
platitudinizers, euphemists it wasn't you 

i emulated there, in that   
godawful place. what kind   
of face 

to put on it? how simple 
is a simon's sign? to my mind 
laughter's not the mark of pleasure, not   
a pleasantry that spread instead 

it's intimate with sheer 
delirium spilt brain 
on split lip, uncontainable 
interiority-- 
make no mistake, it is a horror, this 

inmated, intimated   
self, revealed as your   
material red smear, 
white swipe. it's said the brain 
stinks first, then organworks of art and eatery, 
and then--what's left? a little cartilage for 

ambiguity? a little tendon's b&d? at last, the least   
ephemeral of evidences nuggetworks discrete, and   
indiscreet of teeth, bone-bits, odd scraps 
of a delapidated strut--and this is just 
the sort of stuff, insensate, 
to which life which comes again 

as slime has always 
loved adhering. life who wouldn't   
laugh? your inner life your pet   
pretense it can't be kept up, can't   
be kept clean, 
even in a thought, 
except a good 
bloodworks or shitpump keeps it so. 

   ii. 

out of the mouth comes a tongue, 
it calls itself linguistic and it 
never quite effects 
the cover-up good 
lord, there's much to 
cover up so many belches, outcries, 
upchucks, sneezes, puffings, hiccups, osculations, hawks and   
   coughs-- 

so laughter which, among the noises, prides itself   
on being the most intellectual can't help   
but come out, snorting. nothing 

smiled or mild or meanwhiling--a laugh's 
got teeth to send it off, 
and spit to keep it company, and rot 
to end up with. its closest kin is grimace, it's 
a grimacing with wind.   
it will the will 
be damned 
burst out 

in bad cacaphonies of 
brouhaha and borborygma--it's the   
stockbroker of mockeries, a trachea rake-- 
the vent of rage and irony, and right   
there in the very 
shrine of signs. a laugh, i mean, 
is sorrow's 

archery and signature,   
while flesh is being   
hoisted and arrayed 

on roosts of skeleton. 

   iii. 

i saw what good 

comes to i saw the figure 
human being cuts, upon its frame.   
the laugh was a cry from my own 

perscrewed, misnailed, cross-crafted   
armature. despite 

your consternations, oh you 
meekened warners and polite   
conventioneers, the thieves were better   
served upon that day. for the heart 

is a muscle, where cruelty's humored.   
the tooth of moral rectitude's   
a fang. what i gave 

at the sight of him there 

was up. what i got   
of humanity there   
was the hang . . .   



i. 

daily, the kindergarteners   
passed my porch. i loved   
their likeness and variety,   
their selves in line like little   
monosyllables, but huggable-- 
i wasn't meant 

to grab them, ever, 
up into actual besmooches or down   
into grubbiest tumbles, my lot was not   
to have them, in the flesh. 
was it better or worse to let 
their lovability go by untouched, and just   
watch over their river of ever- 
inbraiding relations? i wouldn't 
mother them or teach. we couldn't be   
each other's others maybe, 
at removes, each other's each. 

   ii. 

each toddler had a hand-hold on 
a loop of rope, designed to haul 
the whole school onward   
in the sidewalk stream-- 
like pickerel through freshets, 
at the pull of something else's will, the children 
spun and bobbled, three years old and four 
or were they little drunken buddhas, 
buoyant, plump?. they looked 
now to the right, now to the sky, and now 
toward nothing nothing was too small-- 
they followed a thread of destination, 
chain of command, order of actual rope that led 

to what? who knew? 

for here and now in one child's eye there was a yellow truck, 
and in another's was a burning star but from my own perspective, 
overhead, adult, where trucks and suns had lost their luster,   
they were one whole baby-rush toward 
a target, toward the law 
of targets, fledge 
in the wake of an arrowhead 

a bull's-eye bloomed, a red   
eight-sided sign. what   
did i wish them? 
nothing i foresaw.


a brilliance takes up residence in flaws-- 
a brilliance all the unchipped faces of design   
refuse. the wine collects its starlets 
at a lip's fault, sunlight where the nicked   
glass angles, and affection where the eye   
is least correctable, where arrows of 
unquivered light are lodged, where someone   
else's eyes have come to be concerned. 

for beauty's sake, assault and drive and burn   
the devil from the simply perfect sun.   
demand a birthmark on the skin of love,   
a tremble in the touch, in come a cry,   
and let the silverware of nights be flecked,   
the moon pocked to distribute more or less   
indwelling alloys of its dim and shine   
by nip and tuck, by chance's dance of laws. 

the brightness drawn and quartered on a sheet,   
the moment cracked upon a bed, will last   
as if you soldered them with moon and flux.   
and break the bottle of the eye to see 
what lights are spun of accident and glass. 



i. 

they let me go 
at night, minus my timepiece, lighter,   
personal effects. the air is always shaking   
the same jars of safety pins cicadas.   
song is my recidivism always 
i'm abandoning the road to stand 
unwatched, unseconded in someone's   
field. the stars that are not mine 

tick fitfully, they always have 
appointments. punctual, six-sharp, 
they are david's they have lodged in his 
death tent, have stuck in his mud sleep. bad luck 

leaves me a loan no company, no katy- 
did or promissory 
note or night 
can last. 
the air 
loses its nerve, 
the old saw its eyeteeth and i 
my words--my alwaysing and my. 

   ii. 

in hush the repossessors reach   
the edges of the field. they pass 

for shadows, sheep of ambush, animals of   
permanence. they turn a black beyond returning 

and they haunt the sleepless. i don't count,   
who cannot earn my keep. 



i owe you an explanation. 
my first memory isn't your own 
of an empty box. my babyhood cabinets held   
a countlessness of cakes, my backyard 
rotted into apple glut, windfalls of 
money-tree, mouthfuls of fib. 

at puberty i liked the locks, 
i was the one who made them fast.   
the yelling in our hallways was about 
lost money, or lost love, but not   
lost life. or so i see it now   
in those days i romanticized   
a risk i thought i'd die   
in the alcoholic automobile, die 
at the hands of nerveless dentistry. small hearts 
were printed in the checkbook when my parents called me   
dear, they meant expensive. 

where were you in all that time? out looking for   
your father's body? making for your mother's room?   
i got my a's in english, civics, 
sweetness and light you got black eyes, and f's,   
and nowhere fast. by  when we met   
if you could call it making an acquaintance,   
rape i was a mal-adjusted gush, a sucker for 
placebos. walking home from central square, i came to have   
the good girl's petty dread the woman 

to whose yard you dragged me might 
detect us, and be furious. more than anything else   
i wanted no one mad at me. propriety, 
or was it property, i thought 
to guard myself i gave away. 

and as for you, you had the shakes,   
were barely seventeen yourself, too raw   
to get it up i said don't be afraid, 
afraid of what might happen if you failed. 
and afterwards, in one of those moments 
it's hard to tell funny from fatal you did 
a terrible civility you told me 

thanks. i'll never forget 
that moment all my life. 
it wasn't until then, as you 
were sheathing it to run, 

i saw the knife. 



in the field is a house 
of wood. a window of the house   
contains the field. 

you can't see far 
with a sun in the sky,   
with a living-room lamp 

at night. locality is all 
you light, and you, as single   
as a bed. but there's 

no end to dark. the bed is in the clearing 
and the clearing's in the wind the world   
is a world among others. now your cell-stars split. 



you take a rock, your hand is hard.   
you raise your eyes, and there's a pair   
of small beloveds, caught in pails. 
the monocle and eyepatch correspond. 

you take a glove, your hand is soft.   
the ocean floor was done 
in lizardskin. around a log or snag   
the surface currents run 

like lumber about a knot. a boat 
is bent to sea--we favor the medium   
we're in, our shape's 
around us. it takes time. 

at night, the bed alive, what   
teller of truth could tell 
the two apart? lover, beloved,   
hope is command. your hand 

is given, when you take a hand. 



stuck on the fridge, our favorite pin-up girl   
is anorexic. on the radio we have a riff 

of muzak sax, and on the mind 
a self-help book. we sprawl all evening, all 

alone, in the unraised ranch   
all day the company we kept 

kept on incorporating. as for the world   
of poverty, we did our best, thanks 

to a fund of christian feeling   
and mementos from 

amelia, the foster child, who has 
the rags and seven photogenic sisters we prefer 

in someone to be saved. she's proof   
americans have got a heart 

to go with all that happy 
acumen you read about. we're known to love 

a million little prettinesses,   
decency, and ribbons on 

the cockapoo. but who 
will study alphabets for hands? who gives 

a damn what patience goes into 
a good wheelchair? who lugs the rice 

from its umpteen stores 
to the ends of the earth, to even 

one dead-end? not we.   
our constitutional pursuit 

is happiness, i.e.   
somebody nice, and not 

too fat, we can have   
for our personal friend. 



abortions will not let you forget. 
you remember the children you got that you did not get,   
the damp small pulps with a little or with no hair,   
the singers and workers that never handled the air.   
you will never neglect or beat 
them, or silence or buy with a sweet. 
you will never wind up the sucking-thumb 
or scuttle off ghosts that come. 
you will never leave them, controlling your luscious sigh,   
return for a snack of them, with gobbling mother-eye. 

i have heard in the voices of the wind the voices of my dim killed children. 
i have contracted. i have eased 
my dim dears at the breasts they could never suck. 
i have said, sweets, if i sinned, if i seized 
your luck 
and your lives from your unfinished reach, 
if i stole your births and your names, 
your straight baby tears and your games, 
your stilted or lovely loves, your tumults, your marriages, aches, and your deaths, 
if i poisoned the beginnings of your breaths, 
believe that even in my deliberateness i was not deliberate.   
though why should i whine, 
whine that the crime was other than mine?-- 
since anyhow you are dead. 
or rather, or instead, 
you were never made. 
but that too, i am afraid, 
is faulty oh, what shall i say, how is the truth to be said?   
you were born, you had body, you died. 
it is just that you never giggled or planned or cried. 

believe me, i loved you all. 
believe me, i knew you, though faintly, and i loved, i loved you 
all.


i've stayed in the front yard all my life. 
i want a peek at the back 
where it's rough and untended and hungry weed grows.   
a girl gets sick of a rose. 

i want to go in the back yard now   
and maybe down the alley, 
to where the charity children play.   
i want a good time today. 

they do some wonderful things. 
they have some wonderful fun. 
my mother sneers, but i say it's fine 
how they don't have to go in at quarter to nine.   
my mother, she tells me that johnnie mae   
will grow up to be a bad woman. 
that george'll be taken to jail soon or late 
on account of last winter he sold our back gate. 

but i say it's fine. honest, i do. 
and i'd like to be a bad woman, too, 
and wear the brave stockings of night-black lace   
and strut down the streets with paint on my face.


maud went to college.   
sadie stayed at home.   
sadie scraped life 
with a fine-tooth comb. 

she didn't leave a tangle in.   
her comb found every strand. 
sadie was one of the livingest chits   
in all the land. 

sadie bore two babies   
under her maiden name.   
maud and ma and papa   
nearly died of shame. 

when sadie said her last so-long   
her girls struck out from home.   
sadie had left as heritage 
her fine-tooth comb. 

maud, who went to college,   
is a thin brown mouse. 
she is living all alone 
in this old house.


he was born in alabama.   
he was bred in illinois.   
he was nothing but a   
plain black boy. 

swing low swing low sweet sweet chariot.   
nothing but a plain black boy. 

drive him past the pool hall.   
drive him past the show.   
blind within his casket, 
but maybe he will know. 

down through forty-seventh street   
underneath the l, 
and northwest corner, prairie,   
that he loved so well. 

don't forget the dance halls-- 
warwick and savoy, 
where he picked his women, where   
he drank his liquid joy. 

born in alabama. 
bred in illinois. 
he was nothing but a   
plain black boy. 

swing low swing low sweet sweet chariot.   
nothing but a plain black boy.


mrs. coley's three-flat brick 
isn't here any more. 
all done with seeing her fat little form   
burst out of the basement door 
and with seeing her african son-in-law   
rightful heir to the throne 
with his great white strong cold squares of teeth   
and his little eyes of stone 
and with seeing the squat fat daughter   
letting in the men 
when majesty has gone for the day-- 
and letting them out again.


inamoratas, with an approbation,   
bestowed his title. blessed his inclination. 

he wakes, unwinds, elaborately a cat   
tawny, reluctant, royal. he is fat 
and fine this morning. definite. reimbursed. 

he waits a moment, he designs his reign,   
that no performance may be plain or vain.   
then rises in a clear delirium. 

he sheds, with his pajamas, shabby days.   
and his desertedness, his intricate fear, the   
postponed resentments and the prim precautions. 

now, at his bath, would you deny him lavender   
or take away the power of his pine? 
what smelly substitute, heady as wine, 
would you provide? life must be aromatic. 
there must be scent, somehow there must be some.   
would you have flowers in his life? suggest 
asters? a really good geranium? 
a white carnation? would you prescribe a show   
with the cold lilies, formal chrysanthemum   
magnificence, poinsettias, and emphatic   
red of prize roses? might his happiest   
alternative you muse be, after all,   
a bit of gentle garden in the best 
of taste and straight tradition? maybe so.   
but you forget, or did you ever know,   
his heritage of cabbage and pigtails,   
old intimacy with alleys, garbage pails, 
down in the deep but always beautiful south   
where roses blush their blithest it is said   
and sweet magnolias put chanel to shame. 

no he has not a flower to his name. 
except a feather one, for his lapel. 
apart from that, if he should think of flowers   
it is in terms of dandelions or death. 
ah, there is little hope. you might as well-- 
unless you care to set the world a-boil 
and do a lot of equalizing things, 
remove a little ermine, say, from kings, 
shake hands with paupers and appoint them men,   
for instance--certainly you might as well 
leave him his lotion, lavender and oil. 

let us proceed. let us inspect, together   
with his meticulous and serious love, 
the innards of this closet. which is a vault 
whose glory is not diamonds, not pearls,   
not silver plate with just enough dull shine.   
but wonder-suits in yellow and in wine,   
sarcastic green and zebra-striped cobalt.   
with shoulder padding that is wide   
and cocky and determined as his pride   
ballooning pants that taper off to ends   
scheduled to choke precisely. 
                                           here are hats   
like bright umbrellas and hysterical ties 
like narrow banners for some gathering war. 

people are so in need, in need of help. 
people want so much that they do not know. 

below the tinkling trade of little coins   
the gold impulse not possible to show 
or spend. promise piled over and betrayed. 

these kneaded limbs receive the kiss of silk.   
then they receive the brave and beautiful   
embrace of some of that equivocal wool.   
he looks into his mirror, loves himself-- 
the neat curve here the angularity   
that is appropriate at just its place   
the technique of a variegated grace. 

here is all his sculpture and his art   
and all his architectural design.   
perhaps you would prefer to this a fine 
value of marble, complicated stone. 
would have him think with horror of baroque,   
rococo. you forget and you forget. 

he dances down the hotel steps that keep   
remnants of last night's high life and distress.   
as spat-out purchased kisses and spilled beer.   
he swallows sunshine with a secret yelp.   
passes to coffee and a roll or two. 
has breakfasted. 
                        out. sounds about him smear, 
become a unit. he hears and does not hear 
the alarm clock meddling in somebody's sleep   
children's governed sunday happiness   
the dry tone of a plane a woman's oath   
consumption's spiritless expectoration   
an indignant robin's resolute donation   
pinching a track through apathy and din   
restaurant vendors weeping and the l   
that comes on like a slightly horrible thought. 

pictures, too, as usual, are blurred. 
he sees and does not see the broken windows   
hiding their shame with newsprint little girl   
with ribbons decking wornness, little boy   
wearing the trousers with the decentest patch,   
to honor sunday women on their way   
from service, temperate holiness arranged   
ably on asking faces men estranged 
from music and from wonder and from joy 
but far familiar with the guiding awe 
of foodlessness. 
                        he loiters. 
                                        restaurant vendors   
weep, or out of them rolls a restless glee. 
the lonesome blues, the long-lost blues, i want a   
big fat mama. down these sore avenues 
comes no saint-sans, no piquant elusive grieg,   
and not tschaikovsky's wayward eloquence   
and not the shapely tender drift of brahms. 
but could he love them? since a man must bring   
to music what his mother spanked him for 
when he was two bits of forgotten hate, 
devotion whether or not his mattress hurts   
the little dream his father humored the thing   
his sister did for money what he ate 
for breakfast--and for dinner twenty years 
ago last autumn all his skipped desserts. 

the pasts of his ancestors lean against   
him. crowd him. fog out his identity.   
hundreds of hungers mingle with his own,   
hundreds of voices advise so dexterously   
he quite considers his reactions his,   
judges he walks most powerfully alone,   
that everything is--simply what it is. 

but movie-time approaches, time to boo   
the hero's kiss, and boo the heroine   
whose ivory and yellow it is sin 
for his eye to eat of. the mickey mouse,   
however, is for everyone in the house. 

squires his lady to dinner at joe's eats.   
his lady alters as to leg and eye, 
thickness and height, such minor points as these,   
from sunday to sunday. but no matter what   
her name or body positively she's 
in queen lace stockings with ambitious heels   

that strain to kiss the calves, and vivid shoes   
frontless and backless, chinese fingernails,   
earrings, three layers of lipstick, intense hat   
dripping with the most voluble of veils.   
her affable extremes are like sweet bombs   
about him, whom no middle grace or good   
could gratify. he had no education 
in quiet arts of compromise. he would 
not understand your counsels on control, nor   
thank you for your late trouble. 
                                                at joe's eats 
you get your fish or chicken on meat platters.   
with coleslaw, macaroni, candied sweets,   
coffee and apple pie. you go out full. 
the end is--isn't it?--all that really matters. 

                      and even and intrepid come 
                      the tender boots of night to home. 

                      her body is like new brown bread   
                      under the woolworth mignonette. 
                      her body is a honey bowl 
                      whose waiting honey is deep and hot,   
                      her body is like summer earth,   
                      receptive, soft, and absolute ...


i hold my honey and i store my bread   
in little jars and cabinets of my will.   
i label clearly, and each latch and lid   
i bid, be firm till i return from hell.   
i am very hungry. i am incomplete. 
and none can tell when i may dine again.   
no man can give me any word but wait,   
the puny light. i keep eyes pointed in   
hoping that, when the devil days of my hurt   
drag out to their last dregs and i resume   
on such legs as are left me, in such heart   
as i can manage, remember to go home, 
my taste will not have turned insensitive   
to honey and bread old purity could love.


into her mother's bedroom to wash the ballooning body.   
my mother is jelly-hearted and she has a brain of jelly   
sweet, quiver-soft, irrelevant. not essential. 
only a habit would cry if she should die. 
a pleasant sort of fool without the least iron. . . . 
are you better, mother, do you think it will come today?   
the stretched yellow rag that was jessie mitchell's mother   
reviewed her. young, and so thin, and so straight.   
so straight as if nothing could ever bend her. 
but poor men would bend her, and doing things with poor men, 
being much in bed, and babies would bend her over, 
and the rest of things in life that were for poor women,   
coming to them grinning and pretty with intent to bend and to kill. 
comparisons shattered her heart, ate at her bulwarks 
the shabby and the bright she, almost hating her daughter,   
crept into an old sly refuge jessie's black 
and her way will be black, and jerkier even than mine.   
mine, in fact, because i was lovely, had flowers 
tucked in the jerks, flowers were here and there. . . . 
she revived for the moment settled and dried-up triumphs, 
forced perfume into old petals, pulled up the droop,   
refueled 
triumphant long-exhaled breaths. 
her exquisite yellow youth . . .


arrive. the ladies from the ladies' betterment league 
arrive in the afternoon, the late light slanting   
in diluted gold bars across the boulevard brag 
of proud, seamed faces with mercy and murder hinting   
here, there, interrupting, all deep and debonair, 
the pink paint on the innocence of fear   
walk in a gingerly manner up the hall. 
cutting with knives served by their softest care,   
served by their love, so barbarously fair. 
whose mothers taught you'd better not be cruel   
you had better not throw stones upon the wrens   
herein they kiss and coddle and assault   
anew and dearly in the innocence   
with which they baffle nature. who are full,   
sleek, tender-clad, fit, fiftyish, a-glow, all   
sweetly abortive, hinting at fat fruit,   
judge it high time that fiftyish fingers felt   
beneath the lovelier planes of enterprise.   
to resurrect. to moisten with milky chill.   
to be a random hitching-post or plush. 
to be, for wet eyes, random and handy hem. 
                        their guild is giving money to the poor. 
the worthy poor. the very very worthy 
and beautiful poor. perhaps just not too swarthy? 
perhaps just not too dirty nor too dim   
nor--passionate. in truth, what they could wish 
is--something less than derelict or dull. 
not staunch enough to stab, though, gaze for gaze 
god shield them sharply from the beggar-bold   
the noxious needy ones whose battle's bald   
nonetheless for being voiceless, hits one down. 
                        but it's all so bad and entirely too much for them. 
the stench the urine, cabbage, and dead beans, 
dead porridges of assorted dusty grains, 
the old smoke, heavy diapers, and, they're told, 
something called chitterlings. the darkness. drawn 
darkness, or dirty light. the soil that stirs.   
the soil that looks the soil of centuries. 
and for that matter the general oldness. old   
wood. old marble. old tile. old old old. 
not homekind oldness not lake forest, glencoe. 
nothing is sturdy, nothing is majestic, 
there is no quiet drama, no rubbed glaze, no   
unkillable infirmity of such 
a tasteful turn as lately they have left,   
glencoe, lake forest, and to which their cars   
must presently restore them. when they're done 
with dullards and distortions of this fistic 
patience of the poor and put-upon. 
                        they've never seen such a make-do-ness as   
newspaper rugs before in this, this flat,   
their hostess is gathering up the oozed, the rich   
rugs of the morning tattered the bespattered. . . .   
readies to spread clean rugs for afternoon.   
here is a scene for you. the ladies look,   
in horror, behind a substantial citizeness   
whose trains clank out across her swollen heart.   
who, arms akimbo, almost fills a door. 
all tumbling children, quilts dragged to the floor   
and tortured thereover, potato peelings, soft- 
eyed kitten, hunched-up, haggard, to-be-hurt. 
                        their league is allotting largesse to the lost.   
but to put their clean, their pretty money, to put   
their money collected from delicate rose-fingers   
tipped with their hundred flawless rose-nails seems . . . 
                        they own spode, lowestoft, candelabra,   
mantels, and hostess gowns, and sunburst clocks,   
turtle soup, chippendale, red satin hangings,   
aubussons and hattie carnegie. they winter   
in palm beach cross the water in june attend,   
when suitable, the nice art institute 
buy the right books in the best bindings saunter   
on michigan, easter mornings, in sun or wind.   
oh squalor this sick four-story hulk, this fibre   
with fissures everywhere why, what are bringings   
of loathe-love largesse? what shall peril hungers   
so old old, what shall flatter the desolate?   
tin can, blocked fire escape and chitterling 
and swaggering seeking youth and the puzzled wreckage   
of the middle passage, and urine and stale shames   
and, again, the porridges of the underslung 
and children children children. heavens that 
was a rat, surely, off there, in the shadows? long 
and long-tailed? gray? the ladies from the ladies'   
betterment league agree it will be better 
to achieve the outer air that rights and steadies, 
to hie to a house that does not holler, to ring 
bells elsetime, better presently to cater 
to no more possibilities, to get 
away. perhaps the money can be posted. 
perhaps they two may choose another slum 
some serious sooty half-unhappy home-- 
where loathe-love likelier may be invested. 
                        keeping their scented bodies in the center   
of the hall as they walk down the hysterical hall,   
they allow their lovely skirts to graze no wall, 
are off at what they manage of a canter, 
and, resuming all the clues of what they were, 
try to avoid inhaling the laden air.


kathleen eileen
already i am no longer looked at with lechery or love. 
my daughters and sons have put me away with marbles and dolls, 
are gone from the house. 
my husband and lovers are pleasant or somewhat polite   
and night is night. 

it is a real chill out, 
the genuine thing. 
i am not deceived, i do not think it is still summer   
because sun stays and birds continue to sing. 

it is summer-gone that i see, it is summer-gone.   
the sweet flowers indrying and dying down, 
the grasses forgetting their blaze and consenting to brown. 

it is a real chill out. the fall crisp comes.   
i am aware there is winter to heed.   
there is no warm house 
that is fitted with my need. 
i am cold in this cold house this house 
whose washed echoes are tremulous down lost halls. 
i am a woman, and dusty, standing among new affairs.   
i am a woman who hurries through her prayers. 

tin intimations of a quiet core to be my   
desert and my dear relief 
come there shall be such islanding from grief,   
and small communion with the master shore.   
twang they. and i incline this ear to tin,   
consult a dual dilemma. whether to dry   
in humming pallor or to leap and die. 

somebody muffed it? somebody wanted to joke.


for reverend theodore richardson
if mary came would mary   
forgive, as mothers may,   
and sad and second saviour   
furnish us today? 

she would not shake her head and leave   
this military air, 
but ratify a modern hay, 
and put her baby there. 

mary would not punish men-- 
if mary came again.


rudolph reed was oaken. 
his wife was oaken too. 
and his two good girls and his good little man   
oakened as they grew. 

i am not hungry for berries.   
i am not hungry for bread.   
but hungry hungry for a house   
where at night a man in bed 

may never hear the plaster   
stir as if in pain. 
may never hear the roaches   
falling like fat rain. 

where never wife and children need   
go blinking through the gloom.   
where every room of many rooms   
will be full of room. 

oh my home may have its east or west   
or north or south behind it. 
all i know is i shall know it,   
and fight for it when i find it. 

it was in a street of bitter white   
that he made his application.   
for rudolph reed was oakener   
than others in the nation. 

the agent's steep and steady stare 
corroded to a grin. 
why, you black old, tough old hell of a man,   
move your family in 
 

nary a grin grinned rudolph reed, 
nary a curse cursed he, 
but moved in his house. with his dark little wife,   
and his dark little children three. 

a neighbor would look, with a yawning eye   
that squeezed into a slit. 
but the rudolph reeds and the children three   
were too joyous to notice it. 

for were they not firm in a home of their own 
with windows everywhere 
and a beautiful banistered stair 
and a front yard for flowers and a back yard for grass? 

the first night, a rock, big as two fists.   
the second, a rock big as three. 
but nary a curse cursed rudolph reed.   
though oaken as man could be. 

the third night, a silvery ring of glass.   
patience ached to endure. 
but he looked, and lo small mabel's blood   
was staining her gaze so pure. 

then up did rise our rudolph reed   
and pressed the hand of his wife, 
and went to the door with a thirty-four   
and a beastly butcher knife. 

he ran like a mad thing into the night.   
and the words in his mouth were stinking.   
by the time he had hurt his first white man   
he was no longer thinking. 

by the time he had hurt his fourth white man   
rudolph reed was dead. 
his neighbors gathered and kicked his corpse.   
nigger-- his neighbors said. 

small mabel whimpered all night long,   
for calling herself the cause. 
her oak-eyed mother did no thing   
but change the bloody gauze.


there is a little lightning in his eyes.   
iron at the mouth. 
his brows ride neither too far up nor down. 

he is splendid. with a place to stand. 

some glowing in the common blood.   
some specialness within.

gang girls are sweet exotics. 
mary ann 
uses the nutrients of her orient, 
but sometimes sighs for cities of blue and jewel   
beyond her ranger rim of cottage grove.

dissolve no margins, stop no savory sanctities. 

mary is 
a rose in a whiskey glass. 

mary's 
februaries shudder and are gone. aprils   
fret frankly, lilac hurries on. 
summer is a hard irregular ridge. 
october looks away. 
and that's the year 
                     save for her bugle-love.   
save for the bleat of not-obese devotion. 
save for somebody terribly dying, under 
the philanthropy of robins. save for her ranger   
bringing 
an amount of rainbow in a string-drawn bag.   
where did you get the diamond? do not ask   
but swallow, straight, the spirals of his flask   
and assist him at your zipper pet his lips 
and help him clutch you. 

love's another departure. 
will there be any arrivals, confirmations?   
will there be gleaning?

her laboring lover ....

for sudden blood, aborted carnival, 
the props and niceties of non-loneliness-- 
the rhymes of leaning.


ugliest little boy 
that everyone ever saw.   
that is what everyone said. 

even to his mother it was apparent-- 
when the blue-aproned nurse came into the   
northeast end of the maternity ward   
bearing his squeals and plump bottom   
looped up in a scant receiving blanket,   
bending, to pass the bundle carefully   
into the waiting mother-hands--that this 
was no cute little ugliness, no sly baby waywardness   
that was going to inch away 
as would baby fat, baby curl, and   
baby spot-rash. the pendulous lip, the   
branching ears, the eyes so wide and wild,   
the vague unvibrant brown of the skin,   
and, most disturbing, the great head.   
these components of that look bespoke   
the sure fibre. the deep grain. 

his father could not bear the sight of him. 
his mother high-piled her pretty dyed hair and   
put him among her hairpins and sweethearts,   
dance slippers, torn paper roses. 
he was not less than these, 
he was not more. 

as the little lincoln grew, 
uglily upward and out, he began   
to understand that something was   
wrong. his little ways of trying   
to please his father, the bringing   
of matches, the jumping aside at   
warning sound of oh-so-large and   
rushing stride, the smile that gave   
and gave and gave--unsuccessful 

even christmases and easters were spoiled.   
he would be sitting at the 
family feasting table, really 
delighting in the displays of mashed potatoes   
and the rich golden 
fat-crust of the ham or the festive 
fowl, when he would look up and find   
somebody feeling indignant about him. 

what a pity what a pity. no love   
for one so loving. the little lincoln   
loved everybody. ants. the changing   
caterpillar. his much-missing mother.   
his kindergarten teacher. 

his kindergarten teacher--whose   
concern for him was composed of one   
part sympathy and two parts repulsion. 
the others ran up with their little drawings.   
he ran up with his. 
she 
tried to be as pleasant with him as   
with others, but it was difficult. 
for she was all pretty all daintiness, 
all tiny vanilla, with blue eyes and fluffy   
sun-hair. one afternoon she 
saw him in the hall looking bleak against   
the wall. it was strange because the   
bell had long since rung and no other   
child was in sight. pity flooded her.   
she buttoned her gloves and suggested   
cheerfully that she walk him home. she   
started out bravely, holding him by the   
hand. but she had not walked far before   
she regretted it. the little monkey.   
must everyone look? and clutching her   
hand like that. . . . literally pinching   
it. . . . 

at seven, the little lincoln loved 
the brother and sister who 
moved next door. handsome. well- 
dressed. charitable, often, to him. they   
enjoyed him because he was 
resourceful, made up 
games, told stories. but when 
their more acceptable friends came they turned   
their handsome backs on him. he 
hated himself for his feeling 
of well-being when with them despite-- 
everything. 

he spent much time looking at himself   
in mirrors. what could be done?   
but there was no 
shrinking his head. there was no   
binding his ears. 

don't touch me cried the little   
fairy-like being in the playground. 

her name was nerissa. the many   
children were playing tag, but when   
he caught her, she recoiled, jerked free   
and ran. it was like all the 
rainbow that ever was, going off   
forever, all, all the sparklings in 
the sunset west. 

one day, while he was yet seven, 
a thing happened. in the down-town movies   
with his mother a white 
man in the seat beside him whispered   
loudly to a companion, and pointed at   
the little linc. 
there that's the kind i've been wanting   
to show you one of the best 
examples of the specie. not like 
those diluted negroes you see so much of on   
the streets these days, but the 
real thing. 

black, ugly, and odd. you 
can see the savagery. the blunt   
blankness. that is the real   
thing. 

his mother--her hair had never looked so 
red around the dark brown   
velvet of her face--jumped up,   
shrieked go to-- she did not finish.   
she yanked to his feet the little   
lincoln, who was sitting there 
staring in fascination at his assessor. at the author of his   
new idea. 

all the way home he was happy. of course,   
he had not liked the word 
ugly. 
but, after all, should he not 
be used to that by now? what had 
struck him, among words and meanings   
he could little understand, was the phrase   
the real thing. 
he didn't know quite why, 
but he liked that. 
he liked that very much. 

when he was hurt, too much 
stared at-- 
too much 
left alone--he 
thought about that. he told himself 
after all, i'm   
the real thing. 

it comforted him.


of the furious 


who take today and jerk it out of joint   
have made new underpinnings and a head.   

blacktime is time for chimeful 
poemhood 
but they decree a 
jagged chiming now. 

if there are flowers flowers 
must come out to the road. rowdy-- 
knowing where wheels and people are, 
knowing where whips and screams are, 
knowing where deaths are, where the kind kills are.   

as for that other kind of kindness, 
if there is milk it must be mindful. 
the milkofhumankindness must be mindful   
as wily wines. 
must be fine fury. 
must be mega, must be main. 

taking today to jerk it out of joint 
the hardheroic maim the 
leechlike-as-usual who use, 
adhere to, carp, and harm. 

and they await, 
across the changes and the spiraling dead,   
our black revival, our black vinegar,   
our hands, and our hot blood.


tonight my brother, in heavy boots, is walking 
through bare rooms over my head, 
opening and closing doors. 
what could he be looking for in an empty house?   
what could he possibly need there in heaven? 
does he remember his earth, his birthplace set to torches?   
his love for me feels like spilled water 
running back to its vessel. 

at this hour, what is dead is restless   
and what is living is burning. 

someone tell him he should sleep now. 

my father keeps a light on by our bed   
and readies for our journey. 
he mends ten holes in the knees 
of five pairs of boy's pants. 
his love for me is like his sewing 
various colors and too much thread, 
the stitching uneven. but the needle pierces   
clean through with each stroke of his hand. 

at this hour, what is dead is worried   
and what is living is fugitive. 

someone tell him he should sleep now. 

god, that old furnace, keeps talking   
with his mouth of teeth, 
a beard stained at feasts, and his breath   
of gasoline, airplane, human ash.   
his love for me feels like fire, 
feels like doves, feels like river-water. 

at this hour, what is dead is helpless, kind   
and helpless. while the lord lives. 

someone tell the lord to leave me alone.   
i've had enough of his love 
that feels like burning and flight and running away. 




it wasn't the bright hems of the lord's skirts   
that brushed my face and i opened my eyes   
to see from a cleft in rock his backside 

it's a wasp perched on my left cheek. i keep   
my eyes closed and stand perfectly still   
in the garden till it leaves me alone, 

not to contemplate how this century   
ends and the next begins with no one 
i know having seen god, but to wonder 

why i get through most days unscathed, though i   
live in a time when it might be otherwise,   
and i grow more fatherless each day. 

for years now i have come to conclusions   
without my father's help, discovering 
on my own what i know, what i don't know, 

and seeing how one cancels the other. 
i've become a scholar of cancellations.   
here, i stand among my father's roses 

and see that what punctures outnumbers what 
consoles, the cruel and the tender never 
make peace, though one climbs, though one descends 

petal by petal to the hidden ground   
no one owns. i see that which is taken   
away by violence or persuasion. 

the rose announces on earth the kingdom   
of gravity. a bird cancels it.   
my eyelids cancel the bird. anything 

might cancel my eyes distance, time, war.   
my father said, never take your both eyes   
off of the world, before he rocked me. 

all night we waited for the knock 
that would have signalled, all clear, come now   
it would have meant escape it never came. 

i didn't make the world i leave you with,   
he said, and then, being poor, he left me   
only this world, in which there is always 

a family waiting in terror 
before they're rended, this world wherein a man   
might arise, go down, and walk along a path 

and pause and bow to roses, roses 
his father raised, and admire them, for one moment   
unable, thank god, to see in each and 
every flower the world cancelling itself. 




lie still now 
while i prepare for my future, 
certain hard days ahead, 
when i'll need what i know so clearly this moment. 

i am making use 
of the one thing i learned 
of all the things my father tried to teach me   
the art of memory. 

i am letting this room 
and everything in it 
stand for my ideas about love   
and its difficulties. 

i'll let your love-cries,   
those spacious notes   
of a moment ago,   
stand for distance. 

your scent, 
that scent 
of spice and a wound,   
i'll let stand for mystery. 

your sunken belly   
is the daily cup   
of milk i drank 
as a boy before morning prayer. 
the sun on the face   
of the wall 
is god, the face 
i can't see, my soul, 

and so on, each thing 
standing for a separate idea, 
and those ideas forming the constellation   
of my greater idea. 
and one day, when i need 
to tell myself something intelligent   
about love, 

i'll close my eyes 
and recall this room and everything in it   
my body is estrangement. 
this desire, perfection. 
your closed eyes my extinction. 
now i've forgotten my 
idea. the book 
on the windowsill, riffled by wind . . . 
the even-numbered pages are 
the past, the odd- 
numbered pages, the future. 
the sun is 
god, your body is milk . . . 

useless, useless . . . 
your cries are song, my body's not me . . . 
no good . . . my idea 
has evaporated . . . your hair is time, your thighs are song . . . 
it had something to do 
with death . . . it had something 
to do with love. 



once in mexico an old man was 
leading on a string--was it a cat? 
and we saw it was a tarantula 
sidling along in the dust, writing 
a message from god for people who 
thought they knew where creature-life ended. 

i sweep my own floor 
--less fuss. 
i walk i get tired 
but do not have to worry about a horse. 

my hands and feet will not loiter   
when i am not looking. 
i will not overwork them. 
besides, it's good for my health. 

my jacket's wistaria flax,   
my blanket hemp, 
berries and young greens   
my food. 

let it be quite understood, 
all this is merely personal. 
i am not preaching the simple life   
to those who enjoy being rich. 

i am shifting rivermist, not to be trusted. 
i do not ask anything extraordinary of myself.   
i like a nap after dinner 
and to see the seasons come round in good order. 

hankering, vexation and apathy,   
that's the run of the world. 
hankering, vexation and apathy,   
keeping a carriage wont cure it. 

keeping a man in livery 
wont cure it. keeping a private fortress   
wont cure it. these things satisfy no craving,   
hankering, vexation and apathy ...   

i am out of place in the capital, 
people take me for a beggar, 
as you would be out of place in this sort of life, 
you are so          i regret it         so welded to your vulgarity. 

the moonshadow merges with darkness   
on the cliffpath, 
a tricky turn near ahead. 

oh there's nothing to complain about.   
buddha says none of the world is good.'   
i am fond of my hut ...   

i have renounced the world   
have a saintly   
appearance. 

i do not enjoy being poor,   
i've a passionate nature.   
my tongue 
clacked a few prayers.


all our roads go nowhere.

maps are curled

to keep the pavement definitely 

on the world.


all our footsteps, set to make 

metric advance,

lapse into arcs in deference 

to circumstance.


all our journeys nearing space 

skirt it with care,

shying at the distances

present in air.


blithely travel-stained and worn, 

erect and sure,

all our travels go forth,

making down the roads of earth 

endless detour.


at supper time an ondine's narrow feet 
made dark tracks on the hearth. 
like the heart of a yellow fruit was the fire's heat,   
but they rubbed together quite blue with the cold.   
the sandy hem of her skirt dripped on the floor.   
she sat there with a silvered cedar knot 
for a low stool and i sat opposite, 
my lips and eyelids hot 
in the heat of the fire. piling on dry bark, 
seeing that no steam went up from her dark dress,   
i felt uneasiness 
as though firm sand had shifted under my feet   
in the wash of a wave. 

i brought her soup from the stove and she would not eat,   
but sat there crying her cold tears, 
her blue lips quivering with cold and grief. 
she blamed me for a thief, 
saying that i had burned a piece of wood 
the tide washed up. and i said, no, 
the tide had washed it out again and even so, 
a piece of sodden wood was not so rare 
as polished agate stones or ambergris. 

she stood and wrung her hair 
so that the water made a sudden splash 
on the round rug by the door. i saw her go   
across the little footbridge to the beach. 
after, i threw the knot on the hot coals. 
it fell apart and burned with a white flash, 
a crackling roar in the chimney and dark smoke. 
i beat it out with a poker   
in the soft ash. 

now i am frightened on the shore at night,   
and all the phosphorescent swells that rise 
come towards me with the threat of her dark eyes   
with a cold firelight in them 
and crooked driftwood writhes 
in dry sand when i pass. 

should she return and bring her sisters with her,   
the withdrawing tide 
would leave a long pool in my bed. 
there would be nothing more of me this side   
the melting foamline of the latest wave.

in memoriam m.k.h., -
she taught me what her uncle once taught her
how easily the biggest coal block split
if you got the grain and hammer angled right.

the sound of that relaxed alluring blow, 
its co-opted and obliterated echo,
taught me to hit, taught me to loosen,

taught me between the hammer and the block
to face the music. teach me now to listen,
to strike it rich behind the linear black.

                                             
a cobble thrown a hundred years ago
keeps coming at me, the first stone
aimed at a great-grandmother's turncoat brow.
the pony jerks and the riot's on.
she's crouched low in the trap
running the gauntlet that first sunday
down the brae to mass at a panicked gallop.
he whips on through the town to cries of 'lundy'

call her 'the convert'. 'the exogamous bride'.
anyhow, it is a genre piece
inherited on my mother's side
and mine to dispose with now she's gone.
instead of silver and victorian lace,
the exonerating, exonerated stone.

                                             
polished linoleum shone there. brass taps shone.
the china cups were very white and big--
an unchipped set with sugar bowl and jug.
the kettle whistled. sandwich and tea scone
were present and correct. in case it run,
the butter must be kept out of the sun.
and don't be dropping crumbs. don't tilt your chair.
don't reach. don't point. don't make noise when you stir.

it is number , new row, land of the dead,
where grandfather is rising from his place
with spectacles pushed back on a clean bald head
to welcome a bewildered homing daughter
before she even knocks. 'what's this? what's this?'
and they sit down in the shining room together.

                                              
when all the others were away at mass
i was all hers as we peeled potatoes.
they broke the silence, let fall one by one
like solder weeping off the soldering iron
cold comforts set between us, things to share
gleaming in a bucket of clean water.
and again let fall. little pleasant splashes
from each other's work would bring us to our senses.

so while the parish priest at her bedside
went hammer and tongs at the prayers for the dying
and some were responding and some crying
i remembered her head bent towards my head,
her breath in mine, our fluent dipping knives--
never closer the whole rest of our lives.

                                               
fear of affectation made her affect 
inadequacy whenever it came to 
pronouncing words 'beyond her'. bertold brek.
she'd manage something hampered and askew 
every time, as if she might betray
the hampered and inadequate by too
well-adjusted a vocabulary.
with more challenge than pride, she'd tell me, 'you
know all them things.' so i governed my tongue
in front of her, a genuinely well-
adjusted adequate betrayal
of what i knew better. i'd naw and aye
and decently relapse into the wrong
grammar which kept us allied and at bay.

                                                
the cool that came off sheets just off the line
made me think the damp must still be in them
but when i took my corners of the linen
and pulled against her, first straight down the hem
and then diagonally, then flapped and shook
the fabric like a sail in a cross-wind,
they made a dried-out undulating thwack.
so we'd stretch and fold and end up hand to hand
for a split second as if nothing had happened
for nothing had that had not always happened
beforehand, day by day, just touch and go,
coming close again by holding back
in moves where i was x and she was o
inscribed in sheets she'd sewn from ripped-out flour sacks.

                                               
in the first flush of the easter holidays
the ceremonies during holy week
were highpoints of our sons and lovers phase.
the midnight fire. the paschal candlestick.
elbow to elbow, glad to be kneeling next
to each other up there near the front
of the packed church, we would follow the text
and rubrics for the blessing of the font.
as the hind longs for the streams, so my soul. . .
dippings. towellings. the water breathed on.
the water mixed with chrism and with oil.
cruet tinkle. formal incensation
and the psalmist's outcry taken up with pride
day and night my tears have been my bread.

                                                
in the last minutes he said more to her
almost than in all their life together.
'you'll be in new row on monday night
and i'll come up for you and you'll be glad
when i walk in the door . . . isn't that right?'
his head was bent down to her propped-up head.
she could not hear but we were overjoyed.
he called her good and girl. then she was dead,
the searching for a pulsebeat was abandoned
and we all knew one thing by being there.
the space we stood around had been emptied
into us to keep, it penetrated
clearances that suddenly stood open.
high cries were felled and a pure change happened.

                                                
i thought of walking round and round a space
utterly empty, utterly a source
where the decked chestnut tree had lost its place
in our front hedge above the wallflowers.
the white chips jumped and jumped and skited high.
i heard the hatchet's differentiated
accurate cut, the crack, the sigh
and collapse of what luxuriated
through the shocked tips and wreckage of it all.
deep-planted and long gone, my coeval
chestnut from a jam jar in a hole,
its heft and hush become a bright nowhere,
a soul ramifying and forever
silent, beyond silence listened for.


the trouble with paradise is you never want to be away from home.

i make what calls me out. 
all gone before you know it.

words may drop passing color yet seeing you here now are born again, and again. 
closing a word in the mouth feels the sound until the tongue can't stay still.

to unmask is to go silent.
language makes no promise to communicate.

an articulated sound has it own dream in the ear.
her presence in the room gives aroma to the syllables i voice.

now she's ready to draw eros from foreign bodies.
it starts by focusing on the sounds beyond hearing, still felt.

by she i mean who speaking animate configures.
this is the time of alternative obscurities to see through.

through thoroughly, as a word weighs.




as if he had been poured
in tar, he lies
on a pillow of turf
and seems to weep

the black river of himself.
the grain of his wrists
is like bog oak,
the ball of his heel

like a basalt egg.
his instep has shrunk
cold as a swan's foot
or a wet swamp root.

his hips are the ridge
and purse of a mussel,
his spine an eel arrested
under a glisten of mud.

the head lifts,
the chin is a visor
raised above the vent
of his slashed throat

that has tanned and toughened.
the cured wound
opens inwards to a dark
elderberry place.

who will say 'corpse'
to his vivid cast?
who will say 'body'
to his opaque repose?

and his rusted hair,
a mat unlikely
as a foetus's.
i first saw his twisted face

in a photograph,
a head and shoulder
out of the peat,
bruised like a forceps baby,

but now he lies 
perfected in my memory,
down to the red horn
of his nails,

hung in the scales
with beauty and atrocity
with the dying gaul
too strictly compassed

on his shield,
with the actual weight
of each hooded victim,
slashed and dumped.


         i
shifting brilliancies. then winter light
in a doorway, and on the stone doorstep
a beggar shivering in silhouette.

so the particular judgement might be set
bare wallstead and a cold hearth rained into--
bright puddle where the soul-free cloud-life roams.

and after the commanded journey, what?
nothing magnificent, nothing unknown.
a gazing out from far away, alone.

and it is not particular at all,
just old truth dawning there is no next-time-round.
unroofed scope. knowledge-freshening wind.

         ii
roof it again. batten down. dig in.
drink out of tin. know the scullery cold,
a latch, a door-bar, forged tongs and a grate.

touch the crossbeam, drive iron in a wall,
hang a line to verify the plumb
from lintel, coping-stone and chimney-breast.

relocate the bedrock in the threshold.
take squarings from the recessed gable pane.
make your study the unregarded floor.

sink every impulse like a bolt. secure
the bastion of sensation. do not waver
into language. do not waver in it.

         iii
squarings? in the game of marbles, squarings
were all those anglings, aimings, feints and squints
you were allowed before you'd shoot, all those

hunkerings, tensings, pressures of the thumb,
test-outs and pull-backs, re-envisagings,
all the ways your arms kept hoping towards

blind certainties that were going to prevail
beyond the one-off moment of the pitch.
a million million accuracies passed

between your muscles' outreach and that space
marked with three round holes and a drawn line.
you squinted out from a skylight of the world.

         v
three marble holes thumbed in the concrete road
before the concrete hardened still remained
three decades after the marble-player vanished

into australia. three stops to play
the music of the arbitrary on.
blow on them now and hear an undersong

your levelled breath made once going over
the empty bottle. improvise. make free
like old hay in its flimsy afterlife

high on a windblown hedge. ocarina earth.
three listening posts up on some hard-baked tier
above the resonating amphorae.

         vi
once, as a child, out in a field of sheep,
thomas hardy pretended to be dead
and lay down flat among their dainty shins.

in that sniffed-at, bleated-into, grassy space
he experimented with infinity.
his small cool brow was like an anvil waiting

for sky to make it sing the perfect pitch
of his dumb being, and that stir he caused
in the fleece-hustle was the original

of a ripple that would travel eighty years
outward from there, to be the same ripple
inside him at its last circumference.

         vii
i misremembered. he went down on all fours,
florence emily says, crossing a ewe-leaze.
hardy sought the creatures face to face,

their witless eyes and liability
to panic made him feel less alone,
made proleptic sorrow stand a moment

over him, perfectly known and sure.
and then the flock's dismay went swimming on
into the blinks and murmurs and deflections

he'd know at parties in renowned old age
when sometimes he imagined himself a ghost
and circulated with that new perspective.

         viii
the annals say when the monks of clonmacnoise
were all at prayers inside the oratory
a ship appeared above them in the air.

the anchor dragged along behind so deep
it hooked itself into the altar rails
and then, as the big hull rocked to a standstill,

a crewman shinned and grappled down the rope
and struggled to release it. but in vain.
'this man can't bear our life here and will drown,'

the abbot said, 'unless we help him.' so
they did, the freed ship sailed, and the man climbed back
out of the marvellous as he had known it.

         ix 
a boat that did not rock or wobble once
sat in long grass one sunday afternoon
in nineteen forty-one or -two. the heat

out on lough neagh and in where cattle stood
jostling and skittering near the hedge
grew redolent of the tweed skirt and tweed sleeve

i nursed on. i remember little treble
timber-notes their smart heels struck from planks,
me cradled in an elbow like a secret

open now as the eye of heaven was then
above three sisters talking, talking steady
in a boat the ground still falls and falls from under.

         x
overhang of grass and seedling birch
on the quarry face. rock-hob where you watched
all that cargoed brightness travelling

above and beyond and sumptuously across
the water in its clear deep dangerous holes
on the quarry floor. ultimate

fathomableness, ultimate
stony up-againstness could you reconcile
what was diaphanous there with what was massive?

were you equal to or were you opposite
to build-ups so promiscuous and weightless?
shield your eyes, look up and face the music.
 
         xii
and lightening? one meaning of that
beyond the usual sense of alleviation,
illumination, and so on, is this

a phenomenal instant when the spirit flares
with pure exhilaration before death--
the good thief in us harking to the promise

so paint him on christ's right hand, on a promontory
scanning empty space, so body-racked he seems
untranslatable into the bliss

ached for at the moon-rim of his forehead,
by nail-craters on the dark side of his brain
this day thou shall be with me in paradise.


i'm feeling by ear.

consider them gods and not cruel but ecstatic.
they have trick tongues and can't talk straight but use us as waves to curve words.
in this moment we are here for their ride. climb on under.
transport poetics in the transtraditionals, revering rumors revved high.
we ask forgiveness for poem talk. i'm on her knees.

she makes me say these things because she is a middle way like no other.

the method is to wear me down to a base line vital pulse.
next pour right through carefully following the barely perceptible impulse.
almost dreams the state resists the name but go ahead and call it poetic that flares.
poetics remains neutral on its name but takes care when it comes to hers.
there's a watch out on her names.

it makes me wait until i have nothing else to fight with and then sets me loose.

when i think what is being said i get a lump in the stomach.
no go on the intellectual gizmo.
yes on any kind of lift, free run, no drift, too swift, the actual thing getting a lift.
it hits the beat like rock bottom.
the tongue gets hands on quick.

the hearback suddenly gets high in the sense of crossing right on over.


i was a man
and i was trying to save a woman in danger.

i picked her up in my arms
and flew.

flying like a frog swimming in air
i ditched our nameless pursuer

and landed. there was a guy
waiting for us

who looked
like a king.

caught.
now i have to accept the punishment

for saving the woman.
first,

we have to take a shower.
the effect is to loosen
 
the skin from the muscle
until it peels off.

the woman
picks up the pieces of my skin and

holds them in her hands
and says i will love each of these

as i loved you.
and i thought this is what is called
 
fetish. and suddenly it came to me that the origin
of the word is fe- as in female, soft, loving, silken --

plus -tissue. like tissues flying.
voicing particles waking in waves

over a living body
of water

loose at last


for thomas edwards wanning
think of the storm roaming the sky uneasily 
like a dog looking for a place to sleep in, 
listen to it growling.

think how they must look now, the mangrove keys
lying out there unresponsive to the lightning
in dark, coarse-fibred families,

where occasionally a heron may undo his head,
shake up his feathers, make an uncertain comment
when the surrounding water shines.

think of the boulevard and the little palm trees
all stuck in rows, suddenly revealed
as fistfuls of limp fish-skeletons.

it is raining there. the boulevard
and its broken sidewalks with weeds in every crack
are relieved to be wet, the sea to be freshened.

now the storm goes away again in a series
of small, badly lit battle-scenes,
each in another part of the field.

think of someone sleeping in the bottom of a row-boat
tied to a mangrove root or the pile of a bridge
think of him as uninjured, barely disturbed.


the nominalist in me invents 
a life devoid of precedents.
the realist takes a different view 
he claims that all i feel and do 
billions of others felt and did 
in history's pre-me period.

arguing thus, both voices speak 
a partial truth. i am unique, 
yet the unceasing self-distress 
of desire buffets me no less 
than it has other sons of man
who've come and gone since time began.

the meaning, then, of this dispute? 
my life's a nominalreal pursuit,
which leaves identity clear and blurred, 
in which what happens has occurred 
often and never--which is to say, 
never to me, or quite this way.


for robert lowell
this is the time of year
when almost every night
the frail, illegal fire balloons appear.
climbing the mountain height,

rising toward a saint
still honored in these parts,
the paper chambers flush and fill with light
that comes and goes, like hearts.

once up against the sky it's hard
to tell them from the stars--
planets, that is--the tinted ones
venus going down, or mars,

or the pale green one. with a wind,
they flare and falter, wobble and toss
but if it's still they steer between
the kite sticks of the southern cross,

receding, dwindling, solemnly
and steadily forsaking us,
or, in the downdraft from a peak,
suddenly turning dangerous.

last night another big one fell.
it splattered like an egg of fire
against the cliff behind the house.
the flame ran down. we saw the pair

of owls who nest there flying up
and up, their whirling black-and-white
stained bright pink underneath, until
they shrieked up out of sight.

the ancient owls' nest must have burned.
hastily, all alone,
a glistening armadillo left the scene,
rose-flecked, head down, tail down,

and then a baby rabbit jumped out,
short-eared, to our surprise.
so soft--a handful of intangible ash
with fixed, ignited eyes.

too pretty, dreamlike mimicry
o falling fire and piercing cry 
and panic, and a weak mailed fist
clenched ignorant against the sky


i put those things there.--see them burn.
the emerald the azure and the gold
hiss and crack, the blues & greens of the world
as if i were tired. someone interferes
everywhere with me. the clouds, the clouds are torn
in ways i do not understand or love.

licking my long lips, i looked upon god
and he flamed and he was friendlier
than you were, and he was small. showing me
serpents and thin flowers these were cold.
dominion waved & glittered like the flare
from ice under a small sun. i wonder.

afterward the violent and formal dancers
came out, shaking their pithless heads.
i would instruct them but i cannot now,--
because of the elements. they rise and move,
i nod a dance and they dance in the rain
in my red coat. i am the king of the dead.


jamestown 
it kissed us, soft, to cut our throats, this coast,
like a malice of the lazy king. i hunt,
& hunt but find here what to kill?--nothing is blunt,
but phantoming uneases i find. ghost
on ghost precedes of all most scared us, most
we fled. howls fail upon this secret, far air grunt,
shaming for food you must. i love the king
& it was not i who strangled at the toast
but a flux of a free & dying adjutant
god be with him. he & god be with us all,
for we are not to live, i cannot wring,
like laundry, blue my soul--indecisive thing . .
from undergrowth & over odd birds call
and who would starv'd so survive? god save the king.


liar, i thought, kneeling with the others,
 how can he love me and hate what i am?
 the dome of st. peter's shone yellowish
 gold, like butter and eggs. my god, i prayed
 anyhow, as if made in the image
 and likeness of him. nearby, a handsome
 priest looked at me like a stone i looked back,
 not desiring to go it alone.
 the college of cardinals wore punitive red.
 the white spine waved to me from his white throne.
 being in a place not my own, much less
 myself, i climbed out, a beast in a crib.
 somewhere a terrorist rolled a cigarette.
 reason, not faith, would change him.


what is the boy now, who has lost his ball.
what, what is he to do? i saw it go
merrily bouncing, down the street, and then
merrily over--there it is in the water
no use to say 'o there are other balls'
an ultimate shaking grief fixes the boy
as he stands rigid, trembling, staring down
all his young days into the harbour where
his ball went. i would not intrude on him,
a dime, another ball, is worthless. now
he senses first responsibility
in a world of possessions. people will take balls,
balls will be lost always, little boy,
and no one buys a ball back. money is external.
he is learning, well behind his desperate eyes,
the epistemology of loss, how to stand up
knowing what every man must one day know
and most know many days, how to stand up
and gradually light returns to the street,
a whistle blows, the ball is out of sight.
soon part of me will explore the deep and dark
floor of the harbour . . i am everywhere,
i suffer and move, my mind and my heart move
with all that move me, under the water
or whistling, i am not a little boy.


nothin very bad happen to me lately.
how you explain that? --i explain that, mr bones,
terms o' your bafflin odd sobriety.
sober as man can get, no girls, no telephones,
what could happen bad to mr bones?
--if life is a handkerchief sandwich,

in a modesty of death i join my father
who dared so long agone leave me.
a bullet on a concrete stoop
close by a smothering southern sea 
spreadeagled on an island, by my knee.
--you is from hunger, mr bones,

i offers you this handkerchief, now set 
your left foot by my right foot,
shoulder to shoulder, all that jazz,
arm in arm, by the beautiful sea
hum a little, mr bones.
--i saw nobody coming, so i went instead.


i lift--lift you five states away your glass,
wide of this bar you never graced, where none
ever i know came, where what work is done
even by these men i know not, where a brass
police-car sign peers in, wet strange cars pass,
soiled hangs the rag of day out over this town,
a juke-box brains air where i drink alone,
the spruce barkeep sports a toupee alas--

my glass i lift at six o'clock, my darling,
as you plotted . . chinese couples shift in bed,
we shared today not even filthy weather,
beasts in the hills their tigerish love are snarling,
suddenly they clash, i blow my short ash red,
grey eyes light and we have our drink together.


don't allow the lucid moment to dissolve
let the radiant thought last in stillness
though the page is almost filled and the flame flickers
we haven't risen yet to the level of ourselves
knowledge grows slowly like a wisdom tooth
the stature of a man is still notched
high up on a white door
from far off, the joyful voice of a trumpet
and of a song rolled up like a cat
what passes doesn't fall into a void
a stoker is still feeding coal into the fire
don't allow the lucid moment to dissolve
on a hard dry substance
you have to engrave the truth




the day was mild, the light was generous.
the german on the caf terrace
held a small book on his lap.
i caught sight of the title
mysticism for beginners.
suddenly i understood that the swallows
patrolling the streets of montepulciano
with their shrill whistles,
and the hushed talk of timid travelers
from eastern, so-called central europe,
and the white herons standing--yesterday? the day before?--
like nuns in fields of rice,
and the dusk, slow and systematic,
erasing the outlines of medieval houses,
and olive trees on little hills,
abandoned to the wind and heat,
and the head of the unknown princess
that i saw and admired in the louvre,
and stained-glass windows like butterfly wings
sprinkled with pollen,
and the little nightingale practicing
its speech beside the highway,
and any journey, any kind of trip,
are only mysticism for beginners,
the elementary course, prelude
to a test that's been
postponed.




for example, with someone who no longer is,
who exists only in yellowed letters.

or long walks beside a stream,
whose depths hold hidden

porcelain cups--and the talks about philosophy
with a timid student or the postman.

a passerby with proud eyes
whom you'll never know.

friendship with this world, ever more perfect
if not for the salty smell of blood.

the old man sipping coffee
in st.-lazare, who reminds you of someone.

faces flashing by
in local trains--

the happy faces of travelers headed perhaps
for a splendid ball, or a beheading.

and friendship with yourself
--since after all you don't know who you are.


i read your poetry once more,
poems written by a rich man, knowing all,
and by a beggar, homeless,
an emigrant, alone.

you always wanted to go
beyond poetry, above it, soaring,
but also lower, to where our region
begins, modest and timid.

sometimes your tone
transforms us for a moment,
we believe--truly-- 
that every day is sacred,

that poetry--how to put it? --
makes life rounder,
fuller, prouder, unashamed
of perfect formulation.

but evening arrives,
i lay my book aside,
and the city's ordinary din resumes--
somebody coughs, someone cries and curses.


.  without baggage

    to travel without baggage, sleep in the train
    on a hard wooden bench,
    forget your native land,
    emerge from small stations
    when a gray sky rises
    and fishing boats head to sea.


.  in belgium

    it was drizzling in belgium
    and the river wound between hills.
    i thought, i'm so imperfect.
    the trees sat in the meadows
    like priests in green cassocks.
    october was hiding in the weeds.
    no, ma'am, i said,
    this is the nontalking compartment.


.  a hawk circles above the highway

     it will be disappointed if it swoops down
    on sheet iron, on gas,
     on a tape of tawdry music,
    on our narrow hearts.


.  mont blanc

    it shines from afar, white and cautious,
    like a lantern for shadows.


.  segesta

    on the meadow a vast temple--
    a wild animal
    open to the sky.


.  summer

    summer was gigantic, triumphant--
    and our little car looked lost
    on the road going to verdun.


.  the station in bytom

    in the underground tunnel
    cigarette butts grow,
    not daisies.
    it stinks of loneliness.


.  retired people on a field trip

    they're learning to walk
    on land.


.  gulls

    eternity doesn't travel,
    eternity waits.
    in a fishing port
    only the gulls are chatty.


.  the theater in taormina

    from the theater in taormina you spot
    the snow on etna's peak 
    and the gleaming sea.
    which is the better actor?


.  a black cat

    a black cat comes out to greet us
    as if to say, look at me
    and not some old romanesque church.
    i'm alive.


.  a romanesque church

    at the bottom of the valley
    a romanesque church at rest
    there's wine in this cask.


.  light

    light on the walls of old houses,
    june.
    passerby, open your eyes.


.  at dawn

    the world's materiality at dawn--
    and the soul's frailty.


try to praise the mutilated world.
remember june's long days,
and wild strawberries, drops of ros wine.
the nettles that methodically overgrow
the abandoned homesteads of exiles.
you must praise the mutilated world.
you watched the stylish yachts and ships
one of them had a long trip ahead of it,
while salty oblivion awaited others.
you've seen the refugees going nowhere,
you've heard the executioners sing joyfully.
you should praise the mutilated world.
remember the moments when we were together
in a white room and the curtain fluttered.
return in thought to the concert where music flared.
you gathered acorns in the park in autumn
and leaves eddied over the earth's scars.
praise the mutilated world
and the gray feather a thrush lost,
and the gentle light that strays and vanishes
and returns.




simone weil, -
only the stones at first
seem to have a part in this,
and the little height of the grass
as it gains a fraction-inch

by gripping the shallow soil
with all the shocking might
of hunger and of thirst,
as if the soil itself

were all that's left on earth.
i think the grass alone
can hold within its grasp
what matters to it most,

and still it looks bereft,
and famished as the stones.
i watch a stream of moths
proceeding on their ways,

they carve out tortuous paths
as if they were intent
on entering unseen
and ever-smaller doors.

so four years into the war,
and cut off from the ones
whose circumstance you felt
and suffering as yours,

you carved yourself a path
through ever-narrowing doors
of hunger and of thirst,
and entered them day by day,

refusing all at first
but that ration of food
your people could obtain
behind the lines in france,

and then refusing that,
from summer into fall
you cut your ration back
to send your part to them,

your part diminishing
to rations cut in half
and cut in half again,
and then nothing at all

but water at the last
sipped for the nurse's sake,
you finally lacked the strength
even to lift your hands

father, i cannot stand
to think of them and eat.
send it to them, it is theirs.
send this food for them,

for my people still in france.
and turned your face away,
as famished as the grass.
only the stones at first

seem to have a part in this,
and the little height of the grass
as it gains a fraction-inch.
but hidden in the grass

as if the grass itself
were giving out a cry,
i overhear the finch
begin her native rhyme

and toil to paraphrase
her version of your words.
it seems she tries and tries
until the words come clear,

it is theirs, she seems to say,
or that is what i hear,
and again it is theirs, it is theirs.
and the plover joins in praise

with her fluttering, murmured prayers
send it to them, it is theirs.
and the blackbirds breaking wide
take it up in their dialects

to sing you in their way,
i swear i can hear the words,
send it to them, they say,
send it to them, it is theirs,

then all the birds of the air
give thanks above your grave, 
as if they were your cause
and those you meant to save,

as if the birds were there
in attendance at the end,
and, seeing the sacrifice
had borne your body up,

so wasted as it was,
to your chair in paradise,
and saw, before they fled,
your first breathtaking act

before the heavenly feast,
the bread set at your place
to refuse to eat till none
on earth has less than you,

though god in pity take
your hands and lift them toward
his table for your sake.
father, they have no food,

send it to them, it is theirs.
and the birds returning here
give tongue to what they've heard,
they tell the grass and stones

and the stream of moths who carve
their tortuous paths in the air.
but how in giving thanks
can we calculate the worth

of one who chose to starve?
you held within your grasp
our hunger and our thirst.
and the little height of the grass

as it gains a fraction-inch
seems to have a part in this.
it grips with a shocking might
what matters to the last,

as if the soil itself
were all that's left on earth,
and all the earth were held
within its famished grasp.


bethlehem in germany,
glitter on the sloping roofs,
breadcrumbs on the windowsills,
candles in the christmas trees,
hearths with pairs of empty shoes
panels of nativity
open paper scenes where doors
open into other scenes,
some recounted, some foretold.
blizzard-sprinkled flakes of gold
gleam from small interiors,
picture-boxes in the stars
open up like cupboard doors
in a cabinet jesus built.

southern german villagers,
peasants in the mica frost,
see the comet streaming down,
heavenly faces, each alone,
faces lifted, startled, lost,
as if lightning lit the town.

sitting in an upstairs window
patiently the village scholar
raises his nearsighted face,
interrupted by the star.
left and right his hands lie stricken
useless on his heavy book.
when i lift the paper door
in the ceiling of his study
one canary-angel glimmers,
flitting in the candelabra,
peers and quizzes him rabbi,
what are the spheres surmounted by?
but his lips are motionless.
child, what are you asking for?
look, he gazes past the roofs,
gazes where the bitter north,
stretched across the empty place,
opens door by door by door.

this is childhood's shrunken door.
when i touch the glittering crumbs,
when i cry to be admitted,
no one answers, no one comes.

and the tailor's needle flashes
in midair with thread pulled tight,
stitching a baptismal gown.
but the gown, the seventh door,
turns up an interior
hidden from the tailor's eyes
baby presents like the boxes
angels hold on streets and stairways,
wooden soldier, wooden sword,
chocolate coins in crinkled gold,
hints of something bought and sold,
hints of murder in the stars.
baby's gown is sown with glitter
spread across the tailor's lap.
up above his painted ceiling
baby mouse's skeleton
crumbles in the mouse's trap.

leaning from the cliff of heaven,
indicating whom he weeps for,
joseph lifts his lamp above
the infant like a candle-crown.
let my fingers touch the silence
where the infant's father cries.
give me entrance to the village
from my childhood where the doorways
open pictures in the skies.
but when all the doors are open,
no one sees that i've returned.
when i cry to be admitted,
no one answers, no one comes.
clinging to my fingers only
pain, like glitter bits adhering,
when i touch the shining crumbs.


the remnant of a vast, oceanic
bruise wound delivered early and long ago

was in you purity and 
sweetness self-gathered, chosen

                                 

when i tried to find words for the moral sense that unifies
and sweetens the country voices in your collage the friendly way,

you said it's a code.

you were a code
i yearned to decipher.--

in the end, the plague that full swift runs by
took you, broke you--

                                          in the end, could not
                                           take you, did not break you--

you had somehow erased within you not only
meanness, but anger, the desire to punish
the universe for everything

not achieved, not tasted, seen again, touched--

. . . the undecipherable
code unbroken even as the soul

learns once again the body it loves and hates is
made of earth, and will betray it.



three sorts of serpents do resemble thee 
 that dangerous eye-killing cockatrice, 
 the enchanting siren, which doth so entice, 
 the weeping crocodile--these vile pernicious three. 
 the basilisk his nature takes from thee, 
 who for my life in secret wait dost lie, 
 and to my heart sendst poison from thine eye 
 thus do i feel the pain, the cause, yet cannot see. 
 fair-maid no more, but mer-maid be thy name, 
 who with thy sweet alluring harmony 
 hast played the thief, and stolen my heart from me, 
 and like a tyrant makst my grief thy game 
   thou crocodile, who when thou hast me slain, 
   lamentst my death, with tears of thy disdain.


read in my face a volume of despairs,
the wailing iliads of my tragic woe,
drawn with my blood and printed with my cares
wrought by her hand, that i have honor'd so.
who, whilst i burn, she sings at my soul's wrack,
looking aloft from turret of her pride
there my soul's tyrant joys her in the sack
of her own seat, whereof i made her guide.
there do these smokes that from affliction rise,
serve as an incense to a cruel dame
a sacrifice thrice grateful to her eyes,
because their power serve to exact the same.
thus ruins she, to satisfy her will,
the temple where her name was honor'd still.


now, when he and i meet, after all these years, 
i say to the bitch inside me, don't start growling.   
he isn't a trespasser anymore, 
just an old acquaintance tipping his hat. 
my voice says, nice to see you, 
as the bitch starts to bark hysterically. 
he isn't an enemy now, 
where are your manners, i say, as i say, 
how are the children? they must be growing up.   
at a kind word from him, a look like the old days,   
the bitch changes her tone she begins to whimper.   
she wants to snuggle up to him, to cringe. 
down, girl keep your distance 
or i'll give you a taste of the choke-chain. 
fine, i'm just fine, i tell him. 
she slobbers and grovels. 
after all, i am her mistress. she is basically loyal.   
it's just that she remembers how she came running   
each evening, when she heard his step 
how she lay at his feet and looked up adoringly   
though he was absorbed in his paper 
or, bored with her devotion, ordered her to the kitchen   
until he was ready to play. 
but the small careless kindnesses 
when he'd had a good day, or a couple of drinks, 
come back to her now, seem more important 
than the casual cruelties, the ultimate dismissal. 
it's nice to know you are doing so well, i say. 
he couldn't have taken you with him 
you were too demonstrative, too clumsy, 
not like the well-groomed pets of his new friends.   
give my regards to your wife, i say. you gag 
as i drag you off by the scruff, 
saying, goodbye goodbye nice to have seen you again.


at this hour the soul floats weightlessly 
through the city streets, speechless and invisible, 
astonished by the smoky blend of grays and golds 
seeping out of the air, the dark half-tones 

of dusk suddenly filling the urban sky 
while the body sits listlessly by the window 
sullen and heavy, too exhausted to move, 
too weary to stand up or to lie down. 

at this hour the soul is like a yellow wing 
slipping through the treetops, a little ecstatic 
cloud hovering over the sidewalks, calling out 
to the approaching night, amaze me, amaze me, 

while the body sits glumly by the window 
listening to the clear summons of the dead 
transparent as glass, clairvoyant as crystal. 
some nights it is almost ready to join them. 

oh, this is a strange, unlikely tethering, 
a furious grafting of the quick and the slow 
when the soul flies up, the body sinks down 
and all night--locked in the same cramped room-- 

they go on quarreling, stubbornly threatening 
to leave each other, wordlessly filling the air 
with the sound of a low internal burning. 
how long can this bewildering marriage last? 

at midnight the soul dreams of a small fire 
of stars flaming on the other side of the sky, 
but the body stares into an empty night sheen, 
a hollow-eyed darkness. poor luckless angels, 

feverish old loves don't separate yet. 
let what rises live with what descends.


reading in the paper a summary 
of a five-year psychological study 
that shows those perceived as most beautiful   
are treated differently, 

i think they could have just asked me, 
remembering a kind of pudgy kid   
and late puberty, the bloody noses   
and wisecracks because i wore glasses, 

though we all know by now how awful it is   
for the busty starlet no one takes seriously,   
the loveliest women i've lunched with   
lamenting the opacity of the body, 

they can never trust a man's interest   
even when he seems not just out for sex   
eyes focus on me above rim of wineglass,   
and who would want to live like this? 

and what does beauty do to a man?-- 
don juan, casanova, lord byron-- 
those fiery eyes and steel jawlines   
can front a furnace of self-loathing, 

all those breathless women rushing to him   
while hubby's at the office or ball game,   
primed to be consumed by his beauty   
while he stands next to it, watching. 

so maybe the looks we're dealt are best.   
it's only common sense that happiness   
depends on some bearable deprivation   
or defect, and who knows what conflicts 

great beauty could have caused, 
what cruelties one might have suffered 
from those now friends, what unmanageable   
possibilities smiling at every small turn? 

so if i get up to draw a tumbler 
of ordinary tap water and think what if this were   
nectar dripping from delicious burning fingers,   
will all i've missed knock me senseless? 

no. of course not. it won't.


when the fog burns off and the air's pulverized   
diamonds and you can see beyond the islands   
of forever--far too dramatic for me. it hurts   
something behind my eyes near the sphenoid,   
not good. i prefer fog with fog behind it,   
uninflammable fog. then there's no competition   
for brightness, no byron for your shelley,   
no juno eclisping your athena, no big bridge   
statement about bringing unity to landmasses.   
all the thought balloons are blank. the marching   
band can't practice, even a bird's got to get   
within five feet before it can start an argument.   
like dead flies on the sill of an abandoned   
nursery, we too are seeds in the rattle   
of mortality. a foglike baby god   
picks it up, shakes it, laughs insanely   
then goes back to playing with her feet.   
i have felt awful cold and lonely and fog   
has been blotting paper to my tears.   
my dog is fog and i don't have to scoop   
its poop with my hand in a plastic bag.   
there are sensations that begin in the world,   
the mind responding with ideas but then   
those ideas cause other sensations.   
what a mess. we stand at the edge   
of a drop that doesn't answer back,   
fog our only friend although it's hell   
on shrimpboats. there, there, says the fog.   
where, where? you can't see a thing.


before balance, before counting, before   
the record glistens and the needle slides,   
grating, into the overture, there is the end   
of weight, the leaning into nothing and then 

a caught breath, the record listens, the needle slides   
over slowly, and all at once around us a woman's voice   
stretches weightless, leaning into nothing. 
like a clothesline, the taut chorus oh, hilarious 

oh baby, all around us, over slowly, a woman's voice   
gathers above the pick me up, pick me up 
and the desperate put, put me down. first the tightrope,   
then the light foot, and the taunting chorus 

pick me up, pick me up. oh, oh baby. 
the slippery floor shimmers and spins like a record while   
the light is swinging footloose on its rope 
out of time. the shadows 

slip, shimmering black, and spin across the floor, 
then turn back and pick up again. oh seedpod stuck for just   
one moment on the cattail, out of time, out of shadows,   
downy cheek against a beard oh scratches 

on the record, oh baby, oh measure   
oh strange balance that grips us   
on this side of the world.


we could wipe away a fly,
drink, and order that yellow 
thing behind the glass, peach 
or sweet bread. sunlight
is catching on a fork,
toothy wink from a star.
the fan is busy, the waiter is busy, 
and today, in this caf
of two dollars and fifty
cents, we're so important 
dogs are shaking our hands. 
welcome, turistas, they say, 
or might say if they could 
roll their rs. where we sit 
it's three o'clock, and
across the room, where
old men are playing dominos 
it's maybe later, it's maybe 
peru under their hats.
there are toads in this place
--sullen guards by the door--
and the bartender is just another 
uncle fooling with the radio. 
a little to the left,
i shout, and he dials left, 
then right, until it's german 
polkas, accordions by the sea. 
the toads move a little. 
an old man clicks a domino. 
omar, my gypsy friend, puts in--
love is chasing me up my sleeve.
i salute him, he salutes me, 
and together we're so drunk 
we're making sense. little 
by little, with rum the color
of a woman's arm, we're seeing things--
of a dancer, no two,
make that three with one chair. 
and that man--the old one 
over there--is so blurry 
he thinks he's flying.


under the fire escape, crouched, one knee in cinders,   
i pulled the ball-peen hammer from my belt,   
cracked a square of window pane, 
the gummed latch, and swung the window, 
crawled through that stone hole into the boiler room   
of canton elementary school, once canton high,   
where my father served three extra years   
as star halfback and sprinter. 
behind a flashlight's 
cane of light, i climbed a staircase almost a ladder 
and found a door. on the second nudge of my shoulder, 
it broke into a hallway dark as history, 
at whose end lay the classroom i had studied   
over and over in the deep obsession of memory. 

i swept that room with my light--an empty blackboard, 
a metal table, a half-globe lying on the floor   
like a punctured basketball--then followed   
that beam across the rows of desks, 
the various catalogs of lovers, the lists 
of all those who would and would not do what,   
until it stopped on the corner desk of the back row,   
and i saw again, after many years the name 
of my father, my name, carved deep into the oak top. 

to gauge the depth i ran my finger across that scar,   
and wondered at the dreams he must have lived   
as his eyes ran back and forth 
from the cinder yard below the window 
to the empty practice field 
to the blade of his pocket knife etching carefully   
the long, angular lines of his name, 
the dreams he must have laid out one behind another   
like yard lines, in the dull, pre-practice afternoons   
of geography and civics, before he ever dreamed 
of savo sound or guadalcanal. 
                                             in honor of dreams 
i sank to my knees on the smooth, oiled floor,   
and stood my flashlight on its end. 
half the yellow circle lit the underedge of the desk,   
the other threw a half-moon on the ceiling,   
and in that split light i tapped the hammer 
easy up the overhang of the desk top. nothing gave   
but the walls' sharp echo, so i swung again,   
and again harder, and harder still in half anger   
rising to anger at the stubborn joint, losing all fear   
of my first crime against the city, the county,   
the state, whatever government claimed dominion,   
until i had hammered up in the ringing dark   
a salvo of crossfire, and on a frantic recoil glanced   
the flashlight, the classroom spinning black   
as a coma. 
               i've often pictured the face of the teacher   
whose student first pointed to that topless desk,   
the shock of a slow hand rising from the back row,   
their eyes meeting over the question of absence. 
i've wondered too if some low authority of the system   
discovered that shattered window, 
and finding no typewriters, no business machines,   
no audiovisual gear missing, failed to account for it,   
so let it pass as minor vandalism. 
                                                               i've heard nothing. 
and rarely do i fret when i see that oak scar leaning   
against my basement wall, though i wonder what it means   
to own my father's name.


in the early stages of epilepsy there occurs a characteristic dream .... one is  somehow lifted free of one's own body  looking back one sees oneself and feels a  sudden, maddening fear another presence is  entering one's own person, and there is no  avenue of return. --george steiner
outside my window the wasps   
are making their slow circle,   
dizzy flights of forage and return,   
hovering among azaleas 
that bob in a sluggish breeze   
this humid, sun-torn morning. 

yesterday my wife held me here 
as i thrashed and moaned, her hand   
in my foaming mouth, and my son   
saw what he was warned he might. 

last night dreams stormed my brain   
in thick swirls of shame and fear. 
behind a white garage a locked shed   
full of wide-eyed dolls burned, 
yellow smoke boiling up in huge clumps   
as i watched, feet nailed to the ground.   
in dining cars white table cloths 
unfolded wings and flew like gulls.   
an old german in a green homburg   
sang lieder, mein herz ist mde. 
in a garden in pasadena my father   
posed in navy whites while overhead 
silver dirigibles moved like great whales.   
and in the narrowing tunnel   
of the dream's end i flew down   
onto the iron red road 
of my grandfather's farm. 
there was a white rail fence. 
in the green meadow beyond,   
a small boy walked toward me.   
his smile was the moon's rim.   
across his egg-shell eyes 
ran scenes from my future life,   
and he embraced me like a son   
or father or my lost brother. 




although i can see him still-- 
the freckled man who goes 
to a gray place on a hill 
in gray connemara clothes 
at dawn to cast his flies-- 
it's long since i began 
to call up to the eyes 
this wise and simple man.   
all day i'd looked in the face   
what i had hoped it would be   
to write for my own race   
and the reality   
the living men that i hate,   
the dead man that i loved,   
the craven man in his seat,   
the insolent unreproved-- 
and no knave brought to book   
who has won a drunken cheer-- 
the witty man and his joke   
aimed at the commonest ear,   
the clever man who cries   
the catch cries of the clown,   
the beating down of the wise   
and great art beaten down. 

maybe a twelve-month since 
suddenly i began, 
in scorn of this audience, 
imagining a man, 
and his sun-freckled face 
and gray connemara cloth, 
climbing up to a place 
where stone is dark with froth, 
and the down turn of his wrist 
when the flies drop in the stream-- 
a man who does not exist,   
a man who is but a dream   
and cried, before i am old   
i shall have written him one   
poem maybe as cold   
and passionate as the dawn.


force of reason, who shut up the shrill
foul furies in the dungeon of the parthenon,
led whimpering to the cave they live in still,

beneath the rock your city foundered on
who, equivocating, taught revenge to sing
or seem to, or be about to a kindlier tune

mind that can make a scheme of anything--
a game, a grid, a system, a mere folder
in the universal file drawer uncompromising

mediatrix, virgin married to the welfare
of the body politic deific contradiction,
warbonnet-wearing olive-bearer, author

of the law's delays, you who as talisman
and totem still wear the aegis, baleful
with medusa's scowl though shrunken

and self-mummified, a gorgon still cool
guarantor of the averted look, the guide
of perseus, who killed and could not kill

the thing he'd hounded to its source, the dread
thing-in-itself none can elude, whose counter-
feit we halfway hanker for aware gone mad

with clarity we have invented all you stand for,
though we despise the artifice--a space to savor
horror, to pre-enact our own undoing in--
living, we stare into the mirror of the gorgon.


you sway like a crane to the tunes of tossed stones. 
i am what you made to live in 
from what you had hair matted as kelp, bad schools. 

oh, you will never know me. i wave and you go 
on playing in the clouds 
boys clap from erasers. i am the pebble 
you tossed on the chalked space and war- 
danced toward, one-leg two-leg, arms treading air. 

in this, your future, waves rechristen the sea 
after its tiny jeweled lives 
that hiss us us to the shore all day. 
where's the kid called kateydid? the moonfaced 
kewpiedoll? the excitable pouting 
zookie? the somber o-be-joyful? 

lost girl, playing hopscotch, i will do what you could. 
name of father, son, ghost. cross my heart and hope. 
while the sea's jewels build shells and shells 
change to chalk and chalk to loam and gold 
wheat grows where oceans teetered.


the others bent their heads and started in.
confused, i asked my neighbor
to explain--a sturdy, bright-cheeked girl
who brought raw milk to school from her family's
herd of holsteins. ann had a blue bookmark,
and on it christ revealed his beating heart,
holding the flesh back with his wounded hand.
ann understood division. . . .

miss moran sprang from her monumental desk
and led me roughly through the class
without a word. my shame was radical
as she propelled me past the cloakroom
to the furnace closet, where only the boys
were put, only the older ones at that.
the door swung briskly shut.

the warmth, the gloom, the smell 
of sweeping compound clinging to the broom
soothed me. i found a bucket, turned it
upside down, and sat, hugging my knees.
i hummed a theme from haydn that i knew
from my piano lessons. . . .
and hardened my heart against authority.
and then i heard her steps, her fingers
on the latch. she led me, blinking
and changed, back to the class.


for richard hugo
you hear the roadhouse before you see it,   
its four-beat country tunes 
amplified like surf through the woods,   
silencing bullfrog and red-tailed hawk,   
setting beards of moss dancing 
on dim, indeterminate trees 
that border two-lane blacktop. 
docked tonight, you reveal the badge 
of the farmer, that blanched expanse of skin   
where cap shades face, babyhood 
pallor above the sun-blackened jaw   
bulging uneasy with a concrete grin   
and some inevitable need to weep.   
don't you think we live and breathe   
in the meantime, in lockstep 
with dawn, sunset, brawling dawn?   
even now, you await secrets worse   
than the few known ways a seized sky   
will come to survive your pity. 
but on another far field, celebrated   
for its arrivals and evictions, you learn   
to be beautiful, never leading 
a sensible life, playing ball in the early dark,   
fighting for a taste of the sweet spot,   
in this uncut land, this straight-edged air.   
whadya want to know that isn't yet a mystery   
somewhere, a confidential stumble, heat   
lightning, a first-rate backseat turndown?   
so it is that later you track high above   
familiar tamarack and ash, beginning   
the next inaccuracy alone, and again,   
remembering that everything east of you 
has already happened, on the same cold ground, 
in a swarm of time, finally spiked home   
to your surprise, nails flung to the air. 
and us all thumbs to the hot hammer-licks   
you hear from the roadhouse before you see it. 



in those days i thought their endless thrum 
   was the great wheel that turned the days, the nights. 
      in the throats of hibiscus and oleander 

i'd see them clustered yellow, blue, their shells 
   enameled hard as the sky before the rain. 
      all that summer, my second, from city 

to city my young father drove the black coupe 
   through humid mornings i'd wake to like fever 
      parceled between luggage and sample goods. 

afternoons, showers drummed the roof, 
   my parents silent for hours. even then i knew 
      something of love was cruel, was distant. 

mother leaned over the seat to me, the orchid 
   father'd pinned in her hair shriveled 
      to a purple fist. a necklace of shells 

coiled her throat, moving a little as she 
   murmured of alligators that float the rivers 
      able to swallow a child whole, of mosquitoes 

whose bite would make you sleep a thousand years. 
   and always the trance of blacktop shimmering 
      through swamps with names like incantations-- 

okeefenokee, where father held my hand 
   and pointed to an egret's flight unfolding 
      white above swamp reeds that sang with insects 

until i was lost, until i was part 
   of the singing, their thousand wings gauze 
      on my body, tattooing my skin. 

father rocked me later by the water, 
   the motel balcony, singing calypso 
      with the jamaican radio. the lyrics 

a net over the sea, its lesson 
   of desire and repetition. lizards flashed 
      over his shoes, over the rail 

where the citronella burned merging our 
   shadows--father's face floating over mine 
      in the black changing sound 

of night, the enormous florida night, 
   metallic with cicadas, musical 
      and dangerous as the human heart.


the dragon is in the street dancing beneath windows 
   pasted with colored squares, past the man 
who leans into the phone booth's red pagoda, past 
   crates of doves and roosters veiled 

until dawn. fireworks complicate the streets 
   with sulphur as people exchange gold 
and silver foil, money to appease ghosts 
   who linger, needy even in death. i am 

almost invisible. hands could pass through me 
   effortlessly. this is how it is 
to be so alien that my name falls from me, grows 
   untranslatable as the shop signs, 

the odors of ginseng and black fungus that idle 
   in the stairwell, the corridor where 
the doors are blue months ajar. hands 
   gesture in the smoke, the partial moon 

of a face. for hours the soft numeric 
   click of mah-jongg tiles drifts 
down the hallway where languid mai trails 
   her musk of sex and narcotics. 

there is no grief in this, only the old year 
   consuming itself, the door knob blazing 
in my hand beneath the lightbulb's electric jewel. 
   between voices and fireworks 

wind works bricks to dust--hush, hush-- 
   no language i want to learn. i can touch 
the sill worn by hands i'll never know 
   in this room with its low table 

where i brew chrysanthemum tea. the sign 
   for jade palace sheds green corollas 
on the floor. it's dangerous to stand here 
   in the chastening glow, darkening 

my eyes in the mirror with the gulf of the rest 
   of my life widening away from me, waiting 
for the man i married to pass beneath 
   the sign of the building, to climb 

the five flights and say his chinese name for me. 
   he'll rise up out of the puzzling streets 
where men pass bottles of rice liquor, where 
   the new year is liquor, the black bottle 

the whole district is waiting for, like 
   some benevolent arrest--the moment 
when men and women turn to each other and dissolve 
   each bad bet, every sly mischance, 

the dalliance of hands. they turn in lamplight 
   the way i turn now. wai min is in the doorway. 
he brings fish. he brings lotus root. 
   he brings me ghost money.


i had never seen a cornfield in my life, 
i had never been to oklahoma, 
but i was singing as loud as anyone, 
oh what a beautiful morning. . . . the corn   
is as high as an elephant's eye, 
though i knew something about elephants, i thought,   
coming from the same continent as they did,   
and they being more like camels than anything else. 

and when we sang from meet me in st. louis,   
clang, clang, clang went the trolley, 
i remembered the ride from ramleh station 
in the heart of alexandria 
all the way to roushdy where my grandmother lived,   
the autos on the roadways vying 
with mule carts and bicycles, 
the mediterranean half a mile off on the left,   
the air smelling sharply of diesel and salt. 

it was a problem which had dogged me 
for a few years, this confusion of places. 
and when in th grade geography i had pronounced   
des moines as though it were a village in france,   
mr. kephart led me to the map on the front wall,   
and so i'd know where i was, 
pressed my forehead squarely against iowa. 
des moines, he'd said. rhymes with coins. 

now we were singing zippidy-doo-dah, zippidy-ay,   
and every song we'd sung had in it 
either sun or bluebirds, fair weather 
or fancy fringe, o beautiful america 
and one tier below me, 
there was linda deemer with her amber waves 
and lovely fruited plains, 
and she was part of america too 
along with sun and spacious sky 
though untouchable, and as distant 
as purple mountains of majesty. 

this is my country, we sang, 
and a few years ago there would have been   
a scent of figs in the air, mangoes, 
and someone playing the oud along a clear stream. 

but now it was my country 'tis of thee   
and i sang it out with all my heart   
and now with linda deemer in mind.   
land where my fathers died, i bellowed,   
and it was not too hard to imagine
 
a host of my great-uncles and -grandfathers   
stunned from their graves in the turkish interior   
and finding themselves suddenly   
on a rock among maize and poultry   
and squanto shaking their hands. 

how could anyone not think america   
was exotic when it had massachusetts   
and the long tables of thanksgiving?   
and how could it not be home 
if it were the place where love first struck? 

we had finished singing. 
the sun was shining through large windows   
on the beatified faces of all 
who had sung well and with feeling. 
we were ready to file out and march back 
to our room where mr. kephart was waiting.   
already linda deemer had disappeared   
into the high society of the hallway. 
one day i was going to tell her something.   
des moines, i was saying to myself, 
baton rouge. terre haute. boise.


you wept in your mother's arms   
and i knew that from then on   
i was to forget myself. 

listening to your sobs, 
i was resolved against my will   
to do well by us 
and so i said, without thinking,   
in great panic, to do wrong   
in one's own judgment, 
though others thrive by it, 
is the right road to blessedness.   
not to submit to error 
is in itself wrong 
and pride. 

standing beside you, 
i took an oath 
to make your life simpler   
by complicating mine 
and what i always thought   
would happen did 
i was lifted up in joy. 



just when it has seemed i couldn't bear   
   one more friend   
waking with a tumor, one more maniac   

with a perfect reason, often a sweetness   
   has come   
and changed nothing in the world   

except the way i stumbled through it,   
   for a while lost   
in the ignorance of loving   

someone or something, the world shrunk   
   to mouth-size,   
hand-size, and never seeming small.   

i acknowledge there is no sweetness   
   that doesn't leave a stain,   
no sweetness that's ever sufficiently sweet ....   

tonight a friend called to say his lover   
   was killed in a car   
he was driving. his voice was low   

and guttural, he repeated what he needed   
   to repeat, and i repeated   
the one or two words we have for such grief   

until we were speaking only in tones.   
   often a sweetness comes   
as if on loan, stays just long enough   

to make sense of what it means to be alive,   
   then returns to its dark   
source. as for me, i don't care   

where it's been, or what bitter road   
   it's traveled   
to come so far, to taste so good.


like primitives we buried the cat
with his bowl. bare-handed
we scraped sand and gravel
back into the hole. it fell with a hiss
and thud on his side,
on his long red fur, the white feathers
that grew between his toes, and his
long, not to say aquiline, nose.
we stood and brushed each other off.
there are sorrows much keener than these.
silent the rest of the day, we worked,
ate, stared, and slept. it stormed
all night now it clears, and a robin
burbles from a dripping bush
like the neighbor who means well
but always says the wrong thing.


that dusty bubble gum, once ubiquitous as starlings,   
is no more, my love. whistling dinosaurs now populate   
only animation studios, the furious actions of angels   
causing their breasts to flop out in mannerist   
frescos flake away as sleet holds us in its teeth.   
and the bus-station's old urinals go under   
the grindstone and the youthful spelunkers   
graduate into the wrinkle-causing sun. the sea   
seemingly a constant to the naked eye is one   
long goodbye, perpetually the tide recedes,   
beaches dotted with debris. unto each is given   
a finite number of addresses, ditties to dart   
the heart to its moments of sorrow and swoon.   
the sword's hilt glints, the daffodils bow down,   
all is temporary as a perfect haircut, a kitten   
in the lap, yet sitting here with you, my darling,   
waiting for a tuna melt and side of slaw   
seems all eternity i'll ever need   
and all eternity needs of me.


this was gruesome--fighting over a ham sandwich                   
with one of the tiny cats of rome, he leaped 
on my arm and half hung on to the food and half 
hung on to my shirt and coat. i tore it apart 
and let him have his portion, i think i lifted him 
down, sandwich and all, on the sidewalk and sat 
with my own sandwich beside him, maybe i petted 
his bony head and felt him shiver. i have 
told this story over and over some things 
root in the mind his boldness, of course, was frightening 
and unexpected--his stubbornness--though hunger 
drove him mad. it was the breaking of boundaries, 
the sudden invasion, but not only that it was 
the sharing of food and the sharing of space he didn't 
run into an alley or into a cellar, 
he sat beside me, eating, and i didn't run 
into a trattoria, say, shaking, 
with food on my lips and blood on my cheek, sobbing 
but not only that, i had gone there to eat 
and wait for someone. i had maybe an hour 
before she would come and i was full of hope 
and excitement. i have resisted for years 
interpreting this, but now i think i was given 
a clue, or i was giving myself a clue, 
across the street from the glass sandwich shop. 
that was my last night with her, the next day 
i would leave on the train for paris and she would 
meet her husband. thirty-five years ago 
i ate my sandwich and moaned in her arms, we were 
dying together we never met again 
although she was pregnant when i left her--i have 
a daughter or son somewhere, darling grandchildren 
in norwich, connecticut, or canton, ohio. 
every five years i think about her again 
and plan on looking her up. the last time 
i was sitting in new brunswick, new jersey, 
and heard that her husband was teaching at princeton, 
if she was still married, or still alive, and tried 
calling. i went that far. we lived 
in florence and rome. we rowed in the bay of naples 
and floated, naked, on the boards. i started 
to think of her again today. i still 
am horrified by the cat's hunger. i still 
am puzzled by the connection. this is another 
insane devotion, there must be hundreds, although 
it isn't just that, there is no pain, and the thought 
is fleeting and sweet. i think it's my own dumb boyhood, 
walking around with slavic cheeks and burning 
stupid eyes. i think i gave the cat 
half of my sandwich to buy my life, i think 
i broke it in half as a decent sacrifice. 
it was this i bought, the red coleus, 
the split rocking chair, the silk lampshade. 
happiness. i watched him with pleasure. 
i bought memory. i could have lost it. 
how crazy it sounds. his face twisted with cunning. 
the wind blowing through his hair. his jaw working.


your head is still 
restless, rolling 
east and west. 
that body in you 
insisting on living 
is the old hawk 
for whom the world 
darkens. 
if i am not 
with you when you die, 
that is just. 

it is all right. 
that part of you cleaned 
my bones more 
than once. but i 
will meet you 
in the young hawk 
whom i see 
inside both 
you and me he 
will guide 
you to the lord of night, 
who will give you 
the tenderness 
you wanted here.


like all his people he felt at home in the forest.   
the silence beneath great trees, the dimness there,   
the distant high rustling of foliage, the clumps 
of fern like little green fountains, patches of sunlight,   
patches of moss and lichen, the occasional   
undergrowth of hazel and holly, was he aware   
of all this? on the contrary his unawareness   
was a kind of gratification, a sense of comfort   
and repose even in the strain of running day   
after day. he had been aware of the prairies.   
he had known he hated the sky so vast, the wind   
roaring in the grasses, and the brightness that   
hurt his eyes. now he hated nothing nor could he   
feel anything but the urgency that compelled him   
onward continually. may i not forget, may i   
not forget, he said to himself over and over.   
when he saw three ravens rise on their awkward   
wings from the forest floor perhaps seventy-five   
ells ahead of him, he said, three ravens,   
and immediately forgot them. may i not forget,   
he said, and repeated again in his mind the exact   
words he had memorized, the message that was   
important and depressing, which made him feel   
worry and happiness at the same time, a peculiar   
elation. at last he came to his people far   
in the darkness. he smiled and spoke his words,   
and he looked intently into their eyes gleaming 
in firelight. he cried when they cried. no rest 
for his lungs. he flinched and lay down while they   
began to kill him with clubs and heavy stones. 



down the street, someone must be praying, and though i don't 
go there anymore, i want to at times, to hear the diction 
and the tone, though the english pronoun for god is obsolete-- 

what goes on is devotion, which wouldn't change if i heard 
the polished sermon, the upright's arpeggios of vacant notes. 
what else could unite widows, bankers, children, and ghosts? 

and those faces are so good as they tilt their smiles upward 
to the rostrum that represents law, and the minister who 
represents god beams like the white palm of the good hand 

of christ raised behind the baptistry to signal the multitude, 
which i am not among, though i feel the abundance of calm 
and know the beatitude so well i do not have to imagine it, 

or the polite old ones who gather after the service to chat, 
or the ritual linen of sunday tables that are already set. 
more than any other days, sundays stand in unvarying rows 

that beg attention there is that studied verisimilitude 
of sanctuary, so even mud and bitten weeds look dressed up 
for some eye in the distant past, some remote kingdom 

where the pastures are crossed by thoroughly symbolic rivers. 
that is why the syntax of prayers is so often reversed, 
aimed toward the dead who clearly have not gone ahead 

but returned to prior things, a vista of angels and sheep, 
a desert where men in robes and sandals gather by a tree. 
hushed stores, all day that sense a bell is about to ring-- 

i recognized it, waking up, before i weighed the bulk of news 
or saw saturday night's cars parked randomly along the curb, 
and though i had no prayer, i wanted to offer something 

or ask for something, perhaps out of habit, but as the past 
must always be honored unconsciously, formally, and persists 
on this first and singular day, though i think of it as last.


from a documentary on marsupials i learn 
that a pillowcase makes a fine 
substitute pouch for an orphaned kangaroo. 

i am drawn to such dramas of animal rescue. 
they are warm in the throat. i suffer, the critic proclaims, 
from an overabundance of maternal genes. 

bring me your fallen fledgling, your bummer lamb, 

lead the abused, the starvelings, into my barn. 
advise the hunted deer to leap into my corn. 

and had there been a wild child-- 
filthy and fierce as a ferret, he is called 
in one nineteenth-century account-- 

a wild child to love, it is safe to assume, 
given my fireside inked with paw prints, 
there would have been room. 

think of the language we two, same and not-same, 
might have constructed from sign, 
scratch, grimace, grunt, vowel 

laughter our first noun, and our long verb, howl.


when i am asked   
how i began writing poems,   
i talk about the indifference of nature.   

it was soon after my mother died,   
a brilliant june day,   
everything blooming.   

i sat on a gray stone bench   
in a lovingly planted garden,   
but the day lilies were as deaf   
as the ears of drunken sleepers   
and the roses curved inward.   
nothing was black or broken   
and not a leaf fell   
and the sun blared endless commercials   
for summer holidays.   

i sat on a gray stone bench   
ringed with the ingenue faces   
of pink and white impatiens   
and placed my grief   
in the mouth of language,   
the only thing that would grieve with me.

we passed old farmer boothby in the field. 
rugged and straight he stood his body steeled 
with stubbornness and age. we met his eyes 
that never flinched or turned to compromise, 
and luck, he cried, good luck--and waved an arm,
knotted and sailor-like, such as no farm 
in all of maine could boast of and away
he turned again to pitch his new-cut hay... 
we walked on leisurely until a bend
showed him once more, now working toward the end
of one great path wearing his eighty years 
like banners lifted in a wind of cheers.

then we turned off abruptly--took the road 
cutting the village, the one with the commanding
view of the river. and we strode
more briskly now to the long pier that showed 
where the frail boats were kept at indian landing.
in the canoe we stepped our paddles dipped 
leisurely downwards, and the slim bark slipped
more on than in the water. smoothly then 
we shot its nose against the rippling current, 
feeling the rising river's half-deterrent 
pull on the paddle as we turned the blade 
to keep from swerving round while we delayed
to watch the curious wave-eaten locks
or pass, with lazy turns, the picnic-rocks....    
blue eels flew under us, and fishes darted
a thousand ways the once broad channel shrunk.
and over us the wise and noble-hearted 
twilight leaned down the sunset mists were parted,--
and we, with thoughts on tiptoe, slunk 
down the green, twisting alleys of the kennebunk,

motionless in the meadows
   the trees, the rocks, the cows... 
and quiet dripped from the shadows 
   like rain from heavy boughs.

the tree-toads started ringing
   their ceaseless silver bells
a land-locked breeze came swinging
   its censer of earthy smells.

the river's tiny caon
   stretched into dusky lands
like a dark and silent companion
   evening held out her hands.

hushed were the dawn's bravados
   loud noon was a silenced cry--
and quiet slipped from the shadows
   as stars slip out of the sky...

it must have been an hour more, or later, 
when, tramping homeward through the piney wood,
we felt the years fly back the brotherhood 
of forests took us--and we saw the satyr 
there in a pool, up to his neck, he stood 
and grinned to see us stare, incredulous--
too startled to remember fear or flight. 
feeling the menace in the crafty night,
we turned to run--when lo, he called to us
using our very names he called. we drew 
with creaking courage down the avenue 
of birches till we saw, with clearing sight, 
no longer through a tricky, pale-green light 
familiar turns and shrubs, the friendly path,--
and farmer boothby in his woodland bath 
the woods became his background every tree 
seemed part of him, and stood erect, and shared 
the beauty of that gnarled serenity
the quiet vigor of age that smiled and squared 
its shoulders against time ... and even night
flowed in and out of him, as though content 
with such a native element
happy to move about a spirit quite
as old, as placid and as confident...
sideways we turned. still glistening and unclad
he leaped up on the bank, light as a lad,
his body in the moonlight dripping stars...

we went on homeward, through the pasture-bars.


he sits at the table, cloudlight of march
one tone with his hair, gray-silver on silver. 
midday fare in vermont is basic enough.
in west newbury, eggs and toast will do-- 
though our doctor's had his sips of wine as well. 
just don't be fooled. they're not as nice as you 
think they are. live here a few more winters, 
you'll get to know them clearer, and vice-versa. 
three years now, and we're still finding our way 
newcomers need a guide to show them the ropes, 
and he has been explaining township and county 
almost from the sunstruck day we met him 
that very first july in this old house.
i'll cite an instance of community
spirit at work, north country justice--
a case i just happened to be involved in.
no, please--all right, if you are having one. 
he holds his glass aloft and then lets fall
a silence that has grown familiar to us
from other stories told on other days,
the will to recount building its head of steam. 
well, now, you have to know about the victim. 
his name was charlie deudon, no doubt canuck 
stock some generations back, but he
nor no one else could tell you--if they cared. 
deudons had been dirt farmers here as long 
as anybody knew. they never starved
but never had a dime to spare, either.
charlie resolved to change the deudon luck. 
and that's just what he did. or almost did. . . . 
he'd graduated two classes ahead of mine
we knew each other, naturally, but not
on terms of friendship. fact is, he had no friends, 
and only one girlfriend, whom he married 
day after commencement, june of . 
and then he set to work and never stopped 
again, until they made him stop for good. 
a wisp of a smile, half irony, half
bereavement plays about his guileless face-- 
red cheeks, blue eyes, a beardless santa claus 
whose bag contains apart from instruments 
of healing stories, parables and proverbs, 
painkillers, too, for when all else fails.
what kind of work had all that hard work been? 
oh, farming, like his elders, only better. 
all the modern improvements, fancy feed 
and fertilizers, plus machinery--
he was the first in these parts to milk 
his herd in any way but as twas done
since adam's boys first broke ground with a plow. 
and anything machines couldn't handle, 
charlie did himself, from dawn to midnight. 
he never wasted a word or spilled a drop 
of milk or drank a drop of beer or liquor. 
he was unnatural. and he made that farm 
into a showplace, a kind of -h model. 
he made good money, yes, but not a dollar 
would he spend unnecessarily.
do you get the picture? they hated him,
the boys that hung around the package store. 
the most they ever got from tightfist charlie 
deudon was a nod out from under his cap.
his trademark--a baseball cap striped white and red. 
they envied him for getting his hay in first 
and there was more. a boy that he had hired,
by the name of carroll giddens, was their buddy. 
likeable fellow, regulation issue, 
the sort that knocks back a pint or a fifth 
in half a shake and tells off-color stories
till he's got them choked to death with laughing. 
course the wisecracks they loved best were those 
about poor charlie and his gold-plated farm. . . . 
just one more case of what's been often said 
by commentators on democracy-- 
how it helps everyone keep modest. 
teasing mischief has crept into his voice. 
a self-taught anthropologist as well 
as teller of tales, he has other frames 
of reference to place around events 
local or international. he knows
that things can stand for more than what they are 
indeed, says standing for things is why we're here, 
and quotes chapter and verse to prove his point. 
think of the worldwide scapegoat ritual. 
in halfway civilized societies
an animal's the one relieved from life 
duty, am i right? a fellow tribesman
will do in a pinch, if animals are lacking,
or if communal fears get screwed too tight. . . . 
anyhow, it was clear that something more 
than common envy stirred up the lynch law.
their own failure's what they wanted dead. 
seconds pass in silence as he stares
at something--perhaps a knothole in the pine 
floorboard. he looks up, eyebrows raised,
and twirls the glass stem between stubby fingers.
a coil of rope hung on the wall, we see,
has made him pause and heave experienced sighs. 
here. have another. so was charlie punished?
i'm going to tell you--better me than others. 
you see, i was involved--no, no, no, 
not in the deed, lord, no, just as a witness.
it happened this way--hope you're not squeamish. 
charlie had this boy to help with chores, 
the one named carroll. married, two kids, i think. 
not too reliable. but so few are
nor could you call his wages generous.
his buddies must have stood him drinks, is all 
i can say. he'd a skinful half the time--
was certainly drunk that christmas eve morning. 
no reason to doubt what charlie told his wife. 
charlie'd been up to help at six with the milking, 
and carroll, drunk as a fiddler's bitch, was there 
loading a pair of milk cans into the barrow. 
he took a slip and the whole business spilled. 
wooden handle clipped him in the side, 
and he fell, too, right in the puddle of milk. 
and started laughing. charlie, you can guess, 
didn't join in he told him to get on home. 
what about the milk?' go home,' he said,
you're drunk.' but what about the milk?' asks carroll. 
comes out of next week's paycheck,' charlie says. 
and then the trouble starts, with carroll swearing 
and yelping, till charlie gives him a little tap 
and goes indoors. by then carroll could tell 
the barrow handle had cracked a rib or two. 
he drove into town to see his doctor--that 
wasn't me--and word went out that charlie 
had roughed up his innocent assistant. 
that's all they needed, carroll's friends. about 
time that stuck-up bastard got his due,
he's gone too far this time, but we'll show him, 
et cetera . . . . as it was christmas eve,
they had the leisure, the liquor, and the rope.
they hanged him? no, that's not our way up here. 
the honored custom's to dump them in the river. 
you see, the river's new hampshire all the way 
over to the vermont side, and thus, 
if the victim's still alive when he hits the water, 
new hampshire law enforcement and legal justice 
steps in. it tends to confuse the issue, see? 
in wintertime, the river freezes over, 
and you can't hope to fish the bodies out 
till the month of march at the earliest. 
by then, who knows which state the victim died in? 
a trick they've played a hundred years and more 
up in woodsville, where the bridge is. that's where 
the loggers used to go to spend their money 
on booze and hookers--who'd arrange for them 
to get knocked in the head at the right moment, 
and pitched off the bridge into the water. 
a famous local industry, but rather 
fallen on hard days by the early fifties, 
just like others more legitimate. . . . 
well, our local rowdies knew the routine, 
and, when time came to follow up their threats, 
they laid their plans according to tradition. 
they knew that charlie'd have to do the milking 
christmas morning same as every day. 
and when he came into the barn to do it,
they'd be waiting for him. and that's what happened.

we strain forward to hear him tell the rest 
the narrative spell is on him, and on us.
his voice weaves through fine-tuned nuances, 
with sudden leaps in volume and skittish phrases 
that somehow help flesh out what he describes.
we see the sprawling barn across the highway 
from the white-columned porch of the old house. 
see the barn closed up tight against the cold, 
and the blue-gray light of december dawn 
as charlie crosses the road to do his chores. 
the roosters shriek their morning alarm, the big 
doors creak open on the darkness--a darkness 
slit with tight-strung wires of light knifing 
through cracks between the boards of the east wall. 
tufts of hay spill from cribs on both sides. 
the waiting cattle stir and low as daylight 
breaks in on the darkness. their master strides 
in past the parked pickup truck, his pail, 
a battered rath blackhawk lard can swinging 
at his side, a whistled jingle bells
his fight song for the working holiday.
he hears the verses harnessed to his whistling, 
the tune drawing its text along march tempo 
. . . it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh-ay 
and then all changes. smash of the blackjack 
against his skull, exploding carnival
of fire-veined shock that flies to the far corners 
of night. four assailants leap from the back
of the truck and lift him partly erect, the quicker 
to bind his arms behind and truss them to 
his half-bent legs, as you might rope a steer 
or sheep you meant to brand or slaughter. 
they take him out to where the car is waiting 
and throw him in the trunk like a sack of feed. 
another car drives past but doesn't slow. 
the bandits duck and climb inside their own. 
tires screech, the driver slams onto the highway, 
a smile and wink all round as they drive north 
to woodsville. the sun is coming up when they
reach the bridge and stop the car. the lid
of the trunk's sprung open, its cargo discharged. 
he is dragged to the railing, lifted, then heaved over. 
the body falls, seeming almost to pause
in air before it hits the water and slides
below the surface of the floating ice. . . .
five miles back along the highway, the dark 
barn, the herd, a crushed tin pail, and signs 
of struggle in the dirt wait for someone's
startled face, back-lit in the doorway,
to see them, then whip aside with a shout of terror.

he wasn't found until spring thaw he washed 
ashore just south of bradford, still tied up
and looking like they'd tarred and feathered him--
partly decomposed, but not his clothes. 
first thing was an autopsy to test if he 
had died by drowning or was dead before 
going under. conclusion was, he'd died 
on land, so as i said, his death belonged 
to the green mountain state's criminal justice. 
and what about the killers--were they caught? 
several suspects found themselves in jail-- 
and that's where i come in as star witness. 
it happened i was on the road that morning. 
real early. see . . . i'd promised my house guest 
of the night--young marine on leave--i'd drive 
him back to lebanon to grab his bus. 
i always keep my word, especially 
when given in the night hours. nice boy-- 
he's been a good friend ever since. we'd said 
good-bye until the next three-day pass. 
well, i was driving home like merry christmas. 
into the headlights comes the deudon farm
and then i noticed the car. a two-toned kaiser, 
side of the road, beneath a maple tree. 
didn't know whose it was or why it was there. 
i saw one face, calvin renfrew's, that's all. 
he didn't have wheels so far as i knew.
occurred to me right then that something might 
be fishy but locals never meddle till--
till it's too late, sometimes. i should have stopped. 
they might have banged me on the head, but then--. 
well, even as it is they got revenge.
i'm still alive, however, and mean to stay so.
he laughs a low laugh that would chill the devil . . .
then takes up the thread--how when he heard the news 
about charlie's disappearance, he drove down 
to tell the state trooper what he'd seen. 
that was the very next day after christmas. 
by nightfall calvin renfrew and norbert joiner, 
the owner of the car the kaiser, and two 
associates were in custody. but not
for long. someone bailed them out, someone 
rich, it had to be, an enemy
or rival of charlie's. that's often our way, 
you know, to let others fix the person
we secretly hate, then give them secret help 
when they get their paws burned in the process. 
a lot of people coveted that farm,
however much disparaged it was in public. 
when charlie's widow put it up for auction, 
don't imagine nobody came to bid.
i still see things of his on others' farms.
what didn't surprise me either's how the town, 
lord help me, the whole county took the side 
of those arrested against the murdered man. 
they said old charlie had it coming to him,
treating his employee that way. meanwhile, 
carroll had quietly slipped across the border 
to canada no way to prove that he'd 
hardly been hurt at all. so rumor flew.
if words could put you under ground, why carroll 
was dead and buried six times over, a martyr 
hounded to his grave by a maniac
who should have been taken care of years ago. 
these are churchgoing people, too, but they 
figure they have a special insight as
to what the boy upstairs considers right. 
man is born for sorrow, so we're told, 
and some try to make sure he gets a close 
acquaintance with the sorrow that's his due. 
meanwhile, if you can say the things people 
want to hear, then you may lynch at will.
he folds his hands and brings them to his chin. 
the rest of the story you can figure out 
yourself. their lawyer asked the jury be 
directed by the judge to return a verdict 
of not guilty. motion granted--as never 
before for a capital offense in this state. 
they'd do it again, don't worry, if the case 
was dear to their concerns. sounds cynical,
i grant you. . . . but then, you see, they started next 
on me for fingering the guilty parties. 
state trooper drops by to ask some questions. 
why was i on the highway that time of morning? 
oh? and who exactly was this friend? 
oh, really? stayed the night, did he? i see. . . . 
a doubt or two'd been raised before already, 
given that i had never married, and 
was locally famous for my special hobby. 
i'm sure i've told you i play a little pipe
organ at church sometimes--i even travel 
to play it elsewhere. i know organists
all over new england, and the town gazette 
used always to mention when i went to play 
at musicales in other towns and states. 
nobody thought it mattered much beforehand, 
but once the tale about the serviceman 
got out, my friends, well, you can just imagine. 
overnight young dr. stephens was
as musical' as you can be and not
get tarred and feathered. my patients, some of them, 
began to melt away like ice cream. stephens, 
a local name, respected in these parts,
became a byword for things we don't discuss. 
i wondered whether i should move, of course 
some rowdy threw a can of paint at the house 
i still get unsigned letters from time to time. 
things must be better where you two come from. 
but this is where i've always lived, it's what 
i know. if i had had the sense to pitch
someone unpopular from off a bridge
instead of enjoying music, chances are 
i'd be a favorite son. in point of fact,
i've given up the organ, seldom play it
nowadays. i've got a different hobby--
your health, gentlemen no more today, though. 
another call to make this afternoon.
but listen, now if you'll come up to me
next week, i'll play some pump organ for you. 
i can still do a rousing hornpipe'--the one 
by handel. tourist attraction hereabouts. 
i am fairly confident you won't
ever have heard it played my way before. 
he stands to go, consenting to be ushered
out under the black trees of late march, down 
to where his battered station wagon sits.
thunder of engines takes him off. . . . but his words 
stay lodged in us like arrows, arrows aimed 
as carefully as acupuncture and meant 
somehow to warn or counsel. not that warnings 
in the abstract often help stave off 
particular misfortunes, inevitably 
the body of most stories drawn from life. 
misfortunes are the hinges life turns on? 
reprieves as well--along with persons, places, 
passions. a fluent paradox, the realm 
normally termed external, i mean its way 
of overhearing thought and mustering 
fresh evidence. . . . today, for instance, how 
new green on branches and a liquid birdcall 
suffice to announce the chaste approach of spring.


in the warming house, children lace their skates,   
bending, choked, over their thick jackets. 

a franklin stove keeps the place so cozy 
it's hard to imagine why anyone would leave, 

clumping across the frozen beach to the river.   
december's always the same at ware's cove, 

the first sheer ice, black, then white 
and deep until the city sends trucks of men 

with wooden barriers to put up the boys'   
hockey rink. an hour of skating after school, 

of trying wobbly figure-'s, an hour 
of distances moved backwards without falling, 

then--twilight, the warming house steamy   
with girls pulling on boots, their chafed legs 

aching. outside, the hockey players keep   
playing, slamming the round black puck 

until it's dark, until supper. at night, 
a shy girl comes to the cove with her father. 

although there isn't music, they glide 
arm in arm onto the blurred surface together, 

braced like dancers. she thinks she'll never 
be so happy, for who else will find her graceful, 

find her perfect, skate with her 
in circles outside the emptied rink forever?


what was the future then but affirmation,   
the first yes between us 
followed by the first lingering dawn? 
waking below a window shaded by redwoods   
waking? we hadn't slept--, 
we found time saved, like sunlight in a tree. 

still, the house was cold, and there were shadows.   
the couple in the next room 
rapped the wall to quiet us, like them,   
condescending from a bitter knowledge 
that, young as we all were, 
love didn't last, but receded into silence. 

wedging our pillows back of the headboard 
that clapped in time with us, 
we let them think we agreed. then, holding on, 
we closed each other's mouths and felt that slowness   
that the best days begin with   
turn into the speed with which they fly. 

flight was that year's theme, all around us-- 
flight of hunter and hunted, 
the president turning inward on one wing,   
and, on the patio, the emigration 
of termites, a glittering fleet, 
leaving that shadowed house a little lighter. 

within it all, above it, or beyond, 
we thought we were the fixed point, 
and held still as the quail lit down beside us   
and waited for her plump mate to appear,   
his crest a quivering hook. 
the valley's reach of sunshine reeled them in. 

there was wilderness around us, don't forget.   
behind the nets of fragrance 
thrown across our path by the acacia   
lurked the green man or the kidnapper.   
and there was the pacific 
with its own passions taking place as rain. 

the sorrow of the couple in the next room   
was a deep muteness nightly. 
that loneliness could come of loving was   
like news of time cored out of the redwood.   
the house that we made shake, 
or thought we did, was taking wing already. 

after we left, still it took us years 
before we stopped comparing 
every morning together to that first one   
and every place we lived to that first place   
and everything we said 
to that first word repeated all night long. 



my wife tells me she hears a beetle   
scurrying across the kitchen floor.   
she says our daughter is dreaming   

too loudly, just listen, her eyelids   
are fluttering like butterflies. 

what about the thunder, i say, 
what about the dispatches from the police car   
parked outside, or me rolling over like a whale? 

she tells me there's a leaf falling 
and grazing the downstairs window, 
or it could be glass cutters, diamonds, 
thieves working their hands toward the latch.   
she tells me our son is breathing too quickly,   
is it pneumonia, is it the furnace 
suddenly pumping monoxides through the house? 

so when my wife says sleep, she means   
a closing of the eyes, a tuning   
of the ears to ultra frequencies. 

it is what always happens 
when there are children, the bed   
becoming at night a listening post,   
each little ting forewarning disaster. 

downstairs there is the sound 
of something brushing against something else   
and i try to listen as my wife might listen,   
insects, i say, dust on a table top, 
maybe a knife's edge against the palm. 

but she tells me it's only 
the african violet on the windowsill   
putting out another flower, 
and falls luxuriously into a dream   
of being awake and vigilant. 

so the house grows noisier, 
there are clicks in the woodwork,   
there are drips, raps, clunks, things   
to make sense of, make benign. 

my son and daughter are sleeping calmly,   
and the stairs, yes, are creaking, 
the wind, i think, or maybe two men,   
where's the beaker of acid, 
the bowling ball, the war hoop 
i learned in second grade? 

so this is what it's like when there's 
no one left but you to love and defend. 

outside there are cats in a fight 
and they remind me too much of babies crying.   
then the bottle thrown against the stoop,   
the sound of something delicate shattered. 

my wife stirs, be glad, she says, 
sound doesn't carry far, that you don't hear   
the whole of it, cries in the night, 
children in other cities, hurts, silences. 

and she's right, i can't hear the whole of it,   
or else i hear too much and it's noise   
or i make it noise because it's too much. 

so i begin homing in on something 
around me, something distinct, my wife's   
breathing, a window's rattle. outside, 
grass is lengthening in the dark, 
and sap running up the phloem of the maple, 
do i hear it? and how the stars must be wheeling   
and in the far room, my children's 
hearts are keeping time, for them, for us 
who have begun to listen in earnest. 



dearest, note how these two are alike 
this harpsicord pavane by purcell 
and the racer's twelve-speed bike. 

the machinery of grace is always simple. 
this chrome trapezoid, one wheel connected 
to another of concentric gears, 
which ptolemy dreamt of and schwinn perfected, 
is gone. the cyclist, not the cycle, steers. 
and in the playing, purcell's chords are played away. 

so this talk, or touch if i were there, 
should work its effortless gadgetry of love, 
like dante's heaven, and melt into the air. 

if it doesn't, of course, i've fallen. so much is chance, 
so much agility, desire, and feverish care, 
as bicyclists and harpsicordists prove 

who only by moving can balance, 
only by balancing move.


a second crop of hay lies cut   
and turned. five gleaming crows   
search and peck between the rows. 
they make a low, companionable squawk,   
and like midwives and undertakers   
possess a weird authority. 

crickets leap from the stubble,   
parting before me like the red sea.   
the garden sprawls and spoils. 

across the lake the campers have learned   
to water ski. they have, or they haven't.   
sounds of the instructor's megaphone   
suffuse the hazy air. relax relax 

cloud shadows rush over drying hay,   
fences, dusty lane, and railroad ravine.   
the first yellowing fronds of goldenrod   
brighten the margins of the woods. 

schoolbooks, carpools, pleated skirts   
water, silver-still, and a vee of geese. 

 

the cicada's dry monotony breaks   
over me. the days are bright   
and free, bright and free. 

then why did i cry today   
for an hour, with my whole   
body, the way babies cry? 

 

a white, indifferent morning sky,   
and a crow, hectoring from its nest   
high in the hemlock, a nest as big   
as a laundry basket ... 
                                    in my childhood   
i stood under a dripping oak, 
while autumnal fog eddied around my feet,   
waiting for the school bus 
with a dread that took my breath away. 

the damp dirt road gave off   
this same complex organic scent. 

i had the new books--words, numbers,   
and operations with numbers i did not   
comprehend--and crayons, unspoiled   
by use, in a blue canvas satchel 
with red leather straps. 

spruce, inadequate, and alien   
i stood at the side of the road.   
it was the only life i had.


switzerland, 
dear friend, called away from my country,   
i square the egg and put it in a letter   
that all may read, gilding each word a little   
so that touched, it yields to a secret   
stirring, a small gold bird on a spring   
suddenly appearing to sing a small song   
of regret, elation, that overspills all private   
bounds, although you ask, as i do, what now   
do we sing to, sing for? before the great war, 
i made a diamond-studded coach three inches high   
with rock crystal windows and platinum wheels 
to ceremoniously convey a speechless egg to court.   
all for a bored czarina my version of history   
fantastic and revolutionary as i reduced the scale   
to the hand-held dimensions of a fairy tale,   
hiding tiny imperial portraits and cameos   
in eggs of pearl and bone. little bonbons, caskets   
the old riddle of the chicken and the egg   
is answered thus in the belle epoque   
of the imagination, the egg came first, containing, 
as it does, both history and uncertainty, my excesses   
inducing unrest among those too hungry to see   
the bitter joke of an egg one cannot eat.   
oblique oddity, an egg is the most beautiful of all   
beautiful forms, a box without corners   
in which anything can be contained, anything   
except time, that old jeweler who laughed   
when he set me ticking. here, among the clocks   
and watches of a country precisely ordered   
and dying, i am not sorry, i do not apologize. 
three times i kiss you in memory 
of that first easter, that first white rising, 
and send this message as if it could save you   
even the present is dead. we must live now   
in the future. yours, faberg.


who bequeathed to chicago a school of music.
   so in pieria, from the wedded bliss
of time and memory, the muses came
to be the means of rich oblivion,
and rest from cares.  and when the thunderer
took heaven, then the titans warred on him
for pity of mankind. but the great law,
which is the law of music, not of bread,
set atlas for a pillar, manacled
his brother to the rocks of the scythia,
and under aetna fixed the furious typhon.
so should thought rule, not force. and amphion,
pursuing justice, entered thebes and slew
his mother's spouse but when he would make sure
and fortify the city, then he took
the lyre that hermes gave, and played, and watched
the stones move and assemble, till a wall
engirded thebes and kept the citadel
beyond the reach of arrows and of fire.
what other power but harmony can build
a city, and what gift so magical
as that by which a city lifts its walls?
so men, in years to come, shall feel the power
of this man moving through the high-ranged thought
which plans for beauty, builds for larger life.
the stones shall rise in towers to answer him.


you are sitting in mrs. caldera's kitchen,   
you are sipping a glass of lemonade 
and trying not to be too curious about 
the box of plastic hummingbirds behind you,   
the tray of tineless forks at your elbow. 

you have heard about the backroom   
where no one else has ever gone 
and whatever enters, remains, 
refrigerator doors, fused coils, 
mower blades, milk bottles, pistons, gears. 

you never know, she says, rummaging   
through a cedar chest of recipes,   
when something will come of use. 

there is a vase of pencil tips on the table,   
a bowl full of miniature wheels and axles. 

upstairs, where her children slept,   
the doors will not close, 
the stacks of magazines are burgeoning,   
there are snow shoes and lampshades,   
bedsprings and picture tubes, 
and boxes and boxes of irreducibles 

you imagine the headline in the literalist express 
house founders under weight of past. 

but mrs caldera is baking cookies, 
she is humming a song from childhood,   
her arms are heavy and strong, 
they have held babies, a husband,   
tractor parts and gas tanks, 
what have they not found a place for? 

it is getting dark, you have sat for a long time. 
if you move, you feel something will be disturbed, 
there is room enough only for your body.   
stay awhile, mrs. caldera says,   
and never have you felt so valuable. 



we can have our pick of seats. 
though the movie's already moving, 
the theater's almost an empty shell. 
    all we can see on our side 
of the room is one man and one woman-- 
as neat, respectable, and distinct 
    as the empty chairs that come 
between them. but distinctions do not surprise, 
fresh as we are from sullen street and subway 
    where lonelinesses crowded 
about us like unquiet memories 
that may have loved us once or known our love. 
    here we are an accidental 
fellowship, sheltering from the city's 
obscure bereavements to face a screened, 
    imaginary living, 
as if it were a destination 
we were moving toward. leaning to our right 
    and suspended before us 
is a bored, smartly uniformed usherette. 
staring beyond her lighted corner, she finds 
    a reverie that moves through 
and beyond the shine of the silver screening. 
but we can see what she will never see-- 
    that she's the star of hopper's scene. 
for the artist she's a play of light, 
and a play of light is all about her. 
    whether the future she is 
dreaming is the future she will have 
we have no way of knowing. whatever 
    it will prove to be 
it has already been. the usherette 
hopper saw might now be seventy, 
    hunched before a hitachi 
in an old home or a home for the old. 
she might be dreaming now a new york movie, 
    fred astaire dancing and kissing 
ginger rogers, who high kicks across new york 
city skylines, raising possibilities 
    that time has served to lower. 
we are watching the usherette, and the subtle 
shadows her boredom makes across her not-quite- 
    impassive face beneath 
the three red-shaded lamps and beside 
the stairs that lead, somehow, to dark streets 
    that go on and on and on. 
but we are no safer here than she. 
despite the semblance of luxury-- 
    gilt edges, red plush, 
and patterned carpet--this is no palace, 
and we do not reign here, except in dreams. 
    this picture tells us much 
about various textures of lighted air, 
but at the center hopper has placed 
a slab of darkness and an empty chair.


finnish rural life, ca. 
fires, always fires after midnight,
the sun depending in the purple birches

and gleaming like a copper kettle.
by the solstice they'd burned everything,

the bad-luck sleigh, a twisted rocker,
things possessed and not-quite-right.

the bonfire coils and lurches,
big as a house, and then it settles.

the dancers come, dressed like rainbows
if rainbows could be spun,

and linking hands they turn
to the melancholy fiddles.

a red bird spreads its wings now
and in the darker days to come.


the wallful of quoted passages from his work,   
with the requisite specimens pinned next 
to their literary cameo appearances, was too good 

a temptation to resist, and if the curator couldn't,   
why should we? the prose dipped and shimmered   
and the flies, as i heard a buff call them, stood 

at lurid attention on their pins. if you love to read   
and look, you could be happy a month in that small   
room. one of the nabokov photos i'd never seen 

he's writing left-handed why did i never trouble   
to find out? at his stand-up desk in the hotel   
apartment in montreux. the picture's mostly 

of his back and the small wedge of face that shows   
brims with indifference to anything not on the page.   
the window's shut. a tiny lamp trails a veil of light 

over the page, too far away for us to read.   
we also liked the chest of specimen drawers   
labeled, as if for apprentice freudians, 

genitalia, wherein languished in phials 
the thousands he examined for his monograph   
on the lycaenidae, the silver-studded blues. 

and there in the center of the room a carillon 
of blues rang mutely out. there must have been 
three hundred of them. amanda's blue was there, 

and the chalk hill blue, the karner blue 
lycaeides melissa samuelis nabokov,          
a violet-tinged copper, the mourning cloak, 

an echo azure, the white-lined green hairstreak, 
the cretan argus known only from mt. ida 
in the series nabokov did on this beauty 

he noted for each specimen the altitude at which   
it had been taken, and as the ads and lovers say,   
and much, much more. the stilled belle of the tower 

was a lycaeides melissa melissa. no doubt 
it's an accident melissa rhymes, sort of, with lolita,          
the scant hour we could lavish on the blues 

flew by, and we improvised a path through cars 
and slush and boot-high berms of mud-blurred snow   
to wherever we went next. i must have been mute, 

or whatever i said won from silence nothing   
it mourned to lose. i was back in that small   
room, vast by love of each flickering detail, 

each genital dusting to nothing, the turn,   
like a worm's or caterpillar's, of each phrase.   
i stood up to my ankles in sludge pooled 

over a stopped sewer grate and thought--   
wouldn't you know it--about love and art   
you can be ruined rurnt, as we said in south- 

western ohio by a book or improved by   
a butterfly. you can dodder in the slop, 
septic with a rage not for order but for the love 

the senses bear for what they do, for detail 
that's never annexed, like a reluctant crumb 
to a vacuum cleaner, to a coherence. 

you can be bead after bead on perception's rosary. 
this is the sweet ache that hurts most, the way 
desire burns bluely at its phosphorescent core 

just as you're having what you wanted most,   
you want it more and more until that's more   
than you, or it, or both of you, can bear. 




how easily happiness begins by   
dicing onions. a lump of sweet butter   
slithers and swirls across the floor   
of the saut pan, especially if its   
errant path crosses a tiny slick 
of olive oil. then a tumble of onions. 

this could mean soup or risotto   
or chutney from the sanskrit 
chatni, to lick. slowly the onions   
go limp and then nacreous 
and then what cookbooks call clear,   
though if they were eyes you could see 

clearly the cataracts in them. 
it's true it can make you weep 
to peel them, to unfurl and to tease   
from the taut ball first the brittle,   
caramel-colored and decrepit 
papery outside layer, the least 

recent the reticent onion 
wrapped around its growing body,   
for there's nothing to an onion 
but skin, and it's true you can go on   
weeping as you go on in, through   
the moist middle skins, the sweetest 

and thickest, and you can go on   
in to the core, to the bud-like,   
acrid, fibrous skins densely   
clustered there, stalky and in- 
complete, and these are the most   
pungent, like the nuggets of nightmare 

and rage and murmury animal   
comfort that infant humans secrete.   
this is the best domestic perfume.   
you sit down to eat with a rumor 
of onions still on your twice-washed   
hands and lift to your mouth a hint 

of a story about loam and usual   
endurance. it's there when you clean up   
and rinse the wine glasses and make   
a joke, and you leave the minutest   
whiff of it on the light switch, 
later, when you climb the stairs. 



the canyon walls close in again,
 slant light a silver glare in brown water.
 the water is only knee deep, but when the boy reaches the
    boulders--
 purple dark, silvered by the smash of brute water--
 water will tear at his chest and arms.
 the walls of the canyon are brilliant in late light.
 they would have glared red and gold for his drowned camera
 splashed blood to his left, to his right a wall of sun laddered
    with boulders.
  
 more than boulders.    some stranger once fought down this 
    cliffside,
 his rope of twisted dry vines strung boulder to boulder,
 clifftop to arroyo.    escape.    escape maybe.    maybe bones
    in the desert.
 i think of hands scuffed raw from the braiding.
  
 almost.  water froths over the boulders,
 tugs at the boy's footing.       almost.
 the blood cliff to his left blinds him.    blind nails scrape at
     two boulders,
 a torn vine whipping somewhere above him.
  
he wedges knees against polished rock, pressing up, clawing
     slick stone.
 now.    rope cutting his hand, he skids underwater
 silver and froth, a film of bright blood staining his eyes.
 but he drags hand over hand up out of the water, climbing
     the sun
 hand over hand, the ancient vines holding,
 boulders for foothold, up out of that canyon.
  



i am wondering what became of all those tall abstractions 

that used to pose, robed and statuesque, in paintings 

and parade about on the pages of the renaissance 

displaying their capital letters like license plates.


truth cantering on a powerful horse,

chastity, eyes downcast, fluttering with veils.

each one was marble come to life, a thought in a coat, 

courtesy bowing with one hand always extended,


villainy sharpening an instrument behind a wall,

reason with her crown and constancy alert behind a helm. 

they are all retired now, consigned to a florida for tropes. 

justice is there standing by an open refrigerator.


valor lies in bed listening to the rain.

even death has nothing to do but mend his cloak and hood, 

and all their props are locked away in a warehouse, 

hourglasses, globes, blindfolds and shackles.


even if you called them back, there are no places left 

for them to go, no garden of mirth or bower of bliss. 

the valley of forgiveness is lined with condominiums 

and chain saws are howling in the forest of despair.


here on the table near the window is a vase of peonies 

and next to it black binoculars and a money clip, 

exactly the kind of thing we now prefer,

objects that sit quietly on a line in lower case,


themselves and nothing more, a wheelbarrow,

an empty mailbox, a razor blade resting in a glass ashtray. 

as for the others, the great ideas on horseback

and the long-haired virtues in embroidered gowns,


it looks as though they have traveled down

that road you see on the final page of storybooks,

the one that winds up a green hillside and disappears

into an unseen valley where everyone must be fast asleep.




the name of the author is the first to go 
followed obediently by the title, the plot, 
the heartbreaking conclusion, the entire novel 
which suddenly becomes one you have never read, never even heard of, 

as if, one by one, the memories you used to harbor 
decided to retire to the southern hemisphere of the brain, 
to a little fishing village where there are no phones. 

long ago you kissed the names of the nine muses goodbye 
and watched the quadratic equation pack its bag, 
and even now as you memorize the order of the planets, 

something else is slipping away, a state flower perhaps, 
the address of an uncle, the capital of paraguay. 

whatever it is you are struggling to remember, 
it is not poised on the tip of your tongue 
or even lurking in some obscure corner of your spleen. 

it has floated away down a dark mythological river 
whose name begins with an l as far as you can recall 

well on your own way to oblivion where you will join those 
who have even forgotten how to swim and how to ride a bicycle. 

no wonder you rise in the middle of the night 
to look up the date of a famous battle in a book on war. 
no wonder the moon in the window seems to have drifted   
out of a love poem that you used to know by heart.


i have lately come to the conclusion that i am eve,
alias mrs. adam. you know, there is no account
of her death in the bible, and why am i not eve?
                    emily dickinson in a letter,
                             january, 
wake up,
you'll need your wits about you.
this is not a dream,
but a woman who loves you, speaking.

she was there
when you cried out
she brushed the terror away.
she knew
when it was time to sin.
you were wise
to let her handle it,
and leave that place.

we couldn't speak at first
for the bitter knowledge,
the sweet taste of memory
on our tongues.

listen, it's time.
you were chosen too,
to put the world together.


when the beautiful young man drowned-- 
accidentally, swimming at dawn 
in a current too swift for him, 
or obedient to some cult 
of total immersion that promised 
the bather would come up divine, 

mortality rinsed from him-- 
hadrian placed his image everywhere, 
a marble antinos staring across 
the public squares where a few dogs 
always scuffled, planted 
in every squalid little crossroads 

at the furthest corners of the empire. 
what do we want in any body 
but the world? and if the lover's 
inimitable form was nowhere, 
then he would find it everywhere, 
though the boy became simply more dead 

as the sculptors embodied him. 
wherever hadrian might travel, 
the beloved figure would be there 
first the turn of his shoulders, 
the exact marble nipples, 
the drowned face not really lost 

to the nile--which has no appetite, 
merely takes in anything 
without judgment or expectation-- 
but lost into its own multiplication, 
an artifice rubbed with oils and acid 
so that the skin might shine. 

which of these did i love? 
here is his hair, here his hair 
again. here the chiseled liquid waist 
i hold because i cannot hold it. 
if only one of you, he might have said 
to any of the thousand marble boys anywhere, 

would speak. or the statues might have been enough, 
the drowned boy blurred as much by memory 
as by water, molded toward an essential, 
remote ideal. longing, of course, 
become its own object, the way 
that desire can make anything into a god.


in the valley of your art history book,   
the corpses stack in the back of a cart 
drawn by an ox whose rolling shoulder muscles   
show its considerable weight. 

he does this often. his velvet nostrils   
flare to indicate the stench. 

it's the smell you catch after class 
while descending a urine-soaked 
subway stair on a summer night 
in a neighborhood where cabs won't drive   
the odor of dead flowers, fear 
multiplied a thousand times. 

the train door's hiss 
seals you inside with a frail boy   
swaying from a silver hoop. 
he coughs in your direction, his eyes   
are burn holes in his face. 

back in the fourteenth-century print   
lying in your lap, a hand 
white as an orchid has sprouted   
from the pyramid of flesh. 
it claws the smoky air. 

were it not for that, 
the cart might carry green cordwood   
the human body knobby and unplaned. 

wrap your fingers around your neck   
and feel the stony glands.   
count the holes in your belt loop 
for lost weight. 

in the black unfurling glass, 
study the hard planes of your face. 

compare it to the prom picture   
in your wallet, the orchid 
pinned to your chest like a spider. 

think of the flames 
at your high school bonfire 
licking the black sky, ashes rising, 
innumerable stars. the fingers that wove   
with your fingers 
have somehow turned to bone. 

the subway shudders between dark and light.   
the ox plods across the page. 

think of everyone 
you ever loved the boy   
who gets off at your stop 
is a faint ideogram for each. 

offer him your hand.   
help him climb the stair.


after death, my father   
practices meticulously   
until the bach is seamless,   
spun glass in a dream,   
you can no longer tell   
where the modulations are,   
or the pedal shifts 
or the split fingerings . . . 

if he rests 
it's to wind the metronome   
or sip his cup of ice . . . 

but who is the other old man   
in the identical flannel gown,   
head cocked, listening 
ever more critically, 
deeper in the empty room?


the child's assignment   
what is a city? 
all dusk she sucks her pencil   
while cars swish by 
like ghosts, neighbors' radios   
forecast rain, high clouds,   
diminishing winds at last 
she writes the city is everyone. 
       now it's time 
for math, borrowing and exchanging,   
the long discipleship 
to zero, the stranger, 
the force that makes us 
what we study father and child,   
writing in separate books,   
infinite and alone.


years later they find themselves talking   
about chances, moments when their lives   
might have swerved off 
for the smallest reason. 
                                     what if 
i hadn't phoned, he says, that morning?   
what if you'd been out, 
as you were when i tried three times   
the night before? 
                           then she tells him a secret.   
she'd been there all evening, and she knew   
he was the one calling, which was why   
she hadn't answered. 
                               because she felt-- 
because she was certain--her life would change   
if she picked up the phone, said hello,   
said, i was just thinking 
of you. 
            i was afraid, 
she tells him. and in the morning   
i also knew it was you, but i just   
answered the phone 
                            the way anyone 
answers a phone when it starts to ring,   
not thinking you have a choice.


the world's a world of trouble, your mother must   
                      have told you   
               that. poison leaks into the basements 

and tedium into the schools. the oak   
                      is going the way 
               of the elm in the upper midwest--my cousin 

earns a living by taking the dead ones   
                      down. 
               and jason's alive yet, the fair- 

haired child, his metal crib next   
                      to my daughter's. 
             jason is one but last saw light five months ago 

and won't see light again. 

                                                    

leaf against leaf without malice   
                     or forethought, 
            the manifold species of murmuring 

harm. no harm intended, there never is.   
                     the new 
            inadequate software gets the reference librarian 

fired. the maintenance crew turns off power one            
                     weekend 
            and monday the lab is a morgue fifty-four 

rabbits and seventeen months of research.   
                     ignorance loves   
          as ignorance does and always 

holds high office.   

                                                   

jason had the misfortune to suffer misfortune   
                   the third 
          of july. july's the month of hospital ro- 

tations on holiday weekends the venerable   
                   stay home. 
          so when jason lay blue and inert on the table 

and couldn't be made to breathe for three-and-a- 
                  quarter hours,   
         the staff were too green to let him go. 

the household gods have abandoned us to the gods   
                  of juris- 
         prudence and suburban sprawl. the curve 

of new tarmac, the municipal pool,   
                  the sky at work 
         on the pock-marked river, fatuous sky, 

the park where idling cars, mere yards   
                  from the slide 
         and the swingset, deal beautiful oblivion in nickel 

bags the admitting room and its stately drive,   
                  possessed   
         of the town's best view. 

                                                  

and what's to become of the three-year-old brother?   
                  when jason was found   
         face down near the dogdish--it takes 

just a cupful of water to drown-- 
                   his brother stood still 
         in the corner and said he was hungry 

and said that it wasn't his fault.   
                  no fault. 
         the fault's in nature, who will 

without system or explanation   
                make permanent 
         havoc of little mistakes. a natural 

mistake, the transient ill-will we define   
                as the normal 
         and trust to be inconsequent, 

by nature's own abundance soon absorbed.   

                                                    

oak wilt, it's called, the new disease.   
                like any such 
         contagion--hypocrisy in the conference room, 

flattery in the halls--it works its mischief mostly   
                unremarked.   
         the men on the links haven't noticed 

yet. their form is good. they're par.   
                the woman who's 
         prospered from hating ideas loves causes 

instead. a little shade, a little firewood.   
                i know 
         a stand of oak on which my father's 

earthly joy depends. we're slow   
                to cut our losses.


we have not long to love. 
light does not stay. 
the tender things are those 
we fold away. 
coarse fabrics are the ones 
for common wear. 
in silence i have watched you 
comb your hair. 
intimate the silence, 
dim and warm. 
i could but did not, reach 
to touch your arm. 
i could, but do not, break 
that which is still. 
almost the faintest whisper 
would be shrill. 
so moments pass as though 
they wished to stay. 
we have not long to love. 
a night. a day.... 




holding only a handful of rushlight 
they pressed deeper into the dark, at a crouch   
until the great rock chamber 
flowered around them and they stood 
in an enormous womb of 
flickering light and darklight, a place 
to make a start. raised hands cast flapping shadows   
over the sleeker shapes of radiance. 

they've left the world of weather and panic 
behind them and gone on in, drawing the dark   
in their wake, pushing as one pulse 
to the core of stone. the pigments mixed in big shells   
are crushed ore, petals and pollens, berries 
and the binding juices oozed 
out of chosen barks. the beasts 

begin to take shape from hands and feather-tufts   
soaked in ochre, manganese, madder, mallow white   
stroking the live rock, letting slopes and contours   
mould those forms from chance, coaxing 
rigid dips and folds and bulges 
to lend themselves to necks, bellies, swelling haunches,   
a forehead or a twist of horn, tails and manes 
curling to a crazy gallop. 

intent and human, they attach 
the mineral, vegetable, animal 
realms to themselves, inscribing 
the one unbroken line 
everything depends on, from that 
impenetrable centre 
to the outer intangibles of light and air, even   
the speed of the horse, the bison's fear, the arc 
of gentleness that this big-bellied cow   
arches over its spindling calf, or the lancing   
dance of death that 
bristles out of the buck's 
struck flank. on this one line they leave   
a beak-headed human figure of sticks   
and one small, chalky, human hand. 

we'll never know if they worked in silence   
like people praying--the way our monks   
illuminated their own dark ages   
in cross-hatched rocky cloisters,   
where they contrived a binding   
labyrinth of lit affinities 
to spell out in nature's lace and fable   
their mindful, blinding sixth sense 
of a god of shadows--or whether like birds   
tracing their great bloodlines over the globe   
they kept a constant gossip up 
of praise, encouragement, complaint. 

it doesn't matter we know 
they went with guttering rushlight 
into the dark came to terms 
with the given world must have had 
--as their hands moved steadily 
by spiderlight--one desire 
we'd recognise they would--before going on   
beyond this border zone, this nowhere   
that is now here--leave something 
upright and bright behind them in the dark. 



the darkness crumbles away.
it is the same old druid time as ever, 
only a live thing leaps my hand,
a queer sardonic rat,
as i pull the parapet's poppy
to stick behind my ear.
droll rat, they would shoot you if they knew 
your cosmopolitan sympathies.
now you have touched this english hand 
you will do the same to a german 
soon, no doubt, if it be your pleasure 
to cross the sleeping green between. 
it seems you inwardly grin as you pass 
strong eyes, fine limbs, haughty athletes, 
less chanced than you for life,
bonds to the whims of murder,
sprawled in the bowels of the earth, 
the torn fields of france.
what do you see in our eyes
at the shrieking iron and flame
hurled through still heavens?
what quaver--what heart aghast?
poppies whose roots are in man's veins
drop, and are ever dropping 
but mine in my ear is safe--
just a little white with the dust.


i was miserable, of course, for i was seventeen, 
and so i swung into action and wrote a poem, 

and it was miserable, for that was how i thought 
poetry worked you digested experience and shat 

literature. it was  at the showplace, long since 
defunct, on west th st., and i sat at the bar, 

casting beer money from a thin reel of ones, 
the kid in the city, big ears like a puppy. 

and i knew mingus was a genius. i knew two 
other things, but they were wrong, as it happened. 

so i made him look at the poem. 
there's a lot of that going around, he said, 

and sweet baby jesus he was right. he laughed 
amiably. he didn't look as if he thought 

bad poems were dangerous, the way some poets do. 
if they were baseball executives they'd plot 

to destroy sandlots everywhere so that the game 
could be saved from children.   of course later 

that night he fired his pianist in mid-number 
and flurried him from the stand. 

we've suffered a diminuendo in personnel, 
he explained, and the band played on.


because she could find no one else to paint apicture of the old family place where she and hersisters lived . . . she attended an adult educationclass in montpelier. in one evening bessie drennan learned everything she would need toaccomplish her goals . . .          the vermont folklife center newsletter

bessie, you've made space dizzy
with your perfected technique for snow
white spatters and a dry brush
feathering everything in the world

seem to make the firmament fly.
four roads converge on the heart of town,
this knot of white and yellow houses
angling off kilter, their astigmatic windows

almost all in rows. lucky the skater
threading the yellow tavern's quilt-sized pond,
the yellow dogs who punctuate the village
where our occupations are chasing

and being chaste, sleighing and sledding
and snowshoeing from house to house
in our conical, flamelike hats.
even the barns are sliding in snow,

though the birches are all golden
and one maple blazes without being consumed.
is it from a hill nearby we're watching,
or somewhere in the sky? could we be flying

on slick runners down into the village?
is that mare with the elegant legs
truly the size of a house,
and is this the store where everyone bought

those pointed hats, the snowshoes that angle
in contradictory directions?
isn't that rin tin tin, bigtongued
and bounding and in two places at once?

down there in the world's corner two children
steal away onto the frozen pond,
carrying their toboggan. even the weathervanes
--bounding fish, a sailing stag--look happy.

the houses are swaying, bessie,
and nothing is grounded in shadow,
set loose by weather and art
from gravity's contraints.

and though i think this man is falling,
is it anything but joyous,
the arc his red scarf
transcribes in the air?


in white pleated trousers, peering through green 
sunshades, looking for the way the sun is red 
noise, how locusts hiss to replicate the sun. 
what is the visual equivalent 
of syncopation? rows of seared palms wrinkle 
in the heat waves through green glass. sprinklers 
tick, tick, tick. the watts towers aim to split 
the sky into chroma, spires tiled with rubble 
nothing less than aspiration. i've left 
minarets for sun and syncopation, 
sixty-seven shades of green which i have 
counted, beginning palm leaves, front and back, 
luncheon pickle, bottle glass, etcetera. 
one day i will comprehend the different   
grades of red. on that day i will comprehend 
these people, rhythms, jazz, simon rodia, 
watts, los angeles, aspiration.


we pull off 
to a road shack 
in massachusetts 
to watch men walk 

on the moon. we did   
the same thing 
for three two one 
blast off, and now 

we watch the same men   
bounce in and out 
of craters. i want 
a coke and a hamburger. 

because the men 
are walking on the moon   
which is now irrefutably   
not green, not cheese, 

not a shiny dime floating   
in a cold blue, 
the way i'd thought, 
the road shack people don't 

notice we are a black   
family not from there,   
the way it mostly goes.   
this talking through 

static, bounces in space- 
boots, tethered   
to cords is much   
stranger, stranger 

even than we are. 




a famous battle happened in this valley.   
                     you never understood the nature poem.   
till now. till this moment--if these statements   
                     seem separate, unrelated, follow this   

silence to its edge and you will hear   
                     the history of air the crispness of a fern   
or the upward cut and turn around of   
                     a fieldfare or thrush written on it.   

the other history is silent the estuary   
                     is over there. the issue was decided here   
two kings prepared to give no quarter.   
                     then one king and one dead tradition.   

now the humid dusk, the old wounds   
                     wait for language, for a different truth   
when you see the silk of the willow   
                     and the wider edge of the river turn   

and grow dark and then darker, then   
                     you will know that the nature poem   
is not the action nor its end it is   
                     this rust on the gate beside the trees, on 

the cattle grid underneath our feet,   
                     on the steering wheel shaft it is   
an aftermath, an overlay and even in   
                     its own modest way, an art of peace 

i try the word distance and it fills with   
                     sycamores, a summer's worth of pollen   
and as i write valley straw, metal   
                     blood, oaths, armour are unwritten.   

silence spreads slowly from these words   
                     to those ilex trees half in, half out   
of shadows falling on the shallow ford   
                     of the south bank beside yellow island   

as twilight shows how this sweet corrosion   
                     begins to be complete what we see   
is what the poem says   
                     evening coming--cattle, cattle-shadows-- 

and whin bushes and a change of weather   
                     about to change them all what we see is how 
the place and the torment of the place are   
                     for this moment free of one another.


the year i was born the atomic bomb went off. 
here i'd just begun, and someone 
found the switch to turn off the world. 

in the furnace-light, in the central solar fire 
of that heat lamp, the future got very finite, 
and it was possible to imagine time-travelers 

failing to arrive, because there was no future. 
inside the great dark clock in the hall, 
heavy brass cylinders descended. 

tick-tock, the chimes changed their tune 
one phrase at a time. the bomb became 
a film star, its glamorous globe of smoke 

searing the faces of men in beach chairs. 
someone threw up every day at school. 
no time to worry about collective death, 

when life itself was permeated by ordeals. 
and so we grew up, beneath an umbrella of acceptance. 
in bio we learned there were particles 

cruising through us like whales through archipelagoes, 
and in civics that if hitler had gotten the bomb 
he'd have used it on the inferior races, 

and all this time love was etching its scars 
on our skins like maps. the heavens 
remained pure, except for little white slits 

on the perfect blue skin that planes cut 
in the icy upper air, like needles sewing. 
from one, a tiny seed might fall 

that would make a sun on earth. 
and so the century passed, with me still in it, 
books waiting on the shelves to become cinders, 

what we felt locked up inside, waiting to be read, 
down the long corridor of time. i was born 
the year the bomb exploded. twice 

whole cities were charred like cities in the bible, 
but we didn't look back. we went on thinking 
we could go on, our shapes the same, 

darkened now against a background lit by fire. 
forgive me for doubting you're there, 
citizens, on your holodecks with earth wallpaper--

a shadow-toned ancestor with poorly pressed pants, 
protected like a child from knowing the future.


i wait for my shadow to forget me, 
to take that one phantom step that i keep 
from taking. i wait for the simple flash 
of a dancer's spat upon this one moon 
of stage-light, the mind's lonely oval 
illuminated on the surface of some 
windless pond or slew. and the old soft-shoe 
practices to get it right, husha-husha-hush 
in its constant audition of sawdust. 
even this choreography of useless 
wishing is not enough to keep tonight 
from becoming nothing more than some floor's 
forgotten routine where faded, numbered 
dance-steps silently waltz themselves away. 
the orchestra's now ready to faur
into the evening's last song while i try 
to convince myself to cross this room 
for the first time all night and rinse 
what's left in some dbutante's silver 
sequined waterfall, hope keeling hopelessly 
ever closer to the edge. across the floor 
other couples sashay on. a tin flask empties 
itself from asking, the shadow's last chance 
now wasted in some chandelier's dim lust.


adjectives continue 
their downward spiral, 
with adverbs likely to follow. 

wisdom, grace, and beauty 
can be had three for a dollar, 
as they head for a recession. 

diaphanous, filigree, 
pearlescent, and love 
are now available 
at wholesale prices. 

verbs are still blue-chip investments, 
but not many are willing to sell. 

the image market is still strong, 
but only for those rated aa or higher. 
beware of cheap imitations 
sold by the side of the road. 

only the most conservative 
consider rhyme a good option, 
but its success in certain circles 
warrants a brief mention. 

the ongoing search for fresh 
metaphor has caused concern 
among environmental activists, 

who warn that both the moon and the sea 
have measurably diminished 
since the dawn of the romantic era. 

latter-day prosodists are having to settle 
for menial positions in poultry plants, 
where an aptitude for repetitive rhythms 
is considered a valuable trait. 

the outlook for the future remains uncertain, 
and troubled times may lie ahead. 
supply will continue to outpace demand, 
and the best of the lot will remain unread.


o wonderful for weight and whiteness 
       ideolog whose absolutes 
               are always proven right 
                      by white and then 
               more white and white again, 
       winning the same argument year 
after year by making the opposition 
                            disappear 

o dear miniature of infinity with no 
       end in sight and no snow- 
             flake exactly like 
                      another, all 
             a little different no 
       matter how many may fall, 
just like our own dna or the human face 
                              eternal 

o still keep covering the street 
       and sidewalks, cemeteries, even 
               our twice-shoveled drive, 
                      and all that is alive, 
               with geometries that sleet 
       will freeze into death's 
impromptu vision of a heaven 
                              wholly white 

for we know who your sponsor is, whose will 
       you so immensely serve, 
               whose chill is more severe 
                      than any here. 
               though his name may be unspoken, 
       his commandments are unbroken, 
and every monument that you erect 
                              belongs to him


					
					over a cup of coffee or sitting on a park bench or 
walking the dog, he would recall some incident 
from his youth--nothing significant--climbing a tree 
in his backyard, waiting in left field for a batter's 
swing, sitting in a parked car with a girl whose face 
he no longer remembered, his hand on her breast 
and his body electric memories to look at with 
curiosity, the harmless behavior of a stranger, with 
nothing to regret or elicit particular joy. and 
although he had no sense of being on a journey, 
such memories made him realize how far he had 
traveled, which, in turn, made him ask how he 
would look back on the person he was now, this 
person who seemed so substantial. these images, it 
was like looking at a book of old photographs, 
recognizing a forehead, the narrow chin, and 
perhaps recalling the story of an older second 
cousin, how he had left long ago to try his luck in 
argentina or australia. and he saw that he was 
becoming like such a person, that the day might 
arrive when he would look back on his present self 
as on a distant relative who had drifted off into 
uncharted lands.
				

 

christmas trees lined like war refugees, 
a fallen army made to stand in their greens. 
cut down at the foot, on their last leg, 

they pull themselves up, arms raised. 
we drop them like wood 
tied, they are driven through the streets, 

dragged through the door, cornered 
in a room, given a single blanket, 
only water to drink, surrounded by joy. 

forced to wear a gaudy gold star, 
to surrender their pride, 
they do their best to look alive.


in the cards and at the bend in the road   
we never saw you   
in the womb and in the crossfire   
in the numbers   
whatever you had your hand in   
which was everything   
we were told never to put   
our faith in you   
to bow to you humbly after all   
because in the end there was nothing   
else we could do   
but not to believe in you   

still we might coax you with pebbles   
kept warm in the hand   
or coins or the relics   
of vanished animals   
observances rituals   
not binding upon you   
who make no promises   
we might do such things only   
not to neglect you   
and risk your disfavor   
oh you who are never the same   
who are secret as the day when it comes   
you whom we explain   
as often as we can   
without understanding


i do not understand the poets who tell me 
that i should not personify. every morning 
the willow auditions for a new role 

outside my bedroom window--today she is 
clytemnestra yesterday a southern belle, 
lost in her own melodrama, sinking on her skirts. 

nor do i like the mathematicians who tell me 
i cannot say, the zinnias are counting on their 
fingers, or the dog is practicing her geometry, 

even though every day i watch her using 
the yard's big maple as the apex of a triangle 
from which she bisects the circumference 

of the lawn until she finds the place where 
the rabbit has escaped, or the squirrel upped 
the ante by climbing into a new euclidian plane. 

she stumbles across the lawn, eyes pulling 
her feet along, gaze fixed on a rodent working 
the maze of the oak as if it were his own invention, 

her feet tangling in the roots of trees, and tripping, 
yes, even over themselves, until i go out to assist, 
by pointing at the squirrel, and repeating, there 

there but instead of following my outstretched 
arm to the crown of the tree, where the animal is 
now lounging under a canopy of leaves, 

catching its breath, charting its next escape, 
she looks to my mouth, eager to read my lips, 
confident that i--who can bring her home 

from across the field with a word, who 
can speak for the willow and the zinnia-- 
can surely charm a squirrel down from a tree.


their authority did not unfold 
from ironed white shirts and thin ties 
or from the funereal seriousness that struck 
their acne-splashed faces but because 
they stood heir to our native faith in light. 

so we followed the thin white waver 
of beams they pointed down aisles 
to seats we never thought of refusing. 
it was the first job i wanted, 
especially after birthday outings 

far from home showed me the glowing 
outfits worn by big-city ushers, their get-ups 
a blend of doorman and military dictator, 
as gaudy and fine as the plots 
of movies my saturdays were swallowed by. 

none of us knew, as they took us 
into the artificial light of the cinema, 
that they walked the path of the pin setter, 
the blacksmith or elevator operator, 
professions reduced to curiosity 

by wandering time. only in the quick steps 
of floor salesmen, the slim backs of hostesses 
bringing us to our tables, do they remain, 
the artful flutters of their flashlights lost 
in dark we are left to find our own way through.


tenderness and rot   
share a border.   
and rot is an   
aggressive neighbor   
whose iridescence   
keeps creeping over.   

no lessons   
can be drawn   
from this however.   

one is not   
two countries.   
one is not meat   
corrupting.   

it is important   
to stay sweet   
and loving.


it is always the same 
she is standing over me 

in the forest clearing, 
a dab of blood on her cheek 

from a rabbit or a deer. 
i am aware of nothing 

but my mutinous flesh, 
and the traps of desire 

sent to test it-- 
her bare arms, bare 

shoulders, her loosened hair, 
the hard, high breasts, 

and under a belt 
of knives and fish-lures, 

her undressed wound. 
every night the same 

the slashed fetlock, 
the buckling under 

i wake in her body 
broken, like a gun.


i gave birth to a princess, her mother 
once told me, and i thought of my son pouring 
his grape-nuts in the garage so as not to wake her, 

of the moment her baby, seeing her 
now a separate entity, seemed not to breathe, 
refused to blink her sapphire eyes. 

i remembered again last night as she 
and i crossed a florida street, the caution 
light running gold streamers 

over the dark sweep of her hair, 
when a young man coming toward us halted 
midway a moment, stunned, before moving on. 

so what is this divine right--less 
than bloodlines, or more? more than symmetry 
of face or a silver necklace nestled 

at a flawless throat, the nerve to send back 
bad food in restaurants, more than the big, 
loopy handwriting of the generous spirit? 

call it bravery, that eager readiness 
in the eyes, the quality of the light shining 
there. call it blessed assurance. 

today, pony-tailed, she luxuriates in sun, 
opulent in a hot pink bikini. in deference 
the ocean leans away, a backdrop. 

i find myself bent, studying the shore for perfect 
shells to lay at her feet--cat's paw, prickly 
cockle, angel wing. call it homage, more or less.


the sun is high, the seaside air is sharp, 
and salty light reveals the mayan school. 
the irish hope their names are on the harp, 
we see the sheep's advertisement for wool, 
boulders are here, to throw against a tarp, 
from which comes bursting forth a puzzled mule. 
perceval seizes it and mounts it, then 
the blood-dimmed tide recedes and then comes in again. 

fateful connections that we make to things 
whose functioning's oblivious to our lives 
how sidewise news of light from darkness springs, 
how blue bees buzz from big blooms back to hives 
and make the honey while the queen bee sings 
leadbelly in arrangements by burl ives-- 
how long ago i saw the misted pine trees 
and hoped, no matter how, to get them into poetry 

stendhal, at fifty, gazing as it happened 
on rome from the janiculum, decided 
that one way he could give his life a stipend 
was to suspend his being amour's fighter 
and get to know himself. here he had ripened 
accomplished, loved, and lived, was a great writer 
but never had explored in true detail 
his childhood and his growing up. so he set sail 

composing la vie de henry brulard 
but in five hundred pages scarcely got 
beyond his seventeenth year, for it is hard 
to take into account what happens here 
and fit it all onto an index card. 
even one moment of it is too hot, 
complex and cannibalistically connected 
to every other, which is what might be expected. 

sterne's hero has a greater problem, never 
getting much past his birth. i've had a third one. 
my autobiography, if i should ever 
start out to write it, quickly seems a burden 
an i-will-do-that-the-next-time endeavor. 
whatever life i do write's an absurd one 
as if some crazy person with a knife 
cut up and made a jigsaw puzzle of a life. 

in any case a life that's hardly possible 
in the conditions that we really live in, 
where easy flying leaps to inaccessible 
mountainy places where love is a given 
and misery, if there, infinitesimal, 
are quite the norm. here none by pain is driven 
that is not curable by the romanza 
that's kept in readiness to finish any stanza. 

whatever, then, i see at this late stage of 
my life i may or may not have stayed ignorant 
of that great book i've strained to write one page of 
yet always hoping my page was significant. 
be it or not, for me and for the ages 
i leave it as it is. yet as a figurant 
who has not stopped, i'm writing in addition 
more lines to clarify my present disposition. 

one person in a million finds out something 
perhaps each fifty years and that is knowledge. 
newton, copernicus, einstein are cunning. 
the rest of us just rise and go to college 
with no more hope to come home with the bunting 
than a stray dachshund going through the village. 
however, what a treat our small successes 
of present and of past, at various addresses 

to be in all those places where i tarried 
too little or too late or bright and early 
to love again the first woman i married 
to marvel at such things as melancholy, 
sophistication, drums, a baby carriage, 
a john cage concert heard at alice tully-- 
how my desire when young to be a poet 
made me attentive and oblivious every moment 

do you remember oceanview the fair? 
the heights above the river? the canoes? 
the place we beached them and the grass was bare? 
those days the sandbars gave our knees a truce? 
the crooked line of pantry shelves, with pear 
and cherry jam? and pancho, with his noose? 
do you remember full and half and empty? 
do you remember sorrow standing in the entry? 

do you remember thought, and talking plainly? 
michel and i went walking after chartres 
cathedral had engaged our spirits mainly 
by giving us an insight into barthes. 
michel said he was capable of feigning 
renewed intentions of the soul's deep part, 
like this cathedral's artificial forces 
that press a kind of artless thought into our faces. 

and yet--    the moor is dark beneath the moon. 
the porcupine turns over on its belly 
and new conceptions rap at the cocoon. 
civilization, dealing with us fairly, 
for once, releases its erectheion 
of understanding, which consoles us, nearly. 
later we study certain characteristics 
that may give us a better chance with the statistics. 

how much i'd like to live the whole thing over, 
but making some corrections as i go 
to be a better husband and a father, 
be with my babies on a sled in snow. 
by twenty i'd have understood my mother 
and by compassion found a way to know 
what separates the what-i-started-out-as 
from what-i-sometimes-wished-i-was-when-in-the-mountains. 

to be once more the one who what was worthy 
of courtship courted--it was quite as stressful 
as trying to, er, as they say, give birth to 
a poem and as often unsuccessful, 
but it was nice to be sublime and flirty 
with radiant girls, and, in some strange way, restful. 
i could be everything i wasn't usually-- 
and then to get somebody else to feel it mutually 

in poems the same problem or a similar. 
desire of course not only to do old things 
but things unheard of yet by nuns or visitors 
and of the melancholy finch be co-finch 
in singing songs with such a broad parameter 
that seamstresses would stare, forget to sew things, 
astronauts quit the sky, athletes the stadium 
to hear them, and the rest of what they hear be tedium. 

such wild desires, i think it's recognizable 
are part and parcel of the human image 
and in a way, i'd say, no less predictable 
than popeye's feelings for a can of spinach. 
yet if we're set on course by the invisible, 
all pre-determined, what about the language 
that teases me each morning with its leanings 
toward the unprogrammed altitudes beyond its meanings? 

are you, o particles, o atoms, nominatives 
like percevals and stendhals, set in motion 
by some ordaining will that is definitive? 
is this invading chill and high emotion, 
this tendency to know one is regenerative, 
is this, all, tidal take-home like the ocean? 
be what you may, my thanks for your society 
through the long life i've had, your jokes and your variety, 

the warmth you've shown in giving me a temperature 
that i can live with, and the strength you've shared with me 
in arms and legs--and for your part in literature, 
what can i say? it is as if life stared at me 
and kissed my lips and left it as a signature. 
thank you for that, and thank you for preparing me 
for love itself, and friendship, its co-agent. 
thank you for being this, and for its inspiration.


don't look at me   
for answers. who am i but   
a sobriquet,   
a teeth-grinder,   
grinder of color,   
and vanishing point?   

there was a time   
of middle distance, unforgettable,   
a sort of lace-cut   
flame-green filament   
to ravish my   
skin-tight eyes.   

i take that back--   
it was forgettable but not   
entirely if you   
consider my   
heavenly bodies . . .   
i loved them so.   

heaven's motes sift   
to salt-white--paint is ground   
to silence and i,   
i am bound, unquiet,   
a shade of blue   
in the studio.   

if it isn't too late   
let me waste one day away   
from my history.   
let me see without   
looking inside   
at broken glass.


if on your grandmother's birthday you burn a candle   
to honor her memory, you might think of burning an extra   
to honor the memory of someone who never met her,   
a man who may have come to the town she lived in   
looking for work and never found it.   
picture him taking a stroll one morning,   
after a month of grief with the want ads,   
to refresh himself in the park before moving on.   
suppose he notices on the gravel path the shards   
of a green glass bottle that your grandmother,   
then still a girl, will be destined to step on   
when she wanders barefoot away from her school picnic   
if he doesn't stoop down and scoop the mess up   
with the want-ad section and carry it to a trash can.   

for you to burn a candle for him   
you needn't suppose the cut would be a deep one,   
just deep enough to keep her at home   
the night of the hay ride when she meets helen,   
who is soon to become her dearest friend,   
whose brother george, thirty years later,   
helps your grandfather with a loan so his shoe store   
doesn't go under in the great depression   
and his son, your father, is able to stay in school   
where his love of learning is fanned into flames,   
a love he labors, later, to kindle in you.   

how grateful you are for your father's efforts   
is shown by the candles you've burned for him.   
but today, for a change, why not a candle   
for the man whose name is unknown to you?   
take a moment to wonder whether he died at home   
with friends and family or alone on the road,   
on the look-out for no one to sit at his bedside   
and hold his hand, the very hand   
it's time for you to imagine holding.


sure, she says, why not,   
we buy the ground lamb from the market   
we buy parsley, fresh tomatoes, garlic   
we cut, press, dice, mix   

make the yeasty dough   
the night before, kneading it   
until our knuckles feel the hardness   
of river beds or rocks in the desert   

we tell tante lola to come   
with her rolling pins we tell   
zaven and maroush, hagop and arpin   
to bring their baking sheets   

we sprinkle the flour on the kitchen table   
and it is snowing on ararat   
we sprinkle the flour and the memory   
of winter is in our eyes   

we roll the dough out   
into small circles   
pale moons over   
every empty village   

kevork is standing on a chair   
and singing   
o my armenian girl  
my spirit longs to be nearer  

nevrig is warming the oven   
and a dry desert breeze   
is skimming over the rooftops   
toward the sea   

we are spreading the lahma 
on the ajoun with our fingers   
whispering into it the histories   
of those who have none   

we are baking them   
under the heat of the sun   
the dough crispening   
so thin and delicate   

you would swear   
it is valuable parchment   
we are taking out   
and rolling up in our hands   

and eating and tasting again   
everything that has already   
been written   
into the body.


the land is full of what was lost. what's hidden 
rises to the surface after rain 
in new-ploughed fields, and fields stubbled again 
the clay shards, foot and lip, that heaped the midden, 

and here and there a blade or flakes of blade, 
a patient art, knapped from a core of flint, 
most broken, few as coins new from the mint, 
perfect, shot through time as through a glade. 

you cannot help but think how they were lost 
the quarry, fletched shaft in its flank, the blood 
whose trail soon vanished in the antlered wood, 
not just the meat, but what the weapon cost-- 

o hapless hunter, though your aim was true-- 
the wounded hart, spooked, fleeting in its fear-- 
and the sharpness honed with longing, year by year 
buried deeper, found someday, but not by you.


the relationship between   
       blackbird and fencepost, between   
the cow and its egret, the field   
       and wildflowers overrunning the field--   
so little depends upon their trust.   

       here, in god we trust   
to keep our cash and thoughts in line--   
       in the sky, an unexplained white line   
could be the first of many omens.   
       but this is no country for omens,   

the line as chalky as the moon,   
       bleak and useless as the moon   
now rising like a breath of cold air . . .   
       there is gullibility in the air.


in the beginning, a word, move 
then a plan and then the reasons, 
which i do not remember exactly. 
i remember clearly only the clothes 
we were given for the journey 
and the last, silent meal we ate. 
we left the place as lightly as we 
had come, so many years before. 

from a sunlit state of innocence 
where white sheets were hung 
to dry like clouds over paradise 
from eucalyptus-scented earth, 
a red house with a yard swung 
between dreaming hills, pillaged 
by raccoons, framed with lilies 
like trumpets of the archangels, 

we moved into history, a river 
slowed by many bends, a village 
of peacocks with a hundred eyes 
a low house among fields, with 
an iron stove, a winter shrine 
a fireplace blackened by time, 
the fragile bones of a sparrow 
frozen in the shape of its flight. 

when father played his trombone 
in the attic, schoolchildren tittered 
in the street. in the late afternoon, 
the cows assembled at the gate, 
witless, waiting for a farmer's son. 
home, the children conjugated 
verbs, found variables and drew 
diagrams of the human heart. 

evenings, the round kitchen table, 
lit by a low dutch lamp, summoned 
poets, players, horsethieves, to glasses 
of jenever. an incense of gossip rose 
slowly, blackening the walls. outside, 
horses pawed the darkness, breathing 
delicate feathers of ice. we courted 
the favors of spiders, mice and moles. 

our words grew small and porous as 
fossiled bones, our gestures groaned 
with the cold. the will-less world of 
water, wood and stone taught us when 
to yield. when it came time to move 
along again, we were four strangers 
waving at each other, in slow motion, 
across a deafening expanse of ocean.


the dance shoes, seduction 
and coercion, owned by male feet, 
roam floors that beg for chandeliers. 
in search of flat-footed beauty 

and a bed, where ever they might be, 
the handsome conversation attracts 
female followers trading on the smiles 
of curves. the next steps are dizzying 

and leave dresses dipped and hung over 
with a purse and heart opened at 
their tops. the wallflowers can't say 
when the tango with the rag doll began, 

but witnesses toasted a conga line 
of would-be brides that transcend 
a retirement community in florida, 
each giving up their precious moments 

on earth to fandango's flimflam.


i hope you'll pardon the informality   
of this letter, postmarked olympia   
greece, not washington, its task not simple   
crossing lines you've crossed, time, mortality,   
to find you, who spent a lifetime crossing lines   
out, twisting, polishing them to shine   

cool and lustrous as the statue i fell in   
love with yesterday. i'm sure you saw him   
too, that perfect hermes by praxitelis,   
full lips, hips contrapposto. i wished to draw him   
down, latter-day pygmalion, and embrace   
him. or barring eros and the guards i'd trace   

his face, the supple muscle of the marble.   
i had a student who resembled him--   
yes, angelos--arrogant and beautiful.   
i never touched him though he touches me in dreams.   
eros dangles his perfection in our faces   
like one-armed hermes with his promise of the grapes.   

i was certain i'd dream of him last night.   
instead i dreamed another in the growing chain   
of others with whom it ended not quite   
right. but the thirst was perfect, if its price pain   
and shattered crystal, spilling wine, all part   
and parcel of our imperfect lives. then art   

startles out of heartache, marble or page.   
you learned this long ago. now i too see   
the wildest things require the strongest cages,   
the panther's double bars, or the seeds,   
bloodysweet and bitter, in the pomegranate's   
rind. love held tight in a sonnet.


it is not poetry you fear, but poets, 
their indelible brand 
of words. how will your daughter 
escape the mark men hanged 
young women for in salem? 
i am nothing more than a teacher, 
like you. see, i have removed 
my shoes and socks. i am rolling 
my trousers above my ankles. 
no cloven hooves. long feet and toes 
like you and your beautiful daughter. 

it is language that has won 
her over, earth-bound words 
walking orderly across the page 
like children holding to 
the rope attached to your wrist, 
teacher and students 
traversing the noisy street 
at the crosswalk, with the light 
of your fingers composing 
the line your children read, 
each syllable's afterimage trailing 
your quick passage of hands 
conducting the boys and girls 
safely from one curb to the other.


doors opened and shut,   
the director shouted orders   
through a bullhorn,   
or babbled just   
                              out of the frame.   
a carpenter hammered flats nearby   
for the next production.   
all of this, and more,   
while the actors blocked it out,   
already living   
in that small square of light   
where silence reigned   
like a tiny theatre for the deaf.   

now, almost a century later,   
it's peaceful, far   
from the center of action,   
the last voice on the street   
reduced to a whisper,   
                              then gone.   
not even birdsong   
as evening's opening credits   
begin to roll.   

only the film,   
shimmering out of a disc   
thinner than sound,   
characters moving   
like fish in their gray element--   
less than fish--   
not a hiss, not a bubble,   
not even a cry   
from that dim world of silence   
doubled by time.


forgiving the living is hard 
enough, shrugging away all the wounds 
delivered with kisses and curses, 
the thousand and one petty slights 
that bled me to an albino shade, 
that shadow me even in dreams. 

but the dead are altogether 
another matter, not easily to be 
enlightened and quite beyond regretting 
anything as far as we can tell 
and most likely indifferent to 
our common currency of tears. 

and so it is that pissing on your grave 
doesn't please me as much as it ought to. 
now that you have passed beyond 
all blaming and shaming, what can i do 
but rise and proclaim sincere admiration 
when my turn comes around to speak?


they grow up together 
but they aren't even fraternal 

twins, they quarrel a lot 
about where to go and what 

to do, the body complains 
about having to carry 

the soul everywhere as if 
it were some helpless cripple, 

and the soul snipes that it can go 
places the body never dreamed of, 

then they quarrel over which one of them 
does the dreaming, but the truth is, 

they can't live without each other and 
they both know it, anima, animosity, 

the diaphragm pumps like a bellows 
and the soul pulls out all the stops-- 

sings at the top of its lungs, laughs 
at its little jokes, it would like 

to think it has the upper hand 
and can leave whenever it wants-- 

but only as long as it knows 
the door will be unlocked 

when it sneaks back home before 
the sun comes up, and when the body 

says where have you been, the soul 
says, with a smirk, i was at the end 

of my tether, and it was, like a diver 
on the ocean floor or an astronaut 

admiring the view from outside 
the mother ship, and like them 

it would be lost without its air 
supply and protective clothing, 

the body knows that and begins 
to hum, i get along without you 

very well, and   the soul says, listen 
to that, you can't sing worth a lick 

without me, they'll go on bickering 
like this until death do them part-- 

and then, even if the soul seems to float 
above the body for a moment, 

like a flame above a candle, pinch 
the wick and it disappears.


a reflection on my students
they are so beautiful, and so very young 
they seem almost to glitter with perfection, 
these creatures that i briefly move among. 

i never get to stay with them for long, 
but even so, i view them with affection 
they are so beautiful, and so very young. 

poised or clumsy, placid or high-strung, 
they're expert in the art of   introspection, 
these creatures that i briefly move among-- 

and if their words don't quite trip   off the tongue 
consistently, with just the right inflection, 
they remain beautiful. and very young. 

still, i have to tell myself it's   wrong 
to think of them as anything but fiction, 
these creatures that i briefly move   among-- 

because, like me, they're traveling   headlong 
in that familiar, vertical direction 
that coarsens beautiful, blackmails young-- 
the two delusions we all move among.


surprised by a frill of white flower 
where i'd never planted an eye, 
i decided to fence it with sticks 

and let the renegade live 
in undoctored soil where the garden 
gave way to volunteer poplars 

and acidic white pine. why not? 
after all, away from the tribe, 
in clay where beetles drill 

and weeds emerge inspired, 
it might grow eccentric, proliferate 
and thrive. 
                when autumn air 

said disinter, to fill the bin 
for winter, i troweled under 
and pulled the stem 

until a rabble of rough spuds 
red as etruscan urns emerged 
as if to prove 

that whatever urge drove 
the rogue to sow itself and strive 
beyond all cultivation 

might offer a vital lesson 
to any apostate instinct 
aspiring to survive.


we gave our dogs a button to sniff,   
or a tissue, and they bounded off   
confident in their training,   
in the power of their senses   
to recreate the body,   

but after eighteen hours in rubble   
where even steel was pulverized   
they curled on themselves   
and stared up at us   
and in their soft huge eyes   
we saw mirrored the longing for death   

then we had to beg a stranger   
to be a victim and crouch   
behind a girder, and let the dogs   
discover him and tug him   
proudly, with suppressed yaps,   
back to command and the rows   
of empty triage tables.   

but who will hide from us?   
who will keep digging for us   
here in the cloud of ashes?


right after the bomb, even before the ceiling 
   and walls and floor are rearranging 
      you and themselves into a different world, 
you must hold still, must wait for them 
   to settle down in unpredictable ways, 
      to bring their wars, shuddering, 
to an end, and only then should you begin 
   numbly to feel what freedom may be left 
      to your feet or knees, to your elbows 
or clenched fingers. where you used to walk 
   or lean or lie down or fix your attention 
      at a whim or stomp your foot 
or slump in a chair, you'll find a new 
   architecturally unsound floor-plan 
      to contend with, if you can move 
at all. now you may remember others 
   who were somewhere near you before 
      this breakdown of circumstances. caught by surprise 
like you, they may be waiting separately 
   at their own levels, inside their own portions 
      of your incoherent flat. they may be thinking 
of you, as you are of them, and wondering 
   whether some common passageway, no matter 
      how crooked or narrow, might still exist 
between you, through which you might share the absence 
   of food and water and the cold comfort 
      of daylight. they may be expecting you 
to arrive at any moment, to crawl through dust 
   and fire to their rescue as they find their bodies 
      growing more stiff, assuming even more 
unusual attitudes at every turn 
   of a second hand, at every sound 
      of a bell or an alarm, at every pounding 
of a door or a heart, so if you can't reach them 
   now and they can't reach you, remember, please 
      remember, whatever you say, 
whatever you hear or keep to yourself, whatever 
   you scream or whisper, will need to make 
      some kind of sense, perhaps for days and days.


in the beginning we could hear their swords cutting jewels 
from the protected orchard while our children heard fine teeth 
dragging along empty granary floors. between us and them 
stands the great wound, swallowing all tears, all voices. 

transfixed or transformed by this pain? we never know because 
who can slip through the gate without throwing a shadow 
toward both the past and present? fire, flood, famine-- 
all we've wished upon them a thousand times, still they inch 

back and taunt us with their persistence. we track them down 
to a quick end. more come. and the old memories grow new. 
the future seems already written with a pen of iron. the book 
unreadable, immense. the enemy has become our masterpiece.

					there will be no deafening noise. no hornblow of thunder. 
 the small plants of the earth will not tremble on the hillside as grace is prepared. 
 the sky will neither drown us in its plenty, nor the ground crack and consume feet in its hunger. 
 no, bodies will not, in their last rags of flesh, creep from under the earth, and with breath once torn from them, choke and expel the old mud of the world. 
 adam and eve, incredulous, will not embrace again in their poverty, not knowing whether to shield themselves, or to emerge shameless from the past's shadow, astonished to again greet terra firma. 
 the book of the world, encrusted with deep-sea pearls and the blood of the lamb, will not open up its pages in which all deeds have been inscribed. 
 and the totality of history will not roll back together, all events fusing, once and for all, into the great blazing sphere of time. 
 none will sit on the right hand. there will be no right hand. 
 and the figure of sorrow and grace, with his staff upright, its purple pennant caught in that final wind, will not be there to greet us, with the mercy of justice in his eyes. 
 no, never judgment. just the abyss into which all acts are thrown down, and the terrible white silence in which judgment either endures or burns.
				

 

i imagined the atmosphere would be clear, 

shot with pristine light, 

not this sulphurous haze, 

the air ionized as before a thunderstorm. 


many have pictured a river here, 

but no one mentioned all the boats, 

their benches crowded with naked passengers, 

each bent over a writing tablet. 


i knew i would not always be a child 

with a model train and a model tunnel, 

and i knew i would not live forever, 

jumping all day through the hoop of myself. 


i had heard about the journey to the other side 

and the clink of the final coin 

in the leather purse of the man holding the oar, 

but how could anyone have guessed 


that as soon as we arrived 

we would be asked to describe this place 

and to include as much detail as possible-- 

not just the water, he insists, 


rather the oily, fathomless, rat-happy water, 

not simply the shackles, but the rusty, 

iron, ankle-shredding shackles-- 

and that our next assignment would be 


to jot down, off the tops of our heads, 

our thoughts and feelings about being dead, 

not really an assignment, 

the man rotating the oar keeps telling us-- 


think of it more as an exercise, he groans, 

think of writing as a process, 

a never-ending, infernal process, 

and now the boats have become jammed together, 


bow against stern, stern locked to bow, 

and not a thing is moving, only our diligent pens.


life's spell is so exquisite, everything conspires to break it.   emily dickinson
it wasn't bliss. what was bliss   
but the ordinary life? she'd spend hours   
in patter, moving through whole days   
touching, sniffing, tasting . . . exquisite   
housekeeping in a charmed world.   
and yet there was always   

more of the same, all that happiness,   
the aimless being there.   
so she wandered for a while, bush to arbor,   
lingered to look through a pond's restive mirror.   
he was off cataloging the universe, probably,   
pretending he could organize   
what was clearly someone else's chaos.   

that's when she found the tree,   
the dark, crabbed branches   
bearing up such speechless bounty,   
she knew without being told   
this was forbidden. it wasn't   
a question of ownership--   
who could lay claim to   
such maddening perfection?   

and there was no voice in her head,   
no whispered intelligence lurking   
in the leaves--just an ache that grew   
until she knew she'd already lost everything   
except desire, the red heft of it   
warming her outstretched palm.


who was my teacher at harvard. did not wear overcoat 
saying to me as we walked across the yard 
cold brittle autumn is you should be wearing overcoat. i said 
you are not wearing overcoat. he said, 
you should do as i say not do as i do. 
just how american it was and how late forties it was 
delmore, but not i, was probably aware. he quoted finnegans wake to me 
in his new york apartment sitting on chair 
table directly in front of him. there did he write? i am wondering. 
look at this photograph said of his mother and father. 
coney island. do they look happy? he couldn't figure it out. 
believed pogo to be at the limits of our culture. 
pogo. walt kelly must have read joyce delmore said. 
why don't you ask him? 
why don't you ask walt kelly if he read finnegans wake or not. 
your parents don't look happy but it is just a photograph. 
maybe they felt awkward posing for photographs. 
maybe it is just a bad photograph. delmore is not listening 
i want to hear him tell me something sad but however true. 
delmore in his tomb is sitting. people say yes everyone is dying 
but here read this happy book on the subject. not delmore. not that rueful man.


we visit by phone as the morphine haze   
retreats, late afternoon, most days.   
our mingled past is set against the pin-   
hole lights of cars cruising the blacked-out streets   

we four in the college smoker popping no-doz,   
honors students carrying heavy course loads   
tipped sideways by sex, one by one discarding   
our virginities on the altar of inverse pride,   

ironing our blouses with peter pan collars   
to wear on dates with those -day wonders,   
ensigns in training for the second world war   
in the business school across the charles river. 

we called ourselves the unholy four.   
whenever any three of us met on campus   
we huddled to bray austria russia prussia 
in unison. it came out sounding like horseshit 

post graduation one year, look at us   
my new husband atop your even newer   
one's car singing the bawdy verses   
of roll me over in a drunken tenor   

while the scandalized uncles and aunties   
--it wasn't enough that you'd wed a chinese--   
wrung their hands. you drove off   
trailing just married in two languages.   

now bj is gone, and hettie. you have, they say,   
only days. it is my plan to go with you   
as far as the border. i've been that far--   
did i come back from there morally improved?   

somehow better equipped to support you   
this side of the douane and wave,   
your two cats curled like commas beside you   
as the barrier lifts and you drive on through?


for longer than by now i can believe 

i assumed that you had nothing to do 

with each other i thought you had arrived 

                  whenever that had been 


more solitary than single snowflakes 

with no acquaintance or understanding 

running among you guiding your footsteps 

                  somewhere ahead of me 


in your own time oh white lakes on the maps 

that i copied and gaps on the paper 

for the names that were to appear in them 

                  sometimes a doorway or 


window sometimes an eye sometimes waking 

without knowing the place in the whole night 

i might have guessed from the order in which 

                  you turned up before me 


and from the way i kept looking at you 

as though i recognized something in you 

that you were all words out of one language 

                  tracks of the same creature


in winter 
    all the singing is in 
         the tops of the trees 
             where the wind-bird 

with its white eyes 
    shoves and pushes 
         among the branches. 
             like any of us 

he wants to go to sleep, 
    but he's restless-- 
         he has an idea, 
             and slowly it unfolds 

from under his beating wings 
    as long as he stays awake. 
         but his big, round music, after all, 
             is too breathy to last. 

so, it's over. 
    in the pine-crown 
         he makes his nest, 
             he's done all he can. 

i don't know the name of this bird, 
    i only imagine his glittering beak 
         tucked in a white wing 
             while the clouds-- 

which he has summoned 
    from the north-- 
         which he has taught 
             to be mild, and silent-- 

thicken, and begin to fall 
    into the world below 
         like stars, or the feathers 
               of some unimaginable bird 

that loves us, 
    that is asleep now, and silent-- 
         that has turned itself 
             into snow.


easter was the old north   
goddess of the dawn.   
she rises daily in the east   
and yearly in spring for the great   

paschal candle of the sun.   
her name lingers like a spot   
of gravy in the figured vestment   
of the language of the britains.   

her totem the randy bunny.   
our very thursdays and wednesdays   
are stained by syllables of thunder   
and woden's frenzy.   

o my fellow-patriots loyal to this   
our modern world of high heels,   
vaccination, brain surgery--   
may they pass over us, the old   

jovial raptors, apollonian flayers,   
embodiments. egg-hunt,   
crucifixion. supper of encrypted   
dishes bitter, unrisen, a platter   

compass of martyrdom,   
ground-up apples and walnuts   
in sweet wine to embody mortar   
of affliction, babies for bricks.   

legible traces of the species   
that devises the angel of death   
sailing over our doorpost   
smeared with sacrifice.


in my great grandmother's time,   
all one needed was a broom   
to get to see places   
and give the geese a chase in the sky.   

                

the stars know everything,   
so we try to read their minds.   
as distant as they are,   
we choose to whisper in their presence.   

                

oh cynthia,   
take a clock that has lost its hands   
for a ride.   
get me a room at hotel eternity   
where time likes to stop now and then.   

                

come, lovers of dark corners,   
the sky says,   
and sit in one of my dark corners.   
there are tasty little zeroes   
in the peanut dish tonight.


i   

one snodgrass, two snodgrass, three snodgrass, four . . . 
       i took my own rollcall when i counted seconds   
one two three, two two three, three . . ., the drum score   
       showed only long rests to the tympani's entrance.   

oh-oh-oh leff leff leff-toh-righ-toh-leff,   
       the sergeant cadenced us footsore recruits   
the heart, poor drummer, gone lame, deaf,   
       then awol, gets frogmarched to the noose.   

ii   

old coots, at the veterans', might catch breath   
       if their cheeks got slapped by a nurse's aide,   
then come back to life just so, at their birth,   
       young rumps had been tendered warm accolades.   

the kick-ass rude attitude, smart-assed insult,   
       the acid-fueled book review just might shock   
us back to the brawl like smelling salts,   
       might sting the lulled heart up off its blocks.   

iii   

i thought i'd always favor rubato   
       or syncopation, scorning fixed rhythms   
               thought my old heartthrobs could stand up to stress   
believed one's bloodpump should skip a few beats   
       if it fell into company with sleek young women   
               believed my own bruit could beat with the best.   

wrong again, snodgrass this new gold gadget,   
       snug as the watch on my wife's warm wrist,   
               drives my pulsetempo near twice its old pace--   
go, nonstop startwatch go, clockwork rabbit,   
       keeping this lame old dog synchronized,   
               steady, sparked up, still in the race.


i've watched his eyelids sag, spring open 
   vaguely and gradually go sliding 
      shut again, fly up 
with a kind of drunken surprise, then wobble 
   peacefully together to send him 
      home from one school early. soon his lashes 
flutter in rem sleep. i suppose he's dreaming 
   what all of us kings and poets and peasants 
      have dreamed of not making the grade, 
of draining the inexhaustible horn cup 
   of the cerebral cortex where ganglions 
      are ganging up on us with more connections 
than atoms in heaven, but coming up once more 
   empty. i see a clear stillness 
      settle over his face, a calming of the surface 
of water when the wind dies. somewhere 
   down there, he's taking another course 
      whose resonance let's hope resembles 
the muttered thunder, the gutter bowling, the lightning 
   of minor minions of thor, the groans and gurgling 
      of feral lovers and preliterate mowglis, the songs 
of shamans whistled through bird bones. a worried neighbor 
   gives him the elbow, and he shudders 
      awake, recollects himself, brings back 
his hands from aboriginal outposts, 
   takes in new light, reorganizes his shoes, 
      stands up in them at the buzzer, barely recalls 
his books and notebooks, meets my eyes 
   and wonders what to say and whether to say it, 
      then keeps it to himself as today's lesson.


jerboa on a triple i was in for it,   
my zither on a double looking feeble   

as a promising first book. oedipal & reckless,   
my scheme would fail keep him a couple drinks   

ahead, & perhaps the muse would smile   
upon me with some ses or some blanks.   

january, vermont snowflakes teased the windows   
of the burlington airport bar. the waitress   

tallied tips & channel-surfed above the amber   
stutter of the snowplow's light it couldn't   

keep up, either. visibility to zero, nothing taking off   
& his dulcimer before me  bonus points   

for bingos like a cautionary tale. the night   
before i'd been his warm up act,   

the audience of expensive preppies   
doubling to twenty when he shambled   

to the podium to give them martial   
& his then-new poems. why do you write   

something nobody reads anymore? queried one   
little trust fund in a blazer. because   

i'm willing to be honestly confused   
& honestly fearful. il miglior fabbro,   

a.k.a. prez sweet & fitting honorifics he has left   
upon the living's lips. sweet & fitting too   

that i could know the poems much better than   
the man, flawed as i am told he was. connoisseur   

of word-root & amphibrach, of coltrane   
solo & of california reds, of box score & horatian loss,   

his garrulousness formidable & masking   
a shyness i could never penetrate, meeting him   

would always find me tongue-tied,   
minding my ps & qs, the latter of which   

i could not play, failing three times to draw a u.   
the dead care nothing for our eulogies   

he wrote this many times & well.   
& yet i pray his rumpled daimonion 

shall guide our letters forward   
as they wend the snow-white notebook leaves,   

the stanzas scrolling down the laptop screens.   
game after game & the snow labored on.   

phalanx, bourboned whiteout & the board aglow   
as he'd best me again & again. qintar 

& prosody, the runway lights enshrouded   
& the wind, endquote, shook the panes.


a fortune cookie 
ominous inscrutable chinese news 
to get just before christmas, 
considering my reasonable health, 
marriage spicy as moo-goo-gai-pan, 
career running like a not-too-old chevrolet. 
not bad, considering what can go wrong 
the bony finger of uncle sam 
might point out my husband, 
my own national guard, 
and set him in afghanistan 
my boss could take a personal interest 
the pain in my left knee could spread to my right. 
still, as the old year tips into the new, 
i insist on the infant hope, gooing and kicking 
his legs in the air. i won't give in 
to the dark, the sub-zero weather, the fog,
or even the neighbors' nativity. 
their four-year-old has arranged 
his whole legion of dinosaurs 
so they, too, worship the child, 
joining the cow and sheep. or else, 
ultimate mortals, they've come to eat 
ox and camel, mary and joseph, 
then savor the newborn babe.


map of terror and pleasure, 
ardent junk, passionate congress 
filled with the arguments of chemicals, 

echo chamber for the fanatical cries 
of stubborn generations, all the quaint invisibles 
death has grown a beard on, 

labyrinth of desire, playing field of impulse, 
factory where decay's silent armies clock in, 
philosopher-clown blowing a horn at each epiphany. 

washed by the rough nurse of morning, 
wheeled into the ward of the afternoon, 
feeds, grateful, on the rich broth of dusk. 

reads the erratic cards of dreams, 
turns on the rack of insomnia, 
steals the two-bit grace of sleep. 

loses its name in foreign embraces, 
forges a passport to the country of   tenderness, 
gestures like a child at the thing that it   wants, 
opaque from its own breath on the glass.


for ira
with the seal of science 

emblazoned 

on your forehead, 

like the old good housekeeping 

seal of approval, 

i believe what you tell me 

about cells and molecules, 

though i can't see them. 


and though the language you speak 

is full of numbers and symbols 

i'll never understand 

though your tie is askew 

and your hair unruly, still i believe 

what you say about the size of the universe, 

which is either expanding or contracting, 

i've forgotten which already. 


so if tomorrow you tell me 

you made a small miscalculation, 

that god indeed created the world 

in  short days, then rested on the th, 

that it was eve who landed us 

in all this trouble, i would believe you. 

i would believe you 

as i've always done before.


my son's been learning time big hand 
and little, powers of sixty 
and of twenty-four, the slow semaphore 
of days. he's brought home paper plates 
from kindergarten, arrows pointing 
at his favorite hours. so far 
the face of every clock has smiled. 

and before we read to sleep each night 
he crosses off another square 
on the calendar above his bed, 
counting down to christmas or to nothing 
in particular, sometimes just a line 
he draws uphill or down, check marks 
like the ones his teacher leaves 

on sheets he's filled with capitals 
and lower cases, other times a pair 
of thick lines like the crossed bones 
on a pirate's flag, an x 
as if to mark the treasure buried 
in some ordinary week, 
no day yet a cross to bear.


day and night, the lake dreams of sky. 
a privacy as old as the mountains 
and her up there, stuck among peaks. the   whole eye 

fastened on hawk, gatherings of cloud or stars, 
so little trespass. an airplane once 
crossed her brow she searched but could not find 

a face. having lived with such strict beauty 
she comes to know how the sun is nothing 
but itself and the path it throws the moon 

a riddled stone. if only a hand 
would tremble along her cheek, would disturb. even the elk 
pass by, drawn to the spill of creeks below-- 

how she cannot help abundance, even as it leaves 
her, as it sings all the way down the mountain.


philosophic 
in its complex, ovoid emptiness, 
a skillful pundit coined it as a sort 
       of stopgap doorstop for those 
                     quaint equations 

                     romans never 
dreamt of. in form completely clever 
and discrete--a mirror come unsilvered, 
       loose watch face without the works, 
                     a hollowed globe 

                     from tip to toe 
unbroken, it evades the grappling 
hooks of mass, tilts the thin rim of no thing, 
      remains embryonic sum, 
                   non-cogito.


as a boy he played alone in the fields   
behind our block, six frame houses   
holding six immigrant families,   
the parents speaking only gibberish   
to their neighbors. without the kids   
they couldn't say good morning and be   
understood. little wonder   
he learned early to speak to himself,   
to tell no one what truly mattered.   
how much can matter to a kid   
of seven? everything. the whole world   
can be his. just after dawn he sneaks   
out to hide in the wild, bleached grasses   
of august and pretends he's grown up,   
someone complete in himself without   
the need for anyone, a warrior   
from the ancient places our fathers   
fled years before, those magic places   
kiev, odessa, the crimea,   
port said, alexandria, lisbon,   
the canaries, caracas, galveston.   
in the damp grass he recites the names   
over and over in a hushed voice   
while the sun climbs into the locust tree   
to waken the houses. the husbands leave   
for work, the women return to bed, the kids   
bend to porridge and milk. he advances   
slowly, eyes fixed, an animal or a god,   
while beneath him the earth holds its breath.


take hold of the bitter end 
pass carefully around 
the standing part, 
being mindful of the bight. 
finish with a round turn, 
make the knot up tight 
and it will not slip under load. 

but you'll find it not 
so easily undone 
dangerous in the dark and cold 
and wet, when it matters most. 
these knots command allegiances. 

the turk's head and midshipman's bend, 
the lighterman's hitch and 
the hangman's noose. 
see what names mean 
knots are men. 

facing page--a simple eye-splice. 
apply a whipping at the end 
so no strands come loose 
in the braid. the knot will hold 
anything you care to bind.


there is a heaviness between us,   
nameless, raised from the void, that counts out the sprung hours.   
what ash has it come to purify?   
what disappearance, like water, does it lift up to the clouds?   

god of my fathers, but not of mine,   
you are a part, it is said, an afterthought, a scattered one.   
there is a disappearance between us as heavy as dirt.   
what figure of earth and clay would it have me become?   

sunday again, january thaw back big time.   
the knock-kneed, overweight boys and girls   
sit on the sun-warmed concrete sidewalk outside the pharmacy   
smoking their dun-filtered cigarettes.   

nothing is bothering them--and their nicotine dreams--   
this afternoon. everything's weightless,   
as insubstantial as smoke.   
nothing is disappearing in their world. arrival is all.   

there is a picture of yves klein leaping out of a window   
above a cobblestone paris street.   
a man on a bicycle peddles away toward the distance.   
one of them's you, the other is me.   

cut out of the doctored photograph, however, the mesh net   
right under the swan-diving body.   
cut out of another print, the black-capped, ever-distancing cyclist, as well as the mesh net.   
hmm . . . and there you have it, two-fingered sleight-of-hand man.   

one loses one's center in the air, trying to stay afloat,   
doesn't one? snowfalling metaphors.   
unbidden tears, the off-size of small apples. unshed.   
and unshedable.   

such heaviness. the world has come and lies between us.   
such distance. ungraspable.   
ash and its disappearance--   
unbearable absence of being,   
                                           tonto, then taken back.


rent a flatbed with a winch. 
with the right leverage 
anything can be hoisted, driven off. 

or the man with a bobcat comes in, 
then the hauler with his enormous truck. 
a leveler or a lawyer does the rest 

experts always are willing to help. 
the structure was old, rotten in spots. 
hadn't it already begun to implode? 

believe you've just sped the process up. 
photographs, toys, the things that break 
your heart--let's trust 

they would have been removed, 
perhaps are safe with the children 
who soon will have children of their own. 

it's over. it's time for loss to build 
its tower in the yard where you 
are merely a spectator now. 

admit you'd like to find something 
discarded or damaged, even gone, 
and lift it back into the world.


what am i to you now that you are no   
longer what you used to be to me?   

who are we to each other now that   
there is no us, now that what we once   

were is divided into me and you   
who are not one but two separate and   

unrelated persons except for that ex-   
that goes in front of the words   

that used to mean me, used to mean   
you, words we rarely used husband, wife   

as when we once posed so young and helpless   
with our hands yours, mine clasped on the knife   

that was sinking into the tall white cake.   
all that sweetness, the layers of one thing

and then another, and then one thing again.


i found it in the wash, the orange 
shell i picked up on the beach 
that last time. one of my girls-- 
the one named after you-- 

must have found it in my room 
and wanted it. clean calcareous 
curve, a palm open to nothing, 
reeking of sunshine 

and your death. for years 
i didn't know what to do with it. 
you would have liked 
this story how a child 

slips grief into a careless pocket. 
breaks it to pieces. lets it go.


i acknowledge my status as a stranger   
inappropriate clothes, odd habits   
out of sync with wasp and wren.   
i admit i don't know how   
to sit still or move without purpose.   
i prefer books to moonlight, statuary to trees.   

but this lawn has been leveled for looking,   
so i kick off my sandals and walk its cool green.   
who claims we're mere muscle and fluids?   
my feet are the primitives here.   
as for the rest--ah, the air now   
is a tonic of absence, bearing nothing   
but news of a breeze.


the leaves had fallen in that sullen place, 
but none around him knew just where they were. 
the sky revealed no sun. a ragged blur 
remained where each man's face had been a face. 

two angels soon crept forth with trays of bread, 
circling among the lost like prison guards. 
love is not love, unless its will affords 
forgiveness for the words that are not said. 

still he could not believe that this was hell, 
that others sent before him did not know 
yet, once his name and memory grew faint, 
it was no worse, perhaps, than a cheap motel. 
it is the love of failure makes a saint. 
he stood up then, but did not try to go.


for carol rigolot
  
        when deeds splay before us 
precious as gold & unused chances 
stripped from the whine-bone, 
we know the moment kindheartedness 
walks in. each praise be 
echoes us back as the years uncount 
themselves, eating salt. though blood 
first shaped us on the climbing wheel, 
the human mind lit by the savanna's 
ice star & thistle rose, 
your knowing gaze enters a room 
& opens the day, 
saying we were made for fun. 
even the bedazzled brute knows 
when sunlight falls through leaves 
across honed knives on the table. 
if we can see it push shadows 
aside, growing closer, are we less 
broken? a barometer, temperature 
gauge, a ruler in minus fractions 
& pedigrees, a thingmajig, 
a probe with an all-seeing eye, 
what do we need to measure 
kindness, every unheld breath, 
every unkind leapyear? 
sometimes a sober voice is enough 
to calm the waters & drive away 
the false witnesses, saying, look, 
here are the broken treaties beauty 
brought to us earthbound sentinels.


pindar, poet of the victories, fitted names   
and legends into verses for the chorus to sing   
names recalled now only in the poems of pindar   

o nearly unpronounceable immortals,   
in the dash, oionos was champion   
oionos, likmynios's son, who came from midea.   
in wrestling, echemos won--the name   
of his home city, tegea, proclaimed to the crowds.   
doryklos of tiryns won the prize in boxing,   
and the record for a four-horse team was set   
by samos from mantinea, halirothios's son.   

and pindar, poet of the olympian and isthmian   
and pythian games, wrote also of the boundless   
and forgetful savannas of time. what is someone? 
the chorus sing in a victory ode--what is a nobody? 

creatures of a day, they chant in answer, creatures   
of a day. so where is the godgiven glory pindar says   
settles on mortals?--bright as gold among the substances,   
say the chorus, paramount as water among the elements.   

not in the victory itself, petty or great,   
of rich young greeks contending in games.   
not in the poetry itself, with its forgotten dances   
and pindar spinning among tiresome or stirring   
myths and genealogies, the chanted names   
of cities and invoked gods and dignitaries--   

striving, o nearly unpronounceable athletes,   
to animate the air with dancing feet raising   
a golden pollen of dust a pervasive blur   
of seedlets in the sunlight, whirling--beyond mere   
victory or applause or performance,   
as victory is beyond defeat.   

the one who threw the javelin furthest   
sang the chorus, chanting pindar's incantation   
against envy and oblivion, was phrastor.   
and when nikeus grunting whirled the stone   
into the air and it flew past the marks   
of all the competitors, nikeus's countrymen   
shouted his name after it, nikeus,   
nikeus, and the syllables so say the lines pindar   
composed for the sweating chorus to chant--radiated   
for a spell like the silvery mirror of the moon.


for the person who obtained my debit card number and spent , in five days
my pale stepdaughter, just off the school bus,   
scowled, well, that's the last time i say my name's   
snodgrass just so, may that anonymous   
mexican male who prodigally claims   

my clan lines, identity and the sixteen   
digits that unlock my bank account,   
think twice. that less than proper name's been   
taken by three ex-wives, each for an amount   

past all you've squandered, each more than pleased   
to change it back. that surname you affect   
may have more consequence than getting teased   
by dumb kids or tracked down by bank detectives.   

don't underrate its history one of ours played   
piano on his prison's weekly broadcast   
one got rich on a scammed quiz show one made   
a bungle costing the world series. my own past   

could subject you to guilt by association   
if you write anything more than false checks,   
abandon all hope of large press publication   
or prizes--critics shun the name like sex 

without a condom. whoever steals my purse   
helps chain me to my writing desk again   
for fun and profit. so take thanks with my curse   
may your pen name help send you to your pen.


as the light goes, go. 
be the rustling in the grass, the fall from 
convention's good graces learn, or someone 
will have you filing files or writing writs, 
demonstrating cutlery or selling knowledge 

door to door someone might even drop 
your lovely life into a factory and have you 
derusting rings on the coolant-spouting 
turntable of a vertical lathe. 
it's best for everyone that what you know 

is generally thought of as general knowledge. 
you can find it in pool rooms and roadside bars, 
in meadows as inviting as beds, in bedrooms 
where it whispers like a ribbon untying 
you can even find it in schools. but be careful 

it's dangerous, inescapable and exact 
down to every atom of everything there is, 
to every name each thing goes by and every 
law each thing obeys. and the best part is, 
you always know more than you know.


aren't you glad at least that the earthworms   
under the grass are ignorant, as they eat the earth,   
of the good they confer on us, that their silence   
isn't a silent reproof for our bad manners,   
our never casting earthward a crumb of thanks   
for their keeping the soil from packing so tight   
that no root, however determined, could pierce it?   

imagine if they suspected how much we owe them,   
how the weight of our debt would crush us   
even if they enjoyed keeping the grass alive,   
the garden flowers and vegetables, the clover,   
and wanted nothing that we could give them,   
not even the merest nod of acknowledgment.   
a debt to angels would be easy in comparison,   
bright, weightless creatures of cloud, who serve   
an even brighter and lighter master.   

lucky for us they don't know what they're doing,   
these puny anonymous creatures of dark and damp   
who eat simply to live, with no more sense of mission   
than nature feels in providing for our survival.   
better save our gratitude for a friend   
who gives us more than we can give in return   
and never hints she's waiting for reciprocity.   

if i had nickel, i'd give it to you,   
the lover says, who, having nothing available   
in the solid, indicative world, scrapes up   
a coin or two in the world of the subjunctive.   
a nickel with a hole drilled in the top   
so you can fasten it to your bracelet, a charm   
to protect you against your enemies.   

for his sake, she'd wear it, not for her own,   
so he might believe she's safe as she saunters   
home across the field at night, the moon above her,   
below her the loam, compressed by the soles of her loafers,   
and the tunneling earthworms, tireless, silent,   
as they persist, oblivious, in their service.


a stay of execution one last day, 
your day, old everydog, then, as they say, 
or as we say a new trick to avoid 
finalities implicit in destroyed, 
you have to be put down, or put to sleep-- 
the very dog who, once, would fight to keep 
from putting down, despite our shouts, a shoe 
until he gnawed it to the sole, and who 
would sit up, through our sleepless nights, to bark 
away some menace looming in the dark. 

can you pick up the sense of all this talk? 
or do you still just listen for a walk, 
or else, the ultimate reward, a car?-- 
my god, tomorrow's ride . . . well, here we are, 
right now. you stare at me and wag your tail. 
i stare back, dog-like, big and dumb. words fail. 
no more commands, ignore my monologue, 
go wander off. good dog. you're a good dog. 
and you could never master, anyway, 
the execution, as it were, of stay


the hounds, you know them all by name. 
you fostered them from purblind whelps 
at their dam's teats, and you have come 
to know the music of their yelps 

high-strung anthee, the brindled bitch, 
the blue-tick coated philomel, 
and freckled chloe, who would fetch 
a pretty price if you would sell-- 

all fleet of foot, and swift to scent, 
inexorable once on the track, 
like angry words you might have meant, 
but do not mean, and can't take back. 

there was a time when you would brag 
how they would bay and rend apart 
the hopeless belling from a stag. 
you falter now for the foundered hart. 

desires you nursed of a winter night-- 
did you know then why you bred them-- 
whose needling milk-teeth used to bite 
the master's hand that leashed and fed them?


i know my friend is going, 
though she still sits there 
across from me in the restaurant,   
and leans over the table to dip 
her bread in the oil on my plate i know   
how thick her hair used to be,   
and what it takes for her to discard 
her man's cap partway through our meal,   
to look straight at the young waiter   
and smile when he asks 
how we are liking it. she eats 
as though starving--chicken, dolmata,   
the buttery flakes of filo-- 
and what's killing her 
eats, too. i watch her lift 
a glistening black olive and peel   
the meat from the pit, watch 
her fine long fingers, and her face,   
puffy from medication. she lowers   
her eyes to the food, pretending 
not to know what i know. she's going.   
and we go on eating.


the message i found on the post-it note 
went thus love truth expect to be found out. 
kid-style capitals proved i wrote it, but 
left no clue why i'd swelled into a fat 

clause no editor could edit then, an entry 
on a shrink's list of patient slang for sex-- 
her desk norwegian teak, the mug of tea 
on which she had affixed her post-it notes 

hot against her knuckle, their lips of stickum 
loosening . . . and yet, i knew the note 
to peel away at hour's end would terminate 
our sessions--cool as the draft her linen 

skirt was lifting to love, just stay benighted,  
given everything i know you've got to hide. 


for fred
i could pick anything and think of you--   
this lamp, the wind-still rain, the glossy blue   
my pen exudes, drying matte, upon the page.   
i could choose any hero, any cause or age   
and, sure as shooting arrows to the heart,   
astride a dappled mare, legs braced as far apart   
as standing in silver stirrups will allow--   
there you'll be, with furrowed brow   
and chain mail glinting, to set me free   
one eye smiling, the other firm upon the enemy.   

this post-postmodern age is all business compact disks   
and faxes, a do-it-now-and-take-no-risks   
event. today a hurricane is nudging up the coast,   
oddly male big bad floyd, who brings a host   
of daydreams awkward reminiscences   
of teenage crushes on worthless boys   
whose only talent was to kiss you senseless.   
they all had sissy names--marcel, percy, dewey   
were thin as licorice and as chewy,   
sweet with a dark and hollow center. floyd's   

cussing up a storm. you're bunkered in your   
aerie, i'm perched in mine   
twin desks, computers, hardwood floors   
we're content, but fall short of the divine.   
still, it's embarrassing, this happiness--   
who's satisfied simply with what's good for us,   
when has the ordinary ever been news?   
and yet, because nothing else will do   
to keep me from melancholy call it blues,   
i fill this stolen time with you.


it may be esoteric and perverse 
 that i consult pythagoras to hear 
 a music tuning in the universe. 
 my interest in his math of star and sphere 
 has triggered theorems too far-fetched to solve. 
 they don't add up. but if i rack and toil 
 more in ether than a mortal coil, 
 it is to comprehend how you revolve, 
 by formulas of orbit, ellipse, and ring. 

 dear son and daughter, if i seem to range 
 it is to chart the numbers spiraling 
 between my life and yours until the strange 
 and seamless beauty of equations click 
 solutions for the heart's arithmetic.


geneticist as driver, down the gene 
codes in, let's say, a topless coupe 
and you keep expecting bends, 

real tyre-testers on tight 
mountain passes, but instead it's dead 
straight, highway as runway, 

helix unravelled as vista, 
as vanishing point. keep your foot 
down. this is a finite desert. 

you move too fast to read it, 
the order of the rocks, the cacti, 
roadside weeds, a blur to you. 

every hour or so, you pass a shack 
which passes for a motel here 
tidy faded rooms with tvs on 

for company, the owner pacing out 
his empty parking lot. and after 
each motel you hit a sandstorm 

thick as fog, but agony. 
somewhere out there are remnants 
of our evolution, genes for how 

to fly south, sense a storm, 
hunt at night, how to harden 
your flesh into hide or scales. 

these are the miles of dead code. 
every desert has them. 
you are on a mission to discover 

why the human heart still slows 
when divers break the surface, 
why mermaids still swim in our dreams.


most of the things you made for me--blanket- 
chest, lapdesk, the armless rocker--i gave 
away to friends who could use them and not 
be reminded of the hours lost there, 
not having been witness to those designs, 
the tedious finishes. but i did keep 
the mirror, perhaps because like all mirrors, 
most of these years it has been invisible, 
part of the wall, or defined by reflection-- 
safe--because reflection, after all, does change. 
i hung it here in the front, dark hallway 
of this house you will never see, so that 
it might magnify the meager light, 
become a lesser, backward window. no one 
pauses long before it. but this morning, 
as i put on my overcoat, then straightened 
my hair, i saw outside my face its frame 
you made for me, admiring for the first 
time the way the cherry you cut and planed 
yourself had darkened, just as you said it would.


i wake to the sound of water, and think, 
mother has died and gone to france, 
she is at un autre htel, speaking french 
better than ever, while i stare at the fog 
that has a river in it--the broad dordogne, 
making its river noise, as if all the faucets 
have been left on all night. the river 
rushing in one direction only, so different 
from blackfish creek, where the sea floods in 
and back, scrubbing the sand both ways. 

well, one travels so things are different. 
american actors speak french on tv here. 
last night they showed accident catastrophe 
about two babies switched in the hospital at birth. 
one dies. the parents discover the dead child 
was someone else's and their child is alive 
in florida with son pre, though sa mre 
est morte de some disease, who knows? 

anyway, ed asner, who plays the lawyer, 
speaks gravelly french, but people have 
an american demeanor, they pull their hair 
on the edge of violence. then each family 
gives up a piece, and the child ends up more 
loved than ever, as if it's inevitable. 
or so the river is telling me 
with its one-way simplicity, 
like gravity. alive in the eternal 
heart of france--that's mother 
i'm thinking about, for some reason, 

maybe the journal my wife's been keeping, 
so like the daily letters mother wrote 
to sa mre et son pre, when her life 
was flowing through her like the broad 
dordogne. and where is she now? 
does she wish my father were with her, 
one of him alive, and one with her? 
a bell is ringing wildly, each of its peals 
like a round boat rolling downstream 
where the river divides around an island 
only to sweep back into itself 
somewhere in the fog.


a history of some sort, one that made us, 
a war and what the war had meant, or since 
meaning eludes war, what it did to the look 
of the trees and the sides of the buildings, 
most of which survived, only to be torn down 
later to widen the street or put up a new 
office complex. there it was on the shelf. 
i was there only a moment, but still, 
i wanted to know what happened to the man 
in the photograph wearing a flat cap 
standing outside the important building 
cheering. he was there. he was part of that 
moment, one of the first into the streets 
when the turn of events came, the declaration 
or pronouncement, words that would change 
the look of everything he smiled on, words 
that may have cost him his life. here it is 
in a book i found on a shelf. the person 
who lives here bought it at a library 
stock reduction sale. no one had read it. 
it looked interesting thirty years ago. 
it was practically new, the back uncracked. 
but the person did what those before her had, 
put it up on a shelf and never found 
a way back to it. the history sits there, 
unread, unbelievable, somebody else's. 
even i have only looked at the pictures, 
at the man smiling between the cold pages. 
maybe ending the world as he knew it 
was ok. maybe it was the only way. 
maybe the world has to come to an end 
in the first place to be the world. and the man? 
he has to smile, though he knows so little 
of what's coming, even looking right at it. 
as we do, who still haven't read the book.


just a shadow. hardly that. but audible. 
coming out of the woods, whispering 
happily ever after. 
                          even in that light-- 
stars with the skeletons of animals 
and old friends-- 
                       visible 
to the eye behind the one always 
left open on the east side of the house, 
downhill. where the coffee trees 
and hemp and the graves of old dogs lie, 
buried themselves in leaves and left 
to the sputtering wind of memory. 

& if that's not enough he says 
to himself in the voice of a black-and-white 
actor whose name is a moth that keeps 
avoiding the tip of his flaming tongue 
to bring you home, well, there 
it is again, 
              already exhausted 
by your efforts to make it 
comfortable 
enough to stay. impatient, 
                                   already headed 
back down into the woods, whispering 
once upon a time . . . 


i go down to the edge of the sea. 
how everything shines in the morning light 
the cusp of the whelk, 
the broken cupboard of the clam, 
the opened, blue mussels, 
moon snails, pale pink and barnacle scarred-- 
and nothing at all whole or shut, but tattered, split, 
dropped by the gulls onto the gray rocks and all the moisture gone. 
it's like a schoolhouse 
of little words, 
thousands of words. 
first you figure out what each one means by itself, 
the jingle, the periwinkle, the scallop 
       full of moonlight. 

then you begin, slowly, to read the whole story.


isn't the moon dark too,   
most of the time?   

and doesn't the white page   
seem unfinished   

without the dark stain   
of alphabets?   

when god demanded light,   
he didn't banish darkness.   

instead he invented   
ebony and crows   

and that small mole   
on your left cheekbone.   

or did you mean to ask   
why are you sad so often?   

ask the moon.   
ask what it has witnessed.


when you are already here 

you appear to be only 

a name that tells of you 

whether you are present or not 


and for now it seems as though 

you are still summer 

still the high familiar 

endless summer 

yet with a glint 

of bronze in the chill mornings 

and the late yellow petals 

of the mullein fluttering 

on the stalks that lean 

over their broken 

shadows across the cracked ground 


but they all know 

that you have come 

the seed heads of the sage 

the whispering birds 

with nowhere to hide you 

to keep you for later 


you 

who fly with them 


you who are neither 

before nor after 

you who arrive 

with blue plums 

that have fallen through the night 


perfect in the dew


if you believe in the magic of language, 
then elvis really lives 
and princess diana foretold i end as car spin. 

if you believe the letters themselves 
contain a power within them, 
then you understand 
what makes outside tedious, 
how desperation becomes a rope ends it. 

the circular logic that allows senator to become treason, 
and treason to become atoners. 

that eleven plus two is twelve plus one, 
and an admirer is also married. 

that if you could just rearrange things the right way 
you'd find your true life, 
the right path, the answer to your questions 
you'd understand how the titanic 
turns into that ice tin, 
and debit card becomes bad credit. 

how listen is the same as silent, 
and not one letter separates stained from sainted.


for kenneth koch
you don't need a pony   
to connect you to the unseeable   
or an airplane to connect you to the sky.   

necessary it is to love to live   
and there are many manuals   
but in all important ways   
one is on one's own.   

you need not cut off your hand.   
no need to eat a bouquet.   
your head becomes a peach pit.   
your tongue a honeycomb.   

necessary it is to live to love,   
to charge into the burning tower   
then charge back out   
and necessary it is to die.   
even for the trees, even for the pony   
connecting you to what can't be grasped.   

the injured gazelle falls behind the   
herd. one last wild enjambment.   

because of the sores in his mouth,   
the great poet struggles with a dumpling.   
his work has enlarged the world   
but the world is about to stop including him.   
he is the tower the world runs out of.   

when something becomes ash,   
there's nothing you can do to turn it back.   
about this, even diamonds do not lie.


we are tender and our lives are sweet 

and they are already over and we are 
visiting them in some kind of endless 
reprieve from oblivion, we are walking 
around in them and after we shatter 
with love for everything we settle in. 

thou tiger on television chowing, 
thou very fact of dreams, thou majestical 
roof fretted with golden fire. thou wisdom 
of the inner parts. thou tintinnabulation. 

is it not sweet to hand over the ocean's 
harvest in a single wave of fish? to bounce 
a vineyard of grapes from one's apron 
and into the mouth of the crowd? to scoop up 
bread and offer up one's armful to the throng? 
let us live as if we were still among 

the living, let our days be patterned after 
theirs. is it not marvelous to be forgetful?


i don't know how it happened, but i fell--   
and i was immense, one dislocated arm   
wedged between two buildings. i felt some ribs   
had broken, perhaps a broken neck, too   
i couldn't speak. my dress caught bunched   
about my thighs, and where my glasses shattered   
there'd spread something like a seacoast, or maybe   
it was a port. where my hair tangled with power lines   
i felt a hot puddle of blood.   
                                                   i must have passed out,   
but when i woke, a crew of about fifty   
was building a winding stairway beside my breast   
and buttressing a platform on my sternum.   
i heard, as through cotton, the noise of hammers,   
circular saws, laughter, and some radio   
droning songs about love. out the corner   
of one eye i could open one eye a bit i saw   
my pocketbook, its contents scattered, my lipstick's   
toppled silo glinting out of reach.   
and then, waving a tiny flashlight, a man   
entered my ear. i felt his boots sloshing   
the blood trickling there. he never came out.   
so some went looking, with flares, dogs, dynamite   
even they burst my middle ear and found   
my skull, its cavern crammed with dark matter   
like a cross between a fungus and a cloud.   
they never found his body, though. and they never   
found or tried to find an explanation,   
i think, for me they didn't seem to need one.   
even now my legs subdue that dangerous   
sea, the water bright enough to cut   
the skin, where a lighthouse, perched on the tip   
of my great toe, each eight seconds rolls   
another flawless pearl across the waves.   
it keeps most ships from wrecking against my feet.   
on clear days, people stand beside the light   
they watch the waves' blue heads slip up and down   
and scan for landmarks on the facing shore.

what's unseen may not exist--   
or so those secret powers insist   
            that prowl past nightfall,   
enabled by the brain's blacklist   
            to fester out of sight,   

so we streak from bad to worse,   
through an expanding universe   
            and see no evil.   
on my rounds like a night nurse   
            or sentry on qui vive,   

i make, through murkier hours, my way   
where the sun patrolled all day   
            toward stone-blind midnight   
to poke this flickering flashlamp's ray   
            at what's hushed up and hidden.   

lacking all leave or protocol,   
things, one by one, hear my footfall,   
            blank out their faces,   
dodge between trees, find cracks in walls   
            or lock down offices.   

still, though scuttling forces flee   
just as far stars recede from me   
            to outmost boundaries,   
i stalk through ruins and debris,   
            graveyard and underground.   

led by their helmetlantern's light   
miners inch through anthracite   
            i'm the unblinking mole   
that sniffs out what gets lost or might   
            slip down the world's black hole.

ending his rounds, the watchman, somewhat tipsy, returns 

what's obscene?--just our obsessed,   
incessant itch and interest   
      in things found frightful   
in bestial tortures, rape, incest   
      in ripe forbidden fruit   

dangling, lush, just out of reach   
dim cellars nailed up under each   
      towering success,   
the loser's envy that will teach   
      a fierce vindictiveness,   

the victors' high court that insures   
pardon for winners and procures   
      little that's needed   
but all we lust for. what endures?--   
      exponential greed   

and trash containers overflowing   
with shredded memos, records showing   
      what, who, when, why   
'til there's no sure way of knowing   
      what's clear to every eye   

the heart's delight in hatred, runny   
as the gold drip from combs of honey   
      the rectal intercourse   
of power politics and money   
      that slimes both goal and source.   

what's obscured?--what's abscessed.   
after inspection, i'd suggest   
      it's time we got our head   
rewired. i plan to just get pissed,   
      shitfaced and brain-dead.


never anymore in a wash of sweetness and awe   
does the summer when i was seventeen come back   
to mind against my will, like a bird crossing   

my vision. summer of moist nights full of girls   
and boys ripened, holy drunkenness and violation   
of the comic boundaries, defiances that never   

failed or brought disaster. days on the backs   
and in the breath of horses, between rivers   
and pools that reflected the cicadas' whine,   

enervation and strength creeping in smooth waves   
over muscular water. all those things accepted,   
once, with unnoticing hunger, as an infant   

accepts the nipple, never come back to mind   
against the will. what comes unsummoned now,   
blotting out every other thought and image,   

is a part of the past not so deep or far away   
the time of poverty, of struggle to find means   
not hateful--the muddy seedtime of early manhood.   

what returns are those moments in the diner   
night after night with each night's one cup of coffee,   
watching an old man, who always at the same hour   

came in and smiled, ordered his tea and opened   
his drawing pad. what did he fill it with?   
and where's he gone? those days, that studious worker,   

hand moving and eyes eager in the sour light,   
that artist always in the same worn-out suit,   
are my nostalgia now. that old man comes back,   

the friend i saw each day and never spoke to,   
because i hoped soon to disappear from there,   
as i have disappeared, into the heaven of better days.


after george herbert 
this tiny ruin in my eye, small 
flaw in the fabric, little speck 
of blood in the egg, deep chip 
in the windshield, north star, 
polestar, floater that doesn't 
float, spot where my hand is not, 
even when i'm looking at my hand, 
little piton that nails every rock 
i see, no matter if the picture 
turns to sand, or sand to sea, 
i embrace you, piece of absence 
that reminds me what i will be, 
all dark some day unless god 
rescues me, oh speck 
that might teach me yet to see.


little has been made   
of the soft, skirting action   
of magnets reversed,   
while much has been   
made of attraction.   
but is it not this pillowy   
principle of repulsion   
that produces the   
doily edges of oceans   
or the arabesques of thought?   
and do these cutout coasts   
and incurved rhetorical beaches   
not baffle the onslaught   
of the sea or objectionable people   
and give private life   
what small protection it's got?   
praise then the oiled motions   
of avoidance, the pearly   
convolutions of all that   
slides off or takes a   
wide berth praise every   
eddying vacancy of earth,   
all the dimpled depths   
of pooling space, the whole   
swirl set up by fending-off--   
extending far beyond the personal,   
i'm convinced--   
immense and good   
in a cosmological sense   
unpressing us against   
each other, lending   
the necessary never 
to never-ending.


put an ear to the light at fall 
of dark and you will hear 
nothing. this pale luminescence 
that drifts in upon them 
makes a blue bole of their caves, 
a scare of their scything 
tails. they tell 
in the bubbling dark of images 
that come in upon them 
when light spreads like an oil slick 
and sea fans 
that once were their refuge 
turn away. 
now there is no dark 
dark enough for their silver tails, 
scatter of color 
like coins massively 
piling in the lap of a miser 
that was, in the day, their pride. 
how hugely here we belong. 
this is their song 
in the silting 
drift of the reef. 
they have never seen the moon 
nor the black scut of night, stars 
spread like plankton 
in their beastly infinities.


there is one mind in all of us, one soul, 
    who parches the soil in some nations 

but in others hides perpetually behind a veil 
    he spills light everywhere, here he spilled 

some on my tie, but it dried before dinner ended. 
    he is in charge of darkness also, also 

in charge of crime, in charge of the imagination. 
    people fucking do so by flicking him 

off and on, off and on, with their eyelids 
    as they ascertain their love's sincerity. 

he makes the stars disappear, but he makes 
    small stars everywhere, on the hoods of cars, 

in the ommatea of skyscrapers or in the eyes 
    of sighing lovers bored with one another. 

onto the surface of the world he stamps 
    all plants and animals. they are not gods 

but it is he who made us worshippers of every   
    bramble toad, black chive we find. 

in idaho there is a desert cricket that makes 
    a clock-like tick-tick when he flies, but he 

is not a god. the only god is the sun, 
    our mind, master of all crickets and clocks.


you change a life 
as eating an artichoke changes the taste 
of whatever is eaten after. 
yet you are not an artichoke, not a piano or cat--
not objectively present at all--
and what of you a cat possesses is essential but narrow 
to know if the distance between two things can be leapt. 
the piano, that good servant, 
has none of you in her at all, she lends herself 
to what asks this has been my ambition as well. 
yet a person who has you is like an iron spigot 
whose water comes from far-off mountain springs. 
inexhaustible, your confident pronouncements flow, 
coldly delicious. 
for if judgment hurts the teeth, it doesn't mind, 
not judgment. teeth pass. pain passes. 
judgment decrees what remains--
the serene judgments of evolution or the judgment 
of a boy-king entering persia burn it, he says, 
and it burns. and if a small tear swells the corner 
of one eye, it is only the smoke, it is no more to him than a beetle 
fleeing the flames of the village with her six-legged children. 
the biologist haldane--in one of his tenderer moments--
judged beetles especially loved by god, 
because he had made so many. for judgment can be tender 
i have seen you carry a fate to its end as softly as a retriever 
carries the quail. yet however much 
i admire you at such moments, i cannot love you
you are too much in me, weighing without pity your own worth. 
when i have erased you from me entirely, 
disrobed of your measuring adjectives, 
stripped from my shoulders and hips each of your nouns, 
when the world is horsefly, coal barge, and dawn the color of winter butter--
not beautiful, not cold, only the color of butter--
then perhaps i will love you. helpless to not. 
as a newborn wolf is helpless no choice but hunt the wolf milk, 
find it sweet.


has crawled out of the ocean   
to carry us from sleep, like sleep,   

the gray of outer sunset portending   
the gray of inner sunset. and so on.   

on the n, one should invent   
intricate fictions for the lives   

of the passengers time is a game.   
soon we will be underground.   

but first, the long lush green   
of duboce park, the happiness of dogs   

good-bye now to their owners   
eyeing one another. good-bye   

to the park's locked men's room,   
where once a man was found dead,   

his penis shoved into his own mouth.   
the world continues, the engine   

of the world the letter n.


down in the blue-green water   
       at nightfall some selving shapes   
float fluorescing, trance-dancing,   
       trembling to the rhythm of   
theodoxical marching-   
       music that they hear over   
the mere noise of the breaking   
       tide. above, stars in certain   
places along the shore roads,   
       cars carrying people on   
uncertain errands, sordid   
       and sacred and all the kinds   
in between. halogen-lit,   
       a woman gets down from her   
all-wheel-drive velocipede,   
       enters through an obeying   
door a cyclopean store   
       to buy unintelligent   
fresh fish and other objects   
       whether formerly alive   
or formerly dead, she comes   
       out again, a poor man calls   
to her, selling his no-news-   
       paper the disastrous head-   
lines smile and nod, they announce   
       the plans of steel patriots   
and undertakers, ad-men   
       and fallen vice-generals,   
doping their stolen crusades.   
       but the woman has learned, as   
i have learned, as all of us   
       must keep learning if we are   
to be good subjects, how to   
       make of a newspaper the   
mask of a locust, calmly   
       put it on, and begin once   
more to eat everything up.


knots, a thousand lights, in   
   sheer dark, aimed at my window,   
tinny crystals, so mother dies   
   in my sleep. the snow turns   
coarse, goes out. an axe sounds   
   where i'd never heard an axe before.   
breathing becomes dangerous. i can't   
   help it, making me her, even   
before i was born, her brain burning   
   out patterns i follow like will   
o' the wisps, sparks popping.   
   i put on heels and find i can balance,   
twist my spine, bend to get my seams   
   straight on my own, no one to   
call on, like she called me, sheer nylon   
   turning on sheer skin under my palms.   
i pull on the ratty musquash coat.   
   i have the body. i move off in it,   
eddying, trying to see who i am now.   
   i totter down the street thinking,   
one day he'll be sorry. and here i am.   
   sorry. i watch her getting smaller   
up the road. i watch us both, till   
   nothing's all there is. 


and blush for a cheek of stone.   

      blush for the lips sewn tight with thread, no speech for the dead   
      maker--   

       
      you've got the razor. you can make each suture snap.   

       
      and watch the mouth    
bloom up with foam,   
      as if he'd drowned himself in soap--   

      you lift the neck and let the head drop back.   
the mouth yawns wide its prize--   

       
      white thrive.   
the larval joy.   
      hot in their gorge on the stew of balms,   
a moist exhale--   
      as if there were a last breath, a taunt   
coiling   
      into your inner ear, good dog, you dig your hands in,   
up-cupping   
      the glossal   
bed--   

       
      saying, graduate   
of the school of flesh,   
      father conspirator--   


      i will learn it.   
      i will bite the tongue from the corpse.


before my first communion, i clung to doubt 
         as satan spider-like stalked 
                the orb of dark surrounding eden 

for a wormhole into paradise. 
       god had formed me from gel in my mother's womb, 
                injected by my dad's smart shoot. 

they swapped sighs until 
         i came, smaller than a bite of burger. 
                quietly, i grew till my lungs were done 

then the lord sailed a soul 
         like a lit arrow to inhabit me. 
                maybe that piercing 

made me howl at birth, 
         or the masked creatures whose scalpel 
                cut a lightning bolt to free me. 

i was hoisted by the heels and swatted, fed 
         and hauled around. time-lapse photos show 
                my fingers grow past crayon outlines, 

my feet come to fill spike heels. 
         eventually, i lurched out 
                to kiss the wrong mouths, get stewed, 

and sulk around. christ always stood 
         to one side with a glass of water. 
                i swatted the sap away. 

when my thirst got great enough to ask, 
         a clear stream welled up inside, 
                some jade wave buoyed me forward, 

and i found myself upright 
         in the instant, with a garden 
                inside my own ribs aflourish. 

there, the arbor leafs. 
         the vines push out plump grapes. 
                you are loved, someone said. take that 

                and eat it.


i see you shuffle up washington street   
whenever i am driving much too fast   
you, chub & bug-eyed, jaw like a loaf   
hands in your pockets, a smoke dangling slack   
from the slit of your pumpkin mouth,   
humped over like the eel-man or geek,   
the dummy paid to sweep out gutters,   

drown the cats. where are you going now?   
though someday you'll turn your gaze    
upon my shadow in this tinted glass   
i know for now you only look ahead   
at sidewalks cracked & paved with trash 
but what are you slouching toward--knee-locked,   
hippity, a hitch in your zombie walk, bighead?


each morning in the little white cabin   
by the river they woke to a raccoon   
clawing under the floorboards or banging   
in the wood stove. they did not discuss this.   
instead they said it was a perfect day   
to pick blueberries on the hill, or that   
a hike to the old glassworks sounded good.   
they were beginning to speak not in meat   
but in the brown paper the butcher wraps   
around it. brown paper around dirty   
magazines. like dirty magazines, they   
only traced the contour of substance silk   
over skin, skin over muscle, muscle over   
bone. what's under bone? marrow? their forks so   
small and dull. as if for dolls. you can tell   
dolls from animals because the latter   
are made of meat. many eat it, also.   
lions are interesting. lions don't eat   
the flesh of their kills right away, but first   
lap up the blood, until the meat is blanched   
nearly white. white as the little cabin   
by the river they stayed in that summer.   
white as the raccoon covered in ashes,   
his black eyes bottomless and bright with hate.

up here as trees
may your branches squirt

my pages please



the wooden horses
are tired of their courses

and plead from head to hoof 
to be fed to a stove--

in leaping lunging flames 
they'd rise again, flared manes

snapping like chains behind them. 
the smoke would not blind them

as do these children's hands 
beyond our cruel commands

the fire will free them then 
as once the artisan when

out of the tree they
were nagged to this neigh.



the generator hums like a distant ding an sich.   
it's early evening, and time, like the dog it is,   
                                                                                 is hungry for food,   
and will be fed, don't doubt it, will be fed, my small one.   
the forest begins to gather its silences in.   
the meadow regroups and hunkers down   
                                                                            for its cleft feet.

something is making the reeds bend and cover their heads.   
something is licking the shadows up,   
and stringing the blank spaces along, filling them in.   
something is inching its way into our hearts,   
                              scratching its blue nails against the wall there.   

should we let it in?   
                                       should we greet it as it deserves,   
hands on our ears, mouths open?   
or should we bring it a chair to sit on, and offer it meat?   
should we turn on the radio,   
                                                     should we clap our hands and dance   
the something dance, the welcoming something dance?   
                               i think we should, love, i think we should.


joy in the day's being done, however    
clumsily, and in the ticked-off lists,    
the packages nestling together,    
no one home waiting for dinner, for    
you, no one impatient for your touch    
or kind words to salve what nightly    
rises like heartburn, the ghost-lump feeling    
that one is really as alone as one had feared.    
one isn't, not really. not really. joy    
to see over the strip mall darkening    
right on schedule a neon-proof pink    
sunset flaring like the roof of a cat's mouth,    
cleanly ribbed, the clouds laddering up    
and lit as if by a match struck somewhere    
in the throat much deeper down.


i try to think of the cup of a hand,   
of legs in a tangle, and not the thistle   

though even it, purpled, spiking away,   
wants to be admired, wants to say, whistle   

a little for me. o every little thing wants 
to be loved, wants to be marked by the cry   

that brings desire to it, even blue-eyed fly   
to the bloated hiss of death. to love is to be remiss   

the horse alone in the wide flat field nods 
its head as if the bridle and bit were missed   

or mocked the cow slung with the unmilked weight   
of her tremendous teats shoots a look back over her shoulder   

at o lonesome me. i want to say to her need                  
as if crooning could be enough,   

sweet, sweet mama . . . truth be told,   
the thousand lisping bees to the milkweeds' honey   

terrifies me. when the stink of slurry season   
is over and the greened fields are slathered, fecund,   

overtall foxgloves tip with the weight of their fruit.   
then i dream a little dream of you   

and me, curled like two grubs on the top of a leaf   
wind-driven and scudding along the lake's surface.   

all night we glide to its blue harbor   
and back again. the fattened slack of us   

singing o darlin' darlin'   darlin'.


sleep, she will not linger
she turns her moon-cold shoulder.
with no ring on her finger,
you cannot hope to hold her.

she turns her moon-cold shoulder
and tosses off the cover.
you cannot hope to hold her
she has another lover.

she tosses off the cover
and lays the darkness bare.
she has another lover.
her heart is otherwhere.

she lays the darkness bare.
you slowly realize
her heart is otherwhere.
there's distance in her eyes.

you slowly realize
that she will never linger,
with distance in her eyes
and no ring on her finger.


everything contains some   
silence. noise gets 
its zest from the 
small shark's-tooth 
shaped fragments 
of rest angled 
in it. an hour   
of city holds maybe   
a minute of these   
remnants of a time   
when silence reigned,   
compact and dangerous   
as a shark. sometimes   
a bit of a tail   
or fin can still   
be sensed in parks.


late august was a pressure drop,   
rain, a sob in the body,   

a handful of air    
with a dream in it,    

summer was desperate    
to paradise itself with blackberry   

drupelets and swarms, everything   
polychromed, glazed, sprinkler caps    

gushing, the stars like sweat   
on a boxer's skin. a voice   

from the day says   
tax cuts    

for the rich or scratch   
what itches or it's a sax   

from bitches brew,   
and i'm a fool    

for these horns   
and hues, this maudlin    

light. it's a currency of feeling    
in unremembered march.   

there's a war on and snow in the 
                        city   
where we've made our desire stop   

and start. in the dying school of bruce   
i'm the student who still believes   

in the bad taste of the beautiful   
and the sadness of songs   

made in the ratio   
of bruise for bruise.


what a fuckup you are.    
what dumbshit you do.    
your father's voice    
still whispers in you,    
    
despite the joys    
that sweeten each day.    
your genius it isn't    
until, dying away,    
    
it worms back through    
the sparkling dream    
where you drown him    
in an inch-deep stream    
    
your knee in his back,    
your strength on his skull,    
it begins singing    
praise for your skill.


ghost i house   
in this old flat--   
your outpost--   
my aftermath


foreplay of obscene graffiti carved   
into trees--foot-long boners   
gouge the bark. beaks and snouts   
on a restroom mirror. slick lips.   
succulent lips. i go out among them   
sometimes. so sweet how they pucker up   
out of pity. a practiced pathos   
in a saloon of woodsmen whose axes   
wait in trucks out back. lips full of yawn   

or yes. lips thick with god-spit   
and god-suck. chapped lips, bloody lips.   
pierced or tattooed, they pout 
into view--here to give, willy-nilly, 
what's been too long held in the body. 
something passes across tongues. it sayeth not   
a name it taketh everyone's turn. mute lips   
of a swift unbuttoner. mouths fording   
frothy streams, vaporous bogs.   
i stumble forth in their midst. maybe   
i am out of bread or in a bad place   
with a book. the streets have an attendant 
caress. moon lapping rumor. fat lip   
approaches hare lip. there go pasty 
lips. all are readied as if for a race   
or to be plucked like rare moths   
by bright wings from the air. betty's lips   
and bobby's and bucky's just before the collision 
and the siren's red wail. laddy, keep 

a light on. i may have to come ashore 
some distance from where i set in. 


after the trumpets, after the incense    
there were nights insomnia fathered gods    
i then rejected as too angry or distracted,    
or whose appetite for submission revealed    
their own lack of faith.   say our names,    
all synonyms for trust. others spoke    
in sugared paradox  to know is to know    
all. to not know all is not to know. to know    
all requires that you know very little,    
but to know that little you have to know    
all . and for a while, it's true,    
i burned in the dark fires of ambivalence,    
my attention consumed like oxygen.    
i'd wake up tired, as i had with the married man    
whose strictures and caprice begat,    
and begat, and begat, and begat    
my love for him, harvesting the same      
silence from my bed. who listens    
to my penitential tune? who accepts    
my petitions for convenient parking,    
for spring, for the self illuminated    
across a kitchen table, for . . . for    
fortitude? i've heard a voice, i'm sure,    
advising me to drop this sentimental farce.    
only to hold the smoke of their names    
again in my mouth i'd resurrect    
the dead, or adopt the gods orphaned    
by atheists, except the gods they've made    
from disbelief no one's faith could tolerate.    
refusing to make the same mistake    
just once, i've cried out to the dark    
many names, most given up as routinely    
as the secrets of friends. if you're a cup      
will my lips profane your own? if a comb      
will i feel your teeth against my neck?      
if a wall i will be darker than your shadow.    
and if a door i will unlatch you, letting in    
all the little foxes from the vineyard.


in appreciation of maxim gorky at the international convention of atheists, 
like gorky, i sometimes follow my doubts   
outside to the yard and question the sky,   
longing to have the fight settled, thinking   
i can't go on like this, and finally i say   

all right, it is improbable, all right, there   
is no god. and then as if i'm focusing   
a magnifying glass on dry leaves, god blazes up.   
it's the attention, maybe, to what isn't there   

that makes the emptiness flare like a forest fire   
until i have to spend the afternoon dragging   
the hose to put the smoldering thing out.   
even on an ordinary day when a friend calls,   

tells me they've found melanoma,   
complains that the hospital is cold, i say god.   
god, i say as my heart turns inside out.   
pick up any language by the scruff of its neck,   

wipe its face, set it down on the lawn,   
and i bet it will toddle right into the godfire   
again, which--though they say it doesn't   
exist--can send you straight to the burn unit.   

oh, we have only so many words to think with.   
say god's not fire, say anything, say god's   
a phone, maybe. you know you didn't order a phone,   
but there it is. it rings. you don't know who it could be.   

you don't want to talk, so you pull out   
the plug. it rings. you smash it with a hammer   
till it bleeds springs and coils and clobbery   
metal bits. it rings again. you pick it up   

and a voice you love whispers hello.


not delft or   
delphinium, not wedgewood 
among the knickknacks, not wide-eyed chicory   
evangelizing in the devil strip-- 

but way on down in the moonless   
octave below midnight, honey, 
way down where you can't tell cerulean   
from teal. 

not mason jars of moonshine, not   
waverings of silk, not the long-legged hunger   
of a heron or the peacock's   
iridescent id-- 

but delilahs of darkness, darling, 
and the muscle of the mind 
giving in. 

not sullen snow slumped   
against the garden, not the first instinct of flame,   
not small, stoic ponds, or the cold derangement 
of a jealous sea-- 

but bluer than the lips of lazarus, baby,   
before sweet jesus himself could figure out 
what else in the world to do but weep.


many believe in the stars.   


   take quinamid   
the son of a dardanian astrologer   
who disregarded what his father said   
and came to troy in a taxi.   

gone.   

    odysseus to greece   

    hector has never fought this far from troy.   
we want him further out. beyond king ilus' tower.   
so walk him to the centre of the plain and, having killed him,   
massacre the trojans there.   

ave   

    immediately beyond the ridge is primrose hill   
where paris favoured aphrodit.   

take it, said hector.   

    greece shouted hurry up   
troy shouted wait for us   

    see,   
far off,   
masts behind the half-built palisade.   
    then   
nearer to yourselves   
scamnder's ford   
from which the land ascends   
then merges with the centre of the plain--   
the tower a ruin its highest point.   

    heaven.   
bad music.   
queen hera is examining her gums.   
looking in through a window   
teenaged athena says   
trouble for greece.   

      they leave.   

      sea.   
      sky.   
      the sunlit snow.   

      two armies on the plain.   
hector, driven by lutie,   
his godchild and his nephew,   
going from lord to trojan lord   

the ships by dark.   

    the ruined tower.   

      in front of it--   
their banners rising one by one.   
one after one, and then another one--   
, greeks.   

      and on a rise in front of greece   
two hero lords   

      ajax the great of salamis   
behind his shield--   
                        
            as fifty trojan shields   
topped with blue plumes, swivelling their points,   
come up the rise--   
      lord teucer five feet high and five feet wide   
loading his bow,   
peering round ajax' shield,   
dropping this trojan plume or that,   
ordering his archers to lie flat,   
promising god as many sheep as there are sheep to count   
if he can put a shaft through hector's neck.   

      prosperity   
beneath the blue, between the sea, the snow, there   
    hector is   
surrendering the urn of one he has just killed   
to one who thought that he had killed the same.   
      lord teucer's eyeprince hector's throat. 
but god would not. the bowstring snaps.   

      outside god's inner court.   
queen hera and athena still in line.   
hera so angry she can hardly speak.   
      a voice   
the wife, the daughter.   
you go. his face will make me   
    heave.   

serene and dignified grandee.   
papa to you.   

papa--his hand--   
i know you do not want the holy family   
    visiting the plain.   
but some of us would like to help the greeks.   
they lost their champion she.   
    thousands of them have died. now they are in retreat.   
    please look. 
      
      the plain.   

you will come back the moment that i call?   
of course, papa.   
then . . . yes. encourage greece.   
but voices only.   
    words. shouts. that sort of thing. a move--and home you come.   
of course, papa.   

      the plain.   

      lord teucer's archers hidden in its grass.   

    chylbborak, lord hector's brother-in-law, to his blue plumes 
move   
move   
      and on their flanks, between the sea and snow,   
led by telspiax' silver yard   
all ilium's masks   

down came their points. out came their battle cry.   
and our cool mr  x  called up.' and up we got   
and sent our arrows into them,   
that made them pirouette,   
topple back down the rise, leaving their dead   
for some of us to strip, and some, the most,   
to pause, to point, to plant, a third, a fourth   
volley into their naked backs. pure joy   

      chylbborak,   
holding his ground   
centre on me.   
more die in broken than in standing ranks.   
apollo aphrodit our gods are here   
you taste the air, you taste their breath   
the greek fleet, ours, by dark   

      then he is ringed.   

      see an imperial pig harassed by dogs.   
      how, like a masterchef his crpes,   
      he tosses them and on their way back down   
      eviscerates, then flips them back into the pack.   
likewise chylbborak the greeks who rushed.   

      hector has seen it. as--   
beneath the blue, the miles of empty air,   
him just one glitter in that glittering   mass--   
the hosts begin to merge.   

      fine dust clouds mixed with beams of light.   
the prince, down from his plate.   
either sides' arrows whingeing by   
cover my back.   
finding a gap   
dismissing blows as gales do slates,   
then at a run, leaping into the ring,   
taking chylbborak's hand   
if you don't mind?   

      agamemnon   
our time has come. god keeps his word.   
fight now as you have never fought.   
we will be at troy's gates by dusk,   
through them by dark,   
by dawn, across our oars,   
as we begin our journey home,   
watching the windmills on its wall   
turn their sails in flames.   

    heaven. the wife. the daughter.   

    hands release black lacquer clasps inlaid with particles of gold.   
silk sheaths--with crashing waves and fishscales woven on a    
            navy ground--   
flow on the pavement.   

      hands take their hands   

      while other hands supply   

      warwear,   

      their car,   

      and put the reins into athena's hands.   

. . . troy's gates by dusk,   
      through them by dark . . .   

      the hours, the undeniable,   
open the gates of paradise.   

      beyond   

      the wastes of space.   

      before   

      the blue.   

      below   

      now near   

      the sea, the snow.   

      all time experts in hand-to-hand action--   
friecourt, okinawa, stalingrad west--   
could not believe the battle would gain.   
but it did.   

      chylbborak's ring is ringed. and then no ring at all.   
some trojans raise their hands in prayer   
      some panachans shout for joy and wait to drag the corpses off. 


      lutie, alone, the reins in one, his other hand   
hacking away the hands that grab his chariot's bodywork,   
rearing his horses, starlight and bertie, through,   
      to,   
      yes,   
      chylbborak up rescued   
prince hector covering. then   

zoo-born wolf front for a family of thieves   
lord diomed, on foot, with sethynos.   
      my lutie answering   
be proud prince hector is your fate.   
which will be so,   
though lutie will not see it.   
      chylbborak and hector do not want to disappoint this oily pair   
here come the sisters karamazof, spark,   
chylbborak said. let's send them home in halves.   
and jumped back down.   

      around the tower,  greeks,  ilians, amid their swirl,   
his green hair dressed in braids, each braid   
tipped with a little silver bell, note   
nyro of simi--the handsomest of all the greeks, save a.   
                  the trouble was, he had no fight. he dashed from fight to fight, 
struck a quick blow, then dashed straight out again.   
save that this time he caught,   
as prince aenas caught his breath,   
that prince's eye who blocked his dash,   
and as lord panda waved and walked away,   
took his head off his spine with a backhand slice--   
beautiful stuff . . . straight from the blade . . .   
      still, as it was a special head,   
mowgag, aenas' minder--   
bright as a box of rocks, but musical--   
spiked it, then hoisted it, and twizzling the pole   
beneath the blue, the miles of empty air,   
marched to the chingaling of its tinklers,   
a knees high majorette   
towards the greeks, the tower.   

      a roar of wind across the battlefield.   

      a pause.   

      and then   

      scattering light,   
the plain turned crystal where their glidepath stopped,   
the queen of heaven shrills typhoid for troy   
and through poor nyro's wobbling mouth   
athena yells   

slew of assiduous mediocrities   
meek greeks   

      it is enough.   

      centre-plain wide,   
lit everywhere by rays of glorious light,   
they rushed their standards into ilium,   
      diomed for once swept forward   
converting shame to exaltation with his cry   

never--to helen's gold without her self   
      never--to helen's self   
    without her gold   

      mowgag well slain.   
hewn through his teeth, his jaw slashed off,   
and nyro's head beside him in the grass.   

      when nyro's mother heard of this   
she shaved her head she tore her frock she went outside   
ripping her fingernails through her cheeks   
then down her neck her chest her breasts   
and bleeding to her waist ran round the shops,   
sobbing   
god, kill troy.   
console me with its death.   
revenge is all i have.   
my boy was kind. he had his life to live.   
i will not have the chance to dance in hector's blood,   
but let me hear some have before i die.   

i saw her running round.   
      i took the photograph.   
      it summed the situation up.   
      he was her son.   
      they put it out in colour. right?   
      my picture went around the   
    world.   

      down the shaft of the shot in his short-staved bow   
      lord panda has been follow-spotting diomed.   

      between her self   her gold he shoots.   
it hits. and as its barbs protrude through dio's back   
aenas hears lord panda shout   
he bleeds the totem greek right-shoulder-front 
how wise of artemis to make   
panda her matador her numero uno moi   

      diomed hit,   
the heart went out of those who followed him   
and they fell back.   

    shields all round   

diomed on his knees   

lifting his hands   

sister and wife of god   

as sethynos breaks off the arrowhead   

eliminate my pain.   

settles his knee beneath his hero's shoulderblades   

let me kill that oaf who claims my death   

bridges his nape with one hand   

before it comes with honour to my name.   

    then with his other hand   
in one long strong slow pull   
drew the shank back, and out.   

    she heard his prayer.   

    before their breathless eyes   
his blood ran back into the pout the shank had left,   
and to complete her miracle   
lord diomed rose up between them, stood in the air,   
then hovered down onto his toes   
brimming with homicidal joy,   
imparting it to greece.   

    then troy was driven back,   
trampling the half-stripped still-masked carcasses   
hatching the centre of the plain.   

      aenas  panda.   
      

get him.   

get him i got him. he is dead. but there he is.   

      and diomed has spotted them.   

calm down, aenas said. perhaps he is possessed.   

what god would visit him?   

so pray to yours--and try another shot.   

huntress, lord panda prays,   
      bright-ankled   god of nets and lines,  
      of tangled mountains, ilex groves and dark cascades . . .   

      but artemis was bored with him   
and let him rise, still praying hard,   
into the downflight of the javelin   
diomed aired at prince aenas.   

    sunlit, it went through panda's lips, out through his neck, and then 
through biblock's neck.   
      and so they fell the lord, face up the friend, face down   
gripping the blood-smeared barb between his teeth,   
between the sea and snow.   

      aenas covers them.   

      eyeing his plate   
--technology you can enjoy--   
diomed found, and threw, a stone   
as heavy as a cabbage made of lead,   
that hit, and split, aenas' hip.   
who went down on one knee   
and put his shield hand on the grass   
and with his other hand covered his eyes.   
dido might have become a grandmother   
and rome not had its day, except   
as diomed came on to lop his top   
aenas' mama, aphrodit dressed   
in grey silk lounge pyjamas piped with gold   
and snake-skin flip-flops stepped   
between him and the greek.   
a glow came from her throat, and from her hair   
a fragrance that betokened the divine.   
stooping, she kissed him better, as   
queen hera whispered greek, cut that bitch.   
and, diomed, you did nicking love's wrist.   

    studying the ichor as   
it seeped across her pulse into her palm   
our lady of the thong lifted her other hand   
removed a baby cobra from her hair   
and dropped it, diomed, onto your neck,   
and saw its bite release its bane into your blood.   
      then nobody could say   
who diomed fought for, or for what he fought.   

      rapt through the mass   
      now shouting at the sky, now stomping on the plain,   
      he killed and killed and killed, greek, trojan, greek, 
lordless, shamefame, both gone and gone   
loyalty nurtured in the face of death,   
the duty of revenge, the right to kill,   
to jeer, to strip, to gloat, to be the first   
to rally but the last to run, all gone--   
and gone, our lady aphrodit, giggling.   

      while everywhere,   

driving your fellow greeks   
    back down the long incline that leads to the scamnder's ford, 
surely as when   
lit from the dark part of the sky by sudden beams,   
a bitter wind   
detonates line by line of waves against the shore.   

    no mind. even as teucer backed away   
he kept his eyes on you.   
you feel the stress? you feel the fear?   
behold your enemy the prince god loves   
    see   teucer's bow. hear teucer's this time lucky.   
    his--   
but this time it was not our father, god,   
who saved your life, my prince.   
    as agamemnon cried   
the ships are safe.   
stand at the riverside's far bank.   
telspiax heard the rustle of lord teucer's shot   
and stood between yourself and it.   

    his head was opened, egglike, at the back,   
mucked with thick blood, blood trickling from his mouth.   
his last words were   
prince, your trumpeter has lost his breath.   

    our worst fear was his face would fade,   
    telspiax's father said. 
but it did not. we will remember it until we die.   

    give his instrument to hogem, hector said, and went--   
lutie on reins--between the sea and snow,   
throwing his chariots wide, scamnderwards,   
as easily as others might a cloak.   

    diomed among this traffic, on his own,   
among his dead,   
their pools of blood, their cut-off body-parts,   
their cut-off heads,   
ashamed as his head cleared   
to see odysseus, idomeneo, the ajax--big and small--   
whipping away downslope, shouting towards odysseus   
where are you going with your back to the battle?   
who shouted back, although he did not turn   
look left   
and there was lutie driving hector onto him,   

sure they would trample him, for sure   
queen hera's human, diomed,   
would stand and die, except   
arms up, young king-- nestor, full tilt,   
reins round his tummy, leaning out --and   
jump . . . wrists locked . . . you young are just . . .   
swinging him up onto the plate . . . too much.   

with your permission, da?   
nod. drew. then threw the chariot's javelin   
as lutie spun his wheels, and hector threw--    
those skewers trading brilliance as they passed--   
and missed--both vehicles slither-straightening,   
regaining speed, close, close, then driven apart   
by empty cars careering off the incline,   
or stationary cars, their horses cropping grass.   

daddy, go slow. hector will say i   ran.   
but not the widows you have made.   

    and slow   
    and low   
cruising the blue above this mix   
heaven's queen and ringsight-eyed athena   
trumpeting down huge worms of sound   
as hector's car rereached king nestor's,   and   
what kept you, prince? diomed offered as they came abreast   
you went for a refreshing towel?   
and threw his axe, that toppled through the air, and, oh,   
hector, my hector, as you thought   
if heaven helps me heaven shows it loves the best,   
parted your lutie's mesh and smashed into his heart.   

    what did you say as god called you to death   
dear lutie?   

king prince, i leave you   driverless.   

    and put the reins into his hands, and fled   
into oblivion   

      as hector with his other hand   
held what his lutie was, upright, face forwards, in between   
the chariot's basket and himself,   
shouting as he drove after them   

loathsome greek,   
your loathsome hair, your loathsome blood,   
your loathsome breath, your loathsome heart,   
jump in your loathsome ships,   
i will come after you,   
come over the aegean after you,   
and find you though you hide inside   
your loathsome father's grave   
and with my bare hands twist your loathsome head   
off your loathsome neck.   

      there was a greek called themion.   
mad about armour. if not armour, cars.   
of course he went to troy. and troy   
saw a stray spear transfix him as he drove.   
      companionably, his horses galloped up   
on starlight's side, and muddled starlight down,   
and bertie down, and brought the prince   
still holding lutie down, as all the world   
hurried, as if by windheads, on towards   scamnder's ford.   


hether you reach it from the palisade   
or through the trees that dot the incline's last stretch 
you hear scamnder's voice before you see   
what one may talk across on quiet days   
its rippling sunspangled breadth   
streaming across the bars of pebbly sand   
that form its ford   
--though on the fleet's side deeper, darkly bright.   

      and here   
tiptoeing from this bar to that,   
settling the cloudy sunshine of her hair,   
her towel retained by nothing save herself,   
the god of tops and thongs   
our lady aphrodit came,   
her eyes brimfull with tears.   

    scamnder is astonished by his luck.   

beauty of beauties, why are you weeping?   
i have been hurt, scamnder.   
no . . .   
humiliated.   
no . . .   
me. a god. just like yourself. touched . .   .   
touched   
by a man.   
a man   
a greek.   
death to all greeks   
he cut me   
sacrilege   
. . . but where?   
i need your healing touch.   
how can i help you if you do not show me where?   
moisten its lips and my wound will be healed.   
you must say where   
well . . .   
    the towel has slipped an inch.   
i am afraid you will be disappointed.   
never.   
are you sure?   
yes   
you will not criticize me?   
no   
    her wrist upturned.   
    out-turned.   
    her opened palm.   
    fanning the fingers of her other hand,   
stroking his spangles with her fingertips.   
goddess, i love you.   
i have always loved you.   
say that you love me. even a little.   
i beg you. god grant it.   
i need your help, scamnder.   
take pity on me. come into me.   
you have your nymphs.   
bores bores   
i might be nibbled by an eel   
death to all eels   
    the towel is down.   
step into me . . .   
i love your toes . . . please let me kiss your toes . . .   
your little dinkum-inkum toes . . .   
no one has kissed them so nicely, scamnder.   
and now your knees . . .   
you tickle me . . .   
and now your thighs   
oh, oh, go on . . .   
and now your bum   
    your holy bum your sacred bum   
    the bum of paradise   
oh, my scamnder, i must have your help . . .   
anything   
    the towel goes curling off,   
and as she floated on his stream   
our lady aphrodit said   
at any moment now the greeks will reach your    
         troy-side bank . . .   

    recall those sequences   
    when horsemen ride out of the trees and down into a   stream   
somewhere in kansas or missouri, say.   
    so--save they were   thousands--greece   
into scamnder's ford.   

    coming downstream,   
a smallish wave   

    that passes   

    but   

    scamnder's flow does not relapse.   

    indeed   

    almost without a sound   
its murmuring radiance rose   
into a dark, torrential surge,   
clouded with boulders, crammed with trees, as clamorous    
         as if it were a sea,   
that lifted greece, then pulled greece down,   
cars gone, masks gone, gone under, reappearing, gone   

onto your knees praise hector for this flood   
the prince god loves prince hector claims   
as he comes through the trees.   

    they do.   
then up and run, run, thousands of them,   
to hold those greeks who got back out   
under until their bubbles stopped while those swept off   
turned somersaults amid scamnder's undertow.   

    the flat--   

     yards of it between the river and the palisade.   

    the king   

the lord has not abandoned us.   
to cross will be as bad for them.   

    but it was not to be as bad for them.   

    indeed,   
as hector drove towards scamnder's brink,   
and as--their banners rising one by one,   
one after one and then another one--   
he and all ilium began to enter it,   
    the river reassumed its softly-spoken, smooth, sunspangled way.   

    and agamemnon cried   

god, what are you for?   
what use are you to me?   

    as hector cries   

two miracles   
your prince is close to god   

    and hera to athena   

fog?   

    and fog came down.   

    and most of greece got out.   

    troy holding hands midstream.   
an army peering through its masks.   

    miss tops and thongs to god   

your hera has . . .   

    and with a wish he turned the fog to light   

    and with a word he called them back to heaven.   

    sky.   
    snow.   
    the  yards.   
    the palisade.   

    hector   
i am your prince.   
my name means he-who-holds.   
troy. and the plain. and now the ships.   
    for troy his battle cry,   
rising into a common cry, that cry   
into a clamour, and that clamour to   
bayings of hatred.   

     yards.   

    the child   
we are the greeks. we fight to win. if one is lost,   
close his eyes, step over him, and kill his enemy.   

     yards.   

    the greeks are tiring.   
    nestor is on his knees   

god of all gods, most holy and most high,  
      if greece has ever sacrificed fresh blood to you,  
      protect our ships.   

    heaven.   
soft music. summertime. queen hera and athena? yes . . .   

    some lesser gods   
observing their approach, approach,   
salaam, and then   
lead them--   
now both in black wraparound tops--   
to god   

darling daddy, here we are.   
and hera here we stay   
until you stop that worthless hector killing greeks.   
    up steps love.   
    hera why is she wearing a tent?   
    love father, see this. her wrist.   
human strikes god communism the end of everything   

darlings, he said,   
you know that being a god means being blamed.   
do this--no good. do that--the same. the answer is   
avoid humanity.   
    remember--i am god.   
i see the bigger picture.   

and i am hera, heaven's queen,   
greece worships me.   

stuff greece, love said.   
your blubber-bummed wife with her gobstopper nipples   
hates troy because troy's paris put her last   
when we stripped off for him.   
    as for the ithacan boat-boy's undercurved preceptatrix,   
she hates troy because my statue stands on its acropolis.   

      hera the cities' whores were taxed to pay for it.   
      love dropping onto her knees before himself   
please . . . stop them harming troy. the greatest city   
                in the world.   

      while hera and athena sang   

cleavage cleavage   
      queen of the foaming hole.   
      mammoth or man or midge   
      she sucks from pole to pole.   

      and god has had enough of it.   

      lifting his scales he said   

hector will have his day of victory.   
then crashed them to the ground.   

       yards.   

      the palisade.   

      its gate.   

      late sunlight on gilt beaks.   

there's no escape from troy.   
or from the plain at troy.   

      begging for ransom, trojan hoti,   
his arms around king menelaos' knees.   

      king agamemnon off.   

      then he punched hoti in the face.   
then punched him in the face again.   
and then again. and when he fell   
king agamemnon kicked him in the groin.   
kicking him in the groin with so much force   
it took a step to follow up each kick.   
then pulled him up,   
then dragged him by his hair   
this way and that,    
then left him, calling   
finish him off.   
and someone did.   

i was sixteen. i said where is achilles?'   
hard as it is to share another's troubles when your own are pressing   
great ajax took my hands in his and said   
he loves us. he is with us. he will come.'   

      but he did not.   

      then ajax to himself   
dear lord, you made me straight.   
give me the strength to last till dark.   

      the prince i get past   everything i see.   
their war is lost.   

      it was.   

      aenas, bassee, sarpdon, gray,   
calling to one another down the line.   
      then, with a mighty wall of sound,   
as if a slope of stones   
rolled down into a lake of broken glass   
we ran at them.   

    and now the light of evening has begun   
to shawl across the plain   
blue gray, gold gray, blue gold,   
translucent nothingnesses   
readying our space,   
within the deep, unchanging sea of space,   
for hesper's entrance, and the silver wrap.   

    covered with blood, mostly their own,   
loyal to death, reckoning to die   
odysseus, ajax, diomed,   
idomeneo, nestor, menelaos   
and the king   

do not die because others have died.   
do not show them the palms of your hands.   

achil   
achil   
if he won't help us, heaven help us.   

stand still and fight.   
feel shame in one another's eyes.   
i curse you, god. you are a liar, god.   
troy will be yours by dark--immortal lies.   
home   
home   
there's no such place.   
you can't launch burning ships.   
more men survive if no one runs.   

    but that is what greece did.   

    dropping their wounded,   
throwing down their dead,   
their shields, their spears, their swords,   
they ran.   

    leaving their heroes tattered, filthy, torn   

    and ran   

    and ran   

    above their cries   

i am the prince the victory is mine   

    chylbborak   

do not take cowardice for granted.   

    scarce had he said it, when   
his son, kykon, standing next to him   
took ajax' final spear cast in his chest.   

i shall not wear your armour, sir, he said.   
and died.   

my son is dead.   

    the prince   

hector is loved by god.   

    and greece, a wall of walking swords,   
but walking backwards,   
leaving the plain in silence   
and in tears.   

    idomeneo,   
running back out at those trojans who came too close   
      

you know my name. come look for me. and boy,   
the day you do will be the day you die.   

    hector to troy   
soldiers--   
unmatched my force, unconquerable my will.   
after ten years of days, in one long day   
to be remembered for as many days   
as there are days to come, this is my day,   
your hector's day. troy given back to troy.   
my day of victory   
      and when the cheering died   
some say destroy greece now. but i say no.   
out of your cars. eat by your fires.   
two hundred fires around each fire   
five hundred men   
the sound of grindstones turning through the night,   
the firelight that stands between our blades,   
so let king agamemnon's own hold hands   
and look into each other's frightened eyes.   
true god great master of the widespread sky   
if only you would turn   
me into a god,   
as you, through me,   
tomorrow by their ships   
will see greece die.   

    silence.   

    a ring of lights.   

    within   

    immaculate   

    in boat-cloaks lined with red   

    king agamemnon's lords--   

    the depression of retreat.   
the depression of returning to camp.   
him at the centre of their circle   
sobbing,   
then shouting   

we must run for it   

    dark glasses in parked cars.   

king agamemnon of mycenae,   
god called, god raised, god recognized,   
you are a piece of shit, diomed said.   

    silence again.   

let us praise god, lord ajax said,   
that hector stopped before he reached the ships.   

    silence again.   

    then   

    nestor   
putting his knee back in   

paramount agamemnon, king of kings,   
lord of the shore, the islands and the sea   
i shall begin, and end, with you.   
    greece needs good words. like them or not, the credit    
            will be yours.   
determined. keen to fight, that is our diomed--   
as i should know. when just a boy of ten i fought   
blowback of missolonghi, a cannibal, drank blood,   
he captured you, he buggered you, you never walked again.   
but diomed lacks experience.   
    god has saved us, momentarily.   
god loves achilles.   
you took, and you have kept, achilles' ribband she.   

i was a fool   

and now you must appease him, agamemnon.   
humble words. hands shaken. gifts.   

    the king--wiping his eyes   

as usual,   
pylos has said the only things worth hearing.   
i was mad to take the she.   
i shall pay fitting damages.   
plus her, i offer him   
the corfiot armour that my father wore.   

    silence.   

    the sea.   

    its whispering.   

to which i add a set of shields.   
posy, standard, ceremonial.   
the last, cut from the hide of a one ton lesbian bull.   

    silence.   

    the sea.   

and . . . a chariot   
from my own quipe   
they smoke along the ground . . .   
they ride its undulations like a breeze . . .   

    the sea.   

plus six horses--saddled, bridled and caparisoned,   
their grooms and veterinarians . . .   

    . . . and six tall shes   
two good dancers, two good stitchers, two good cooks.   
all capable of bearing boys . . .   

oh, very well then twenty loaves of gold,   
the same of silver, and the same of iron.   

    masks. lights.   
behind the lords   
some hundreds from the army have walked up.   
    lord nestor smiles.   
lord menelaos smiles.   

plus--   
though it may well reduce your king to destitution   
    a'kimi'kriex,   
my summer palace by the argive sea,   
its lawns, its terraces, its curtains in whose depths   
larks dive above a field of waving lilies   
and fishscale-breakers shatter on blue rocks.   
then, as he draws their silky heights aside,   
standing among huge chests of looted booty,   
long necked, with lowered lids, but candid eyes,   
my living daughter, phaniss, a diamond   
big as a cheeseball for her belly stud.   
his wife to be minus--i need not say--her otherwise huge    
          bride-price.   

more   
more   
more   

    lord ajax almost has to hold him up.   

the whole of eastern pel'po'nesia--   
an area of outstanding natural beauty--   
its cities, epi'dvros, trw''zen,   
their fortresses, their harbours and their fleets,   
their taxpayers--glad to accept his modest ways--   
all this, the greatest benefaction ever known,   
if he agrees to fight. and he admits i am his king.   

    instantly, nestor   

an offer god himself could not refuse.   
all that remains to say is   
who shall take it to achilles?   

    agamemnon you will.   

    starlight.   

    the starlight on the sea.   

    the sea.   

    its whispering   

    mixed with the prayers   
of ajax and of nestor as they walk   
along the shore towards achilles' gate.   

my lords?   

your lord.   

this way.   

    they find him, with guitar,   
singing of gilgamesh.   

take my hands. here they are.   

    you cannot take your eyes away from him.   
his own so bright they slow you down.   
his voice so low, and yet so clear.   
you know that he is dangerous.   

patroclus?    
friends in need.   
    still,   
friends.   
    that has not changed,   
i think.   
    autmedon? wine.   

dear lord and master of the widespread sky,  
      accept ourselves, accept our prayers.   

    their cups are taken.   

father friend?   

    king nestor for his life   

you know why we are here.   
    we face death.   
the mass choose slavery.   
mycenae has admitted he was wrong to wrong yourself.   
in recompense he offers you   
the greatest benefaction ever known.   
take it, and fight. or else hector will burn the ships   
then kill us randomly.   
    remember what your father said   
the day when ajax and myself drove up to ask   
if you could come with us to troy?   
that you should stand among the blades where honour grows.   
and secondly, to let your anger go.   
    spirit, and strength, and beauty have combined   
such awesome power in you   
a vacant heaven would offer you its throne.   
think of what those who will come after us will say.   
    save us from hector's god, from hector, and from hector's force.   
i go down on my knees to you, achilles.   

i must admire your courage, father friend,   
for treating me as if i was a fool.   
i shall deal with hector as i want to.   
you and your fellow countrymen will die   
for how your king has treated me.   

    i have spent five years fighting for your king.   
my record is ten coastal and ten inland cities   
burnt to the ground. their males, massacred.   
their cattle, and their women, given to him.   
among the rest, briseis the beautiful, my ribband she.   
not that i got her courtesy of him.   
she joined my stock in recognition of   
my strength, my courage, my superiority,   
courtesy of yourselves, my lords.   
    i will not fight for him.   
he aims to personalise my loss.   
briseis taken from achilles--standard practice   
helen from menelaos--war.   
    lord busy busy, building his palisade, mounting my she,   
one that i might have picked to run my house,   
raising her to the status of a wife.   
    do i hate him? yes, i hate him. hate him.   
and should he be afraid of me? he should.   
i want to harm him. i want him to feel pain.   
in his body, and between his ears.   
    i must admit,   
some of the things that you have said are true.   
but look what he has done to me to me   
the king on whom his kingliness depends   
i will not fight for him.   
    hearing your steps, i thought at last,   
my friends have come to visit me.   
they took their time about it, true--   
after he took my she none of you came--   
now, though--admittedly they are in trouble,   
serious trouble--they have arrived as friends,   
and of their own accord.   
    but you have not come here as friends.   
and you have not come of your own accord.   
you came because your king told you to come.   
you came because i am his last resort.   
and, incidentally, your last resort.   

    at least he offers stuff.   
all you have offered is advice   
keep your temper . . .   
    mind your tongue . . .   
    think what the world will say . . .'   
no mention of your king's treatment of me.   
no sign of love for me behind your tears.   
    i will not fight for him.   
    i can remember very well indeed   
the day you two grand lords came visiting my father's house, 
how i ran out to you, and took your hands--   
the greatest men that i had ever seen   
ajax, my fighting cousin, strong, brave, unafraid to   die   
nestor, the king of sandy pylos, wisdom's sword.   
and then, when all had had enough to eat and drink   
and it was sealed that i should come to troy,   
then my dear father said that lordship knows   
not only how to fight, and when to hold its tongue,   
but of the difference between a child enraged   
and honour bound lords.   
    i will not fight for him.   
    there is a king to be maintained. you are his lords.   
my fighting powers prove my inferiority.   
whatever he, through you, may grant,   
i must receive it as a favour, not of right,   
go back to him with downcast looks, a suppliant tone,   
acknowledge my transgressions--i did not   
applaud his sticky fingers on my she's meek flesh.   
    my mother says i have a choice   
live as a happy backwood king for aye   
or give the world an everlasting murmur of my name,   
and die.   
    be up tomorrow sharp   
to see me sacrifice to lord poseidon and set sail.   
    oh, yes, his gifts   
the greatest benefaction ever known.'   
    if he put heaven in my hand i would not want it.   
his offers magnify himself.   
    likewise his child.   
i do not want to trash the girl.   
she is like me. bad luck to have poor friends.   
bad luck to have his kingship as your sire.   
    my father will select my wife.   
each spring a dozen local kings drive up   
and lead their daughters naked round our yard.   
some decent local girl. my father's worth   
is all the wealth we will require.   
    you greeks will not take troy.   
you have disintegrated as a fighting force.   
troy is your cemetery. blame your king.   
the man who you say has done all he can.   
the man who has admitted he was wrong.   
but he has not done all he can.   
and he has not admitted he was wrong.   
or not to me.   
    i want him here, your king.   
his arms straight down his sides, his shoulders back,   
announcing loud and clear that he was wrong to take my she.   
apologising for that wrong, to me, the son of pleus.   
before my followers, with you, pylos and salamis,   
crete. sparta. tyrins, argos, calydon, the islands, here,   
stood to attention on either side of him.   
      that is my offer. take it, or die.   

    nestor may stay the night.   
you, dear cousin ajax, tell your king what i have said.   
preferably, in front of everyone.   
                      
                                    
                      who said,   
as my achilles lifted his guitar   

lord, i was never so bethumped with words   
since first i called my father dad.   

    the sea.   
their feet along the sand to agamemnon's gate.   
and in starlit air   
the trojans singing   

i love my wife, i love her dearly,   
      i love the hole she pisses through,   
      i love her lily-white tits   
      and her nut-brown arsehole,   
      i could eat her shit with a wooden spoon.


just then, encountering my ruddy face    
in the grand piano's cold black craquelure,    
it conjured the jack-o'-lantern moon    
dipping up over the roofs of the tenderloin.    
    
only when i have done with the myths--    
the inner spill that triggers us to flame,    
breasts so sensitive a moment's touch             
will call down fever the dark sea-lane    
    
between limbic squall and the heart's harbour--    
will i picture you, just beyond innocence,    
lying stripped by a thrown-wide window,    
letting the cool breeze covet your ardour.


it was winter, near freezing,   
i'd walked through a forest of firs   
when i saw issue out of the waterfall   
a solitary bird.   

it lit on a damp rock,   
and, as water swept stupidly on,   
wrung from its own throat   
supple, undammable song.   

it isn't mine to give.   
i can't coax this bird to my hand   
that knows the depth of the river   
yet sings of it on land.


can the bald lie? the nature of the skin says not 
it's newborn-pale, erection-tender stuff, 
every thought visible,--pure knowledge, 
mind in action--shining through the skull. 
i saw one, a woman, hairless absolute, cleaning. 
she mopped the green floor, dusted bookshelves, 
all cloth and concentration, queen of the moon. 
you can tell, with the bald, that the air 
speaks to them differently, touches their heads 
with exquisite expression. as she danced 
her laundry dance with the motes, everything 
she ever knew skittered under her scalp. 
it was clear just from the texture of her head, 
she was about to raise her arms to the sky 
i covered my ears as she prepared to sing, roar, 
to let the big win resonate in the little room.


our business is with fruit and leaf and bloom    
though they speak with more than just the season's tongue--    
the colours that they blaze from the dark loam    
all have something of the jealous tang    
    
of the dead about them. what do we know of their part    
in this, those secret brothers of the harrow,    
invigorators of the soil--oiling the dirt    
so liberally with their essence, their black marrow?    
    
but here's the question. are the flower and fruit    
held out to us in love, or merely thrust    
up at us, their masters, like a fist?    
    
or are they the lords, asleep amongst the roots,    
granting to us in their great largesse    
this hybrid thing--part brute force, part mute kiss?


when he had suckled there, he began    
to grow first, he was an infant in her arms,    
but soon, drinking and drinking at the sweet    
milk she could not keep from filling her,    
from pouring into his ravenous mouth,    
and filling again, miraculous pitcher, mercy    
feeding its own extinction . . . soon he was    
huge, towering above her, the landscape,    
his shadow stealing the color from the fields,      
even the flowers going gray. and they came    
like ants, one behind the next, to worship    
him--huge as he was, and hungry it was    
his hunger they admired most of all.    
so they brought him slaughtered beasts    
goats, oxen, bulls, and finally, their own    
kin whose hunger was a kind of shame      
to them, a shrinkage even as his was      
beautiful to them, magnified, magnificent.      
    
the day came when they had nothing left    
to offer him, having denuded themselves    
of all in order to enlarge him, in whose    
shadow they dreamed of light and that      
is when the thought began to move, small    
at first, a whisper, then a buzz, and finally,    
it broke out into words, so loud they thought    
it must be prophecy they would kill him,      
and all they had lost in his name would return,    
renewed and fresh with the dew of morning.    
hope fed their rage, sharpened their weapons.    
    
and who is she, hooded figure, mourner now    
at the fate of what she fed? and the slow rain,      
which never ends, who is the father of that?      
and who are we who speak, as if the world    
were our diorama--its little figures moved    
by hidden gears, precious in miniature, tin soldiers,    
spears the size of pins, perfect replicas, history    
under glass, dusty, old fashioned, a curiosity    
that no one any longer wants to see,    
excited as they are by the new giant, who feeds    
on air, grows daily on radio waves, in cyberspace,      
who sows darkness like a desert storm,    
who blows like a wind through the boardrooms, 
 who touches the hills, and they smoke.


it was so simple you came back to me 
and i was happy. nothing seemed to matter 
but that. that you had gone away from me 
and lived for days with him--it didn't matter. 
that i had been left to care for our old dog 
and house alone--couldn't have mattered less 
on all this, you and i and our happy dog 
agreed. we slept. the world was worriless. 

i woke in the morning, brimming with old joys 
till the fact-checker showed up, late, for work 
and started in item it's years, not days. 
item you had no dog. item she isn't back, 
in fact, she just remarried. and oh yes, item you 
left her, remember? i did? i did. i do.


never mind thick night darkness move quick   
madness engulf me like jacob's coat   
colors tighten like sickness 'round me throat.   
wha it is do already can't tek back   
but it still got me a wash me hand   
til they sour and callus, de visions   
plaguing de dark a me mind like locust.   

me conscience no business dem days   
when me could grin up and skin teet     
inna company of great men   
who smile up smile up wid me   
an looking fava   inna secret eyes an backdoor smiles.   
i know say woman like me plain wicked an conniving   
stinkin' wid ambition, smilin' close against you skin,   
seeking confession wid de devil.   

now so, me lay up inna bed wid death   
a-write me love letter. got me   
a crave colors to soothe me spirit

and white--mek me breast feel weight down   
wid milk, got me head swirling like inna hurricane.   
i chew down me bitter nails til i taste de poison

twilight folds over houses on our street   
its hazy gold is gilding our front lawns,   
delineating asphalt and concrete   
driveways with shadows. evening is coming on,   
quietly, like a second drink, the beers   
men hold while rising from their plastic chairs   
to stand above their sprinklers, and approve.   

soon the fireflies will rise in lucent droves--   
for now, however, everything seems content   
to settle into archetypal grooves   
the toddler's portraits chalked out on cement,   
mothers in windows, finishing the dishes.   
chuck connelly's cigarette has burned to ashes   
he talks politics to roger in the drive.   

it's all someone can do just to survive,   
he says, and nods--both nod--and pops another   
beer from the cooler. no rain. would you believe--   
says chuck, checking the paper for the weather.   
at least a man can keep his yard in shape.   
somewhere beyond this plotted cityscape   
their sons drive back and forth in borrowed cars   

how small their city seems now, and how far   
away they feel from last year, when they rode   
their bikes to other neighborhoods, to score   
a smoke or cop a feel in some girl's bed.   
they tune the radio to this summer's song   
and cruise into the yet-to-exhale lung   
of august night. nothing to do but this.   

these are the times they'd never dream they'll miss--   
the hour spent chasing a party long burned out,   
graphic imagined intercourse with denise.   
this is all they can even think about,   
and thankfully, since what good would it do   
to choke on madeleines of   temps perdu    
when so much time is set aside for that?   

not that their fathers weaken with regret   
as nighttime settles in--no, their wives   
are on the phone, the cooler has labatt   
to spare at nine the giants play the braves.   
there may be something to romanticize   
about their own first cars, the truths and lies   
they told their friends about some summer fling,   

but what good is it now, when anything   
recalled is two parts true and one part false?   
when no one can remember just who sang   
that song that everybody loved? what else?   
it doesn't come to mind. the sprinkler spits   
in metronome they're out of cigarettes.   
roger folds up his chair, calls it a day.   

the stars come out in cosmic disarray,   
and windows flash with television blues.   
the husbands come to bed, nothing to say   
but   'night . two hours late--with some excuse--   
their sons come home, too full of songs and girls   
to notice dew perfect its muted pearls   
or countless crickets singing for a mate.


families when a child is born
hope it will turn out intelligent.
i, through intelligence
having wrecked my whole life,
only hope that the baby will prove
ignorant and stupid.
then he'll be happy all his days
and grow into a cabinet minister.



my candle burns at both ends
    it will not last the night
 but ah, my foes, and oh, my friends--
    it gives a lovely light


the great gold apples of night
hang from the street's long bough
       dripping their light
on the faces that drift below,
on the faces that drift and blow
down the night-time, out of sight
       in the wind's sad sough.

the ripeness of these apples of night
distilling over me
       makes sickening the white
ghost-flux of faces that hie
them endlessly, endlessly by
without meaning or reason why
       they ever should be.


there's a flutter of grey through the trees
   ah, the exquisite curves of her dress as she passes
   fleet with her feet on the path where the grass is

i see not her face, i but see
   the swift re-appearance, the flitting persistence--
   there--of that flutter of grey in the distance.

it has flickered and fluttered away
   what a teasing regret she has left in my day-dream,
   and what dreams of delight are the dreams that one may 
         dream

it was only a flutter of grey
   but the vaguest of raiment's impossible chances
   has set my heart beating the way of old dances.


                                  i

to dream of love, and, waking, to remember you
as though, being dead, one dreamed of heaven, and woke
      in hell.
at night my lovely dreams forget the old farewell
ah wake not by his side, lest you remember too

                                  ii

i set all rome between us with what joy i set
the wonder of the world against my world's delight
rome, that hast conquered worlds, with intellectual might
capture my heart, and teach my memory to forget


from tablet writing, babylonian excavations of the th millennium b.c.
bilbea, i was in babylon on saturday night.
i saw nothing of you anywhere.
i was at the old place and the other girls were there, 
but no bilbea.

have you gone to another house? or city?
why don't you write?
i was sorry. i walked home half-sick.

tell me how it goes.
send me some kind of a letter.
and take care of yourself.



love faded in my heart--
i thought it was dead.
now new flowers start,
fresh leaves outspread.
why do these flowers upstart
and again the leaves spread?
oh, when will it be dead--
this root that tears my heart



the man moves earth 
to dispel grief. 
he digs holes 
the size of cars. 
in proportion to what is taken 
what is given multiplies-- 
rain-swollen ponds 
and dirt mounds 
rooted with flame-tipped flowers. 
he carries trees like children 
struggling to be set down. 
trees that have lived 
out their lives, 
he cuts and stacks 
like loaves of bread 
which he will feed the fire. 
the green smoke sweetens 
his house. 

the woman sweeps air 
to banish sadness. 
she dusts floors, 
polishes objects 
made of clay and wood. 
in proportion to what is taken 
what is given multiplies-- 
the task of something 
else to clean. 
gleaming appliances 
beg to be smudged, 
breathed upon by small children 
and large animals 
flicking out hope 
as she whirls by, 
flap of tongue, 
scratch of paw, 
sweetly reminding her. 

the man moves earth, 
the woman sweeps air. 
together they pull water 
out of the other, 
pull with the muscular 
ache of the living, 
hauling from the deep 
well of the body 
the rain-swollen, 
the flame-tipped, 
the milk-fed-- 
all that cycles 
through lives moving, 
lives sweeping, water 
circulating between them 
like breath, 
drawn out of leaves by light.


we were very tired, we were very merry--

we had gone back and forth all night on the ferry.

it was bare and bright, and smelled like a stable--

but we looked into a fire, we leaned across a table,

we lay on a hill-top underneath the moon

and the whistles kept blowing, and the dawn came soon. 


we were very tired, we were very merry--

we had gone back and forth all night on the ferry 

and you ate an apple, and i ate a pear, 

from a dozen of each we had bought somewhere 

and the sky went wan, and the wind came cold, 

and the sun rose dripping, a bucketful of gold. 


we were very tired, we were very merry,

we had gone back and forth all night on the ferry.

we hailed, good morrow, mother to a shawl-covered head, 

and bought a morning paper, which neither of us read

and she wept, god bless you for the apples and pears,

and we gave her all our money but our subway fares.


eleven o'clock, and the curtain falls.
the cold wind tears the strands of illusion 
the delicate music is lost
in the blare of home-going crowds
and a midnight paper.

the night has grown martial
it meets us with blows and disaster. 
even the stars have turned shrapnel, 
fixed in silent explosions.
and here at our door 
the moonlight is laid 
like a drawn sword.



once, in the city of kalamazoo,   
the gods went walking, two and two,   
with the friendly phoenix, the stars of orion,   
the speaking pony and singing lion.   
for in kalamazoo in a cottage apart   
lived the girl with the innocent heart. 

thenceforth the city of kalamazoo   
was the envied, intimate chum of the sun.   
he rose from a cave by the principal street.   
the lions sang, the dawn-horns blew,   
and the ponies danced on silver feet.   
he hurled his clouds of love around   
deathless colors of his old heart 
draped the houses and dyed the ground.   
o shrine of the wide young yankee land,   
incense city of kalamazoo,   
that held, in the midnight, the priceless sun   
as a jeweller holds an opal in hand 

from the awkward city of oshkosh came 
love the bully no whip shall tame, 
bringing his gang of sinners bold. 
and i was the least of his oshkosh men 
but none were reticent, none were old. 
and we joined the singing phoenix then, 
and shook the lilies of kalamazoo   
all for one hidden butterfly.   
bulls of glory, in cars of war   
we charged the boulevards, proud to die   
for her ribbon sailing there on high.   
our blood set gutters all aflame,   
where the sun slept without any heat-- 
cold rock till he must rise again.   
she made great poets of wolf-eyed men-- 
the dear queen-bee of kalamazoo,   
with her crystal wings, and her honey heart.   
we fought for her favors a year and a day   
oh, the bones of the dead, the oshkosh dead,   
that were scattered along her pathway red   
and then, in her harum-scarum way,   
she left with a passing traveller-man-- 
with a singing irishman   
went to japan. 

why do the lean hyenas glare 
where the glory of artemis had begun-- 
of atalanta, joan of arc, 
cinderella, becky thatcher, 
and orphant annie, all in one? 
who burned this city of kalamazoo 
till nothing was left but a ribbon or two-- 
one scorched phoenix that mourned in the dew, 
acres of ashes, a junk-man's cart, 
a torn-up letter, a dancing shoe, 
and the bones of the dead, the dead? 
who burned this city of kalamazoo-- 
love-town, troy-town kalamazoo? 

a harum-scarum innocent heart.


a chant for boys with manly voices
every line sung one step deeper than the line preceding
any sky-bird sings,
         ring, ring
any church-chime rings,
         dong ding
any cannon says,
         boom bang
any whirlwind says,
         whing whang
the bell-buoy hums and roars,
         ding dong
and way down deep,
where fishes throng,
by davy jones' big deep?sea door,
shaking the ocean's flowery floor,
his door-bell booms
         dong dong,
         dong dong,
deep, deep down,
         clang boom,
         boom dong.


there's machinery in the butterfly
         there's a mainspring to the bee
there's hydraulics to a daisy,
         and contraptions to a tree.

if we could see the birdie
         that makes the chirping sound
with x-ray, scientific eyes,
    we could see the wheels go round.

and i hope all men 
who think like this 
will soon lie 
underground.


why do you subdue yourself in golds and purples?   
why do you dim yourself with folded silks? 
do you not see that i can buy brocades in any draper's shop,   
and that i am choked in the twilight of all these colors. 
how pale you would be, and startling--   
how quiet 
but your curves would spring upward   
like a clear jet of flung water, 
you would quiver like a shot-up spray of water,   
you would waver, and relapse, and tremble.   
and i too should tremble, 
watching. 

murex-dyes and tinsel-- 
and yet i think i could bear your beauty unshaded.


all day i have watched the purple vine leaves
fall into the water.
and now in the moonlight they still fall,
but each leaf is fringed with silver.


barque of phosphor
 on the palmy beach,
  
 move outward into heaven,
 into the alabasters
 and night blues.
  
 foam and cloud are one.
 sultry moon-monster
 are dissolving.
  
 fill your black hull
 with white moonlight.
  
 there will never be an end
 to this droning of the surf.



i placed a jar in tennessee,   
and round it was, upon a hill.   
it made the slovenly wilderness   
surround that hill. 

the wilderness rose up to it, 
and sprawled around, no longer wild.   
the jar was round upon the ground   
and tall and of a port in air. 

it took dominion everywhere.   
the jar was gray and bare. 
it did not give of bird or bush,   
like nothing else in tennessee.


once more the storm is howling, and half hid   
under this cradle-hood and coverlid   
my child sleeps on. there is no obstacle   
but gregory's wood and one bare hill   
whereby the haystack and roof-levelling wind,   
bred on the atlantic, can be stayed   
and for an hour i have walked and prayed   
because of the great gloom that is in my mind. 

i have walked and prayed for this young child an hour, 
and heard the sea-wind scream upon the tower, 
and under the arches of the bridge, and scream 
in the elms above the flooded stream 
imagining in excited reverie 
that the future years had come   
dancing to a frenzied drum   
out of the murderous innocence of the sea. 

may she be granted beauty, and yet not   
beauty to make a stranger's eye distraught,   
or hers before a looking-glass for such,   
being made beautiful overmuch,   
consider beauty a sufficient end,   
lose natural kindness, and maybe   
the heart-revealing intimacy   
that chooses right, and never find a friend. 

helen, being chosen, found life flat and dull,   
and later had much trouble from a fool   
while that great queen that rose out of the spray,   
being fatherless, could have her way,   
yet chose a bandy-leggd smith for man.   
it's certain that fine women eat   
a crazy salad with their meat   
whereby the horn of plenty is undone. 

in courtesy i'd have her chiefly learned   
hearts are not had as a gift, but hearts are earned   
by those that are not entirely beautiful.   
yet many, that have played the fool 
for beauty's very self, has charm made wise   
and many a poor man that has roved,   
loved and thought himself beloved,   
from a glad kindness cannot take his eyes. 

may she become a flourishing hidden tree,   
that all her thoughts may like the linnet be,   
and have no business but dispensing round   
their magnanimities of sound   
nor but in merriment begin a chase,   
nor but in merriment a quarrel.   
oh, may she live like some green laurel   
rooted in one dear perpetual place. 

my mind, because the minds that i have loved,   
the sort of beauty that i have approved,   
prosper but little, has dried up of late,   
yet knows that to be choked with hate   
may well be of all evil chances chief.   
if there's no hatred in a mind   
assault and battery of the wind   
can never tear the linnet from the leaf. 

an intellectual hatred is the worst,   
so let her think opinions are accursed.   
have i not seen the loveliest woman born 
out of the mouth of plenty's horn,   
because of her opinionated mind   
barter that horn and every good   
by quiet natures understood   
for an old bellows full of angry wind? 

considering that, all hatred driven hence,   
the soul recovers radical innocence   
and learns at last that it is self-delighting, 
self-appeasing, self-affrighting,   
and that its own sweet will is heaven's will,   
she can, though every face should scowl   
and every windy quarter howl   
or every bellows burst, be happy still. 

and may her bridegroom bring her to a house   
where all's accustomed, ceremonious   
for arrogance and hatred are the wares   
peddled in the thoroughfares.   
how but in custom and in ceremony   
are innocence and beauty born?   
ceremony's a name for the rich horn,   
and custom for the spreading laurel tree.


there is the sudden silence of the crowd 

above a player not moving on the field, 

and the silence of the orchid. 


the silence of the falling vase 

before it strikes the oor, 

the silence of the belt when it is not striking the child. 


the stillness of the cup and the water in it, 

the silence of the moon 

and the quiet of the day far from the roar of the sun. 


the silence when i hold you to my chest, 

the silence of the window above us, 

and the silence when you rise and turn away. 


and there is the silence of this morning 

which i have broken with my pen, 

a silence that had piled up all night 


like snow falling in the darkness of the house-- 

the silence before i wrote a word 

and the poorer silence now.


the sea-wash never ends.
the sea-wash repeats, repeats.
only old songs? is that all the sea knows?
             only the old strong songs?
             is that all?
the sea-wash repeats, repeats.



sorrow is my own yard 
where the new grass 
flames as it has flamed 
often before, but not 
with the cold fire 
that closes round me this year. 
thirty-five years 
i lived with my husband. 
the plum tree is white today 
with masses of flowers. 
masses of flowers 
load the cherry branches 
and color some bushes 
yellow and some red, 
but the grief in my heart 
is stronger than they, 
for though they were my joy 
formerly, today i notice them 
and turn away forgetting. 
today my son told me 
that in the meadows, 
at the edge of the heavy woods 
in the distance, he saw 
trees of white flowers. 
i feel that i would like 
to go there 
and fall into those flowers 
and sink into the marsh near them.


i do not know where either of us can turn 
just at first, waking from the sleep of each other. 
i do not know how we can bear 
the river struck by the gold plummet of the moon, 
or many trees shaken together in the darkness. 
we shall wish not to be alone 
and that love were not dispersed and set free-- 
though you defeat me, 
and i be heavy upon you. 

but like earth heaped over the heart 
is love grown perfect. 
like a shell over the beat of life 
is love perfect to the last. 
so let it be the same 
whether we turn to the dark or to the kiss of another 
let us know this for leavetaking, 
that i may not be heavy upon you, 
that you may blind me no more. 



the dark is thrown 
back from the brightness, like hair 
cast over a shoulder. 
i am alone, 

four years older 
like the chairs and the walls 
which i once watched brighten 
with you beside me. i was to waken 
never like this, whatever came or was taken. 

the stalk grows, the year beats on the wind. 
apples come, and the month for their fall. 
the bark spreads, the roots tighten. 
though today be the last 
or tomorrow all, 
you will not mind. 

that i may not remember 
does not matter. 
i shall not be with you again. 
what we knew, even now 
must scatter 
and be ruined, and blow 
like dust in the rain. 

you have been dead a long season 
and have less than desire 
who were lover with lover 
and i have life--that old reason 
to wait for what comes, 
to leave what is over. 



a poem should be palpable and mute   
as a globed fruit, 

dumb 
as old medallions to the thumb, 

silent as the sleeve-worn stone 
of casement ledges where the moss has grown-- 

a poem should be wordless   
as the flight of birds. 

                                        

a poem should be motionless in time   
as the moon climbs, 

leaving, as the moon releases 
twig by twig the night-entangled trees, 

leaving, as the moon behind the winter leaves,   
memory by memory the mind-- 

a poem should be motionless in time   
as the moon climbs. 

                                        

a poem should be equal to 
not true. 

for all the history of grief 
an empty doorway and a maple leaf. 

for love 
the leaning grasses and two lights above the sea-- 

a poem should not mean   
but be. 



farmhouses curl like horns of plenty, hide   
scrawny bare shanks against a barn, or crouch   
empty in the shadow of a mountain. here   
there is no house at all-- 

only the bones of a house, 
lilacs growing beside them, 
roses in clumps between them,   
honeysuckle over 
a gap for a door, a chimney 
mud-chinked, an immense fireplace,   
the skeleton of a pine, 

and gandy dancers working on the rails 
that run not thirty yards from the once door. 

i heard a gandy dancer playing on a jew's harp   
where is now that merry party i remember long ago?   
nelly was a lady ... twice ... old black joe, 
as if he laid his right hand on my shoulder, 
saying, your father lived here long ago, 
your father's father built the house, lies buried   
under the pine-- 
                         sing nelly was a lady   
... blue juniata ... old black joe 

for sometimes a familiar music hammers 
like blood against the eardrums, paints a mist   
across the eyes, as if the smells of lilacs,   
moss roses, and the past became a music   
made visible, a monument of air.


these lovers' inklings which our loves enmesh,   
lost to the cunning and dimensional eye,   
though tenemented in the selves we see,   
not more perforce than azure to the sky,   
were necromancy-juggled to the flesh,   
and startled from no daylight you or me. 

for trance and silvemess those moons commend,   
which blanch the warm life silver-pale or look   
what ghostly portent mist distorts from slight   
clay shapes the willows that the waters took   
liquid and brightened in the waters bend,   
and we, in love's reflex, seemed loved of right. 

then no more think to net forthwith love's thing,   
but cast for it by spirit sleight-of-hand 
then only in the slant glass contemplate,   
where lineament outstripping line is scanned,   
then on the perplexed text leave pondering,   
love's proverb is set down transliterate.


i met a man in south street, tall-- 
a nervous shark tooth swung on his chain.   
his eyes pressed through green glass   
--green glasses, or bar lights made them   
so-- 
      shine-- 
                green-- 
                           eyes--

or are there frontiers--running sands sometimes   
running sands--somewhere--sands running . . . 
or they may start some white machine that sings.   
then you may laugh and dance the axletree--

      and sleep another thousand--

swinging summer entrances to cooler hells . . .   
outside a wharf truck nearly ran him down

o carib isle 

the tarantula rattling at the lily's foot 
across the feet of the dead, laid in white sand   
near the coral beach--nor zigzag fiddle crabs   
side-stilting from the path that shift, subvert 
and anagrammatize your name--no, nothing here   
below the palsy that one eucalyptus lifts   
in wrinkled shadows--mourns. 

                                        and yet suppose 
i count these nacreous frames of tropic death,   
brutal necklaces of shells around each grave   
squared off so carefully. then 

to the white sand i may speak a name, fertile 
albeit in a stranger tongue. tree names, flower names   
deliberate, gainsay death's brittle crypt. meanwhile   
the wind that knots itself in one great death-- 
coils and withdraws. so syllables want breath. 

but where is the captain of this doubloon isle 
without a turnstile? who but catchword crabs 
patrols the dry groins of the underbrush? 
what man, or what 
is commissioner of mildew throughout the ambushed senses?   
his carib mathematics web the eyes' baked lenses 

under the poinciana, of a noon or afternoon 
let fiery blossoms clot the light, render my ghost   
sieved upward, white and black along the air   
until it meets the blue's comedian host. 

let not the pilgrim see himself again 
for slow evisceration bound like those huge terrapin   
each daybreak on the wharf, their brine-caked eyes 
--spiked, overturned such thunder in their strain   
and clenched beaks coughing for the surge again 

slagged of the hurricane--i, cast within its flow,   
congeal by afternoons here, satin and vacant. 
you have given me the shell, satan,--carbonic amulet   
sere of the sun exploded in the sea.


i 

he whom we anatomized 
whose words we gathered as pleasant flowers 
and thought on his wit and how neatly he described things'   
speaks 
to us, hatching marrow, 
broody all night over the bones of a deadman. 

my tongue is a curve in the ear. vision is lies. 
we saw is so and it was not so, 
the emperor with the golden hands, the virgin in blue.   
--a blazing parchment, 
matthew paris his kings in blue and gold. 

it was not so, 
scratched on black by god knows who,   
by god, by god knows who. 

in the dark in fetters 
on bended elbows i supported my weak back 
hulloing to muffled walls blank again 
unresonant. it was gone, is silent, is always silent. 
my soundbox lacks sonority. all but inaudible 
i stammer to my ear 
naked speech naked beggar both blind and cold 
wrap it for my sake in paisley shawls and bright soft fabric,   
wrap it in curves and cover it with sleek lank hair. 

what trumpets? what bright hands? fetters, it was the emperor   
with magic in darkness, i unforewained. 
the golden hands are not in averrhoes, 
eyes lie and this swine's fare bread and water 
makes my head wuzz. have pity, have pity on me 

to the right was darkness and to the left hardness   
below hardness darkness above 
at the feet darkness at the head partial hardness   
with equal intervals without 
to the left moaning and beyond a scurry.   
in those days rode the good lorraine 
whom english burned at rouen, 
the day's bones whitening in centuries' dust. 

then he saw his ghosts glitter with golden hands,   
the emperor sliding up and up from his tomb   
alongside charles. these things are not obliterate.   
white gobs spitten for mockery 
and i too shall have cy gist, written over me. 

remember, imbeciles and wits,   
sots and ascetics, fair and foul,   
young girls with little tender tits,   
that death is written over all. 

worn hides that scarcely clothe the soul   
they are so rotten, old and thin, 
or firm and soft and warm and full--   
fellmonger death gets every skin. 

all that is piteous, all that's fair,   
all that is fat and scant of breath,   
elisha's baldness, helen's hair,   
is death's collateral 

three score and ten years after sight   
of this pay me your pulse and breath   
value received. and who dare cite,   
as we forgive our debtors, death? 

abelard and eloise, 
henry the fowler, charlemagne,   
gene, lopokova, all these 
die, die in pain. 

and general grant and general lee,   
patti and florence nightingale,   
like tyro and antiope 
drift among ghosts in hell, 

know nothing, are nothing, save a fume   
driving across a mind 
preoccupied with this our doom   
is, to be sifted by the wind, 

heaped up, smoothed down like silly sands.   
we are less permanent than thought. 
the emperor with the golden hands 

is still a word, a tint, a tone, 
insubstantial-glorious, 
when we ourselves are dead and gone   
and the green grass growing over us.

let his days be few and let 
his bishoprick pass to another, 
for he fed me on carrion and on a dry crust,   
mouldy bread that his dogs had vomited, 
i lying on my back in the dark place, in the grave,   
fettered to a post in the damp cellarage. 
            whereinall we differ not. but they have swept the floor,   
there are no dancers, no somersaulters now,   
only bricks and bleak black cement and bricks,   
only the military tread and the snap of the locks. 
            mine was a threeplank bed whereon   
i lay and cursed the weary sun. 
they took away the prison clothes 
and on the frosty nights i froze. 
i had a bible where i read 
that jesus came to raise the dead-- 
i kept myself from going mad 
by singing an old bawdy ballad 
and birds sang on my windowsill 
and tortured me till i was ill, 
but archipiada came to me 
and comforted my cold body 
and circe excellent utterer of her mind 
lay with me in that dungeon for a year 
making a silk purse from an old sow's ear 
till ronsard put a thimble on her tongue. 
    whereinall we differ not. but they have named all the stars,   
trodden down the scrub of the desert, run the white moon to a schedule,   
joshua's serf whose beauty drove men mad. 
they have melted the snows from erebus, weighed the clouds,   
hunted down the white bear, hunted the whale the seal the kangaroo,   
they have set private enquiry agents onto archipiada 
what is your name? your maiden name? 
go in there to be searched. i suspect it is not your true name.   
distinguishing marks if any? o anthropometrics 
now the thumbprints for filing. 
colour of hair? of eyes? of hands? o bertillon 
how many golden prints on the smudgy page? 
homer? adest. dante? adest. 
adsunt omnes, omnes et 
villon. 
villon? 
blacked by the sun, washed by the rain, 
hither and thither scurrying as the wind varies.

under the olive trees   
walking alone 
on the green terraces   
very seldom 
over the sea seldom 
where it ravelled and spun 
blue tapestries white and green 
gravecloths of men   
romans and modern men   
and the men of the sea 
who have neither nation nor time 
on the mountains seldom   
the white mountains beyond 
or the brown mountains between 
and their drifting echoes 
in the clouds and over the sea 
in shrines on their ridges 
the goddess of the country 
silverplated in silk and embroidery 
with offerings of pictures 
little ships and arms   
below me the ports   
with naked breasts   
shipless spoiled sacked   
because of the beauty of helen 



i woke up this mornin'   
'bout half-past three.   
all the womens in town   
was gathered round me. 

sweet gals was a-moanin',   
sylvester's gonna die 
and a hundred pretty mamas   
bowed their heads to cry. 

i woke up little later 
'bout half-past fo', 
the doctor n' undertaker's   
both at ma do'. 

black gals was a-beggin', 
you can't leave us here   
brown-skins cryin', daddy   
honey baby don't go, dear 

but i felt ma time's a-comin',   
and i know'd i's dyin' fast. 
i seed the river jerden 
a-creepin' muddy past-- 
but i's still sweet papa 'vester,   
yes, sir long as life do last 

so i hollers, com'ere, babies,   
fo' to love yo' daddy right 
and i reaches up to hug 'em-- 
when the lawd put out the light. 

then everything was darkness   
in a great ... big ... night.


and lightening? one meaning of that
beyond the usual sense of alleviation,
illumination, and so on, is this

a phenomenal instant when the spirit flares
with pure exhilaration before death--
the good thief in us harking to the promise

so paint him on christ's right hand, on a promontory
scanning empty space, so body-racked he seems
untranslatable into the bliss

ached for at the moon-rim of his forehead,
by nail-craters on the dark side of his brain
this day thou shall be with me in paradise.


i'm feeling by ear.

consider them gods and not cruel but ecstatic.
they have trick tongues and can't talk straight but use us as waves to curve words.
in this moment we are here for their ride. climb on under.
transport poetics in the transtraditionals, revering rumors revved high.
we ask forgiveness for poem talk. i'm on her knees.

she makes me say these things because she is a middle way like no other.

the method is to wear me down to a base line vital pulse.
next pour right through carefully following the barely perceptible impulse.
almost dreams the state resists the name but go ahead and call it poetic that flares.
poetics remains neutral on its name but takes care when it comes to hers.
there's a watch out on her names.

it makes me wait until i have nothing else to fight with and then sets me loose.

when i think what is being said i get a lump in the stomach.
no go on the intellectual gizmo.
yes on any kind of lift, free run, no drift, too swift, the actual thing getting a lift.
it hits the beat like rock bottom.
the tongue gets hands on quick.

the hearback suddenly gets high in the sense of crossing right on over.

Nico Vassilakis returns to Jacket2 with a new feature on the current state of visual poetry in Finland. “There’s a stir going on, a textual free-for-all, a visible shift in how language is being handled in response to the machines in our lives,” he notes. “In Finland, visual poetry, in some way, sprang up almost fully formed. There are few antecedents that point to its appearance, yet here it is. The fully mature mingle with the nascent and in so doing form a new constellation of visual poetries.”a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  i  j  k  l  m  n  o  p  q  r  s  t  u  v  w  x  y  z

If a line leafs, as leaves follow flowers
fading before they have ever happened,
that is spring, and this is language.
A simultaneity happens that has never happened —
speaking to you now of magnolias
edging brown before description —
before description allows itself to be enacted
before magnolias transition from winter bud, possibly
to scatter on sidewalk. Before us, before we
have walked over them before us. They develop in
time that moves through us, even as we move against
it, losing a day as we float backward past datelines and
equators, in time that moves whether in space or in motion
that time is in our body, and while in our minds, which
are energies made of an incessant construction of the various
entities of our body rubbing against each other in constant
reorganization of combustion and transmission — even in
our mind-energies, there is only simultaneity — our multiple
consciousness frames events as one happening relational, the trip
10 years ago jostles the plan for employment — memory
is future — we remember as to be able to travel forward — if
we do not, would not, dwell in the past we become disorganized
our parts no longer able to communicate: communication depends on
electrical flash mobilized from pt. A to pt. B and instantly back
again creating a simultaneous line of both and all directions,
even affecting all the points, creating not a circle but a woven
sphere within spheres and triangle and all ovoid, rectangles, elliptical —
cohered into a cone that travelled through by plane then wears
on the body, again the body is time in that these instantaneous,
multidirectional, simultaneous communiqués show by their
energies, or no, there is no cause right now to find. Instead, display
what seems to be a passage of time thru the body, but the
body is time — nothing passes through it, time is not a river
but the body in beautiful entropy, is of it, not just in it,
Cannot be described in conjunction or as other.
Just body/time without equal sign. But nature is a temple,
filled with living pillars, the flat plane passes through the cone
made of many geometric parts, the cone is altered, the plane
has passed through and has not happened yet, the plane is memory
and the cone is what is being assembled, always under construction,
a collection of tangents, and as plane passes through, small pieces
cling to it, journeying elsewhere and leaving cone eroded, as
living pillars speak in blurry languages, what they say is mistranslated
they may be in the temple of nature, or of it, or the temple is
where time becomes the entity we always imagined it to be,
something separate and comprehensible in that separation
from us, to be able to stand apart like a pillar and observe, even if
for one second, a second occurring with all the other seconds
around it, companionably, to make a minute that occurs with
all the other minutes, to take a hold of, like grabbing a river,
That which exactly what it is not and therefore maybe might be.
The space between eye and eye elided in transmission
of gazing at self in a mirror and looking once and
at the other organ of vision, the brain compensates and reaches
conclusion before induction has even laddered.              The nights let us have leaves
 
                       we have them           the leaves have let us
 
            & then they let us
 
                                     smaller
 (toll)  
To sentence is to seizure.
(that much we agree on?)
A caesura cut in               space/a splice 
                 or white ribbon tying 
                 & untying anguish 
                 to language. 
“What then is the size of the loss?” 
Is it measured by the darkness of the archives
where each word clings
                 tenuously
to its orbital aura — a page, a scrap
                 a frayed map
singed at the edges, standing wave
                  reverb.
Catapult, elegy, expenditure. 
“Every word teeming and bereft.”
Murmur nocturne, weep aubade.  
 
 
(pledge)  
At night the <altered> precise
possibilities for <stopping> speaking
dissolve <persist> into the whiteness
joining a blink & a <disjointed> waver —         
“the beyond         
 is in the          
surface”        
weaving calliope migraine
to reclaim the remnant, translating
the dead out of their rubbleinto a language of messianic
                                                                                                      shimmer 
Yeah, but the old franchise on dulcor 
                 is kaput. 
 
 
(torques) 
“To thread thru rant/a wire”
                “to write just small, though hungry” 
To fall asleep
                in the low ghost’s
strange hope
                for words. 
A question
                mark makes 
a world by 
                marring. 
But living is what comes before
the amends for living.
                After is for making
                the broken into
letters that can
                regather
                the scattered.
A poem is a séance
between any
two persons.
A point anywhere along a line
running from ruin to gift.  
 
 
(pitch) 
“All serifs are seraphim,” folded in the 
margins, the unruly dream 
of a text that would 
mend an alphabet. 
But if A = null-a 
the impossible repair will
                  always be deferred.  
Aptly, the trace of 
disaster scores 
what it carries —
                a continual sonata for
escaping 
                entropy. 
                Splathed across
its full range, it lights
itself by
                fracture.
Jagged hosannahs where
                enigma becomes kerygma.
 
 
(surge)

Is this a book?
                No, but each letter’s
                                a rift/in the hinge
                                of the text.
Distance elides us. Letters recombine.
God, according to the Sefer Yetzirah, only needed 22 to create the entire world — 
how very thrifty of him! But we grow older in letters, wearied by them, worried 
by them — how do we re-invent the letter?
 
                                Inside
the vacant room the letter
                                drops to the floor.
                The white saw of its ash
                cuts a groove
in the grain of the wood.
                And the operable lexicon is swarming with bad apples.
Yet disaster is also
song, its splendid
crowbar
                smashing windows, prying locks
cobbling
thatness out of shatteredness. 
A spidered quire barbed with
                fonts of sunlight. A
gathering of signatures crowned
                with burst bind.
