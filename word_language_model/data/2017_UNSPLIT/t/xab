My son said Daddy are there words for everything? I said You mean the space betweenThe clouds? "Yes! "No!Like those who love to think one word will take care of Maupassant's tree and his landlady.But it turns out you will get no further than the words that reach and do not touch.X uses a hard word one per poem like throwing a true diamond sale or throwing a Ruby on a Corten steel table, a little gold in cardboard. There is a country whereThey make their own cardboard.

My old dead father put it to meWomen of an "intimate ageReconciled all separationHe sung it outOh family ways, ah family waysThe song contained a pregnant pause pun praisePatiently he observed, as the rat jumped outPatient in music, patient in clayPatient in love and in death, a satisfied ghost





The Box Kite
 

The lift, the very lift and pull of it!
They'd wasted the summer morning,

father and son in the devil's
breath of July--gnats wheeling

madly above the drive--pasting Sunday comics 
across the struts, like the canvas skin

of a Sopwith Camel. Into the close-gnawn yard
with its humpback boulder, 

they dragged it triumphantly, unreeling the twine
until the contraption yanked itself

from bald earth, high above
the matchbox houses on the verge

of woods and the sweet-smelling bog,
to a height where a boy might peer over the horizon

to Boston--and beyond, the ocean.
The son was my father. I tottered at his legs, 

having borrowed his name and my grandfather's.
They payed out the ramshackle affair 

until it became a postage stamp. The line
burned a bloody groove into my palms,

the last time they stood at ease with each other.






Thoreau
 

That oily bale of rags, lost
to the silent architectures of the wood--
or so it seemed, as the fall's chancels
darkened, and rough earth gave and forgave.
Forgave, I mean, the intrusion.






Over the Dead Flatness of the Fens
 

Like columns of mist
in some temple to a vanished god,
the late cloud-stacks mass over a June
reduced to the sickly greens of the Norfolk broads;

and, above the steam-soiled mess
where earthworms grovel, where lumpish toads
set up the resistances of grace,
where badgers undermine the tarred road,

I watch the canvas of that underpainted sky
through a jellied glass of vermouth
while the gravestone crops up
and an oily wind steels itself to the south.

There certain winged creatures
from a century misplaced on shelves
take the day down with a moaning chant
known to themselves.






Evolution of My Block
 

As a boy I bicycled the block
w/a brown mop top falling
into a tail bleached blond,

gold-like under golden light,
like colors of Noble Knights
'banging on corners, unconcerned

w/the colors I bore--a shorty
too small to war with, too brown
to be down for the block.

White Knights became brown
Kings still showing black & gold 
on corners now crowned, 

the block a branch branded
w/la corona graffitied on
garage doors by the pawns.

As a teen, I could've beamed 
the crown, walked in w/out 
the beat down custom, 

warred w/my cousin 
who claimed Two-Six, 
the set on the next block

decked in black & beige.
But I preferred games to gangs,
books to crooks wearing hats

crooked to the left or right
fighting for a plot, a block
to spot & mark w/blood

of boys who knew no better
way to grow up than throw up
the crown & be down for whatever.






Memory of the Murdered Professors at the Jagiellonian
 

After Hasior

They fired a bullet into the head 
of each question, trying to kill Kant's 
unending argument with Hegel. 
They burned laws, moral codes, 
& the Golden Means. Anyone 
serving tea & cookies to Death, 
looking or acting as if he knew love, 
stood before the firing squad. 
All questions had to go. Pronoun 
or noun. If it crawled on busted kneecaps, 
whimpering & begging for mercy, 
it was still half of a question. 

                    *     *     *

The little skyscraper of glass boxes 
sunlight strikes the same time of day 
at a certain angle outside Zakopane 
looks like condos where nimble ghosts 
still stand up to the darkest answers. 
No, I can't hear one voice pleading. 
But I do hear gusts coming down 
from the hills. No, you're wrong again. 
The crow perched on the totem is real. 
Look at how the light lifts off its wings, 
but I wish I could understand what it is 
he's trying to say. I think I heard a name. 






The Shortest Night
 

I went into the forest searching 
for fire inside pleading wood, 
but I can't say for how long 
I was moored between worlds. 
I heard a magpie's rumination, 
but I don't know if its wings 
lifted the moon or let it drift 
slow as a little straw boat 
set ablaze on a winding river. 
I learned the yellow-eyed wolf 
is a dog & a man. A small boy 
with a star pinned to his sleeve 
was hiding among thorn bushes, 
or it was how the restless dark 
wounded the pale linden tree 
outside a Warsaw apartment. 
Night crawls under each stone 
quick as a cry held in the throat. 
All I remember is my left hand 
was holding your right breast 
when I forced my eyes shut. 
Then I could hear something 
in the room, magnanimous 
but small, half outside & half 
inside, no more than a song-- 
an insomniac's one prophecy 
pressed against the curtains, 
forcing the ferns to bloom. 






The Prelude
 

Oh this Diet Coke is really good,
though come to think of it it tastes
like nothing plus the idea of chocolate,
or an acquaintance of chocolate
speaking fondly of certain times
it and chocolate had spoken of nothing,
or nothing remembering a field
in which it once ate the most wondrous
sandwich of ham and rustic chambered cheese
yet still wished for a piece of chocolate
before the lone walk back through
the corn then the darkening forest
to the disappointing village and its super
creepy bed and breakfast. With secret despair
I returned to the city. Something 
seemed to be waiting for me. 
Maybe the "chosen guide Wordsworth 
wrote he would even were it "nothing 
better than a wandering cloud
have followed which of course to me
and everyone sounds amazing.
All I follow is my own desire, 
sometimes to feel, sometimes to be
at least a little more than intermittently
at ease with being loved. I am never
at ease. Not with hours I can read or walk
and look at the brightly colored
houses filled with lives, not with night
when I lie on my back and listen,
not with the hallway, definitely 
not with baseball, definitely 
not with time. Poor Coleridge, son
of a Vicar and a lake, he could not feel
the energy. No present joy, no cheerful
confidence, just love of friends and the wind
taking his arrow away. Come to the edge
the edge beckoned softly. Take
this cup full of darkness and stay as long
as you want and maybe a little longer.






from Sunday Morning
 

XXXVIII

Over the cliffs of the hillside: the sun
then below in the valley
the earth covered with flowers
Zurita enamored friend
takes in the sun of photosynthesis
Zurita will now never again be friend
since 7 P.M. it's been getting dark

Night is the insane asylum of the plants


XLII

Enclosed with the four walls of
a bathroom: I looked up at the ceiling
and began to clean the walls and
the floor the sink   all of it
You see: Outside the sky was God
and he was sucking at my soul --believe me!
I wiped my weeping eyes


LVII

In the narrow broken bed
restless all night
like a spent candle lit again
I thought I saw Buddha many times
At my side I felt a woman's gasp for air
but Buddha was only the pillows
and the woman is sleeping the eternal dream


LXIII

Today I dreamed that I was King
they were dressing me in black-and-white spotted pelts
Today I moo with my head about to fall
as the church bells' mournful clanging
says that milk goes to market


LXXXV

They've shaved my head
they've dressed me in these gray wool rags
--Mom keeps on smoking
I am Joan of Arc

They catalog me on microfilm


XCII

The glass is transparent like water
Dread of prisms and glass
I circle the light so as not to lose myself in them






The Desert of Atacama V
 

           Speak of the whistle of Atacama
           the wind erases like snow
           the color of that plain





i.   The Desert of Atacama soared over infinities of
     deserts to be there


ii.  Like the wind feel it pass whistling through the
     leaves of the trees


iii.  Look at it become transparent faraway   and just
     accompanied by the wind


iv.  But be careful: because if ultimately the Desert
     of Atacama where not where it should be the
     whole world would begin to whistle through the
     leaves of the trees   and when we'd see ourselves
     in the same never   transparent   whistles
     in the wind swallowing the color of this pampa





The Desert of Atacama VI
 

Arid plains do not dream
             No one has ever managed to see
             Those chimerical pampas





i.   The landscapes are convergent and divergent in the
    Desert of Atacama

ii.  Over the convergent and divergent landscape Chile
     is convergent and divergent in the Desert of Atacama

iii.  That's why what's there never was there and if it
     were to stay where it is it would see its own life turn
     around until being the chimerical plains   deserted
     enlightened   fading away like them

iv.  And when the convergent and divergent landscapes
     of the Desert of Atacama unfold themselves
     all of Chile will have been the life beyond   because
     unlike Atacama they are already extending themselves
     like a dream the deserts of our own chimera
     over there in these plains of hell





The Desert of Atacama VII
 

i.  Let's look then at the Desert of Atacama

ii. Let's look at our loneliness in the desert

So that desolate before these forms the landscape becomes
a cross extended over Chile and the loneliness of my form
then sees the redemption of the other forms:   my own
Redemption in the Desert

iii.  Then who would speak of the redemption of my form

iv.  Who would tell of the desert's loneliness

So that my form begins to touch your form and your form
that other form like that until all of Chile is nothing but
one form with open arms:   a long form crowned with thorns

v.   Then the Cross will be nothing but the opening arms
     of my form

vi.  We will then be the Crown of Thorns in the Desert

vii.  Then   nailed form to form   like a Cross
      extended over Chile   we will have seen forever
      the Final Solitary Breath of the Desert of Atacama





Authors Prayer
 

If I speak for the dead, I must leave
this animal of my body,

I must write the same poem over and over,
for an empty page is the white flag of their surrender.

If I speak for them, I must walk on the edge
of myself, I must live as a blind man

who runs through rooms without
touching the furniture.

Yes, I live. I can cross the streets asking "What year is it?
I can dance in my sleep and laugh

in front of the mirror.
Even sleep is a prayer, Lord,

I will praise your madness, and
in a language not mine, speak

of music that wakes us, music
in which we move. For whatever I say

is a kind of petition, and the darkest
days must I praise.






from The Spring Flowers Own
 


The morning after
my death
we will sit in cafs
but I will not
be there
I will not be



*



There was the great death of birds
the moon was consumed with
fire
the stars were visible
until noon.



Green was the forest drenched
with shadows
the roads were serpentine



A redwood tree stood
alone
with its lean and lit body
unable to follow the
cars that went by with
frenzy
a tree is always an immutable
traveller.



The moon darkened at dawn
the mountain quivered
with anticipation
and the ocean was double-shaded:
the blue of its surface with the
blue of flowers
mingled in horizontal water trails
there was a breeze to
witness the hour



*



The sun darkened at the
fifth hour of the
day
the beach was covered with
conversations
pebbles started to pour into holes
and waves came in like
horses.



*



The moon darkened on Christmas eve
angels ate lemons
in illuminated churches
there was a blue rug
planted with stars
above our heads
lemonade and war news
competed for our attention
                                       our breath was warmer than 

the hills.




*



There was a great slaughter of
rocks   of spring leaves
of creeks
the stars showed fully
the last king of the Mountain
gave battle
and got killed.



We lay on the grass
covered dried blood with out
bodies
green blades swayed between
our teeth.



*



We went out to sea
a bank of whales was heading
South
a young man among us a hero
tried to straddle one of the
sea creatures
his body emerged as a muddy pool
                           as mud
we waved goodbye to his remnants
happy not to have to bury
him in the early hours of the day



We got drunk in a barroom
the small town of Fairfax
had just gone to bed
cherry trees were bending under the
weight of their flowers:
they were involved in a ceremonial
dance to which no one
had ever been invited.



*



I know flowers to be funeral companions
they make poisons and venoms
and eat abandoned stone walls



I know flowers shine stronger
than the sun
                                     their eclipse means the end of 

times




but I love flowers for their treachery
their fragile bodies
grace my imagination's avenues



without their presence
my mind would be an unmarked
grave.



*



We met a great storm at sea
looked back at the
rocking cliffs
the sand was going under
black birds were
leaving
the storm ate friends and foes
alike
water turned into salt for
my wounds.



*



Flowers end in frozen patterns
artificial gardens cover
the floors
we get up close to midnight
search with powerful lights
the tiniest shrubs on the
meadows
A stream desperately is running to
the ocean




*








from The Manifestations of the Voyage
 


my house's stairway is seized
with vertigo.
Matter having forsaken its laws,
we land in hell,
ascending to heaven.



*



Shadows move along ladders
under the silence of ordinary things
there is another silence:
it belongs neither to the leaves not to the
dead



                                       with a crown of birds circling
                                                         him
                                       a child is running in an abandoned 
                                                house
                                       the stairway takes the measure of
                                        its own emptiness



I myself am the stairway that
Time has used in its
funeral course



                                        wheels lift water in the 
                                                gardens of Hama
                                            and come down
                                                not waiting for the river
                                                    to put out the fire



Here we are left with
the river Seine and Paris's poisons.
I prefer gardens where
linden trees get ready for
a lunar voyage




The stairway that separates my
room from my memory
whispers in my ear . . .




I am not at the mercy of men
since trees live in my fantasies
 men and trees long for fire
 and call for the rain
I love rains which carry desires
                                     to 
                                           oceans.



Between one airplane and
another
space is disoriented
stars sneak into holes and brides
go naked to wells




their innocence wanes under
our eyes
You and I are made from a
worm-eaten wood




                                               The Word has sunk
                                                 we are left with no cry   gesture
                                                                             or gaze
                                                 silence to us is forbidden.




We are threatened neither by life
                                            nor by death
                                                nor forced to admire the Spring




I found earth-castles on the edge
of the desert's torrents
I took their marble stairs
but could not find my way either
up or down
then I understood that I was
in a state of non-reason
and non-madness
and that the gardens of Andalusia
were standing
ready to die.

Two cities               Two tears
                                        Let insanity keep between
                                                             its skirts
                                                                 legs
                                                              within its black eyes
                                      the fright of my adolescence
                                   and the nocturnal walk on the hills:
                                       which hill?
                                I mean the kingdom that a man carries
                                         in his gut when 
                                                 his love's fulfilled.


                                Two cities which are neither Beirut
                                        nor Damascus
                                two tears: neither of alcohol nor of 
                                                           rain
                                        Yes there has been a truck
                                              and a blue-eyed woman
                                              from Russia
                                              --grey olive tree--
                                I was a butterfly caught by
                                              a fire:
                                        neither the day's not the night's
                                              but the
                                              incandescence that radiates
                                              from the body like a
                                              receding sickness,
                               Let tombs stay open!

The stairway which leads to my
room
borrows its metals from Babylon
The Prophet's Ascension
had two movements
we fell into whirlpools
of mud
and the wind followed his horse
A tempest went after
the sun's steps
The Prophet swam through waves
of clouds
a river of gold carried his
vessel
and away from the sun he reached Paradise
a Paradise made of light.



The stairway which leads to my room
leads to an observatory
I own two telescopes
to observe stars and black holes
and take mechanized stairs
which advance with no advance



my hair spins with
sunflowers



*



Illegitimate is this linden tree
which shakes by my door



let us get ready for Hell!



*



Cursed be messengers
tossing about water's tranquility
and building forest fences



Oh that the wind go quicker than us!
that we be smothered by light!




This linden tree standing by my door
weights heavy on my days
I will finally marry it
and we shall bring children
condemned to terror



this tree looks at me
with insistence:
It will be kept waiting
until Time's end.






XXXVI from The Arab Apocalypse
 

In the dark irritation of the eyes there is a snake hiding

In the exhalations of Americans there is a crumbling empire

In the foul waters of the rivers there are Palestinians

OUT OUT of its borders pain has a leash on its neck

In the wheat stalks there are insects vaccinated against bread

In the Arabian boats there are sharks shaken with laughter

In the camel's belly there are blind highways

OUT OUT of TIME there is spring's shattered hope

In the deluge on our plains there are no rains but stones






XXXIX from The Arab Apocalypse
 

When the living rot on the bodies of the dead
When the combatants' teeth become knives
When words lose their meaning and become arsenic
When the aggressors' nails become claws
When old friends hurry to join the carnage
When the victors' eyes become live shells
When clergymen pick up the hammer and crucify
When officials open the door to the enemy
When the mountain peoples' feet weigh like elephants
When roses grow only in cemeteries
When they eat the Palestinian's liver before he's even dead
When the sun itself has no other purpose than being a shroud

the human tide moves on . . .






XLIV from The Arab Apocalypse
 

Where do you want ghosts to reside?
In our wakeful hours there are flowers which produce nightmares
We burned continents of silence   the future of nations
the breathing of the fighters got thicker   became like oxen's

there is in that breath sparkles of scorched flesh and the fainting of stars

we crucify Gilgamesh on a TANK Viking II reaches Mars
Imam Ali dances over a nuclear blast
cursed are the clouds which repel water
cursed are the Arabs who fell tall and haggard eucalyptus trees






Ramadan
 

You wanted to be so hungry, you would break into branches,
and have to choose between the starving month's

nineteenth, twenty-first, and twenty-third evenings.
The liturgy begins to echo itself and why does it matter?

If the ground-water is too scarce one can stretch nets
into the air and harvest the fog.

Hunger opens you to illiteracy,
thirst makes clear the starving pattern,

the thick night is so quiet, the spinning spider pauses,
the angel stops whispering for a moment--

The secret night could already be over,
you will have to listen very carefully--

You are never going to know which night's mouth is sacredly reciting
and which night's recitation is secretly mere wind--






from The Spring Flowers Own
 

This unfinished business of my
childhood
this emerald lake

from my journey's other
side

haunts hierarchies of heavens


a palm forest
fell overnight
to make room for an unwanted
garden
ever since
fevers and swellings
turn me into a river



the streets were steep
winds were running ahead
of ships . . .



There was indeed the death of birds
the moon had passed away.


*



The morning after his death
pursuing him beyond his bitter end
his mother came to
his grave:
she removed his bones out of 

their pattern
                                and ditched them into mud:

women came at night
and claimed Rimbaud their own



that night there was much
thunder      it was awesome



*



Laurels and lilacs
bloom around my head
because I stood up to the sun



You see     the Colorado River runs
between flowered banks
I repeat my journeys to seek the
happiness that overcame
your absence
I was happy not to love you anymore
until the sunset reached
the East
and broke my raft apart
there were other rivers underground
covered with dead flowers
it was cold it was cold yes it was
cold.



*



Under a combination of pain
and machine-gun fire
flowers disappeared
they are in the same
state of non-being
as Emily Dickinson



We the dead have conversation
in our gardens
about our lack of
existence.



*



The gardener is planting
blue and white
flowers
some angel moved in with me
to flee the cold
temperature on earth are
rising
but we wear upon us some
immovable frost
everyone carries his dying as
a growing shadow.



*



I left the morning paper
by the coffee cup
the heat was 85 like the

                                                    year

and I went to the window to find
that flowers had bloomed overnight
to replace the bodies
felled in the war



the enemy had come with fire
and ruse
to stamp the names of the dead
in the gardens of Yohmor
It is not because spring
is too beautiful
that we'll not write what
happens in the dark.



*



A butterfly came to die
between two stones
at the foot of the Mountain
the mountain shed shadows
over it
to cover the secret of
death.

to be reminded
of the failing
mainspring

not sudden silence
after the extreme figure
but the relative

a grimace told
him to push the
articulation farther





the yet green used

a different sound
preceded every word
then took to term

to feel hips
as if new tangents
were bolting






from Step
 

iridescence as old
story, that brought
cold from deep

a chord moves into
an upper chamber
among rival unknowns

declension toward one

light-sensitive dot





a perfect world
the strokes same light value
runny, evened

illuminations came
from the plant
the signal blinked

search for asylum
carried on in an
inner distortion






from Step
 

a perfect world
a trail widens out the
code of indents

channels serving
both prey and

arms back, re-

a perfect world

the breathing field

the choices are circled
until so dark they
must be chosen over

someone in estranged

"these doors don't

a perfect world
living manifests of

worked back into
the locus one had
thought delivered

rectangles seep with

print as enlarged

the smile that held
no life but an erect

Sign for My Father, Who Stressed the Bunt
 

On the rough diamond,
 the hand-cut field below the dog lot and barn,
 we rehearsed the strict technique
 of bunting. I watched from the infield,
 the mound, the backstop
 as your left hand climbed the bat, your legs
 and shoulders squared toward the pitcher.
 You could drop it like a seed
 down either base line. I admired your style,
 but not enough to take my eyes off the bank
 that served as our center-field fence.
  
 Years passed, three leagues of organized ball,
 no few lives. I could homer 
 into the left-field lot of Carmichael Motors,
 and still you stressed the same technique,
 the crouch and spring, the lead arm absorbing
 just enough impact. That whole tiresome pitch
 about basics never changing,
 and I never learned what you were laying down.
  
 Like a hand brushed across the bill of a cap,
 let this be the sign 
 I'm getting a grip on the sacrifice.





Once
 

I climbed the roll of hay to watch the heron
in the pond. He waded a few steps out,
then back, thrusting his beak under water, 
pulling it up empty, but only once.
Later I walked the roads for miles, certain 
he'd be there when I returned. How is it for him, 
day after day, his brittle legs rising 
from warm green scum, his graceful neck curled, 
damp in the bright heat? It's a dull world. 
Every day, the same roads, the sky, 
the dust, the barn caving into itself, 
the tin roof twisted and scattered in the yard. 
Again, the bank covered with oxeye daisy 
that turns to spiderwort, to chicory, 
and at last to goldenrod. Each year, the birds-- 
thick in the air and darting in wild numbers-- 
grow quiet, the grasses thin, the light leaves 
earlier each day. The heron stood 
stone-still on my spot when I returned. 
And then, his wings burst open, lifting the steel- 
blue rhythm of his body into flight. 
I touched the warm hay. Hoping for a trace 
of his wild smell, I cupped my hands over 
my face: nothing but the heat of fields 
and skin. It wasn't long before the world 
began to breathe the beat of ordinary hours, 
stretching out again beneath the sky.





On the First Day She Made Birds
 

He asked me       if I had a choice
what kind of bird
would I choose to be. 
I know what he thought I'd say
since he tried to        end
my sentences half the time
anyway. Something exotic
he thought. He thought
maybe macaw.
That would fit
all loudmouthed 
and primary colored 
he would think.
(He thinks too much
I always thought.)
But really       at heart
I'm more
don't laugh now
     an L B J
          little brown job
except               except
I'm not the 
flit        from
branch
to        branch        type
such a waste
of energy all that
wing flap
and scritch scritch scratch.
Really now
can you see me
seed pod clamped
between my beak
like some landowner,
Havana cigar
clenched
between his teeth?
No         I think         not
I think
green heron.
You ask why?
Personality
mainly.
That hunched look
wings tucked to neck
waiting        waiting
in the sun
on a wide slab of rock
alongside a slow river
like some old man
up from a bad night's dream
where he's seen his coffin
and you say to him
Have a nice day
and he says        Make me.
Oh          you want looks
I'll give you
looks:
long olive green feathers
a trace of 
iridescence
I could stand
going out       iridescent
chestnut sides and head
a black crown
yes        a crown
something regal
to flash when you get
too close
dark bill         bright
yellow legs
and that creamy streak
down my throat and pecs
good
        not great
but good         pecs
just enough for a quick
hop to the next.
The best part
no sexual dimorphism
male         female
both alike 
endless possibilities.






Catalina Eddies
 

Dusk to dawn, sleek skunks enjoy
avocados in my yard. I give wide berth.
Before the first jogger leaves her prints
on pavement, tough raccoons appear.
They pretend they don't hear my keys click
but they peek to make sure it's me.
Foxes play hide-and-seek,
sometimes on our lawn, other times
across the street, but never after seven;
and brazen squirrels eye me
from the center of the street,
dare me to approach.

Will this be a day for Catalina eddies,
clouds stacked, catching like magnets
in a liquid air swirl?
Or will it blow a fierce Santa Ana,
days of fires in the hills,
smoldering chaparral,
winds so fierce birds do low-crawls?
I cast a spell for Santa Anas
the shallow coast a censer
mixed with black sage, Torrey Pine,
Engelmann oak--precious oils
to fumigate the San Diego skies,
the annual burning pulse.






To Orpheus
 

It isn't madness but shame for wanting
and shame for not having what I want,

which is a kind of madness--drunk,
3 a.m., the stairwell too steep to climb.

The bed can wait. I go to the pool instead,
strip and step in, the smell of smoke and sweat

washing from hair and skin. The wet kiss:
his mouth pressed here, my neck, and there,

my chest--in the end--went nowhere.
Cars pass with coupled strangers. I wade.

The brick wall stretches into the sky,
the sky empty, save the constellations,

whose lives I love--yours most of all,
father of poets, whose lyre filled trees

and stones with awe, the lover torn to shreds
and thrown in to the river. Tonight,

you're the swan, lost among pinholes of light,
your throat bitten by a black hole

that takes and takes and never fills. I kick, 
stroke my tired arms to buoy this body.

It makes ring after perfect ring, but each one
breaks along the edge. You who never were,

did you look down on the world at last
and see that more won't be enough? Not now.

Not ever. Want picks the human heart.
You're the lie I won't believe forever.






A Ride in the Rain
 

The driver has no knife. He has no knife, no, 
you think, and lower your head into his car.
A ride in the rain? The dark clouds bellow.
You saw him drinking at the local bar,

you think, and lower your head into his car.
Rain taps on the roof, falls on this familiar man:
You saw him drinking at the local bar.
He shrugs and offers up his empty hands.

Rain taps on the roof, falls on this familiar man,
and sugarcane stalks bend in the breeze.
He shrugs and offers up his empty hands.
As sewer pipes burst, flooding the street,

and sugarcane stalks bend in the breeze,
machetes swing into the green stems, low.
As sewer pipes burst, flooding the street,
bile is a blade at the back of your throat.

Machetes swing into the green stems, low.
A ride in the rain? The dark clouds bellow.
Bile is blade at the back of your throat.
The driver has no knife. He has no knife, no.






Dear Friend
 

     X.

Your bags were packed
and left at the door, the vase you
filled with shells, wrapped in tissue,
your books boxed. I have the whelk

you found on shore, the small conch,
intact--the point, the fine grooves--
and keep it in a box with a picture of you
at the beach: your hair slicked back,

head cocked at an angle.
Behind you, the green jacket
you told me to throw away. Strewn

over a chair, its arms dangle
above the floor--a hole in the pocket,
the elbows thin from years of use.


     Y.

I become each day more reckless,
too impatient for summer, the unbearable heat,
the calm that comes with it. There are no hills here,
not one, and I'm bored with the stillness

of the yellow field outside my window. And you,
who cannot keep still, who can never
look back, where will you go next?
How will I find you?

Can you feel the world pull 
apart, the seams loosen?
What, tell me, will keep it whole, 

if not you? if not me?
Send a postcard, picture, tell me
how you've been.


      Z.

Running down the stairwell in the garden,
I divide the steps by three, until my 
foot catches the edge, wet with rain, and my 
frame, flung forward by its own momentum,

leans into the night as if reaching
for something I didn't know I
wanted. Not the moon. No. Not the sky,
suspended and limitless. Not even

the tulips standing on their stems
(their petals cup the air).
But in the streetlamp's circle of light, I land

among them, broken.
My body can't contain
itself, as blood burgeons in my hands.






Photo of a Girl on a Beach
 

Once when I was harmless
and didn't know any better,

a mirror to the front of me
and an ocean behind,

I lay wedged in the middle of daylight,
paper-doll thin, dreaming,

then I vanished. I gave the day a fingerprint,
then forgot.

I sat naked on a towel
on a hot June Monday.

The sun etched the inside of my eyelids,
while a boy dozed at my side.

The smell of all oceans was around us--
steamy salt, shell, and sweat,

but I reached for the distant one.
A tide rose while I slept,

and soon I was alone. Try being
a figure in memory. It's hollow there.

For truth's sake, I'll say she was on a beach
and her eyes were closed.

She was bare in the sand, long,
and the hour took her bit by bit.






Dj Vu
 

It happened to me once.
Winter came, and snow quilted every inch.
I stood on the soapbox, as I was told,
and made staggering accusations. The public ignored,
so I retreated behind the potted yew.
I was waiting for a moment I was supposed to have

on a balcony overlooking the giant, gridded landscape.
The sounds I made underscored what I meant.
The potted yew was the face that I wore.
It was a metaphor for what could be.
The public endured.
I put the potted yew behind me. I made staggering an art.

That wasn't the truth though. Winter
comes and negates all its covers. It doesn't matter where I stand.
The balcony is a floor without walls.
The yew is a hurt that shadows.
The instance lives beneath us. Not just us, everybody.

The shadow hurts us. I make sounds like
the truth. Fate and theft are involved.
I think I told you this before. The floor is a wall that obscures.
The yew is quilt without color. Shadow is a fate you involved.
The yew on a balcony negates. I told you this before.
I was left undone. It's what I meant. Underneath everyone.






Cue Lazarus
 

Start this with the invocation:
             a seventy-seven Pinto,
             an eastbound freeway, two boys
a few months from their driver's license.

It happens again because you've
             said it. You sit in the back seat,
             a ghost of red vinyl, to listen
to these boys--one of whom was you,

the one along for the ride--talk
              brave about cheerleaders
              and socket wrenches as they pass
a stolen cigarette between them.

They don't know you're there,
              wouldn't believe in you should
              they look backstage, backseat.
The boys are driving back from an October

orchard where they'd gone to see leaves
              change. You remember: orange, brown,
              as though you'd just seen those leaves,
because in this proximity

to yourself--the boy in the passenger
               seat--you are thinking the
               same thing, and each of your in-
carnations feels like they've thought this

before. Your ghost, your present tense
               thinks that maybe this isn't right.
               Now you're along for the ride.
These boys haven't cuffed up against

their own mortality yet, though one
               of them is sick. The other one,
               driving and picking at the thin
hair falling from his scalp, will die

soon, because what lurks in his dark
               blood can be cured by medical
               science. And that cure is what will
kill him, as it leaves him weak,

unable to fight off infection
               in his lungs. But that comes later.
               You are here with them now to find
out what you owe to whom--your life,

mortgaged to one of these boys
               and you've never been able to
               rectify that debt. You are the
stage direction, a ghost backstage,

wanting a spotlight, a soapbox
               a soliloquy. Dissolve
               back into your life, like sugar
in tea--exit this scene now, stage left.

                               *

You are the apparition again
               in your mother's house. You follow
               yourself down the yellow hallway
to the ringing phone in the kitchen.

You already know who's calling,
               the way you knew then--when you were 
               the self you're haunting. Your friend
is dead. You know this even before 

his sister tells you--but because your
               ghost is too close, the boy can feel
               your grief, but can't feel his own.
And you did know then, didn't you?

You knew that morning, that the earth
               awakes closest to the sun--four
               days into every new year.
And Lazarus, dead now, four days.

Roll away the stone. Believe
               in something besides the past.
               Awaken from this dream like
a man called out from a cave.

It happens this way each time:
               a bourbon breakdown in January
               rain--weeping an invocation,
cursing corollary.

                               *

Can you go to Tom's grave today
               and mandate him back to this life?
               Should you cue him from the wing
like a stage direction? Would he

damn you--a sadness, a gravestone
               on your chest, for calling him
               into this mortal suffering?
If you had been in Houston that day

he'd have died anyway. You're a fool
               to think you can bargain across the river.
               Haunting the past won't stop
it from happening each time, exactly 

the same way. Won't stop your heart
               from breaking like a glass decanter,
               brown whisky sliding 
mercury across the tile.







Interstate Sonnet
 

A cigarette kiss in the desert. The wind-proof arc
of flame sparks inside the speeding Buick. Menthol:
a break from the monotony of highway nicotine--
most intimate of drugs. Make this mean sorrow
or thermodynamics, whatever small gesture
there is time for. Light another one, the vainglorious

interstate dusk and ash--the long, silver tooth.
This shirtless abandon, this ninety-mile-an-hour
electric laugh. The edges of windshield, haphazard
chatter. The clatter of the hubcap and the thunderclap:
the white-hot retinal memory of your life as a Joshua tree.
Permanence in the passenger seat. This long haul,

this first drag--nothing like cinnamon, nothing
like the iron taste on the back of your mortal tongue.






Dreaming Pancho Villa
 

  The silence that was neither Spanish  nor English  was my prayer.                               --Luis Alberto Urrea 

1.
Last night I dreamt I was Pancho Villa--
ragged, bandoliered, reckless.
I dreamt my poetry at the end of a pistol,
felt it kick nearly out of my hand.

But this morning I awoke again
white and assimilated into these cobwebs
of my half-self. When did I forget
my mother? Sometimes Spanish

syllables creak like wobbly shopping cart 
wheels, I have to lean against accent,
fill myself with verbs: necesitar, hablar, poder.

2.
Half, medio, milkweed,
Carlos Gringo, Carlos Murphy.
Part mexicano,
part Kentucky hillbilly,
I've angloed my way
through this life--
hablando espaol 
de conveniencia,
nunca pensando en
la bendicin. 

3.
I dreamed again last night
I was Pancho Villa. Only this time
I couldn't speak a word of Spanish.
I could understand what the men
were asking me, but to blurt orders
in English would have stretched my neck.
So I kept quiet, austere. I kept a rifle
in my hand. I've taken it as a sign.

When I was fourteen,
I lost my brand-new Timex
in the waist-high surf of Pismo Beach.
I couldn't feel it missing from my wrist
until I was in my uncle's Volvo,
my shorts still soaking, my lips caked white.

The sand in my hair, the sand in my shoes--
the very real estate of Madera, where
during the revolution, no train or telegraph
passed for months. The business
lumbering on, turning trees 
to the fabric of living.
After the war, they sent query
to Jurez, they needed the hour, the day,
the month, the year they hadn't noticed.

4. 
I'm awake early, half-dreams of last night's rain & a dirty porch pull me
from the sheets. En la madrugada, a broom is a necessary instrument.
The swish of straw against concrete, a whisper, a prayer. Shoulders
cantilever, wrists rigid, hands in pliable tension--in this motion there is
memory.

My great-grandmother swept her porch, the way she did every morning.
From the burnished Sonoran dawn, a stranger approached. She watched
him, always sweeping. The man was young, in his early thirties maybe,
beaten, ragged. His face crusted with blood, filthy. The man appealed to 
her, "Seora, por favor, aydeme, he said. She stopped sweeping & 
looked at him. "Me siguen los federales, he said. She looked on him with
pity & brought him into her home. She must have thought of her 
daughters, she must have thought of consequence. She put the man in a
bed, went back outside to sweep. The federales arrived shortly after, five
on horseback armed & angry. "Seora, they asked, "have you seen a 
stranger this morning? She stopped sweeping, told them she had not. 
They asked if anyone was in the house. "No one, she told them, "only my 
sick uncle. They left without incident or investigation.

Night fell. She cleaned the man's wounds, gave him clothes, listened to
his stories of revolution. She told him, "Whether the revolution or the
government, I lose chickens all the same. She handed him a plate of
arroz con pollo. He rested for two days. She gave him the few centavos
she had & he left amidst the desert night.

Years later, the man returned to her house--with a gift that no one can
remember--to thank her for his life.

5. 
This time it's turning
tequila sueo,
gold spinner
gone retrograde
illusion.
La Sirena--verde-verdad,
glinting back-black
and skin--
across the metallic blue
chulo wagon.
Mariachi gone mad
in the back seat.
This is cruising
at watch-me-
miles-an-hour.

"Ese,
why don't 
you come down
to chrome avenue,
where it's all
manos y moda?
We'll sit
straight-slick,
three-reefer-
tone-deaf-
brass-stick high.
Me and you, pendejo.
We'll pick up Hi-Tone,
all fingers and hair,
that little guitarrista.
No te mortifiques,
Ride shotgun with me.
Pgame un grito.

Chale. I've got work to do, homes.

6. 





7. 
I'm dreamsick now. Staying asleep past
noon. Desvelado. Headache-fog
when I'm awake, even keeping down
milk is hard. Images, sounds, curdle thick
in my ears, my eyes. Levntate.
Qu horas son?

I dream Villa's first murder. The other
man on horseback, his jefe's son. An argument
at the crossroads. A girl, Pancho's sister.
Something forced--a point, a pistol. A sharp
report, blue-black smoke. Fear, alarm--the smell
of guilt, like bad masa, taints tastes, turns on Pancho.
Running now, like before but worse. Three days
into las montaas. Marcado por vida.

8.
In a dream of brown skin, I'm lost
in black, black hair, dark nipples,
a face I've never known. A kiss
so difficult I moan. My face
wet with her--princess, mujer--irrecoverable.
Only impression across
sleep-soaked lips, only an ache
and a dark, dark scent.

9.





10. 
Barbed wire fence runs down the axis
                of a heart. River rides in canyon
                dreams--a revolution in water.
I am a kiss, confessed by tongues that will not pronounce me.






Mi Historia
 

My red pickup choked on burnt oil
as I drove down Highway 99.
In wind-tattered garbage bags
I had packed my whole life:
two pairs of jeans, a few T-shirts,
an a pair of work boots.
My truck needed work, and through
the blue smoke rising from under the hood,
I saw almond orchards, plums,
and raisins spread out on paper trays,
and acres of Mendota cotton my mother picked as a child.

My mother crawled through the furrows
and plucked cotton balls that filled
the burlap sack she dragged,
shoulder-slung, through dried-up bolls, 
husks, weevils, dirt clods,
and dust that filled the air with thirst.
But when she grew tired,
she slept on her mother's burlap,
stuffed thick as a mattress,
and Grandma dragged her over the land
where time was told by the setting sun. . . .

History cried out to me from the earth,
in the scream of starling flight,
and pounded at the hulls of seeds to be set free.
History licked the asphalt with rubber,
sighed in the windows of abandoned barns,
slumped in the wind-blasted palms,
groaned in the heat, and whispered its soft curses. 
I wanted my own history--not the earth's,
nor the history of blood, nor of memory,
and not the job founded for me at Galdini Sausage.
I sought my own--a new bruise to throb hard
as the asphalt that pounded the chassis of my truck.






Oxtail Stew
 

At five o'clock in the morning,
I walked to work and passed the green ponds
of Horizon Park where the last bluegill,
caught on the low, slight bank,
panted hard in the dark mud, crushed glass,
sour bottle caps, whiskey,
and the iron weight of heat and smog.
This haze stared through eyes
gray as the broken window panes
on the cheap side of town,
and when this haze held you
and whispered in your ears its quiet tragedies,
it stole your breath quick as time.
This is where men gathered to sell peanuts,
buckets of oranges, and roses,
and they sat on the benches and watched
the trucks drive by and disappear.

What I want to say is simple:
a man must do more than sell roses
where the bums go and beg--
he must keep something holy.
He must breath the winds
that rustle the orchards of the valley 
where the white almond blooms
replenish with their soft scent.
He must learn from the Appaloosa
when she walks in from the fields
and bows her head to a trough of water
that reflects nothing but her eyes and the stars.

Shoulder, fat, bone, and loose sheet metal
banged out a day-long cacophony.
Twenty-eight pounds of spice
had to be mixed before the grinder was done.
Mustard powder, paprika, salt,
and chili powder boiled in my nose,
in my eyes, and in the red throb 
of my hard nicked-up knuckles.
By late morning the meat defrosted,
and the boxes began their ooze.
Pig parts became easy to recognize.
Eighty pounds of guts, kidneys,
and stomach fell across my chest
each time a box ripped apart.
We dared not stop the music of our work:
the clack of a clean pine pallet,
pink meat and white fat ground to a pulp,
sweetened, stuffed, and crimped,
the chorizo boxed, the boxes labeled,
stacked, and wrapped.

At lunch, I watched Guillermo hunker over the table
and dig into his stew--carrots, potatoes,
celery, oxtail, and gravy, made from
chili peppers and fat, smoldering in a ceramic bowl.
Guillermo took out a white cotton napkin
and spread it evenly across his lap,
picked up a piece of sourdough ripped
from a loaf and soaked the bread in the stew
for a long time . . . his own tired body
taking back what the work took, and he ate.
He sucked on chili peppers the color of blood
and took another bite of the bread.
He sucked out the beef from the eyes of the bones
and gnawed on the soft marrow,
and he drank hot coffee sweetened con canela.
"Eloisa, he said, "can cook, and he touched
the brown lace crocheted into the edge
of his cotton napkin, rubbed his gut, wiped the table, 
and walked out to complete his work.






Let Nothing Lie Dormant
 

At the farmer's market in Rosarito, Mexico,
a man touched my arm.
He sat on a stool at a wooden table,
and in the center,
a blue pitcher of water beaded under the sun.
Hunkered over his lap,
he worked with a gouge on a block of walnut,
and he blew at the dust,
and the dust swirled in the breeze.

Done stripping the sapwood vulnerable to rot,
the man held the heart of the wood,
a purple wood hard against
the chisel's cutting edge.
He looked up from his work,
and his gray eyes told me I must listen.
"This wood must be strong
or the heart cracks before the real work is done.
See this? he asked softly,
and he lifted a mallet carved
from a branch of apple, "Strong wood, he said.
"It wanted to be more than a tree.

He rubbed fresh walnut dust between his palms.
We drank glasses of ice water,
talked about life in general,
and he used the pitcher,
billowed and wet like the sail of a boat,
to cool his neck.

Later, through the soft meat of an avocado,
I felt the pit longing to be free.






Gatekeepers
 

1.

A crow gliding over a ravine was
The sign his eyes were waiting for.
They thought they were ready to cross.

The tumbleweed listening to a cricket
And seeing a line of ants snaking in
Was the figure of his younger sister,
Huddled by him, asking for a campfire.

They made it as far as a roadside store
And held their hands over the electric coils.
When asked if they were going to buy anything,
Their tongues broke off into halves
And fell to the floor like Popsicles.


2.

My father says I was born to translate
What he could only nod to for years.
He also says that God made a mistake
By blurring out his eyes first because
He can hear her asking for a blanket.

She saw a church adorned with hipbones,
Sun-bleached, and beautiful as curved jewelry.
She dreamt of its wide doors, and after dipping
Her finger in His palm, she felt His warmth.

My father says that cactus needles fly
And burn like the memory of lost ones,
Then he tells me I was born to study
The sand trails and notice when footsteps
Drag and turn to knee and handprints.
Those are ones I need to follow, he says.






Diapers
 

INS officers raided a building, taking twelve illegal aliensinto custody. The owner was cited for employing workerswithout proper identification.

1. RAID

Ernesto's boot heels are wild hooves
Being roped in, left bound in the air.
Carmen, slow-footed, nauseous with child,
Fights them off by swinging her purse.
"Pinche cabrones saben hablar espaol
Cuando nos van a arrestar, she says
As her voice is drowned out by a row 
Of washing machines on their rinse cycle.
Like a cat spooked out of a trash bin,
Sal runs into the street.

Chorus: Chingado!


2. A GIRL AND HER FATHER

We were driving through town, Mama,
Right by where people pick up the bus
When this man jumps out right in front of us.
Dad hit the brakes. His eyes got this big, Mama.

He was running from the law, that's for sure.
Just be glad no one got hurt, mija.
Try not to think about it anymore, mija.
We won't go that way again, that's for sure.


3. THE FACTORY

Two of the old-timers talked about unions:
"A trabajar, porque hablar de las uniones
Slo trae la migra de nuevo.


4. A YOUNG MOTHER

Can you imagine how many diapers
We went through with the twins?
The disposable ones were way too expensive,
So we switched to cloth. They were great. No,
We didn't wash them. Thank God, we had a service.
We just put the dirty ones in plastic bags,
And they picked them up and dropped off clean ones
Right on our porch every two weeks.
It made things so much easier. And you know,
We didn't have to worry about those summer rashes
Because their little bottoms could breathe better.
If you can afford the service, just do it.
Or at least do it for the first six months.
It's even good for the environment.


5. JEFE

No son gallinas
Esperando un huevo.
A trabajar!

Chorus: Chingado!






Through a Glass
 

On the crown of his head 
where the fontanelle pulsed 
between spongy bones, 
a bald spot is forming, globed and sleek 
as a monk's tonsure.

I was the earliest pinch of civilization, 
the one who laced him 
into shoe leather 
when he stumbled into walking upright. 
"Shoes are unfair to children, he'd grouse.

Through a pane of glass 
that shivers when the wind kicks up 
I watch my son walk away.

He's out the door, up the street, around 
a couple of corners by now. 
I'm in for life. 
He trips; my hand flies out;

I yank it back.





Prayer
 

I want a god
as my accomplice
who spends nights
in houses
of ill repute
and gets up late
on Saturdays

a god
who whistles
through the streets
and trembles
before the lips 
of his lover

a god
who waits in line
at the entrance 
of movie houses
and likes to drink
caf au lait

a god
who spits 
blood from 
tuberculosis and
doesn't even have
enough for bus fare

a god 
knocked
unconscious
by the billy club
of a policeman
at a demonstration

a god 
who pisses 
out of fear
before the flaring
electrodes
of torture

a god 
who hurts
to the last
bone and
bites the air
in pain

a jobless god
a striking god
a hungry god
a fugitive god
an exiled god
an enraged god

a god
who longs
from jail
for a change
in the order
of things

I want a 
more godlike 
god






To Those Who Have Lost Everything
 

crossed 
in despair
many deserts
full of hope

carrying
their empty
fists of sorrow
everywhere

mouthing
a bitter night
of shovels
and nails

"you're nothing
you're shit
your home's
nowhere--

mountains
will speak
for you

rain 
will flesh
your bones

green again
among ashes
after a long fire

started in
a fantasy island
some time ago

turning
Natives
into aliens






"Mexican Is Not a Noun

from Of Dark Love
 

I

there has never been sunlight for this love,
like a crazed flower it buds in the dark,
is at once a crown of thorns and
a spring garland around the temples

a fire, a wound, the bitterest of fruit,
but a breeze as well, a source of water,
your breath--a bite to the soul,
your chest--a tree trunk in the current

make me walk on the turbid waters,
by the ax that breaks this lock,
the dew that weeps from trees

if I become mute kissing your thighs,
it's that my heart eagerly
searches your flesh for a new dawn






from Of Dark Love
 

XII

once again I look out your window
and the world looks oddly different,
maybe the fields have blossomed,
or perhaps more stars have been born

delirious waves caress my feet,
something new, unknown,
sunsets whisper in my ear as well,
everywhere I find your odor, your shape

you are among old-growth pines,
in the fog along the coastal rocks, 
around the most somber of afternoons

impossible to wipe away your job
from my eyes, from my sad mouth--
you are the universe made flesh






How to Look at Mexican Highways
 

          
          1. You are not going anywhere.         1.1. No one is waiting for you.         1.2. In case someone is waiting for you, you can always explain                the delay later.         1.3. Blame it on the traffic, no one else knows that you chose to walk.2. Don't look at the pavement, look at the things that you don't see    when you're indoors.         2.1. Water towers.         2.2. Cables.                  2.2.1. Cables bringing other people's voices and faces onto                           TV monitors.                  2.2.2. Cables bringing electricity to light bulbs and                            refrigerators.          2.3. Laundry on clotheslines.          2.4. Empty cans of food.                  2.4.1. With flowers growing out of them.                  2.4.2. With cactuses growing out of them.3. Feel the waves surrounding you.           3.1. Waves bringing other people's voices to the speakers of your                  sound system.           3.2. Waves of street sounds.4. Measure how fast you can run up and down staircases; compare that    to the speed of the cars driving by.5. When you tire, stand in the middle of the overpass.          5.1. Look down.          5.2. Try to look ahead, attempt to delineate the city's skyline.                    5.2.1. If there's too much pollution, look down again.                    5.2.2. Hold on tighter to the rail.                    5.2.3. Stay there a bit longer; remember no one is waiting                              for you.                    5.2.4. You're not going anywhere.6. Through the rails you will see stories unfolding on the street.          6.1. Pay attention.          6.2. You are not they.          6.3. They are not they.                   6.3.1. They are one plus one plus one, indefinitely.7. You're surrounded by monads going somewhere.8. There is a purpose to their movement.9. Desire is a Federacy.





Migrating Birds
 

Victor gets a real sense of power
from making his own raisins. He buys
pounds and pounds of grapes
and leaves them to dry
on the kitchen table.

Theresa doesn't want to hear about
her ex-husband's cancer. Not on Father's Day.
She takes a train all night
to have breakfast with her cousin.
All Sunday she rides the train back.

Once Martin's wife had left,
he decided to take advantage of her space.
He built a sauna where her closet was,
and now sits there every morning
to read the paper and Buddha.

One night Helga wore her prettiest dress,
thought she knew he wouldn't be there.
She drank white wine, got drunk
(she was on a diet), and fell down.
Later he saw the holes in her pantyhose.

Mara was usually bumping into 
furniture. Each time she got closer to what
she wanted. "What do you want from me?
"Nothing, he replied, so she took off
and felt like migrating birds. But many.






Poem in Spanish
 

The grave has more power than the eyes of the beloved.
An open grave with all its magnets.
This weight on the wings. The sky is waiting for an airship.

I have the feeling that I haven't got much life left.
Three hours after the celestial attack.

Why don't I respond when I'm being offended?
Because my religion doesn't allow me to.
Exterior maps: geography. Interior maps: psychography.
And in your hard cathedral I kneel.
Mountains pass camels pass
like the history of wars in antiquity.

Of all the men I am, I can't find any of them
without the control of the intruding eye.
Problems. Mysteries that fasten themselves to my chest.
All I want is not to see businesses nor gardens
nor markets nor eyeglasses nor elevators.

In order to serve all radio listeners,
without discriminating between social classes, I speak a tongue
that fills hearts with the law of communicating clouds.
I have my brain or whatever it is full of skull moths.
For the world to go on being what it is it must
--per force--take another form.

True poems are fires. When something cherished burns
instead of the fireman I call, rushes forth the incendiary. 
It says: live, live, live!
It is Death.






An Institute Is Closing
 

                  I'm not in with this mystery. Somebody steady me.
                       Cool ocean breezes don't make me laugh.

               I'm in with noisy metal little nils. A million apologies.
                                  I must have made more.

                           You were sensitive, you needed them
              No you weren't and you didn't. In fact . . . oh forget it!

                 In the middle of the ocean reflected with the moon,
                 good place to show; probably no one knows you there.

       Your leaving, the thrown rope up to sky, climbed up for real goodbye.
          I realized my reason insufficient; you must have considered this.

             How my specific lean to you smelled like an old paper cup
                      of funny water and you were not very thirsty.

                    You came unbidden initially and often. A field
                and flickering wicks of foxes from here to there. You.

                            Holding Hell at bay. Back to ground,
                          I see you on the moon with your mirror

                                catching action on the parallax.
                                      Some kind of wise guy.






Where Everything Waits
 

                        Nobody was left who'd lastly scuffed first earth's crust.
                      Boiling sea had thin-sheened each cubit of firmament.
                               Mountains ceased to assert, gave into ground
                                            arounding whatever hard rock
                                           to then there over and take down.

                    All shapes breaking hysterical particles and subs who settled
                                devoting former whir of shape to Silence,
                                                which was enough.

                             It stayed uniform Silent for some many months
                    which strengthened to pull outer space noise in to neutralize
                                                   but lost its grip.

                                 So this Sound hard-pressed in to sink holes
                              and look into original force that was still shut in
                         under black lacquer cabinetry: our future perfect world.

                                                 It opened the door of dust,
                                   the space sound picked up pings distantly.
                                 Seeing to sound is what and how Bounceback.

                                             Since the dust so still and small
                                             the waves skinnied high-pitched
                                    to switch on resistance of an average mote.

                                             What would stand to receive?
                          What was the point of pointing out resisting decay?
                                                 What was there to say?

                        Could anything be activated? Much was strained in "done state
                  and so sought exit through the soft Silence under rather than he stabbed
                                       by the point-cornered Silence above.

                                                So sound deranged to be
                                               needle pierce to dust piece
                           and sunned a word heard first by the bygone ("ouch).

                                 And the Silence startled by the sneaking sound
                                                forgot its own high ground
                                                and grumbled some rebuke.

                    Underground glad particulates laughed at the gaff and expanded
                        (something among it a voice) to sweep up what had been



                                                             PART TWO


                                                        One in Dust begun.

                                     One chased out to Perceptivity from mum.

                                      This made an in as such that could close

                       over after outreach which comes back with something to say.

                              Stretching comes to the zone where there is shifting 

                            from mixing its own x-space with outside sensed data.

                                      Each already edgy piece in "earshot

                             each piece pulled in by dust's desire to harbor more

                                              is similar to dolphin noise.

                                          Riffs that began off flats of static,

                                               f.p. earth (future perfect),

                                             etched by rust-hinged sound.

                                                     Not all dust took in.

                                        Those who did not got ultra dense.

                                     If there was a strike to one of this specie

                           sparks would be three feet at least and atoms unleash.

                                        To them strikes relieve adhesion.

                       They like hits from nowhere; they won't admit they are hard

                                                         in every space.

                                      But sparks in dark if an eye sees them

                              a mouth to say how beautiful a light of such blue

                                             that lasts and deepens blue.

                                       Shaped like a pin, each spark alights

                                          to hold itself, elsewhere, down.

                              What it lands on is to remember the spark beautiful.

                                      A spark from Hard Silence made mad.

                                The more made makes it harder which gets hit

                                         and flies further because it is harder.



                                                        PART THREE


                       Minute care is taken so that soft expansive dust gets all over

                                   the dense. Colors change as comes collision.

                                They want to do all they can now that they can.

                   Hopefully they don't know about the deep frozen people in orbit.

                       Those on the figurative shelf until there is a proper place.

                                         More on that after the fire; for now:

                                         the Sound, the Nerve, the Building.






No Soldier Story
 

                          These ghost soldiers live underground with the vast
                                          oversupply of castoff lanterns.
                              If one were to take broadsword to one of these

                              orange-bearded mammoth men of rough hew,
                                   he would laugh at the passing metal,
                                            make light of entrails.

                            For years I have been here without a clear map.
                             That hopes should dim as days go on above is
                                     natural I suppose, what do I know?

                                        I am dressed like one of them.
                             The thick walls quake but stay soundproof.
                                            I fear my fists vestigial.

                             These soldiers' own panic is taking up rugs
                            finding filigrees of the former world beneath,
                                 e.g., a locket with their mongrel's mush.

           They will freeze, then feign noncom; smacking barrels of burgundy
                               with pistol butts. I react comme squirrel:
                   fleeing their reach to the chamber out of the impact area.

                One loved me until I asked if he worried about what must be
      happening without us. Well, his lips did narrow, hand abandoned my knee,
                         blah, blah big mouth were his departing words.

                    I will not say with shame that I came from nothing.
                        Someone paved my first breakthrough at least,

                        one time calling it love. And I will stand by that
                                as it applies to my primary makeup.






Driving in Oklahoma
 

On humming rubber along this white concrete,
lighthearted between the gravities
of source and destination like a man
halfway to the moon
in this bubble of tuneless whistling
at seventy miles an hour from the windvents,
over prairie swells rising
and falling, over the quick offramp
that drops to its underpass and the truck
thundering beneath as I cross
with the country music twanging out my windows,
I'm grooving down this highway feeling
technology is freedom's other name when
--a meadowlark
comes sailing across my windshield
with breast shining yellow
and five notes pierce
the windroar like a flash
of nectar on mind,
gone as the country music swells up and drops
                                me wheeling down
                      my notch of cement-bottomed sky
                             between home and away
and wanting
to move again through country that a bird
has defined wholly with song,
and maybe next time see how
                         he flies so easy, when he sings.





In the Changing Light
 

Brimming the trees with song
they flood July, spill over into
August pulsing lovecries,
cicadas here--one that 
our cat brought me lay, legs folded
neatly, on clear wings as on a shroud, green
and white, fizzing now and then, 
but when I threw it spread
wings and zagged in a wide curve into
the sweetgum tree where presently
its dry buzzsaw whined for some
significant other to auger down
into dark dense earth and gnaw at 
the roots of things,
sans eyes, sans wings, sans
song for seventeen years or so.

As daylight sharpens, deer slip back
into the woods. I wonder what a deer,
when danger grows too bright,
makes of a world whose darker,
truer memories in ear
and nose must solve the dazzle of
our alien eyes, more surgical
at stripping off its cover, at masking selves
as downwind leaves.
I've read somewhere the claim, by computer people,
that pain cannot be felt
until self-consciousness
has been achieved, and they had programmed in
that level, so they said, of artificial pain.
In A. R. Luria's book The Mind
of a Mnemonist, the man infallibly
remembered everything, but all perceptions
were unlike ours. Hearing, he tasted: sweet, bitter,
salty; heard neon colors; rough or silky, icy or
bloodwarm words: laid them like eggs aside on streets
his memory walked stolidly along,
walked back to get them when he needed to.
--Forgot, once, a word;
had set it carefully beneath a lamp
whose bulb was burnt out.
Bud opens and 
is marigold, bird touched
by sunlight sings,
mind thinks:
I am. Still,
as the old man put it, coming out
into the light we wawl
and cry. I wonder,
in this darklit galaxy,
how that song is heard.






Another Sunday Morning
 

What I walked down to the highway for,
                                   through the summer dawn,
                                            was the Sunday funnies,
                     or so I thought--
                                      but what I remember reading there
                           in the shadowless light
                                               among meadowlarks singing
                     was tracks in the deep warm dust
                                           of the lane, where it parted
                                  with its beige dryness the meadow's dew--
                    the sleek trail where a snake had crossed
                        and slid into tall grass;
                                                  the stippled parallels
                with marks between them where
                                                  a black blister-beetle had dragged
                                 its bulbous belly across
                      in search of weeds more green;
                                                              the labyrinth of lacelike
            dimples left by a speed-freak
                                        tiger-beetles's sprints that ended
                                         where it took wing
                              with a little blur of dust-grains;
                                            and stepping through the beetle-trails,
         the wedge-heels and sharp-clawed hands of skunk-track
                              crossing unhurried and walking
                                       along the ditch to find
                                  an easy place for climbing;    
not far past that,
            a line of cat-prints running
                                               straight down the lane and ending
        with deep marks where it leaped
                                                  across the ditch to the meadow
                 for birds asleep or wandering baby rabbits:
and freshly placed this morning,
                                               the slender runes
                                      of bob-whites running, scuffles
                    of dustbaths taken--
                                        and there ahead
crouched low at the lane-edge
                                     under purple pokeweed-berries
                     four quail had seen me,
                    and when I walked slowly
                    on toward them, instead
                           of flying they ran 
with a fluid scuttling
                                     on down the lane and stopped frozen
                                               till I came too close
               --then quietly when
                     I expected an explosion
         of wings they took off low and whispering
                and sailed, rocking and tilting
                                          out over the meadow's tall bluestem,
             dropped down and were gone until
 I heard them whistling, down by the little pond,
                 and whistled back so sharply
               that when I got back to the  house
                  they still were answering 
                   and one flew into the elm
                  and whistled from its shadows
                                                  up over the porch where I sat
       reading the funnies while the kittens
                         played with the headlines
                                         till when the first gold sunlight
                 tipped the elm's leaves he flew
back out to the meadow and sank
                                   down into the sun-brilliant dew
                             on curving wings,
                and my brothers and sisters waked
                                           by the whistling came pouring out
       onto the porch and claimed their share
                                  of the Sunday funnies--
                     and I went on to read
           the headlines of World War Two,
with maps of the struggling armies leaving
                                            tank-tracks over the dunes of Libya
                            and the navies churning their wakes
                             of phosphorescence in the Coral Sea
                             where the ships went down on fire
                             and the waves bobbed and flamed
                          with the maimed survivors , screaming
                                  in Japanese or English until
                                  their gasoline-blistered heads
                                  sank down to the tiger sharks
                                   and the war was lost or won
                                 for children sitting in sunlight,
                                  believing their cause was just
                                 and knowing it would prevail,
                                   as the dew vanished away. 






When Names Escaped Us
 

The boy painted himself white and ran into the darkness.

We let the words "he may be dead, bury him,
bury him.

We took his clothes to the rummage sale
in the basement of the mission
We put his photographs and drawings
in a birdcage and covered it with a starquilt.

For four nights voices carried clear to the river.

After winter so many storms moved in
strangers came among us
They danced
They shoveled in the shadows of trees

Then, somehow we all felt
all of us were of this one boy.






Postmodern Rez Edge Inhalation: Paint Thinner Sublime
 

Chemical angels ride into this vacant room
as walls and windows drip away
into western fronts, post depression farm
boundaries barely barb-wired together, enclosed
stone pile pastures a gray horse standing still,
facing north, a snort of breath drifting
to a rail car passing horizon
the wind hinting the spirit of ice
nights so long you can only hope
the red blood circling for warmth
in your cells don't freeze here
with the rest of this lost American dream.






November Becomes the Sky With Suppers for the Dead
 

I am standing outside 
in Minnesota
ghost wind recalling
names in winter mist

The road smells
of dogs two days dead

White photographers talk in 
the house of mainstream
media

I can't articulate 
the agony of Eagle Singer's
children to them.

We celebrate the old
man while another 
generation shoots 
crushed and heated
prescriptions
sells baskets,
machinery,
the fixtures yet to be
installed in the house,
yet to be heated
by the tribal government,
for another night
stolen by the stupors
and the wondrous
pleasure of forget
everything medicines.

Back inside 
Uncle Two Dogs rolls me
a smoke out of
organic American Spirit

I look to a last cup
of coffee.

The way home
fills with snow
our tracks
human and machine.






Peace Walk
 

We wondered what our walk should mean,
taking that un-march quietly;
the sun stared at our signs-- "Thou shalt not kill.

Men by a tavern said, "Those foreigners . . .
to a woman with a fur, who turned away--
like an elevator going down, their look at us.

Along a curb, their signs lined across,
a picket line stopped and stared
the whole width of the street, at ours: "Unfair.

Above our heads the sound truck blared--
by the park, under the autumn trees--
it said that love could fill the atmosphere:

Occur, slow the other fallout, unseen,
on islands everywhere--fallout, falling
unheard. We held our poster up to shade our eyes.

At the end we just walked away;
no one was there to tell us where to leave the signs.





Lotem Abdel Shafi
 

The heart dies without space for love, without a moral horizon:
think of it then as a bird trapped in a box.
My heart goes out with love to those beyond the fence;
only toward them can one really advance, that is, make progress.
Without them I feel I'm half a person.
Romeo was born a Montague, and Juliet came from the Capulet line,
and I'm a disciple of Shakespeare, not Ben Gurion--
therefore I'll be delighted if my daughter marries the grandson of Haidar Abdel Shafi.
I mean this, of course, as a parable only--but the parable is my measure,
and since it has more to do with my body than teeth or hair,
this isn't just some idle fancy that, out of poetic license,
I place our fate in my daughter's sex.
That I grant myself this imaginary gift, testifies to the extent
to which we're living, still, in the underworld,
where we're granted the hope and potential of an amoeba.
But all mythology begins with creatures that creep and crawl,
spring out of the ground and devour each other,
until a sacred union occurs, healing the breach in the world.
The Arab groom from Gaza, too, will extend to my daughter a dress
on which is embroidered the Land redeemed from Apartheid's curse--
our Land as a whole, belonging equally to all of its offspring,
and then he'll lift the veil from her face, and say to her:
"And now I take you to be my wife, Lotem Abdel Shafi.





Stupid Meditation on Peace
 

"He does not come to coo.                    --Gerard Manley Hopkins

Insomniac monkey-mind ponders the Dove,
Symbol not only of Peace but sexual
Love, the couple nestled and brooding.

After coupling, the human animal needs
The woman safe for nine months and more.
But the man after his turbulent minute or two

Is expendable. Usefully rash, reckless
For defense, in his void of redundancy
Willing to death and destruction.

Monkey-mind envies the male Dove
Who equally with the female secretes
Pigeon milk for the young from his throat.

For peace, send all human males between
Fourteen and twenty-five to school
On the Moon, or better yet Mars.

But women too are capable of Unpeace,
Yes, and we older men too, venom-throats.
Here's a great comic who says on our journey

We choose one of two tributaries: the River
Of Peace, or the River of Productivity.
The current of Art he says runs not between

Banks with birdsong in the fragrant shadows--
No, an artist must follow the stinks and rapids
Of the branch that drives the millstones and dynamos.

Is peace merely a vacuum, the negative
Of creation, or the absence of war?
The teaching says Peace is a positive energy.

Still something in me resists that sweet milk,
My mind resembles my restless, inferior cousin
Who fires his shit in handfuls from his cage.





Making Peace
 

A voice from the dark called out,
"The poets must give us
imagination of peace, to oust the intense, familiar
imagination of disaster. Peace, not only
the absence of war.

But peace, like a poem,
is not there ahead of itself,
can't be imagined before it is made,
can't be known except
in the words of its making,
grammar of justice,
syntax of mutual aid.

A feeling towards it,
dimly sensing a rhythm, is all we have
until we begin to utter its metaphors,
learning them as we speak.

A line of peace might appear
if we restructured the sentence our lives are making,
revoked its reaffirmation of profit and power,
questioned our needs, allowed
long pauses. . . .

A cadence of peace might balance its weight
on that different fulcrum; peace, a presence,
an energy field more intense than war,
might pulse then,
stanza by stanza into the world,
each act of living
one of its words, each word
a vibration of light--facets
of the forming crystal.





Evidence of Red
 

First, night opened out.
Bodies took root from rotting salt
and seawater into evidence of red life.
Relentless waves pumped tidal air
into a single heartbeat.

In the pulp of shadow and space,
water sucked our people from sleep.
That's how it all began. At least
that's all we can remember to tell.
It began with water and heartbeat.

In minutes we tunneled through
corn woman's navel into tinges 
of moist red men and women.
Yawning, we collected our chins,
knees, breasts, and sure-footed determination.

A few thousand years before
Moses parted the Red Sea, and the 
God with three heads was born in the Middle East,
the Choctaw people danced
our homeland infra red.

Finally when the stranger's arms
reached to strangle the West,
Grandmother eavesdropped 
on the three-faced deity 
who said that chaos was coming.

When he puckered his lips and tried to kiss her
she made it rain on him.
"Maybe you've forgotten
you were born of water and women,
she said, walking away laughing.






Indians Never Say Good-bye
 

          
          There she was standing over me. She inched her face close to my face. She put her hands on my face. I remembered her immediately, but did not speak. My eyes blurred. They were hot and heavy. It hurt to look at Ain't Sally. It hurt to see.     I closed my eyes. I felt her cool touch. She chanted. "You will be well. You will not die. Chim chukma taha che. You will be well. Chi pesa taha che.     She sang to me. Then I heard her leave.A woman whose bed was surrounded by white partitions, moaned again. This was not a new sound. It was a constant. Her breath whistled irregularly. There was no escaping the whistle. The whistling sounds were everywhere in the white room. Then they stopped.     Another woman in another bed called out. No answer. She pushed the bell. Women wearing white dresses came into the room. They pushed the partitions back. They said the whistling woman was dead. I went back to sleep. Before the hospital. Before rheumatic fever. Before the dead woman. I had met Ain't Sally. I was seven years old.Ain't Sally was an ancient Indian relative who lived in Hayrick, outside of Dublin. A place of the Snakes. A place of memory.     Once a base camp for nomadic tribes following buffalo, once a county seat, Hayrick, Texas took its name from a solitary mountain standing in the breadth of open grasslands. Only a state government road sign remains, marking the place of Hayrick. Marking the sign of the Snakes.     The only time we visited Ain't Sally, I rode in the back seat of our green 1950 Chevrolet, and listened to my Indian grandmother tell stories about our family. Chapters went like this:     --Life in a  Dugout.     --Making Lye Soap.     --How Grandfather got VD.     I don't remember much of the drive to Hayrick. We drove the rural roads of West Texas. There were two lanes of dust and dirt, stagnant, green-belted river beds and one-lane bridges.     When we arrived at Ain't Sally's the old woman ambled out of a rusted screen door of a paintless wooden house. Breasts sagging, her thin body lacking in strength seemed unable to support her weight. She wore a sleeveless dress that revealed naked brown skin, skin that was no more than a sheath for aging bones. Hairless underarms.     She fed us saltine crackers and cold squirrel dumplings. She asked me questions. She asked me about my secrets. I don't remember having any to tell. She told me hers while I ate.     She said I reminded her of someone she'd seen a long time ago. I remember dancing for her. I told her I was a bird. A manbird. A hunter. I danced around the kitchen table and sang and pretended to be PowWow Dancer. A bird of dance. A bird of rhythm.When my mother and grandmother went to town, Ain't Sally took me for a walk around her place. The farm had belonged to her relatives. We went down to the dry gorge and she pointed out all kinds of roots and trees. She asked me if I knew about the plants of the pasture. I said yes. I thought I was lying.     As we walked farther from the house, I remember a hot gusty wind picked up her voice like dust tendrils on bedrock and blew it away from me. I ran to catch the sound. I found Ain't Sally sitting on a granite rock.     --Ala Tek. Indian girl.     --Come and see, on our land, the four winds of the old days will blow through our hair.     Then she tugged at my black braids.     --Come and visit the Snakes, Ala Tek.     --When I was your age they blew across this place like red dust devils on flat neutral plains.     --Can you see them.     --Do you hear the Snake People calling us?--Yes. I can see them. I hear them. They are naked and wild. Their eyes, like black grapes shining in the Sun, stare back at me.     --They're hungry.    I watch the Snake People eat the fleshy intestines of my uncle's butchered cow. I taste the hot blood, roll it around on my tongue and remember. It makes me sweat.     I watch the Snake People play games around the carcass. And before we walk back into the house, the old woman and me, she runs her crooked fingers across my eyes and says.     --Ala Tek. Indian Girl.     --The ghosts of your ancestors will visit you there.The rest of the visit blurs. My last memories are from that day. She waves to me from her front porch.      She never explained the Snakes. She only said, "Che pisa lauchi. I'll see you. Indians never say good-bye.      I never saw Ain't Sally again until she appeared in my hospital room. I thought she was dead. I didn't know about the Snakes until some twenty-five years later. To make the sign of the snake means:     Comanches are here.





The Fork-in-the-Road Indian Poetry Store
 

     I.

i saved my energy as i read,
          like managing held-breath underwater
so i could extend my survey 
          and not miss anything great

the fork-in-the-road indian poetry store
on the highway on the northeast side
of wetumka toward weleetka
          large open grassy field behind it
          county road completing the fork
          vanishes in verdant
          north oktahutchee bottomland
i am overcome
by the indianness of this town
                       exhilaration
                       an unexplainable import of joy
                       pervades me
even the few current-age vestiges
do not belie
                        a sense that this town
                        this people have always been here


     II.

the reading today on the lawn is by two elderly sisters
in long gingham dresses who are the last living speakers of yuchi

Endangered Species
 

herds of buffalo
gone now
                       you search the undulating
         sea of grass
near campo and wildhorse
                       for the great hairy horned whales
but none surface

instead
if you look carefully

                        you see the shallow swimming

                     you identify with

Digging Deeper
 

   I. The Secret Garden

fooled the squash bugs
by setting young plants
in the center of piles
of old weathered cedar shingles
that i had dumped
one truckload at a time
around the perimeter of the woods
out of sight of the house
yet near enough to garner a hand
of bucketful for kindling
when the woodstove became
december's focus

the shingle pile had flattened
from firewood attrition and gravity
so only a few layers remained
no wild plants grew up through the shingles
although a couple of hours of sunshine
lit each pile each day
i called it the secret garden
because no one ever walks that way


    II. The Change

the middle vegetable garden
and the south garden (Vegetable River)
have provided entertainment and food

first the june-july drought
scorched and stunted growth
even with frequent watering
then came the late july
and august monsoons
with a 65-70/85-90 mix
almost every day

the plants invigorated
the bugs rebirthed 
the grasses skyrocketed
from rock-hard drought
to rainforest jungle
i took a gas-powered weedeater
into the Vegetable River delta
yesterday whacked some high weeds
on the periphery of the melon patch
and uncovered two twenty-pound
crimson sweets in another corner
of the patch a crimson sweet was so ripe
that it had cracked itself open
sixty-five days after
sticking the seed in the ground

i was thrilled
after three years
of growing vines and stunted fruit
i had finally grown
big ripe melons


    III. August

august gardening is by caesar
certainly august
the purple hulls the 
yellow-shelled cowpeas
yellow and white okra blossoms
all wash out in the intensity
of <<green>> whelming <<green>>

even on a cool morning or evening
i come in from the search and harvest
having had not the slightest
perception of heat even with
sweat drenching my forehead
double-shirted long-sleeved
against the reborn mosquitoes
and realize only then
how hot my body is
the air is cool
what created the heat?

a perception narrows
that more than heat and humidity
are at play an intensity
a swollen vibration 
more than the half-black over-ripe
jalapenos more than the 
crisp prongs of okra pod
more than the nutty crunch
of raw cowpeas more than the
fruitful tangle of kentucky wonder and
morning glory smartweed vines
more than white glistening
corn smut blisters
more than the biggest brightest-marked
three-inch grasshoppers and cicadas
that you've ever seen
an intensity underlain in
a crush of <<green>> an interplay a 
swollen vibration a 
chlorophylandering that even
the dogs won't come near
no snakes no skinks no lizards
too strong for spiders

I-gv-yi-i Tsa-la-gi Go-whe-lv-i: A-sgo-hni-ho-'i/

FIRST CHEROKEE LESSON: MOURNING

             Find a flint blade
             Use your teeth as a whetstone

             Cut your hair
             Talk to shadows and crows

             Cry your red throat raw

             Learn to translate the words you miss most:
             dust                     love                    poetry

             Learn to say         home

My cracked earth lips
drip words not sung
as lullabies to my infant ears
not laughed over dinner
or choked on in despair
No

They played dead until
the soldiers passed
covered the fields like corpses
and escaped into the mountains
When it's safe we'll find you
they promised
But we were already gone
before sunrise

I crawl through a field of
twisted bodies to find them
I do everything Beginning Cherokee
tells me
Train my tongue
to lie still
Keep teeth tight
against lips
Listen to instruction tapes
Study flash cards

How can I greet my ancestors in a language they don't understand

My tear ducts fill with milk
because what I most love
was lost at birth

My blood roars skin to blisters 
weeps haunted calls of owls
bones splinter
jut through skin
until all of me
is wounded
as this tongue


Ta-li-ne-i Tsa-la-gi Go-whe-lv-i: A-ni-s-gi-li/

SECOND CHEROKEE LESSON: GHOSTS

             Leave your hair
             at the foot of your bed

             Scratch your tongue
             with a cricket's claw to speak again

             Stop the blood with cornmeal

             Your ancestors will surround you as you sleep
             keep away ghosts of generals presidents       priests
             who hunger for your
             rare and tender tongue

             They will keep away ghosts
             so you have strength
             to battle the living

Stories float through lives
with an owl's sudden swooping
I knew some Cherokee
when I was little
My cousins taught me
My mother watches it all happen again
sees ghosts rush at our throats
with talons drawn like bayonets
When I came home speaking
your grandmother told me
I forbid you to speak that language
in my house
Learn something useful

We sit at the kitchen table
As she drinks iced tea
in the middle of winter
I teach her to say u-ga-lo-ga-go-tlv-tv-nv/ tea
across plastic buckets of generic peanut butter
wonder bread diet coke
Try to teach her something useful

I am haunted by loss
My stomach is a knot of serpents
and my hair grows out
as owl feathers

THIRD CHEROKEE LESSON: MEMORY

             Raid archeologists' camps
             and steal shovels
             to rebury the dead

             Gather stories like harvest
             and sing honor songs

             Save the seeds
             to carry you through the winter

             Bury them deep in your flesh

             Weep into your palms
             until stories take root
             in your bones
             split skin
             blossom

There are stories caught
in my mother's hair
I can't bear the weight of

Could you give me a braid
straight down the middle
of my back just the way I like
So I part her black-going-silver hair
into three strands
thick as our history
radiant as crow wings

             This is what it means to be Indian
Begging for stories in a living room
stacked high with newspapers magazines baby toys

Mama story me

She remembers
             Great Grandmother Nancy Harmon
             who heard white women
             call her uppity Indian during
             a quilting bee
             and climbed down their chimney with
             a knife between her teeth

She remembers
             flour sack dresses
             tar paper shacks
             dust storms         blood       escape

She carries fire on her back
My fingers work swiftly as spiders
and the words that beat in my throat
are dragonflies

She passes stories down to me
I pass words up to her
Braid her hair

It's what she doesn't say
that could destroy me
what she can't say
She weeps milk

FOURTH CHEROKEE LESSON: BIRTH

             Gather riverbank clay
             to make a bowl

             Fill it with hot tears

             Strap it to your back
             with spider silk

             Keep your flint knife close
             to ward off death
             and slice through umbilical cords

             Be prepared for blood

Born without a womb
I wait for the crown of fire
the point where further stretching is impossible
This birth could split me
I nudge each syllable into movement
Memorize their smells
Listen to their strange sleepy sounds
They shriek with hunger and loss
I hold them to my chest and weep milk
My breasts are filled with tears

I wrap my hair around their small bodies
a river of owl feathers

See they whisper We found you
We made a promise

This time we'll be more careful
Not lose each other in
the chaos of slaughter

We are together at sunrise
from dust we sprout love and poetry
We are home
Greeting our ancestors
with rare and tender tongues





Haiku Journey
 

         i. Spring

the tips of each pine
the spikes of telephone poles
hold gathering crows

may's errant mustard
spreads wild across paved road
look both ways

roadside treble cleft
feeding gopher, paws to mouth
cheeks puffed with music

yesterday's spring wind
ruffling the grey tips of fur
rabbit dandelion

         ii. Summer

turkey vulture feeds
mechanical as a red oil rig
head rocks down up down

stiff-legged dog rises
goes grumbling after squirrel
old ears still flap

snowy egret--curves,
lines, sculpted against pond blue;
white clouds against sky

banded headed bird
this ballerina killdeer
dance on point my heart

         iii. Fall

leaf wind cold through coat
wails over hills, through barren trees
empty garbage cans dance

damp September night
lone farmer, lighted tractor
drive memory's worn path

sky black with migration 
flocks settle on barren trees
leaf birds, travel songs

october moon cast
over corn, lighted fields
crinkled sheaves of white

         iv. Winter

ground painted in frost 
thirsty morning sun drinks white
leaves rust golds return

winter bare branches 
hold tattered cups of summer
empty nests trail twigs

lace edges of ice
manna against darkened sky
words turn with weather

now one to seven
deer or haiku syllables
weave through winter trees

Northern follows jig
body flashes with strike, dive:
broken line floats up.






If I Laid Them End to End
 

That old guy with the muskrat soup
slurps it loudly from the ladle
Hoowah, pretty good stuff!
You shift your weight on the stool
raise the bad leg just enough
and retrieve the red bandana hankie.
Talk still spills like sunshine
over the knife-marred counter
as slowly you wipe the can
push the cloth back in your pocket
and cough down the grape pop
glancing at the bobbing black head
where it surfaced in the pot.

The burned farm. That hungry year.
The long walk from Strawberry Mountain
warmed now with the weight
of fresh butchered wiiyaas in your pack.
Mum's baking soda biscuits mixed and cut
lined waiting in the tin pan
like our little kids' faces at the window.
Sure took the wrinkle out of our bellies that night.

One opening day when those two old fishermen
ended up drunk clinging to the canoe.
The hunt for diamond willow,
beaver camp on Easter weekend,
the whitefish feeding on wax worms,
the string of crappies slipped from your hand,
the missing outhouse floor,
training waaboose,
feeding the least weasel,
tales from working on the ships,
from boiling sap, planting trees, pounding, carving,
and then the cigar box memories
of those old time Indians
who could really tell stories . . .






Goodbye to All That
 

                                              i.
He could have taken you prisoner, of course
when our two tribes were at war
over whitefish and beaver territory
and the Anishinaabeg chased your Indian ancestors
from the woodlands he now brings you home to.
Or your Dakota relatives might have waged a war party
on their swift plains' ponies to avenge your taking
and bring you back from those uncivilized
they named in disgust the rabbit-chokers.
But those histories of dog-eaters and Chippewa crows
are just a backdrop now for other stories
told together by descendants of smallpox survivors
and French fur traders, 
clan members of Wolf and of Water Spirit.
And now you gather,
trackers and scouts in new bloodless legal battles,
still watch for mark and sign--
for the flight of waterbirds.


                                              ii.
Old histories that name us enemies
don't own us; nor do our politics
grown so pow-wow liberal you seldom
point out the follies of White Earth tribal leaders.
(Except of course for the time our elected chair
mistakenly and under the influence of civilization
drove his pickup down the railroad tracks
and made the tri-state ten o'clock news.)
And Sundays behind the Tribune
he seldom even mentions the rabid casino bucks
or gets out his calculator and with lodge-pole eyebrows
methodically measures beaded distances,
results of territorial lines drawn in your homeland.
And even though I have seen him sniff, glance over
he really almost never checks the meat in your pot,
nor reconnoiters the place of your rendezvous
just to be sure.






Redwing Blackbird
 

Feet firmly perch
thinnest stalks, reeds, bulrush.
Until all at once, they attend my
female form, streaked throat, brownness.

Three fly equidistant
around me, flashing.
Each, in turn, calls territorial
trills, beckons ok-a-li, ok-a-li!

Spreads his wings, extends
inner muscle quivering red
epaulet bands uniquely bolden.

Turn away each suitor,
mind myself my audience.
Select another to consider,
He in turn quiver thrills.

Leave for insects.
Perhaps one male follows.
Maybe a few brood of young,
line summertime.

Silver Maple samaras
wing wind, spread clusters
along with mine, renewing Prairie.

As summer closes, I leave
dragonflies, damselflies, butterflies,
mosquitoes, moths, spiders, crickets for

grain, see, Sunflower;
join thousands to flock Sky--
grackles, blackbirds, cowbirds,     starlings--
Swarming like distant smoke clouds, rising.






When the Animals Leave this Place
 

Underneath ice caps, once glacial peaks
deer, elk, vixen begin to ascend.
Free creatures camouflaged as
waves and waves receding far

from plains pulling

upward slopes and faraway snow dusted mountains.
On spotted and clear cut hills robbed of fir,
high above wheat tapestried valleys, flood plains
up where headwaters reside.

Droplets pound, listen.

Hoofed and pawed mammals
pawing and hoofing themselves up, up. 
Along rivers dammed by chocolate beavers,
trailed by salamanders--mud puppies.

Plunging through currents,
          above concrete and steel man-made barriers

these populations of plains, prairies, forests flee
in such frenzy, popping splash dance,
pillaging cattail zones, lashing lily pads--
the breath of life in muddy ponds, still lakes.

Liquid beads slide on windshield glass

along cracked and shattered pane,
spider-like with webs and prisms.
"Look, there, the rainbow
touched the ground both ends down!

Full arch seven colors showered, heed
what Indigenous know, why long ago,
they said no one belongs here, surrounding them,
that this land was meant to be wet with waters of nearby
not fertile to crops and domestic graze.

The old ones said,

"When the animals leave this place
the waters will come again.
This power is beyond the strength of man.
The river will return with its greatest force.

No one can stop her.
          She was meant to be this way.
                         Snakes in honor, do not intrude.

The rainbow tied with red and green like
that on petal rose, though only momentarily.
Colors disappear like print photographs fade.
They mix with charcoal surrounding.

A flurry of fowl follow

like strands, maidenhair falls,
from blackened clouds above
swarming inward
covering the basin and raising sky.

Darkness hangs over

the hills appear as black water crests,
blackness varying shades.
The sun is somewhere farther than the farthest ridge .
Main gravel crossroads and back back roads

slicken to mud, clay.
          Turtles creep along rising banks, snapping jowls.

Frogs chug throaty songs.
The frogs only part of immense choir
heralding the downpour, the falling oceans.
Over the train trestle, suspension bridge with

current so slick everything slides off in sheets.

Among rotten stumps in black bass ponds,
somewhere catfish reel in fins and crawl,
walking whiskers to higher waters.
Waters above, below

the choir calling it forth.

Brightly plumed jays and dull brown-headed cowbirds
fly as if hung in one place like pinwheels.
They dance toward the rain crest, 
the approaching storm

beckoning, inviting, summoning.

A single sparrow sings the stroke of rain
past the strength of sunlight.
The frog chorus sings refrain,
melody drumming thunder,

evoked by beasts and water creatures wanting their homes.
Wanting to return to clearings and streams where ash, or
white birch woods rise,    tower over,
quaking aspen stand against
storm shown veils--sheeting rains crossing

pasture, meadow, hills, mountain.
Sounds erupt.
Gathering clouds converge, push,
pull, push, pull forcing lightning

back and forth shaping 
windy, sculptured swans, mallard ducks, and giants
from stratocumulus media.
As if they are a living cloud chamber,
As if they exist only in the heavens.

Air swells with dampness.
          It has begun.






Three Translations from Characters Found on a Lovers Body
 

I.

The earth and its foregoing, this could be horizon.
Combined, the radicals pressed into one another.
What do we represent lying held in men and arms,
to erect gold and sun and legs (running)?
I call you disc, sun entangled in the branches of a tree.
Rice field over struggle, earth over self.
Effacement. Your mouth is a carriage
and the carriage plus the tenth of a cubit is turn,
bent knuckle revolving around a pivot.
Common, is the object beneath the bench.
Plant, covers, knife, a weed
extended to mean govern, the flame in the middle
of the lamp is the man with ample arms,
blend and pace in the midst of court.
Your torso sings Garden.                       Composes.


II.

Mastery of weeds extends to mean:
plants bending to cover the middle of lamp.
A knife for a flame, foregoing the earth,
this is the horizon of a man with arms.
To move across your body, I am the carriage
and the cubit, the disc running tangled
in the branches of a tree.
I am the common object beneath the bench,
the wheel running length
of the rutted road
down to the garden of abdomen.
I struggle over fields
to kiss a mouth filled with rice,
to put away evil.           This is earth over self.


III.

Beneath a table of common struggles
I blend and pace in ample arms.
A rice field foregoing garden
on the horizon of your belly.
Govern the revolving cubit, the bent knuckle.
Me over you, over self, a tree.
Earth entangled in the branches of a knife.
Plant and cover inside your mouth,
the turning disc,
the carriage and wheel.
To erect lamps in the bend
of your gold leg running
is to extend the word
to mean master, garden or weed. 






Tonawanda Swamps
 

As it would for a prow, the basin parts with your foot.
Never a marsh, of heron blue
                                                  but the single red feather
from the wing of some black bird, somewhere
a planked path winds above water,
the line of sky above this aching space.

Movement against the surface
is the page that accepts no ink.
A line running even 
over the alternating depths, organisms, algae,
a rotting leaf.

Walk naked before me
carrying a sheaf of sticks.
It's the most honest thing a man can do.

As water would to accept you,
I part
a mouth, a marsh, or margin
is of containment,
the inside circuitous edge.

No line to follow out to ocean,
no river against an envelope
                                               of trembling white ships.
Here I am landlock.
Give me your hand.






The Awful Ease of Tides
 

for Arthur Sze
    I.

Somehow precise and unquestionable,
the cut of the Chinese man's hair.
Never before this certainty,
I consider the decision of each strand.
The diameter. The angle.
So black, the way it appears,
crashing against the hard corner of his jaw.


    II.

I consider the darkness.
You are appointed court photographer. Consider this picture.


    III.

My small face is red behind a bath towel curtain.
I watch a funeral that is taking place next door.
So black, my dog,
hurling himself against a chain link fence.


    IV.

The casket is lowered and I am removing rusty pins
from the grease on the window's aluminum track,
along with strands of hair.


    V.

This is pressing.
I mark it with an asterisk. Black and large.


    VI.

A vague feeling,
pressing itself against a snowfence in my mind.
Like a threat, I view the way you cut your hair
as if it were a history of something small.






Power
 

The difference between poetry and rhetoric
is being ready to kill
yourself
instead of your children.

I am trapped on a desert of raw gunshot wounds
and a dead child dragging his shattered black
face off the edge of my sleep
blood from his punctured cheeks and shoulders
is the only liquid for miles
and my stomach
churns at the imagined taste while
my mouth splits into dry lips
without loyalty or reason
thirsting for the wetness of his blood
as it sinks into the whiteness
of the desert where I am lost
without imagery or magic
trying to make power out of hatred and destruction
trying to heal my dying son with kisses
only the sun will bleach his bones quicker.

A policeman who shot down a ten year old in Queens
stood over the boy with his cop shoes in childish blood
and a voice said "Die you little motherfucker and
there are tapes to prove it. At his trial
this policeman said in his own defense
"I didn't notice the size nor nothing else
only the color. And
there are tapes to prove that, too.

Today that 37 year old white man
with 13 years of police forcing
was set free
by eleven white men who said they were satisfied
justice had been done
and one Black Woman who said
"They convinced me meaning
they had dragged her 4'10'' black Woman's frame
over the hot coals
of four centuries of white male approval
until she let go
the first real power she ever had
and lined her own womb with cement
to make a graveyard for our children.

I have not been able to touch the destruction
within me.
But unless I learn to use
the difference between poetry and rhetoric
my power too will run corrupt as poisonous mold
or lie limp and useless as an unconnected wire
and one day I will take my teenaged plug
and connect it to the nearest socket
raping an 85 year old white woman
who is somebody's mother
and as I beat her senseless and set a torch to her bed
a greek chorus will be singing in 3/4 time
"Poor thing. She never hurt a soul. What beasts they are.





Cod
 

It is the fish that bring them first.
Cod in such numbers as to seem endless.
Cod to fill the nets and bellies of hungry
Europeans with the tender white flesh.
Cod, it seems to them, without end.

They fill the ships,
salting the fish
down in barrels,
til the hull is full,
and head back home. This wet
cod-fishing goes on for
years, far out in the Banks,
with only an occasional stop on land.

We dry our fish in the sun
cure it in smoke-houses
and sure enough, the
foreigners hear
about it.

Soon they need
a land base
to dry the cod
which weighs less
than when wet
tastes better, too

it is these dreams 
of cod that 
first bring
the French
to land

dreams 
of cod 
the gold
of the sea
that will 
fill their bellies
and their
pockets

Daughters of the King
 

          
          Les Filles du Roi (1668)French men are marrying Indian women. It will have to be stopped. Wives will have to be found. French wives for French men. And so the call goes out to all the unfortunates in France. Women without homes, without family, poor women, women alone. Women with no dowries to buy a husband. Becomes a Fille du Roi, a Daughter of the King. Each woman considers her options. The hardships she doesn't know are preferable to the ones she knows too well. As a Daughter of the King, she will have a dowry, payable to her husband at the time of marriage. She will have a home, the possibility of children, a place in the community. Women come from Ile de France, from Normandy, 800 women in ten years. Les Filles du Roi.Une Fille du Roi, 1668Marie Mazol is thirty three years old when she becomes a Daughter of the King. She will bring 300 livres to her marriage to Antoine Roy-Desjardins. She will have money for her own use as well, for expenses, they promise her. She thought it would go further, but what she takes with her are a coffer, a cap, a taffeta handkerchief, a shoe ribbon, a hundred needles, a comb, a pair of stockings, a pair of gloves, a pair of scissors, two knives, a thousand pins, a bonnet, and four laces. Thus prepared, she faces marriage to a man she doesn't know, in a country she's never seen.Les Filles du Roi--AfterwardsThe Daughters of the King become wives. But French and Indian keep marrying. Their descendants will say, "Scratch a Frenchman, find an Indian.





graduate school first semester: so here I am writing about Indians again
 

"The conquest is not sustainable . . .                                  --Winona LaDuke

thanks for bringing that 
to our attention
she said the first time
to my response to a history text
about a famous painting
of the Battle of Quebec
that never mentioned the French
and only mentioned Indians twice,
once as nuisances, once 
as the noble savage
kneeling by the dying
English general

this was during
the French and Indian war
I said, soon thousands 
of French and Indian people 
would be displaced, sold
into indentured servitude
my own family among them
there would be bounties
on the heads of Abenaki people
in Maine, and the English
would sow the fields of the Mohawks
with salt

thanks for bringing that up,
she said

the next book mentioned
cannibals in the Caribbean,
Indians who believed the Spanish were
gods, Indians killing themselves, Indian
women in love with Spanish pricks, Indians
whose names, even when known, were 
passed over in favor of the ones
given them by the Spanish

stop writing about
Indians
she told me
you're making everyone
feel guilty

but the next book
was back in Maine
home territory
the diary of a midwife
right after that same
French and Indian war
and she was using herbs
not found in English herbals
and wrote that a "young
squaw visited her 
over a period of 
three weeks, but

the famous historian 
said only that 
there may have been 
Indians in the area,
while she wrote 
at length about 
white men dressing up
as Indians
to protest against the rich
stealing their lands

stop writing about Indians
she told me again
only louder as if
I was hard of hearing
you have to allow authors
their subjects, she said
stop writing about 
what isn't in the text

which is just our entire history

this week, she said
I'm really upset
you're telling the same story
three times 
because there's only
one story about Indians
and we all know what it is
so I asked her if there are an
infinite number of stories about
white people
and she told me to 
stop being racist

so I stayed away from class for a week
because they were reading a book
about a mystery in the Everglades
and I knew there had to be 
Indians in that swamp
and I didn't want to have to 
write about Indians
again

it was on to the next book 
written, she said by
a Cherokee writer, 
which Leslie Silko, who is Laguna, 
will be interested to find out
because the book was Ceremony
but that is a small mistake 
sort of like saying that 
Dante is Chinese, so 
I overlooked it

now, she told me
write about Indians

and I might have done that
except she went on 
about Indians putting on 
a mask of whiteness
like white people put on 
black face, and some of the students
wrote it down in their notebooks
and everyone started talking about
minstrel shows

then she wanted me to tell her
if there is such a thing as
an Indian world view
and I said, well, yes and no,
which I figured was safe
since I would be at least
half-right whichever answer
she wanted, but when I mentioned
the European world view,
she said there isn't any such thing
which was quite a relief to me,
I hate to think there were a 
whole lot of people thinking in
hierarchies and as if the 
earth is a dead object and
animals and plants and some people
not having spirit
then she said I'd better stick
to what I know, that is,
Indians, which is what 
I was trying to do in the first place,
and that maybe European philosophy
was too much for my primitive
brain in spite of its being my
undergraduate major
and I pointed out that the
oppressed always know more
about the oppressor than vice
versa, so she just glared at me
and told me that I look
Scandinavian

which was a surprise to me
and I wondered why I never was a
prom queen since it was always the
Scandinavian girls who got that
honor, maybe they never
noticed I was one of them. Exactly
how much Indian are you anyway?
she asked. I told her I guessed
I was pretty much Indian. I 
suppose she wondered 
why I wouldn't accept that mask of
whiteness she kept talking about
as myself







Our Lady of Perpetual Loss
 

Maybe all losses before this one are practice:
maybe all grief that comes after her death seems tame.
I wish I knew how to make dying simple,
wish our mother's last week were not constructed
of clear plastic tubing, IVs, oxygen hiss,
cough medicine, morphine patches, radiation tattoos,
the useless burn on her chest.
I'm still the incurable optimist, she whispers,
you're still the eternal pessimist.
My sister sleeps on a sofa; our brother, exhausted,
rolls up in a blanket on the hard floor.
Curled in a rented white bed, our mother's body
races to catch up with her driven, nomadic soul.
Those nights alone, foster care, empty beer bottles
taught us she was always already vanishing.






Advice from La Llorona
 

--a found poem

Each grief has its unique side.
Choose the one that appeals to you.
Go gently.
Your body needs energy to repair the amputation.
Humor phantom pain.

Your brain cells are soaked with salt;
connections fail unexpectedly and often.
Ask for help.
Accept help.

Read your grief like the daily newspaper:
headlines may have information you need.
Scream. Drop-kick the garbage can across the street.

Don't feel guilty if you have a good time.
Don't act as if you haven't been hit by a Mack Truck.
Do things a little differently
but don't make a lot of changes.
Revel in contradiction.

Talk to the person who died.
Give her a piece of your mind.

Try to touch someone at least once a day.
Approach grief with determination.
Pretend the finish line doesn't keep receding.
Lean into the pain.
You can't outrun it.






Love Poem to a Butch Woman
 

This is how it is with me:
so strong, I want to draw the egg
from your womb and nourish it in my own.
I want to mother your child made only
of us, of me, you: no borrowed seed
from any man. I want to re-fashion
the matrix of creation, make a human being
from the human love that passes between
our bodies. Sweetheart, this is how it is:
when you emerge from the bedroom
in a clean cotton shirt, sleeves pushed back
over forearms, scented with cologne
from an amber bottle--I want to open
my heart, the brightest aching slit
of my soul, receive your pearl.
I watch your hands, wait for the sign
that means you'll touch me,
open me, fill me; wait for that moment
when your desire leaps inside me.






Old Territory. New Maps.
 

You plan an uncomplicated path
through Colorado's red dust,
around the caustic edge of Utah's salt flats
a single night at a hotel
in the Idaho panhandle. Our plans change.
It's spring, we are two Indian women along
together and the days open:
sunrise on a fine long road,
antelope against dry hills,
heron emerging from dim fields.
You tell me this is a journey
you've always wanted to take.
You ask me to tell you what I want.

I want my longing to miraculously
bring you through the barrier of your skin
into my blood so that I can possess you
entirely and yet be entirely possessed.
You say no, your face tight with pain, tears
burning your eyes, hands clenching the steering wheel.
I believe you. We drive hundreds of miles 
across deserts sculpted by wind and story,
and I learn distance from my hand to your thigh,
your mouth to my mouth, the curve of a collar
along a warm, smooth neck.
You grin as if no one has ever seen you thus:
naked, savage, happy.
That is the beginning of yes.

Ghosts are everywhere.
We hear them singing on that mountain in Ute country,
the cries of your flute pleasuring old spirits.
Like those people whose land we cross,
we don't live by lines drawn on paper.
Instead, we mark the waterfall of shy kisses, 
a dry windy town where we exchange secrets in whispers,
the high cliff hollow that shelters us
on the edge of the Uinta forest.
Wildflowers bend beneath our bodies,
cup the trembling weight of touch.
We wander for awhile in a place vast enough
to contain all possibilities.

After twelve hundred miles together
we enter green forest thick along a fearless river.
This dense topography we can't see through,
can't find the horizon to judge distances
or the arc of the sun to know east from west.
There at last you clasp my hand, guide it
to a place beyond maps, 
no universe I have ever known.
It is a raw landscape; we are the sojourners
overcome by the perilous shock of arrival.
We stop the car, walk by the river,
clumsy, frightened by desire. I wish
for more than body or soul can bear.

Sweet, these are the maps we made together,
territories we foolishly vowed to own.
Here, the place we wandered off the map,
moved deep into a land without scars 
where every direction took us home
but no place could give us shelter.
I don't know how to survive awakening
in a woman's body with a child's
broken heart. I fall on my knees, our love
a bare stone on the windowsill between us.
How can I learn this trick, will your body
back to the other side of my skin? Help me
translate loss the way this land does--
flood, earthquake, landslide--
terrible, and alive.

Intimate Detail
 

Late summer, late afternoon, my work
interrupted by bees who claim my tea,
even my pen looks flower-good to them.
I warn a delivery man that my bees, 
who all summer have been tame as cows,
now grow frantic, aggressive, difficult to shoo
from the house. I blame the second blooms
come out in hot colors, defiant vibrancy--
unexpected from cottage cosmos, nicotianna,
and bean vine. But those bees know, I'm told
by the interested delivery man, they have only 
so many days to go. He sighs at sweetness untasted.

Still warm in the day, we inspect the bees.
This kind stranger knows them in intimate detail.
He can name the ones I think of as shopping ladies.
Their fur coats ruffed up, yellow packages tucked
beneath their wings, so weighted with their finds
they ascend in slow circles, sometimes drop, while
other bees whirl madly, dance the blossoms, ravish
broadly so the whole bed bends and bounces alive.

He asks if I have kids, I say not yet. He has five,
all boys. He calls the honeybees his girls although
he tells me they're ungendered workers 
who never produce offspring. Some hour drops,
the bees shut off. In the long, cool slant of sun,
spent flowers fold into cups. He asks me if I've ever
seen a Solitary Bee where it sleeps. I say I've not.
The nearest bud's a long-throated peach hollyhock.
He cradles it in his palm, holds it up so I spy
the intimacy of the sleeping bee. Little life safe in a petal,
little girl, your few furious buzzings as you stir
stay with me all winter, remind me of my work undone.






Last Snow
 

Dumped wet and momentary on a dull ground
that's been clear but clearly sleeping, for days.
Last snow melts as it falls, piles up slush, runs in first light
making a music in the streets we wish we could keep.
Last snow. That's what we'll think for weeks to come.
Close sun sets up a glare that smarts like a good cry.
We could head north and north and never let this season go.
Stubborn beast, the body reads the past in the change of light,
knows the blow of grief in the time of trees' tight-fisted leaves.
Stubborn calendar of bone. Last snow. Now it must always be so.





Elemental Conception
 

She wants to grow from the rich-rotten trunk
of the stamp left to sprout in the chain-linked
alley yard. She wants to be born there.

Or out of dry wind rushing debris around
and cleaning the world like a slate that 
hasn't yet written how her birth will be

if she be born slick-wet and shimmering
in rings like gas spill, born from long trickles
run off curb-piled snow that flows in curtains

any northern winter when it is possible to burn
in water, when flakes against skin so cold brand
their pattern on the new-thought, engraved self.






A Practical Mom
 

can go to Bible study every Sunday
and swear she's still not convinced,
but she likes to be around people who are.
We have the same conversation
every few years--I'll ask her if she stops
to admire the perfect leaves
of the Japanese maple
she waters in her backyard,
or tell her how I can gaze for hours
at a desert sky and know this
as divine. Nature, she says, 
doesn't hold her interest. Not nearly
as much as the greens, pinks, and grays 
of a Diebenkorn abstract, or the antique
Tiffany lamp she finds in San Francisco.
She spends hours with her vegetables,
tasting the tomatoes she's picked that morning
or checking to see which radishes are big enough to pull.
Lately everything she touches bears fruit,
from new-green string beans to winning
golf strokes, glamorous hats she designs and sews,
soaring stocks with their multiplying shares.
These are the things she can count in her hands,
the tangibles to feed and pass on to daughters
and grandchildren who can't keep up with all
the risky numbers she depends on, the blood-sugar counts
and daily insulin injections, the monthly tests
of precancerous cells in her liver and lungs.
She's a mathematical wonder with so many calculations
kept alive in her head, adding and subtracting
when everyone else is asleep.

The Weight of Nothing
 

                      to end with nothing is something                              Suvan Geer                      or to rephrase a popular Billy Preston song,                      "somethin' from nothin' is somethin'

     I

everyone loves
the disappearing
coin. a bird pulled from
an empty hat. the comfort of
trusting a magician's hands.
when we know we'll get some-
thing from what 
he takes away.


     II

the student's assignment--
concentrate on nothing
for fifteen minutes a day.
she tries to empty her head
but can't figure out how.
after all, she doesn't know what
nothing sounds or looks like,
and the teacher won't give 
the slightest clue. yet
she's got a good hunch
the exercise might quiet
all that shriek and clatter
trapped between her ears.
so like a good pupil,
she devotes an entire year
searching for nothing.
some days she's as still
as a stone, but can't
escape the distractions
of river and wind,
footsteps approaching,
birds calling in the trees
overhead. or closing
her eyes, she'll focus
on a cloudless blue sky.
pillows and planes and purple
sunsets keep interrupting.
she silently repeats words
like ocean or why,
chants sounds that dwell
low in her throat
like maah and uhmm.
at year's end her teacher 
asks if she's found nothing.
she tells him she's found
everything but nothing.
he smiles, you're closer
than you think. now
try for twenty minutes.


     III

we've all seen them--
looking at their empty
outstretched palms,
and we're fooled, thinking
about what isn't there.
sighing, they marvel
at all they've held in those hands,
their history revealed
in the thickened joints,
the full weight of their desire--
even now, incredible
hands still opening
and grasping
when there's nothing to keep.


     IV

without my friend Nothing
on the page, I'd never have to write
another poem. but Nothing waits
here, waving me on, inviting me
to rap and rant, pray sing, testify
what is, was, could, and always will be.
I greet all that's coming,
contained as sheer breath
into word, born
to crave and engrave the emptiness
that Nothing can't stop giving.






Love Story
 

The kitchen door opens onto dirt 
and the second half of the country 
all the way to the Pacific. Rusted 
prairie trains out of the tall weeds 
elbow the last century aside, rumble 
from every direction towards Chicago.

My great-grandfather, who would be 
150 years old today, put on his one 
tall hat and took the big trip 
to Omaha for my great-grandma 
with the family ring on his vest
and winter wheat lying wait in seed.

He gave her all the miles he had 
and she gave him the future I walk 
around in every day. The mountains 
were too far west to count so they 
doubled back over the land and century 
and the real weather kept coming from them.





Cabaret Ludwig
 

I'll fly off to a fjord in Norway,
post "Oh the pain above my doorway
if you insist on going your way,
           for this is not a duck.

That is what cowards say, and realists
who run away, shun the appeal its
rare white fur holds, although they feel it's
           a rabbit full of pluck.

Let's multiply, let's twitch our noses,
let's walk among the night's dark roses,
though where the oldest story goes is
           a place where tongues might cluck.

I've had my share of quacks and hisses;
whereof mouth cannot speak, it kisses;
hop to it, man, and realize this is
           a lovely bit of luck.






Algonquin Afterthoughts
 

By the time you swear you're his,    Shivering and sighing,And he vows his passion is    Infinite, undying--Lady, make a note of this:    One of you is lying.             --Dorothy Parker
Or else our drunken tumble was
   too true for daylight's pleasure,
too much in vino veritas
   troubled the gods of measure
who sent bright draughts of sunshine down
   and sobered up my treasure.

All night rapacity had come
   as naturally as breathing;
we nibbled on each other's necks
   like greedy babies teething.
How soon an empty bottle makes
   one feel a blissful free thing.

"Aspirin, aspirin, he implored;
   I fed him several pills,
and when he wondered where he was
   it gave me frightful chills,
but still I told him of the party's
   unexpected thrills.

Words woke us up, reflection turned
   affection to regret:
"After she left me I tried not
   to do this, but I get
so lonely...so I showed him out,
   warbling "I'm glad we met.

But now I crave the swift return
   of scotch-transfigured nights,
like Chaplin, horrified by his
   rich friend in City Lights
who only recognizes him
   from liquor-gladdened heights,

sticking a tall glass in the man's
   upstanding hand (the clink
or worse awaits poor tramps like us
   if scamps like you won't think)
and meekly scolding, in a voice
   weak with nostalgia, "Drink.







The World Had Fled
 

The world had fled, with all its silly cares
and questionable aches, and in one swoon
we rose above its stupefying airs
like flying lovesick pigs up to the moon.
     In that blue light where two lives equaled all,
     our souls looked down upon a spinning ball.

The world returned, and this was a surprise
I raged against like someone on a rack,
telling the sun, tears clouding my stunned eyes,
give us our splendid isolation back.
     I craved third rails, a shot of something strong
     when I found out it doesn't last for long.

The world came back and stayed, pain never ended,
but when the aches and cares begged for a hand,
grew softer in the light we'd made and tended,
I finally began to understand
    love's widening third stage, and of the three
    this was the most outstanding ecstasy.






Rain at Reading
 

We had gathered under a tent in the park
for some words before lunch and after separate mornings,
and when--twice--the poet said "capital,
the lightning bolts that followed the noun
had me bolting too; I'd always suspected
God's communist leanings, but now I regretted
how few exchanges we know
between craft and climate:

imagine a rhyme inciting a rainbow,
blood feuds bruising the sky,
hymns of forgiveness bringing a soft
new light to the faces watching the last act,
waltzes and songs and declamations--
this would be capital entertainment!--
locked in a clinch with open air.

But the lightning was as quick as it was loud.
The clouds dispersed,
and then so did the crowd.






Silver Roses
 

The strings, as if they knew
the lovers are about to meet, begin
to soar, and when he marches in the door
they soar some more--half ecstasy, half pain,
the musical equivalent of rain--
while children who have grown up with one stare
steal further looks across a crowded room,
as goners tend to do.

My father loved it too,
warned me at dinner that he'd be a wreck
long before the final trio came
(Ja, ja, she sighed, and gave him up forever);
he found his Sophie better late than never
and took the fifth about his silent tears
but like him I'm a softie, with a massive
gift for feeling blue.

I went with others, threw
bouquets and caution to the whirling wind,
believing that the rhapsody on stage
would waft its wonders up to our cheap seats;
but mirrors can be beautiful fierce cheats,
delusions of an over-smitten mind;
I relished trouser roles until I had
no petals left to strew.

Up, down the avenue
I wandered like a ghost, I wondered why
a miracle is always a mirage,
then plodded home and set back all the clocks,
spent hard-won funds installing strong new locks,
telling myself if violence like this
could never sound like violins, I would
to art, not life, be true.

And I am trying to
fathom the way I got from there to here,
the joy that snuck up when I'd sworn off joy:
we've made a sterling start, we've got a plan
to watch it on your satin couch downtown
and I'll be there upon the stroke of eight,
bearing in my trembling ungloved hand
a silver rose for you.






Feeling the draft
 

We were young and it was an accomplishment
to have a body. No one said this. No one
said much beyond "throw me that sky or 
"can the lake sleep over? The lake could not. 
The lake was sent home and I ate too many 
beets, went around with beet-blood tongue 
worrying about my draft card-burning brother 
going to war. Other brothers became holes 
at first base at war, then a few holes 
Harleying back from war in their always 
it seemed green jackets with pockets galore 
and flaps for I wondered bullets, I wondered 
how to worship these giants. None of them 
wanted to talk to me or anyone it seemed 
but the river or certain un-helmeted curves 
at high speed, I had my body 
and flung it over branches and fences 
toward my coming sullenness as the gravity 
of girls' hips began and my brother 
marched off to march against the war. 
I watched different masses of bodies on tv, 
people saying no to the jungle with grenades 
and people saying no to the grenades with signs 
and my father saying no to all of them 
with the grinding of his teeth he spoke with. 
I'd pedal after the nos up and down a hill 
like it was somehow a rosary, somehow my body 
was a prayer I could chant by letting it loose 
with others like me milling around 
the everything below five feet tall 
that was ours, the everything below 
the adult line of sight that was ours 
to hold as long as we could: a year, 
a summer. Until the quarterback came back 
without . . . well, without. When the next Adonis 
stepped up to throw the bomb. 







Report from the black box
 

For Flaco

                                     A cooler 
head of lettuce prevailed, but when the actor 
asked his question and paused 
for us to watch him pause and think 
inside the pause, I almost answered
as if we were in a bar, just the two of us 
and a balcony and spotlight. The two of us
and programs and makeup and a sofa 
from the director's living room and the black/
womb/agora/sance of theater inviting us to feel 
together alone. I recall I don't recall 
the question but its scope on his face 
was immense, as if he were the Milky Way 
asking am I pretty, am I here for sure for real 
for long and my breath was the quiet yessing 
of tall grass against the shoulders of a cat 
stalking the night. I actually opened my mouth 
before I actually thought you will be stoned 
and not in the good way, not with stones 
of tongues, stones of fingers against my forehead 
but the play was messy and tangible and full 
of the etceteras I am full of and why 
wouldn't I want to talk with that is a question 
the poem is asking you to answer wherever 
you are without me is the problem 
theater solves, since we sit together 
in the dark with the dark because the dark 
deserves a face a soliloquy a lover a bow 
at the end. When I always wonder if the players 
regret that the lights come up and they see us 
as we are seeing them as they were, 
what a weird mirror that is, showing one side 
sudden appreciation and the resumption
of loose ends, the other the vast 
and devotional possibilities of being kidnapped 
by a dream and which side is which side 
are you on?





A private public space
 

You can't trust lesbians. You invite them 

to your party and they don't come, 
they're too busy tending vaginal 
flowers, hating football, walking their golden 
and chocolate labs. X gave me a poem 

in which she was in love with a woman 
and the church but the church 
couldn't accept four breasts in one bed. 
When I asked if our coworkers knew, 

she dropped her head and I said nothing 
for years until this morning I realized 
no one reads poems: my secrets and hers
are safe in verse. I knew she'd have enjoyed 

the Beaujolais and I want to meet Dianne, 
Mona Lisa, Betty, Alice, 
the name's been changed 
to protect women who can't stand in a room 
holding hands because you can't trust 
heterosexuals to love love, however 
it comes. So I recorded 

the party for her, for them, the mic
a bit away from the action 
to catch the feel of waves touching shore 
and letting go, the wash of moods 
across the hours of drink and yes, some grapes 
were thrown and I breathed 
the quickening revelation
of a cigarette, someone said "I gave up 
underwear for Lent and I hope 

they play the tape while making love. 
As if finally the world's made happy 
by who they are, laughing with, not at 
the nipple lick clit kiss hug
in bed and after, the on and on 
of meals and moons and bills 
and burning days of pretending 
they don't exist. "Who's she? Just 

a friend. And oceans are merely dew
upon the land.






Vita
 

When I was two feet tall
and held the hand above,
how could I know
how far that limping bond would go,
that finger-inch of love.





Unmediated experience
 

She does this thing. Our seventeen- 
year-old dog. Our mostly deaf dog. 
Our mostly dead dog, statistically 
speaking. When I crouch. 
When I put my mouth to her ear 
and shout her name. She walks away. 
Walks toward the nothing of speech. 
She even trots down the drive, ears up, 
as if my voice is coming home. 
It's like watching a child 
believe in Christmas, right 
before you burn the tree down. 
Every time I do it, I think, this time 
she'll turn to me. This time 
she'll put voice to face. This time, 
I'll be absolved of decay. 
Which is like being a child 
who believes in Christmas 
as the tree burns, as the drapes catch, 
as Santa lights a smoke 
with his blowtorch and asks, want one?






Trying to Get Through
 

I make a knife of words.
I sit here waiting.
I play with crumbs.

Her eyes that should look
straight at me are
toward the window, glazed--
husband's horizon?

Not armored. Only armed
with pots and pans.
Not out of arm's reach,
beyond curtains of doorbells,
garden gates.

She puts up ironwork
in her eyes; it draws a bolt
over what's real--
then looks at me.

I wish I'd brought my saw.





Schizotableau
 

She's sitting at my little desk,
drinking decaf.
How'd she get back in?
Where's her blind man gone?
(I pray he's gone--
though the desk needs tuning.)
What door was unlocked?
They all seemed bastioned.

I sight through the crack.

That's my favorite cup,
with the bite out of it.

She's writing one of my poems.

Just who's sitting at that desk,
playing me?

Shrubbery, thrashing to get in, 
lines all panes,
long windows split in parallels.

My windows set out
on separate expeditions.
They never meet,
no matter how far extended.





Lines from the Reports of the Investigative Committees
 

The Department of the Interior and Department of Homeland Security announced a joint enquiry into the explosion and sinking of the Transocean Deepwater Horizon on April 22. The us House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce Subcommittee  on Oversight and Investigations and Senate Committee on Energy and  Natural Resources have also announced investigations.     Last week bp launched its own investigation into the incident and has an investigation team at work in Houston, Texas.
--bp.com, April 28, 2010
Beneath three thousand feet, the sea is wholly dark.
The shuttle feeds hydraulics to the blind shear ram
and represents a single failure point for disconnect.
Recommendation: Declare selected points on earth
invisible. Affected communities have been provided
with limited quantities of powdered milk
and other staples. Many questions remain. Some
close their eyes under water instinctively.
Imagination can create a sense of peril where
no real peril exists. Safety equipment tests
were necessarily imaginary; mechanisms in question
were wholly inaccessible. A journalist sinking
into the mud was told to toss his camera
to a colleague and hold extremely still. In this
sense, we are our own prisoners. Investigators
have salt in their hair and sand in their teeth.
The hotel pool is empty. Yet questions remain.
Barbeque billboards depict grinning pigs in aprons
and toques. Cleanup crews recover thousands
of plastic milk jugs from the shallows. Do these
images appeal to the death drive? Care should be
taken to ensure the highest possible reliability
from that valve. Thousands in affected communities
have been evicted and live in tents. Demonstrators
have prevented investigators from accessing 
hotel stairwells. 1900: Rudolf Diesel 
demonstrates an engine fueled by peanut oil 
at the Paris World's Fair. The Vietnamese owner 
of Bad Bob's bbq Buffet tells a journalist
she last drank powdered milk in a refugee camp 
"a thousand years ago. Items available only
in limited quantities are found in Appendix C. 
Cleanup crews have stacked thousands of drums 
of dispersant in hotel parking lots. Dominant 
failure combinations for well control suggest 
additional safety mechanism diversity
and redundancy provide additional reliability. 
Bank of America will offer limited foreclosure 
deferments in affected communities. Thousands 
of years ago, a pronghorn ram slipped beneath 
the surface of a tar pit, jerking its snout
for air. Recommendation: Live at inaccessible 
elevations. Recommendation: Close your eyes. 
Recommendation: Prevent access to the invisible. 
Engineering reports noted required safety 
mechanisms were unlikely to function yet were 
required for safety's sake. If the committee
may offer an analogy, a blind surgeon is dangerous, 
an imaginary surgeon harmless. Still, questions 
remain. BP's 2010 Q1 replacement cost profit 
was $5,598 million, compared with $2,387 million 
a year ago, an increase of 135%. Unlimited 
quantities of peanuts are available. However,
care must be taken to ensure continued high 
reliability of the shuttle valve, since it is 
extremely critical to the overall disconnect 
operation. Phenomena not meant to be accessed 
or imagined are found in Appendix E. Cleanup crews 
are sometimes idled for lack of fuel. 1913: Diesel
found dead, drowned under suspicious circumstances. 
The investigators' hotel toilets won't flush. 
Midas turned everything he touched to gold. 
In this sense, seabirds cloaked in oil are rich.
Cleanup crews live in tents and are provided 
with limited quantities of barbeque and wear 
white canvas jumpsuits like prisoners on furlough. 
If the committee may offer an analogy, the death 
drive resides at wholly dark depths of imagination 
and fuel issues from a wound we've opened there.

Lines on Marriage
 

You're not dewy with
sleep in the next room,
or impossibly
distant. You're not here.
"Bovary bores me,
Bovary irritates
me, the vulgarity
of the subject gives
me bouts of nausea.
You might be jogging
or buying groceries.
I don't know where you

It's about three, I
think, the hour Sartre

early or too late

Flaubert hates his
characters not because
of what they do or
who they are but
because they don't do
anything and are
no one. Which is to
say they're like us.
You might be on the
moon or puking gin
at a truck stop but
likely not. Emma
buys a map of Paris

Always too early or

Lines on Distance
 

She stepped into the tub at dawn and turned
on first the radio and then the tap.
The Predator operators of Nellis afb
have as much or more ptsd as pilots
who fly. Down the hall and oceans distant
I listened to her work to wash events
away as quickly as they accumulated.
A sort of race. I thought of where the soap
was going. Targets glowed on monitors
in the base's trailers near Las Vegas
and operators in full flight suits drank
coffee from paper cups and adjusted
altitude as I stroked myself beneath
the blankets. I don't like to take chances
and haven't been to Vegas in years. The pilots
call people who run for cover, black sperm
writhing across their screens, "squirters.
Near my finish line she tugged up the puckered
rubber no-slip safety mat. The sound should
remind you of a time a doctor took
hold of your arm for comfort or leverage
and tore the bandage off. If nothing like
this has happened to you, imagine it.
The haberdasher in Diderot who stole
his wife's dowry (long story) plans to leave
Paris for Geneva, sensing distance
will make him less guilty. She wasn't coming
back to bed. She may already have left.
Villagers call the drones, which make
a buzzing sound, "wasps. The radio
reported to an empty room. "An assassin,
writes Diderot, "if transported to the shores
of China, will lose sight of the corpse
he left bleeding on the banks of the Seine.
Asia's always such a great place to hide,
but Geneva's obviously more convenient.
Say she expected her husband to return
from duty in a month. Would anything
we did between now and then make us
any more or less wretched than we were?
The drone returns to Bagram without
the missiles it left with and a soldier
restores its complement. Either his name
is Dan or else imagine that. And that
a cuckold's rage can snuff a bomb. I came
into either a tissue or my fist. This was
weeks or months ago, and I can't recall.
When de Castaeda and his men clambered
down into the Grand Canyon in 1540,
they found the boulders which had looked
as tall as a man from the rim in fact
stood taller than Seville's La Giralda.
They must have marveled at distance's power
to deceive and to wake deception's twin, oblivion.
Their women and homes forgotten. You can't
hear their screams from here, but they're there.





Interpol 22019-1.7: The Head of the Hatra Apollo
 

Missing from the National Museum, Baghdad, April 2003

No light can gild the sun god's cheek but strains
through burlap now, Phoibos the refugee,
his head a marble cabbage in a sack
jouncing east by pickup down a dirt track
across Seleucid wastes, Parthian plains,
once more fortune's tourist, bobbing free.
Or not--just stashed behind a rubbish mound
where bare-boned goats might crop a scraggy meal,
scant miles from the museum's shattered room.
Stripped of laurels, his oracles, his loom
of sacred strings, no Horai here spin round,
just pacing men who wait to close the deal.
A goatherd sings, slings a Kalashnikov:
the godhead mute since looters hacked it off.






Her Scar
 

Remember me: the murmuring lips half said
in half-light, buried in the hollow
a boy's neck made, as now inside his head
they stir again, though twenty years swallow 
the purest parts of her, all but her plea,
this taunt--what act from him could it command?
The boy who'd know is gone--Re-member me--
but what man can assemble limbs, make stand
again those legs that twined in his, or hitch
the yoke of hips to sway and resurrect 
a girl? I try, but only recollect
her scar--each lewd, profaning, cautered stitch--
vermiform, red, furrowed belly to breast:
where nights, long past, he'd laid his head in rest.






Speech Therapy
 

The ugly duckling remained ugly
its whole life but found others
as ugly as itself, I guess that's the message.
Smoke rises from the heads in the backyard.
Do you think if I hang around here long enough
someone will proffer a muffin, 
one skulking shadow to another?
Soon, my shoes will be part of the populous dirt.
Have I learned all the wrong lessons,
the ones you shouldn't know until
the last dew-clogged lawn is mowed
and the sun goes down on the ruined battlements?
Why was I given a toy train if not
to stage stupendous wrecks? Sure,
I can walk by the sea holding a hand
with as much melancholy as the next fellow,
substituting the cries of slammed waves
for the droll adumbrations of distraught
skeletons, the day taking on the sheen
of a stone removed from the mouth
and skipped between the breakers jubilant and sunk.






The New Optimism
 

The recital of the new optimism
was oft interrupted, rudeness
in the ramparts, an injured raven
that needed attendance, pre-op
nudity. The young who knew everything
was new made babies who unforeseeably
would one day present their complaint.
Enough blame to go around but the new
optimism didn't stop, helped one
pick up a brush, another a spatula
even as the last polar bear sat
on his shrinking berg thinking,
I have been vicious but my soul is pure.
And the new optimism loves the bear's 
soul and makes images of it to sell
at fair-trade craft fairs with laboriously 
knotted hunks of rope, photos of cheese,
soaps with odd ingredients, whiskey,
sand, hamburger drippings, lint,
any and everything partaking of the glowing
exfoliating cleanup. And the seal
is sponged of oil spill. And the broken 
man is wheeled in a meal. War finally
seems stupid enough. You look an animal
in the eye before eating it and the gloomy
weather makes the lilacs grow. Hello,
oceans of air. Your dead cat loves you
forever and will welcome you forever home.







Walking, Blues
 

Rain so dark I
can't get through--
train going by 

in a hurry. The voice
said walk or die, I
walked,--the train

and the voice all 
blurry. I walked with 
my bones and my heart

of chalk, not even
a splintered notion:
days of thought, nights

of worry,--lonesome 
train in a hurry.








The Geese
 

slicing this frozen sky know
where they are going--
and want to get there.

Their call, both strange 
and familiar, calls
to the strange and familiar

heart, and the landscape 
becomes the landscape
of being, which becomes 

the bright silos and snowy 
fields over which the nuanced
and muscular geese

are calling--while time 
and the heart take measure.






An American Poem
 

I was born in Boston in
1949. I never wanted
this fact to be known, in
fact I've spent the better
half of my adult life
trying to sweep my early
years under the carpet
and have a life that
was clearly just mine
and independent of
the historic fate of
my family. Can you
imagine what it was
like to be one of them,
to be built like them,
to talk like them
to have the benefits
of being born into such
a wealthy and powerful
American family. I went
to the best schools,
had all kinds of tutors
and trainers, traveled
widely, met the famous,
the controversial, and
the not-so-admirable
and I knew from
a very early age that
if there were ever any
possibility of escaping
the collective fate of this famous
Boston family I would
take that route and
I have. I hopped
on an Amtrak to New
York in the early 
70s and I guess
you could say
my hidden years 
began. I thought
Well I'll be a poet.
What could be more
foolish and obscure.
I became a lesbian.
Every woman in my 
family looks like
a dyke but it's really 
stepping off the flag
when you become one.
While holding this ignominious
pose I have seen and 
I have learned and
I am beginning to think
there is no escaping
history. A woman I
am currently having
an affair with said
you know  you look
like a Kennedy. I felt
the blood rising in my
cheeks. People have
always laughed at
my Boston accent
confusing "large for
"lodge, "party
for "potty. But
when this unsuspecting
woman invoked for
the first time my
family name
I knew the jig
was up. Yes, I am,
I am a Kennedy.
My attempts to remain
obscure have not served
me well. Starting as
a humble poet I
quickly climbed to the 
top of my profession
assuming a position of
leadership and honor.
It is right that a 
woman should call
me out now. Yes,
I am a Kennedy.
And I await
your orders.
You are the New Americans.
The homeless are wandering
the streets of our nation's
greatest city. Homeless
men with AIDS are among 
them. Is that right?
That there are no homes
for the homeless, that
there is no free medical
help for these men. And women.
That they get the message
--as they are dying--
that this is not their home?
And how are your
teeth today? Can
you afford to fix them?
How high is your rent?
If art is the highest
and most honest form
of communication of
our times and the young
artist is no longer able
to move here to speak
to her timeYes, I could,
but that was 15 years ago
and remember--as I must
I am a Kennedy.
Shouldn't we all be Kennedys?
This nation's greatest city
is home of the business-
man and home of the
rich artist. People with
beautiful teeth who are not
on the streets. What shall
we do about this dilemma?
Listen, I have been educated.
I have learned about Western
Civilization. Do you know
what the message of Western
Civilization is? I am alone.
Am I alone tonight?
I don't think so. Am I
the only one with bleeding gums
tonight. Am I the only
homosexual in this room
tonight. Am I the only
one whose friends have
died, are dying now.
And my art can't 
be supported until it is
gigantic, bigger than
everyone else's, confirming
the audience's feeling that they are
alone. That they alone
are good, deserved
to buy the tickets
to see this Art.
Are working,
are healthy, should 
survive, and are
normal. Are you
normal tonight? Everyone
here, are we all normal.
It is not normal for
me to be a Kennedy.
But I am no longer
ashamed, no longer
alone. I am not
alone tonight because
we are all Kennedys.
And I am your President.







Nocturne
 

A man can give up so much, 
can limit himself to handwritten correspondence, 
to foods made of whole grains, 
to heat from a woodstove, logs 
hewn by his own hand and stacked neatly 
like corpses by the backdoor.

He can play nocturnes by heart. 
They will not make the beloved appear. 
He can learn the names of all the birds 
in the valley. Not one 
will be enticed to learn his.





Sestina: Altaforte
 

  LOQUITUR: En Betrans de Born.
     Dante Alighieri put this man in hell for that he was a stirrer-up of strife.
     Eccovi!
     Judge ye!
     Have I dug him up again?

  The scene is his castle, Altaforte. "Papiols is his jongleur. "The 
Leopard, the device of Richard (Cur de Lion).

                                    I

Damn it all! all this our South stinks peace.
You whoreson dog, Papiols, come! Let's to music!
I have no life save when the swords clash.
But ah! when I see the standards gold, vair, purple, opposing
And the broad fields beneath them turn crimson,
Then howl I my heart nigh mad with rejoicing.

                                     II

In hot summer have I great rejoicing
When the tempests kill the earth's foul peace,
And the light'nings from black heav'n flash crimson,
And the fierce thunders roar me their music
And the winds shriek through the clouds mad, opposing,
And through all the riven skies God's swords clash.

                                     III

Hell grant soon we hear again the swords clash!
And the shrill neighs of destriers in battle rejoicing,
Spiked breast to spiked breast opposing!
Better one hour's stour than a year's peace
With fat boards, bawds, wine and frail music!
Bah! there's no wine like the blood's crimson!

                                     IV

And I love to see the sun rise blood-crimson.
And I watch his spears through the dark clash
And it fills all my heart with rejoicing
And prys wide my mouth with fast music
When I see him so scorn and defy peace,
His lone might 'gainst all darkness opposing.

                                     V

The man who fears war and squats opposing
My words for stour, hath no blood of crimson
But is fit only to rot in womanish peace
Far from where worth's won and the swords clash
For the death of such sluts I go rejoicing;
Yea, I fill all the air with my music.

                                     VI

Papiols, Papiols, to the music!
There's no sound like to swords swords opposing,
No cry like the battle's rejoicing
When our elbows and swords drip the crimson
And our charges 'gainst "The Leopard's rush clash.
May God damn for ever all who cry "Peace!

                                     VII

And let the music of the swords make them crimson
Hell grant soon we hear again the swords clash!
Hell blot black for always the thought "Peace!






Song
 

My love is in a light attire
     Among the apple trees,
Where the gay winds do most desire
     To run in companies.

There, where the gay winds stay to woo
     The young leaves as they pass,
My love goes slowly, bending to
     Her shadow on the grass.

And where the sky's a pale blue cup
     Over the laughing land,
My love goes lightly, holding up
     Her dress with dainty hand.






Le Maudit
 

Women's tears are but water;
The tears of men are blood.

He sits alone in the firelight
And on either side drifts by
Sleep, like a torrent whirling,
Profound, wrinkled and dumb.

Circuitously, stealthily,
Dawn occupies the city;
As if the seasons knew of his grief
Spring has suddenly changed into snow

Disaster and sorrow
Have made him their pet;
He cannot escape their accursed embraces.
For all his dodgings
Memory will lacerate him.

What good does it do to wander
Nights hours through city streets?
Only that in poor places
He can be with common men
And receive their unspoken
Instinctive sympathy.

What has life done for him?
He stands alone in the darkness
Like a sentry never relieved,
Looking over a barren space,
Awaiting the tardy finish.





Sea-Heroes
 

Crash on crash of the sea,
straining to wreck men; sea-boards, continents,
raging against the world, furious,
stay at last, for against your fury
and your mad fight,
the line of heroes stands, godlike:

Akroneos, Oknolos, Elatreus,
helm-of-boat, loosener-of-helm, dweller-by-sea,
Nauteus, sea-man,
Prumneos, stern-of-ship,
Agchilalos, sea-girt,
Elatreus, oar-shaft:
lover-of-the-sea, lover-of-the-sea-ebb,
lover-of-the-swift-sea,
Ponteus, Proreus, Oos:
Anabesneos, who breaks to anger
as a wave to froth:
Amphiolos, one caught between 
wave-shock and wave-shock:
Eurualos, board sea-wrack,
like Ares, man's death,
and Naubolidos, best in shape,
of all first in size:
Phaekous, sea's thunderbolt--
ah, crash on crash of great names--
man-tamer, man's-help, perfect Laodamos:
and last the sons of great Alkinos,
Laodamos, Halios, and god-like Clytomeos.

Of all nations, of all cities,
of all continents,
she is favoured above the rest,
for she gives men as great as the sea,
to battle against the elements and evil:
greater even than the sea,
they live beyond wrack and death of cities,
and each god-like name spoken
is as a shrine in a godless place.

But to name you,
we, reverent, are breathless,
weak with pain and old loss,
and exile and despair--
our hearts break but to speak
your name, Oknaleos--
and may we but call you in the feverish wrack
of our storm-strewn beach, Eretmeos,
our hurt is quiet and our hearts tamed,
as the sea may yet be tamed,
and we vow to float great ships,
named for each hero,
and oar-blades, cut of mountain-trees
as such men might have shaped:
Eretmeos, and the sea is swept,
baffled by the lordly shape,
Akroneos has pines for his ship's keel;
to love, to mate the sea?
Ah there is Ponteos,
the very deep roar,
hailing you dear--
they clamour to Ponteos,
and to Proos
leap, swift to kiss, to curl, to creep,
lover to mistress.

What wave, what love, what foam,
For Oos who moves swift as the sea?
Ah stay, my heart, the weight
of lovers, of loneliness
drowns me,
alas that their very names
so press to break my heart
with heart-sick weariness,
what would they be,
the very gods,
rearing their mighty length
beside the unharvested sea?






Granadilla
 

I cut myself upon the thought of you
And yet I come back to it again and again,
A kind of fury makes me want to draw you out
From the dimness of the present
And set you sharply above me in a wheel of roses.
Then, going obviously to inhale their fragrance,
I touch the blade of you and cling upon it,
And only when the blood runs out across my fingers
Am I at all satisfied.






Carrefour
 

O You,
Who came upon me once
Stretched under apple-trees just after bathing,
Why did you not strangle me before speaking
Rather than fill me with the wild white honey of your words
And then leave me to the mercy 
Of the forest bees.






At the Fair
 

     I. Springing Jack

Green wooden leaves clap light away,
Severely practical, as they

Shelter the children candy-pale,
The chestnut-candles flicker, fail . . .

The showman's face is cubed clear as
The shapes reflected in a glass

Of water--(glog, glut, a ghost's speech
Fumbling for space from each to each).

The fusty showman fumbles, must 
Fit in a particle of dust

The universe, for fear it gain
Its freedom from my cube of brain.

Yet dust bears seeds that grow to grace
Behind my crude-striped wooden face

As I, a puppet tinsel-pink
Leap on my springs, learn how to think--

Till like the trembling golden stalk
Of some long-petalled star, I walk

Through the dark heavens, and the dew
Falls on my eyes and sense thrills through.


     II. The Ape Watches "Aunt Sally

The apples are an angel's meat;
The shining dark leaves make clear sweet

The juice; green wooden fruits alway
Fall on these flowers as white as day--

(Clear angel-face on hairy stalk:
Soul grown from flesh, an ape's young talk!)

And in this green and lovely ground
The Fair, world-like, turns round and round

And bumpkins throw their pence to shed
Aunt Sally's wooden clear-striped head.--

I do not care if men should throw
Round sun and moon to make me go--

As bright as gold and silver pence . . .
They cannot drive their black shade hence!






What the Goose-Girl Said About the Dean
 

Turn again, turn again,
Goose Clothilda, Goosie Jane.

Bright wooden waves of people creak
From houses built with coloured straws
Of heat; Dean Pasppus' long nose snores
Harsh as a hautbois, marshy-weak.

The wooden waves of people creak
Through the fields all water-sleek.

And in among the straws of light
Those bumpkin hautbois-sounds take flight.

Whence he lies snoring like the moon
Clownish-white all afternoon.

Beneath the trees' arsenical
Sharp woodwind tunes; heretical--

Blown like the wind's mane
(Creaking woodenly again).

His wandering thoughts escape like geese
Till he, their gooseherd, sets up chase,
And clouds of wool join the bright race
For scattered old simplicities.






"Tournez, Tournez, Bon Chevaux De Bois
 

Turn, turn again,
Ape's blood in each vein!
The people that pass
Seem castles of glass,
The old and the good
Giraffes of the blue wood,
The soldier, the nurse,
Wooden-face and a curse,
Are shadowed with plumage
Like birds, by the gloomage.
Blond hair like a clown's 
The music floats--drowns
The creaking of ropes,
The breaking of hopes,
The wheezing, the old,
Like harmoniums scold;
Go to Babylon, Rome,
The brain-cells called home,
The grave, new Jerusalem--
Wrinkled Methusalem!
From our floating hair 
Derived the first fair
And queer inspiration
Of music, the nation
Of bright-plumed trees
And harpy-shrill breeze . . .
     *  *  *  *
Turn, turn again,
Ape's blood in each vein!






By Candlelight
 

Houses red as flower of bean,
Flickering leaves and shadows lean!
Pantalone, like a parrot,
Sat and grumbled in the garret--
Sat and growled and grumbled till 
Moon upon the window-sill
Like a red geranium
Scented his bald cranium.
Said Brighella, meaning well:
"Pack your box and--go to Hell!
Heat will cure your rheumatism! . . .
Silence crowned this optimism--
Not a sound and not a wail:
But the fire (lush leafy vales)
Watched the angry feathers fly.
Pantalone 'gan to cry--
Could not, would not, pack his box!
Shadows (curtseying hens and cocks)
Pecking in the attic gloom
Tried to smother his tail-plume . . .
Till a cockscomb candle-flame
Crowing loudly, died: Dawn came.






Ghost-Raddled
 

"Come, surly fellow, come! A song!
     "What, madmen? Sing to you?
Choose from the clouded tales of wrong
     And terror I bring to you.

Of a night so torn with cries,
     Honest men sleeping
Start awake with glaring eyes,
     Bone chilled, flesh creeping.

Of spirits in the web-hung room
     Up above the stable,
Groans, knocking in the gloom
     The dancing table.

Of demons in the dry well
     That cheep and mutter,
Clanging of an unseen bell,
     Blood, choking the gutter.

Of lust, frightful, past belief,
     Lurking unforgotten,
Unrestrainable, endless grief
     From breasts long rotten.

A song? What laughter or what song
     Can this house remember?
Do flowers and butterflies belong
     To a blind December?






St. Patricks Day: With an Irish Shamrock
 

From the region of zephyrs, the Emerald isle,
     The land of thy birth, in my freshness I come,
To waken this long-cherished morn with a smile,
     And breathe o'er thy spirit the whispers of home.
O welcome the stranger from Erin's green sod;
  I sprang where the bones of thy fathers repose,
I grew where thy free step in infancy trod,
  Ere the world threw around thee its wiles and its woes.
         But sprightlier themes
         Enliven the dreams,
My dew-dropping leaflets unfold to impart:
         To loftiest emotion
         Of patriot devotion,
I wake the full chord of an Irishman's heart.

The rose is expanding her petals of pride,
     And points to the laurels o'erarching her tree;
And the hardy Bur-thistle stands rooted beside,
     And sternly demands;--Who dare meddle wi' me?
And bright are the garlands they jointly display,
     In death-fields of victory gallantly got;
But let the fair sisters their trophies array,
     And show us the wreath where the shamrock is not!
             By sea and by land,
             With bullet and brand,
My sons have directed the stormbolt of war;
             The banners ye boast,
             Ne'er waved o'er our host,
Unfanned by the accents of Erin-go-bragh!

Erin mavourneen! dark is thy night;
     Deep thy forebodings and gloomy thy fears;
And O, there are bosoms with savage delight
     Who laugh at thy plainings and scoff at thy tears!
But, Erin mavourneen, bright are the names
     Who twine with the heart-vein thy fate in their breast;
And scorned be the lot of the dastard, who shames
     To plant, as a trophy, this leaf on his crest!
             Thrice trebled disgrace
             His honours deface,
Who shrinks from proclaiming the isle of his birth!
             Though lowly its stem,
             This emerald gem
Mates with the proudest that shadow the earth!



      Sandhurst, March 17, 1827






St. Patricks Day
 

St. Patrick's Day! St. Patrick's Day!
Oh! thou tormenting Irish lay--
I've got thee buzzing in my brain,
And cannot turn thee out again.
Oh, mercy! music may be bliss
But not in such a shape as this,
When all I do, and all I say,
Begins and ends in Patricks's Day.

Had it but been in opera shape,
Italian squall, or German scrape,
Fresh from the bow of Paganini,
Or caught from Weber of Rossini,
One would not care so much--but, oh!
The sad plebeian shame to know
An old blind fiddler bore away
My senses with St. Patrick's Day.

I take up Burke in hopes to chase
The plaguing phantom from its place;
But all in vain--attention wavers
From classic lore to triplet quavers;
An "Essay on the great "Sublime
Sounds strangely set in six-eight time.
Down goes the book, read how I may,
The words will flow to Patrick's Day.






St. Patricks Day
 

There's an Isle, a green Isle, set in the sea,
     Here's to the Saint that blessed it!
And here's to the billows wild and free
     That for centuries have caressed it!

Here's to the day when the men that roam
     Send longing eyes o'er the water!
Here's to the land that still spells home
     To each loyal son and daughter!

Here's to old Ireland--fair, I ween,
     With the blue skies stretched above her!
Here's to her shamrock warm and green,
     And here's to the hearts that love her!






To the Swimmer
 

Now as I watch you, strong of arm and endurance, battling and struggling
With the waves that rush against you, ever with invincible strength returning
Into my heart, grown each day more tranquil and peaceful, comes a fierce longing
Of mind and soul that will not be appeased until, like you, I breast yon deep and boundless expanse of blue.

With an outward stroke of power intense your mighty arm goes forth,
Cleaving its way through waters that rise and roll, ever a ceaseless vigil keeping
Over the treasures beneath.

My heart goes out to you of dauntless courage and spirit indomitable,
And though my lips would speak, my spirit forbids me to ask,
"Is your heart as true as your arm?






Sapphics
 

So it is: sleep comes not on my eyelids.
Nor in my eyes, with shaken hair and white
Aloof pale hands, and lips and breasts of iron,
   So she beholds me.

And yet though sleep comes not to me, there comes
A vision from the full smooth brow of sleep,
The white Aphrodite moving unbounded
   By her own hair.

In the purple beaks of the doves that draw her,
Beaks straight without desire, necks bent backward
Toward Lesbos and the flying feet of Loves
   Weeping behind her.

She looks not back, she looks not back to where
The nine crowned muses about Apollo
Stand like nine Corinthian columns singing 
   In clear evening.

She sees not the Lesbians kissing mouth
To mouth across lute strings, drunken with singing,
Nor the white feet of the Oceanides
   Shining and unsandalled.

Before her go cryings and lamentations
Of barren women, a thunder of wings,
While ghosts of outcast Lethean women, lamenting,
   Stiffen the twilight.






After Fifty Years
 

Her house is empty and her heart is old,
And filled with shades and echoes that deceive
No one save her, for still she tries to weave
With blind bent fingers, nets that cannot hold.
Once all men's arms rose up to her, tis told,
And hovered like white birds for her caress:
A crown she could have had to bind each tress
Of hair, and her sweet arms the Witches' Gold. 

Her mirrors know her witnesses, for there
She rose in dreams from other dreams that lent
Her softness as she stood, crowned with soft hair.
And with his bound heart and his young eyes bent
And blind, he feels her presence like shed scent,
Holding him body and life within its snare.






A Poplar
 

Why do you shiver there
Between the white river and the road?
You are not cold,
With the sun light dreaming about you;
And yet you lift your pliant supplicating arms as though
To draw clouds from the sky to hide your slenderness.

You are a young girl
Trembling in the throes of ecstatic modesty,
A white objective girl
Whose clothing has been forcibly taken away from her.





Storm Ending
 

Thunder blossoms gorgeously above our heads,
Great, hollow, bell-like flowers,
Rumbling in the wind,
Stretching clappers to strike our ears . . .
Full-lipped flowers
Bitten by the sun
Bleeding rain
Dripping rain like golden honey--
And the sweet earth flying from the thunder.






Banking Coal
 

Whoever it was who brought the first wood and coal
To start the Fire, did his part well;
Not all wood takes to fire from a match,
Nor coal from wood before it's burned to charcoal.
The wood and coal in question caught a flame
And flared up beautifully, touching the air
That takes a flame from anything.

Somehow the fire was furnaced,
And then the time was ripe for some to say,
"Right banking of the furnace saves the coal.
I've seen them set to work, each in his way,
Though all with shovels and with ashes,
Never resting till the fire seemed most dead;
Whereupon they'd crawl in hooded night-caps
Contentedly to bed. Sometimes the fire left alone
Would die, but like as not spiced tongues
Remaining by the hardest on till day would flicker up,
Never strong, to anyone who cared to rake for them. 
But roaring fires never have been made that way.
I'd like to tell those folks that one grand flare
Transferred to memory tissues of the air
Is worth a like, or, for dull minds that turn in gold,
All money ever saved by banking coal.






Song of the Son
 

Pour O pour that parting soul in song,
O pour it in the sawdust glow of night,
Into the velvet pine-smoke air tonight,
And let the valley carry it along.
And let the valley carry it along. 

O land and soil, red soil and sweet-gum tree,
So scant of grass, so profligate of pines,
Now just before an epoch's sun declines 
Thy son, in time, I have returned to thee.
Thy son, I have in time returned to thee.

In time, for though the sun is setting on
A song-lit race of slaves, it has not set;
Though late, O soil, it is not too late yet
To catch thy plaintive soul, leaving, soon gone,
Leaving, to catch thy plaintive soul soon gone. 

O Negro slaves, dark purple ripened plums,
Squeezed, and bursting in the pine-wood air,
Passing, before they stripped the old tree bare
One plum was saved for me, one seed becomes

An everlasting song, a singing tree,
Caroling softly souls of slavery,
What they were, and what they are to me,
Caroling softly souls of slavery.






Harvest Song
 

I am a reaper whose muscles set at sun-down. All my oats are cradled.
But I am too chilled, and too fatigued to bind them. And I hunger.

I crack a grain between my teeth. I do not taste it.
I have been in the fields all day. My throat is dry. I hunger.

My eyes are caked with dust of oat-fields at harvest-time.
I am a blind man who stares across the hills, seeking stack'd fields 
     of other harvesters.

It would be good to see them . . . crook'd, split, and iron-ring'd handles 
     of the scythes . . . It would be good to see them, dust-caked and 
     blind. I hunger.

(Dusk is a strange fear'd sheath their blades are dull'd in.)
My throat is dry. And should I call, a cracked grain like the oats
     . . . eoho--

I fear to call. What should they hear me, and offer me their grain,
     oats, or wheat or corn? I have been in the fields all day. I fear 
     I could not taste it. I fear knowledge of my hunger.

My ears are caked with dust of oat-fields at harvest-time. 
I am a deaf man who strains to hear the calls of other harvesters whose
     throats are also dry.

It would be good to hear their songs . . . reapers of the sweet-stalked
     cane, cutters of the corn . . . even though their throats cracked, and
     the strangeness of their voices deafened me. 

I hunger. My throat is dry. Now that the sun has set and I am chilled.
     I fear to call. (Eoho, my brothers!)

I am a reaper. (Eoho!) All my oats are cradled. But I am too fatigued
     to bind them. And I hunger. I crack a grain. It has no taste to
     it. My throat is dry . . .

O my brothers, I beat my palms, still soft, against the stubble of my
     harvesting. (You beat your soft palms, too.) My pain is sweet.
     Sweeter than the oats or wheat or corn. It will not bring me
     knowledge of my hunger.






I Have Not Lived
 

Though half my years besiege the aged sun,
     I have not lived. My robust preparation
     Lags tardily behind fit consummation,
Droops sweatily in courses just begun.

Oh, I have loved and lusted with the best,
     Plucked momentary music from the senses;
     I've kissed a lip or two with fair pretenses
And wept for softness of a woman's breast.

My mind rebounds to nether joys and pain,
     Toying with filth and pharisaic leaven;
     I know the lift up sundry peaks to heaven,
And every rockless path to hell again.

I wait the hour when gods have more to give
Than husks and bare insatiate will to live.






Grieve Not
 

Grieve not that winter masks the yet quick earth,
        Nor still that summer walks the hills no more;
        That fickle spring has doffed the plaid she wore
To swathe herself in napkins till rebirth.

These buddings, flowerings, are nothing worth;
        This ermine cloud stretched firm across the lakes
        Will presently be shattered into flakes;
Then, starveling world, be subject to my mirth.

I know that faithful swift mortality
        Subscribes to nothing longer than a day;
        All beauty signals imminent decay;
And painted wreckage cumbers land and sea.

I laugh to hear a sniveling wise one say,
"Some winnowed self escapes this reckless way.






Poets Have Chanted Mortality
 

It had better been hidden
    But the Poets inform:
We are chattel and liege
    Of an undying Worm.

Were you, Will, disheartened,
    When all Stratford's gentry
Left their Queen and took service
    In his low-lying country?

How many white cities
    And grey fleets on the storm
Have proud-builded, hard-battled,
    For this undying Worm?

Was a sweet chaste lady
    Would none of her lover.
Nay, here comes the Lewd One,
    Creeps under her cover!

Have ye said there's no deathless
     Of face, fashion, form,
Forgetting to honor
     The extent of the Worm?

O ye laughers and light-lipped,
    Ye faithless, infirm,
I can tell you who's constant,
    'Tis the Eminent Worm.

Ye shall trip on no limits,
    Neither time ye your term,
In the realms of His Absolute
    Highness the Worm.





On the Poets Birth
 

A page, a huntsman and a priest of God
    Her lovers, met in jealous contrariety
Equally claiming the sole parenthood
    Of him the perfect crown of their variety.
Then, whom to admit, herself she could not tell:
That always was her fate, she loved too well.

"But many-fathered little one, she said,
    "Whether of high or low, of smooth or rough,
Here is your mother whom you brought to bed;
    Acknowledge only me; be this enough;
For such as worship after shall be told
A white dove sired you or a rain of gold.






A Valentine
 

The hunter to the husbandman
Pays tribute since our love began,
And to love-loyalty dedicates
The phantom kills he meditates.
Let me embrace, embracing you,
Beauty of other shape and hue,
Odd glinting graces of which none
Shone more than candle to your sun;
Your well-kissed hand was beckoning me
In unfamiliar imagery.
Smile your forgiveness: each bright ghost
Dives in love's glory and is lost
Yielding your comprehensive pride
A homage, even to suicide.






A Renascence
 

White flabbiness goes brown and lean,
     Dumpling arms are now brass bars,
 They've learnt to suffer and live clean,
     And to think below the stars.
  
 They've steeled a tender, girlish heart,
     Tempered it with a man's pride,
 Learning to play the butcher's part
     Though the woman screams inside--
  
 Learning to leap the parapet, 
     Face the open rush, and then
 To stab with the stark bayonet,
     Side by side with fighting men.
  
 On Achi Baba's rock their bones
     Whiten, and on Flanders' plain,
 But of their travailings and groans
     Poetry is born again.






Nursery Memories
 

I.  THE FIRST FUNERAL            
  
 (The first corpse I saw was on the 
 German wires, and couldn't be buried)
  
 The whole field was so smelly;
     We smelt the poor dog first:
 His horrid swollen belly 
     Looked just like going burst.
  
 His fur was most untidy;
     He hadn't any eyes.
 It happened on Good Friday
     And there was lots of flies.
  
 And then I felt the coldest
     I'd ever felt, and sick,
 But Rose, 'cause she's the oldest,
     Dared poke him with her stick.
  
 He felt quite soft and horrid:
     The flies buzzed round his head
 And settled on his forehead:
     Rose whispered: That dog's dead.
  
 You bury all dead people,
     When they're quite really dead,
 Round churches with a steeple:
     Let's bury this,' Rose said.
  
 And let's put mint all round it
     To hide the nasty smell.'
 I went to look and found it--
     Lots, growing near the well.
  
 We poked him through the clover
     Into a hole, and then
 We threw brown earth right over
     And said: Poor dog, Amen!'






To an Ungentle Critic
 

The great sun sinks behind the town
 Through a red mist of Volnay wine . . . .
 But what's the use of setting down
 That glorious blaze behind the town?
 You'll only skip the page, you'll look
 For newer pictures in this book;
 You've read of sunsets rich as mine.
  
 A fresh wind fills the evening air
 With horrid crying of night birds . . . .
 But what reads new or curious there
 When cold winds fly across the air?
 You'll only frown; you'll turn the page,
 But find no glimpse of your New Age
 Of Poetry' in my worn-out words.
  
 Must winds that cut like blades of steel
 And sunsets swimming in Volnay,
 The holiest, cruellest pains I feel,
 Die stillborn, because old men squeal
 For something new: Write something new:
 We've read this poem  that one too,
 And twelve more like 'em yesterday'?
  
 No, no! my chicken, I shall scrawl
 Just what I fancy as I strike it,
 Fairies and Fusiliers, and all.
 Old broken knock-kneed thought will crawl
 Across my verse in the classic way.
 And, sir, be careful what you say;
 There are old-fashioned folk still like it. 






The Spoilsport
 

My familiar ghost again
     Comes to see what he can see,
 Critic, son of Conscious Brain,
     Spying on our privacy.
  
 Slam the window, bolt the door,
     Yet he'll enter in and stay;
 In to-morrow's book he'll score
     Indiscretions of to-day.
  
 Whispered love and muttered fears,
     How their echoes fly about!
 None escape his watchful ears,
     Every sigh might be a shout.
  
 No kind words nor angry cries
     Turn away this grim spoilsport;
 No fine lady's pleading eyes,
     Neither love, nor hate, nor . . . port.
  
 Critic wears no smile of fun,
     Speaks no word of blame nor praise,
 Counts our kisses one by one,
     Notes each gesture, every phrase.
  
 My familiar ghost again
     Stands or squats where suits him best;
 Critic, son of Conscious Brain,
     Listens, watches, takes no rest.






A Boy in Church
 

Gabble-gabble, . . . brethren, . . . gabble-gabble!'
     My window frames forest and heather.
 I hardly hear the tuneful babble,
     Not knowing nor much caring whether
 The text is praise or exhortation,
 Prayer or thanksgiving, or damnation.
  
 Outside it blows wetter and wetter,
     The tossing trees never stay still.
 I shift my elbows to catch better
     The full round sweep of heathered hill.
 The tortured copse bends to and fro
 In silence like a shadow-show.
  
 The parson's voice runs like a river
     Over smooth rocks, I like this church:
 The pews are staid, they never shiver,
     They never bend or sway or lurch.
 Prayer,' says the kind voice, is a chain
 That draws down Grace from Heaven again.'
  
 I add the hymns up, over and over,
     Until there's not the least mistake.
 Seven-seventy-one. (Look! there's a plover!
     It's gone!) Who's that Saint by the lake?
 The red light from his mantle passes
 Across the broad memorial brasses.
  
 It's pleasant here for dreams and thinking,
     Lolling and letting reason nod,
 With ugly serious people linking
     Sad prayers to a forgiving God . . . .
 But a dumb blast sets the trees swaying
 With furious zeal like madmen praying.






The Kiss
 

Are you shaken, are you stirred
     By a whisper of love,
 Spellbound to a word
     Does Time cease to move,
 Till her calm grey eye
     Expands to a sky
 And the clouds of her hair
     Like storms go by?
  
 Then the lips that you have kissed
     Turn to frost and fire,
 And a white-steaming mist
     Obscures desire:
 So back to their birth
     Fade water, air, earth,
 And the First Power moves 
     Over void and dearth.

Is that Love? no, but Death,
    A passion, a shout,
The deep in-breath,
    The breath roaring out,
And once that is flown,
    You must lie alone,
Without hope, without life,
    Poor flesh, sad bone.





The God Called Poetry
 

Now I begin to know at last,
 These nights when I sit down to rhyme,
 The form and measure of that vast
 God we call Poetry, he who stoops
 And leaps me through his paper hoops
 A little higher every time.
  
 Tempts me to think I'll grow a proper
 Singing cricket or grass-hopper
 Making prodigious jumps in air
 While shaken crowds about me stare
 Aghast, and I sing, growing bolder
 To fly up on my master's shoulder
 Rustling the thick stands of his hair.
  
 He is older than the seas,
 Older than the plains and hills,
 And older than the light that spills
 From the sun's hot wheel on these.
 He wakes the gale that tears your trees,
 He sings to you from window sills.
  
 At you he roars, or he will coo,
 He shouts and screams when hell is hot,
 Riding on the shell and shot.
 He smites you down, he succours you,
 And where you seek him, he is not.
  
 To-day I see he has two heads
 Like Janus--calm, benignant, this;
 That, grim and scowling: his beard spreads
 From chin to chin: this god has power
 Immeasurable at every hour:
 He first taight lovers how to kiss,
 He brings down sunshine after shower,
 Thunder and hate are his also,
 He is YES and he is NO.
  
 The black beard spoke and said to me,
 Human fraility though you be,
 Yet shout and crack your whip, be harsh!
 They'll obey you in the end:
 Hill and field, river and marsh
 Shall obey you, hop and skip
 At the terrour of your whip,
 To your gales of anger bend.'
  
 The pale beard spoke and said in turn
 True: a prize goes to the stern,
 But sing and laugh and easily run
 Through the wide airs of my plain,
 Bathe in my waters, drink my sun,
 And draw my creatures with soft song;
 They shall follow you along
 Graciously with no doubt or pain.'
  
 Then speaking from his double head
 The glorious fearful monster said
 I am YES and I am NO,
 Black as pitch and white as snow,
 Love me, hate me, reconcile
 Hate with love, perfect with vile,
 So equal justice shall be done
 And life shared between moon and sun.
 Nature for you shall curse or smile:
 A poet you shall be, my son.'






Red Stains
 

In a pyloned desert where the scorpion reigns
 My love and I plucked poppies breathing tales
 Of crimes now long asleep, whose oncered stains
 Dyed stabbing men, at sea with bloody sails.
 The golden sand drowsed. There a dog yelped loud;
 And in his cry rattled a hollow note
 Of deep uncanny knowledge of that crowd
 That loved and bled in winy times remote.
 The poppies fainted when the moon came wide;
 The cur lay still. Our passionate review
 Of red wise folly dreamed on . . . She by my side
 Stared at the Moon; and then I knew he knew.
        And then he smiled at her; to him 'twas funny--
        Her calm steel eyes, her earthold throat of honey!






Edges
 

I've often wondered why she laughed
 On thinking why I wondered so;
 It seemed such waste that long white hands
 Should touch my hands and let them go.
  
 And once when we were parting there,
 Unseen of anything but trees,
 I touched her fingers, thoughtfully,
 For more than simple niceties.
  
 But for some futile things unsaid
 I should say all is done for us;
 Yet I have wondered how she smiled
 Beholding what was cavernous.






Stranger
 

This is the village where the funeral
 Stilted its dusty march over deep ruts
 Up the hillside covered with queen's lace
 To the patch of weeds known finally to all.
  
 Of her virtues large tongues were loud
 As I, a stranger, trudged the streets
 Gay with huckstering: loud whispers from a few
 Sly wags who squeezed a humor from the shroud.
  
 For this was death.
 I should never see these men again
 And yet, like the swiftness of remembered evil--
 An issue for conscience, say--
 The cold heart of death was beating in my brain:
 A new figuration of an old phenomenon.
  
 This is the village where women walk the streets
 Selling eggs, breasts ungathered, hands like rawhide;
 Of their virtues the symbol can be washtubs
 But when they die it is a time of singing,
  
 And then the symbol changes with change of place.
 Let the wags wag as the pall-bearers climb the hill.
 Let a new slab look off into the sunset:
The night drops down with sullen grace.






I Leave Her Weeping
 

I leave her weeping in her barred little bed, 
 her warm hand clutching at my hand, 
 but she doesn't want a kiss, or to hug the dog goodnight-- 
 she keeps crying mommy, uhhh, mommy, 
 with her lovely crumpled face 
 like a golden piece of paper I am throwing away. 
 We have been playing for hours, 
 and now we need to stop, and she does not want 
 to. She is counting on me to lower the boom 
 that is her heavy body, and settle her down. 
 I rub her ribcage, I arrange the blankets around her hips. 
 Downstairs are lethal phonecalls I have to answer. 
 Friends 
 dying, I need to call. 
 My daughter may be weeping all my tears, 
 I only know 
 that even this young 
 and lying on her side, 
 her head uplifted like a cupped tulip, 
 sometimes she needs to cry.





Night Watch
 

Chico whines, no reason why. Just now walked, 
dinner gobbled, head and ears well scratched. 
And yet he whines, looking up at me as if confused 
at my just sitting here, typing away, while darkness 
is stalking the back yard. How can I be so blind,
he wants to know, how sad, how tragic, how I 
won't listen before it is too late. His whines are 
refugees from a brain where time and loss have 
small dominion, but where the tyranny of now 
is absolute. I get up and throw open the kitchen door, 
and he disappears down the cement steps, barking 
deeper and darker than I remember. I follow
to find him perfectly still in the empty yard-- 
the two of us in the twilight, standing guard.





The Poet Goes About Her Business
 

for Michele (1966-1972)
Michele has become another dead little girl. An easy poem.
Instant Praxitelean. Instant seventy-five year old photograph
of my grandmother when she was a young woman with shadows
I imagine were blue around her eyes. The beauty of it.
Such guarded sweetness. What a greed of bruised gardenias.
Oh Christ, whose name rips silk, I have seen raw cypresses
so dark the mind comes to them without color.
Dark on the Greek hillside. Dark, volcanic, dry and stone.
Where the oldest women of the world are standing dressed in black
up in the branches of fig trees in the gorge
knocking with as much quickness as their weakness will allow.
Weakness which my heart must not confuse with tenderness.
And on the other side of the island a woman
walks up the path with a burden of leaves on her head,
guiding the goats with sounds she makes up,
and then makes up again. The other darkness is easy:
the men in the dreams who come in together to me with knives.
There are so many traps, and many look courageous.
The body goes into such raptures of obedience.
But the huge stones on the desert resemble
nobody's mother. I remember the snake.
After its skin had been cut away, and it was dropped
it started to move across the clearing.
Making its beautiful waving motion.
It was all meat and bone. Pretty soon it was covered with dust.
It seemed to know exactly where it wanted to go.
Toward any dark trees.





Night Heron Maybe
 

I woke to more rain, and felt in the dark
 for how wet the sill was, then rolled back
 to my radio, and a midnight preacher
 in my earphone teaching about sin.
  
 I learned that punishment would come
 like lightning that surprises an innocent shore.
 Thunder would follow me all my days,
 stern reminder and sharp rebuke.
  
 The long, sleek, and pointed call
 that rose, as if in response, out of the estuary
 of night and storm, said it knew well
 what the given world gave, and wanted more.






The Salt Stronger
 

I have seen the legislators
 on their way,
 the jacketless men
 in mid-winter who will cast
 their votes like stones for this war.
  
 Men who have to cross the street
 through slush
 and over gutter, their cuffs
 now vaguely blued with a salt
 that dries in dots where it splashes,
  
 and mingles with the finely
 woven cloth
 of the chalk-stripe suits,
 the soi-disant practical men,
 you can see them now tiptoeing,
  
 now leaping, balletic, windsor-knotted,
 fragrant
 and shaved,
 they pass, they pass
 the window of the Capitol Deli
  
 wherein I am writing to my friend
 in Baghdad,
 he a "witness for peace, 
 a poet who for years has wondered
 what good poetry is or has been or does.
  
 I compose today's answer from here,
 saying,
I think of poetry
as a salt dug from a foreign mine
 that arrives like a miracle in Boston
  
 as pellets to break underfoot
 and melt
 the dangerous plated ice
 and cling to the acknowledged lawmakers,
 to stay with them in their dreams,
  
 to eat at the cloth and reach down
 to the skin
 and beyond the calf
 into the shin. I think the soul
 is equivalent to bone, and that conscience
  
 must hide in the marrow,
 float in the rich fluids
 and wander the honeycomb at the center.
 There, and not in the brain,
 or even the heart is where
  
 the words attach, where they land
 and settle,
 take root after the long
 passage through the body's by-ways.
 Just think, I write, of how some poetry rolls
  
 off the tongue, then try to see the tongue
 in the case
 that faces me, a curious,
 thick extension of cow-flesh
 fresh from a butcher's block, grainy and flush.
  
 I think that if my tongue alone could talk
 it would swear
 in any court that poetry
 tastes like the iodine in blood,
 or the  copper in spit, and makes a salt stronger than tears.






Against Epiphany
 

What god was it that would open
 earth's picture book and see the two
 of us on a road, snowfields glittering
 on every side and poplars bent like
 the fingers of an old man clutching
 what he loved about the sun?
  
 Which one was it that would peer 
 into our thatched, white-washed
 farmhouse, and see the fur, flies,
 and shit-stained walls? Which one
 laughed at the barbed wire fences, 
 the wall topped with broken glass?
  
 Which of the many who came then,
 gleaming and rimed in hard sunlight?
 Which of those who bobbed like ice
 along the winter shore? What did
 we have that any god would want?
 Quick, if you can find it, hide it.






Cicada
 

That whine is the sound
 of waste, rot, the frantic,
 grinding inability to attend
 to anything but sere thwarting
 of yourself, a dry corrosion
 which some say they know,
 but you and I--
  
 (my jaw clenched as you
 turn a page,
 you with a heart like drywall,
 I who would
 lace my arms with razors,
 then press them
 slowly to your lips,
 the metal taste
 mixing with flesh,
 and through gritted teeth
 I making the sound
 of you, you, you
 do not know, meaning
 only me, me)
  
 we know best.






Gautier DAgotys Ecorchs
 

Anatomie des parties de la gnration, Paris, 1773
What have they done to deserve this beauty?
 Did they, like Marsyas, invite some knife-
 wielding god with petty transgressions,
 the crime of a few tunes on Athena's lost flute?
  
 Or were they simply too poor for deep
 graves, locked gates, and good husbands
 to watch over the mounds of new soil
 tossed toward them and their hunted unborn?
  
 Whoever they were, they're still with us,
 posing demurely in suits of blood
 and muscle, the bruised shadows
 of what skin they do have, purpling like
  
 crushed petunias as they spread their legs
 and raise their meaty arms to show
 dissected breasts, unfinished infants, sundry
 viscera on the ground about their feet
  
 as if this were Thanksgiving and they
 cornucopias stuffed with squash and fruit.
 And who delivered their sentences?
 Surely not the muses who, at least,
  
 let them keep rococo faces. In 1773
 the womb and the brain were the last outposts
 of the body to be mapped. D'Agoty bought
 the rights to Le Blon's technique of printing
  
 mezzotints and gave these ladies homes
 in scientific texts, but anatomists believed
 D'Agoty's prints too gorgeous to be accurate.
 Perhaps that's why they open other wounds
  
 so easily in us. All so like the single rabbit
 I downed at twenty with a borrowed rifle,
 and then was obligated to see skinned,
 first scoring the length of the spine,
  
 then peeling the fur in one steaming piece,
 while the perverse uncle who clearly desired
 to touch me, instead held up a dripping pelt
 in one hand, and in the other, a flayed carcass
  
 still wrapped in its bundle of muscle like a gift.






The Dead Send Their Gardener
 

He arrives in the courtyard with two cartons
 of juice, each of which he'll tip and drain
 at one go in the heat, and a sack of food
 for the roses. He looms over his tools, 
 blond and dusty as a stalk of ripe wheat,
 surely someone's prized lover. Centuries
 bask among his hybrid teas, and he shakes
 his capable handfuls of food into their beds
 until nothing but roses nose the blues between lake
 and garden, lake and sky, the lapse of lawn
 where a party could be if those who lived here once
 returned to pour the wine. She'd be the sort
 to tuck a bud behind her ear, and he to catch
 one in his teeth. But alas, we're guests
 of the present, expectant and sultry; all
 graciousness is fled, and rain fills the spent
 blooms, tumbles their tops, weighted with ruffles
 and shocks of pink. The gardener too disappears
 with his breeches the color of mustard and cinched
 with a string, gone back into the pages of Hardy
 or Lawrence. Perhaps, he'll appear again Tuesday next,
 but he won't look any of us living in the eye.





Cherries
 

Rocked in my mother's pregnant amble,
 and born into forty-five years in the dark,
 the egg this child was also swayed in the arts
 of lovers I took before you, fed with me
  
 in the public markets of Baltimore and Denpasar
 on oysters and rambutan, woke with me each year
 to new waves of wander, fish and flower,
 liqueur of each region, and bread of each village,
  
 each cup of moonlight in the long sward
 between my window and the Wannsee.
 The egg he was heard and voices
 of everyone I desired and held itself
  
 in some deep hormonal bloom,
 taking whatever was remarkable
 in my life into its possibility.
 We learned not to hurry in Balinese rain,
  
 to listen for the rumble of wild boar
 in the Malvan woods. We climbed
 into planes bound for cities we'd never
 visit again and skin we'd summon
  
 with sobbing. And so, my husband,
 as you dream of owning this child,
 remember that he has ridden in my fire,
 bathed in my blood, and sipped
  
 at the breath I drew the first 
 time I saw what Rodin had clawed
 from stone before he turned from Claudel
 and went home for dinner and a clean shirt.
  
 Remember that this child is collage
 of everything before you, frangipani
 and escargot, five-for-a-dollar boxes
 of macaroni, and French cherries
  
 from an old woman in Auvergne
 who insisted on the gift
 because it was so marvelous
 to see a woman traveling alone.






Weaning
 

I. Deer Season
  
 The quiet of windows pours its sand in my ear.
 What, what? ask the dolls of evening
  
 though they do not wish to hear my answer.
 Five hens are alive in the brush, purring
  
 toward the slough. No one here has a rifle
 but the wind turns abruptly and returns a report.
  
 Three bright orange vests hang at the ready.
 The doe turns in her frame above the stove,
  
 and her season climbs like the moon into its place
 in the sky's clock. The green theater
  
 with it's elegant aspens goes more threadbare
 each week, so I'll soon see the others, heretofore
  
 only heard. Just to the south the casino lights
 ride the underbellies of clouds, and further
  
 down the interstate more world twirls
 in its paper and drinks, while the baby throws
  
 his feet through the bars, and the father
 takes him like a little canoe on the billowy
  
 lake of his chest. Comes a mewling, then,
 from my dark, a mooing, a whine, feathered
  
 or furred I can't divine. The girl with the flat face
 and bleached lips read her poems in crisp
  
 Ivy League whatnot, but I got sidetracked
 by the way her torso seemed stacked, pressed
  
 in layers like shale, so there was a weight to her
 that hung in the bottom of the eye like the bulk
  
 of a tear that never quite falls. It's true
 the intelligence was clear as green ice, and just
  
 as hard, stripped of its I and heat. Her baby
 burbled on in the back of the room happily not
  
 in the poems. Oh little rabbit of grief on the spot
 where the last dog was turned under, don't speak.
  
 I make a fire, then dream a fire: wind carries
 its gray rags into the woods, and the crackling
  
 in the grate enters my ducts, wakes me.
 When I look out, the grass along the fence
  
 is crawling with light, and the last wild asters
 press their blue buttons into the cold glass.
  
  
 II. The New Year
  
 Zero and a fine hard snow burns
 when it hits bare skin. A white
  
 ridge glows inside the birches
 across the slough where snow articulates
  
 the distance. Where water moves,
 where the land heaves. I haul oak chunks
  
 in a plastic sled. When I bend to stack
 the splits, my breasts pop and burn,
  
 and my child's face rises like a bird
 razoring its shadow over the snow.
  
 Wind takes the rag of some old self
 and shakes it at me. The heart is only
  
 another shape the view stretches to include.
 Birches march out of the hardwoods
  
 with their white waists radiant, so many
 clones on one taproot. A jay circles
  
 the full feeders fending off smaller birds.
 I make this vocal gesture because self
  
 is simply one edge of me. Out here
 there's only an economy of wood burned
  
 or to be burned, how much water's left
 in the tank, how hard or soft the light.
  
 Degrees and drafts. This room and everything in it
 are mine, and though I try to be selfish and grim,
  
 my child has made me enduringly plural,
 more than I, but not quite we.
  
 Black-capped chickadees flee
 from three big jays at the feeder. Shrieking
  
 and diving in the strong winter light, the jays
 are not actually blue. Their feathers refract light
  
 so they appear blue. Self-luminous,
 hardy and belligerent as pronouns.
  
  
 III. Easter
  
 The kick of the screw finding purchase in pine
 slams my wrist bone, elbow and shoulder,
 but it's in, and the panel is up. Now another
 and another until the wall is flush. I mark
  
 and cut each length with the small tooth
 of the new jigsaw my husband thought
 I should have. Two days apart from him
 and the child, I've forgotten the pump
  
 to empty my breasts, so the saw's jump
 at the end of the cut draws the burning
 up. And with it a guilt as bright as the room
 where I drive plank after plank against the studs,
  
 each a satisfaction against the body's wish
 to be elsewhere. Even into the night, I can't put
 down my drill. I stoke the fire and drive 
 more screws, loving the growl when they're
  
 in as far as they'll go. The mind arranging
 which planks and trim tomorrow, next week
 and spring. Even my sleep is a cutting and fastening
 broken by my turning on the full globes
  
 of my breasts. So toward morning I dream
 of parties given by women I used to know,
 and to which I'm not and will never be invited,
 trays of fancy sandwiches and petit fours,
  
 half moon glasses of seething champagne.






Middle Age
 

Many of my friends are alone
 and know too much to be happy
 though they still want to dive
 to the bottom of the green ocean
 and bring back a gold coin
 in their hand. A woman I know wakes
 in the late evening and talks
 to her late husband,
 the windows blank photographs.
 On the porch, my brother,
 hands in pockets,
 stares at the flowing stream.
 What's wrong? Nothing.
 The cows stand
 in their own slow afternoons.
 The horses gather
 wild rose hips in the sun
 the way I longed for someone
 long ago. What was it like?
 The door opening
 and no one on either side.






Arrow Breaking Apart
 

While lovers sleep, I dig my nails into the earth,
  
 holding up traffic. Just now a cloud has pulled up
 while I was talking to the Emptiness
  
 of the Universe and my voice plugged into the waves
  
 at the bottom of the ocean.
 My heart is taped up like a child's drawing
  
 of the moon over the broken window of the sky
  
 where the wind always comes back to fill my lungs.
 I will dance on my shadow. I will open my mouth
  
 with the air inside my mother's coffin.
  
 I will be the arrow breaking apart in the body
 of the blackbird, which appears at my window, singing.






The New Year
 

I will dive to the bottom of the hotel pool and find my mother's hairpin.
  
 With the mouth of a drowning woman on my lap,
 I will add her breath to mine. In the dark, I will lay the thin white sheet
  
 of the moonlight over the blue plums of my wife's breasts.
  
 With the new planet I discovered just when I thought I was losing my sight,
 I will love another man because I will be a woman.
  
 Everything important will never as yet have happened. Let it happen.
  
 I will throw a lit match on the secrets my body
 has kept from me and stand in the fire. The people I have sawed in half
  
 will appear in my bedroom mirror, getting dressed.






Jacksonville, Vermont
 

Because I am not married, I have the skin of an orange
  
 that has spent its life in the dark. Inside the orange I am blind.
 I cannot tell when a hand reaches in and breaks
  
 the atoms of the blood. Sometimes a blackbird will bring the wind
  
 into my hair. Or the yellow clouds falling on the cold floor
 are animals fighting each other
  
 out of their drifting misery. All the women I have known
  
 have been ruined by fog and the deer crossing the field at night.






The Party
 

And that's how it is; everyone standing up from the big silence
  
 of the table with their glasses of certainty and plates of forgiveness
 and walking into the purple kitchen; everyone leaning away from the gas stove
  
 Marie blows on at the very edge of the breaking blue-orange-lunging-
  
 forward flames to warm another pot of coffee, while the dishes pile up in the sink,
 perfect as a pyramid. Aaah, says Donna, closing her eyes,
  
 and leaning on Nick's shoulders as he drives the soft blade of the knife
  
 through the glittering dark of the leftover chocolate birthday cake.
 That's it; that's how it is; everyone standing around as if just out of the pool,
  
 drying off, standing around, that's it, standing, talking,
  
 shuffling back and forth on the deck of the present
 before the boat slowly pulls away into the future. Because it hurts
  
 to say goodbye, to pull your body out of the warm water;
  
 to step out of the pocket of safety, clinging to what you knew,
 or what you thought you knew about yourself and others.
  
 That's how it is, that's it, throwing your jacket over your shoulders
  
 like a towel and saying goodbye Victoria goodbye Sophie goodbye
 Lili goodbye sweetie take care be well hang in there see you soon.






At Sunset
 

Your death must be loved this much.
  
 You have to know the grief--now.
 Standing by the water's edge,
  
 looking down at the wave
  
 touching you. You have to lie,
 stiff, arms folded, on a heap of earth
  
 and see how far the darkness
  
 will take you. I mean it, this, now--
 before the ghost the cold leaves
  
 in your breath, rises;
  
 before the toes are put together
 inside the shoes. There it is--the goddamn
  
 orange-going-into-rose descending
  
 circle of beauty and time.
 You have nothing to be sad about.






Neighbor: Miss Peachs Body Didnt Turn Out Right
 

But whose did? She's crumpled where she's supposed to be unfolded,
 something bad written on a piece of paper. Her walking
 is a devolution that hunches and shrinks everyone
  
 as she moves up the tree-lined street. I'm on my porch waving to my neighbors
 and having one of those honeyed afternoons when I don't know who I am.
  
 I know everything else, though, and it's ringing in my head. Then there she is
 in a pool on my front steps, laughing, asking about lunch, as if the bones
 of at least four different animals weren't loose inside her, scurrying this way and that.
 Someone needs to find her a place to live, a hidey hole we can cram food in
 and get away from quickly. We could call her part bird
  
 and be done with it. But everyone is dying right under the surface these days,
 especially around the eyes. Death has crawled up into the face
 to nibble away whatever blocks its view of the stars.
 We're riddled with it. It's pulling our flesh
  
 into outrageous, unwilled positions, like the huge smile on my face
 as I lift her onto my lap and hold her together for a minute
 before I tell her she isn't welcome here.






Winter in Gold River
 

Pretty girl. The weather has knocked her down again
 and given her to the lake to wear as a skin.
  
 Why am I always being the weather?
 There were days in the winter
 when her smile was so lovely I felt
 the breathing of my own goodness,
  
 though it remained fetal and separate.
 I was a scavenger who survives
  
 with a sling and stones, but whose god
 nonetheless invents the first small bright bird.
 And it was like flight to bring food to her lips
  
 with a skeletal hand. But now she will always 
 be naked and sad. She will be what happens
  
 to lake water that is loved and is also 
 shallow enough. The thickening, the slowing,
 the black blood of it, the chest opened
 to reveal the inevitable heart attack.
  
 God, the silence of the chamber
 we watch from. What happens to water
 that isn't loved? It undergoes processes.
  
 It freezes beside traffic. 
 But the reaching out to all sides at once,
 the wet closing of what was open?
 That is a beautiful woman.
  
 So of course I stand and stare, never able
 to pinpoint the exact moment I killed her.






Miss Peach: The College Years
 

I. Pledge Sister
  
 Everyone looks at me as if I'm a rainbow
 drawn by a slow child. Because they can eat without
 a ringing in their ears. They can ask for gravy.
 They miss the point I'm always 
 aiming at their heads. The pills I suck are like me:
 pink, fizzy, and totally legal. They turn listening to noise
 into a type of eating.
  
 Everyone wants to know about my pubic hair.
 They say they're looking for signs that I'm dying,
 but what they really want is the food melting on the fork
 when they finally say none for me, thanks. They worship
 the pain they think I'm in. Meanwhile,
 I'd eat a beetle if I thought its legs 
 could make my lashes longer. I've got all these
 organs inside me and I can't resist teasing them
 to see if they'll go away.
  
 Everyone likes it when I finally die in the magazine article:
 the cries no one heard, the love I needed massaged
 into my hamburger meat. No one knows I am the flower,
 the bee, the wind, the rain, the dirt: all the vectors.
 No one knows how well I sleep, how well I lie in bed
 not sleeping. I run and sharpen 
 the bones of my face. The other girls say
 they don't care if their shadows aren't museum quality. They're happy
 just knowing they're made out of marble. They have no respect
 for the chisel I would take to the human race.
  
  
 II. Spring Break
  
 Love isn't above starting this way:
 you can drop me from a second-story window
 if you pin me against it first. It doesn't want to start this way,
 and who can blame it. There's the electric outlet and then
 there's the baby finger stuck into it. I was both.
  
 A couple nights later, on a busy street, I recognized his walk
 the way a mouse must recognize a hole it used last winter.
 Sure, I wish the universe could clear its throat.
 Sure, I'm sick of the source of great fire
 always being the sun. A few nights ago he peeled off of me
 as if he were my own skin and he didn't want the job.
  
 But afterwards he kissed me as if to apologize
 for every brutal thing he was strong enough to have just done.
 Later he walked me across town, and we ended up
 in an expensive place, in the middle
 of a loud song. He looked right at me
 the whole time, as if I were still the one thing he would choose,
 even though the damn thing couldn't stop spinning 
 and was clearly broken.
  
  
 III. The Essay
  
 It is dumb to know what one has longing for.
 I am moved by the orange stitching on a girl's corduroy book bag.
  
 I, too, wonder what I am happy about.
 There is always something natural in pieces
  
 like sand or snow. If early Western cultures
 had perceived the surface of the day as wrapping around them like a shell,
 I wouldn't be here right now.
 Not exactly me, not exactly here, not exactly now. The world spreads out
  
 from how we look at one thing. I tell myself this and then I look at things for hours.
  
 Don't think I don't know how stupid I sound. Please, do not think I don't know.
  
  
 IV. Fifth-Year Senior
  
 Everything tastes like love. That's what
 makes me nervous. That and I wish I knew what I will act like
  
 later today. I watch myself being kind sometimes
 and I think, is there nothing you won't fake?
  
 But that's unforgiving. A smile, a purse, an ax,
 these are all things you pick up and carry.
  
 Lately, I pick up the lightest things. I am floating and honored
 to drag myself back and forth like a huge feather
  
 across my sleeping boyfriend. He thanks me
 by actually changing under my touch. He is smooth
  
 and I worry that I barely feel him,
 but doing things no one should see
  
 seems the only good use of my time. He buys me
 jewelry I never wear. I love it because it piles up, which proves
  
 I'm alive. The boys my age cry more than the girls do.
 They're always losing games, and those are very symbolic.
  
 My girlfriends and I can't get off the couch anymore,
 and summer is seeping in under the doors.
  
 My friend says people are wrong about us.
 It's the ripe fruit that gets eaten. I say the truth is
  
 I don't work at things because then
 I get them.
  
  
 V. Graduation Address
  
 I like to be at the end and look back
 at the beginning and see all
 the stupidity there.
  
 I think we are young.
 The posters all say so,
 and though no one ever officially
 joined our clubs, we designed many logos.
  
 The beautiful, dumb girl you loved
 was everyone at our lecture,
 and what a strange boy we all were in the corner
 with our walking stick, talking too much
 about the board games back home.
  
 Many of you were next to me at the talk where I became
 hyper-aware of the creeping in my heart.
  
 As you know, I became obsessed
 with the on and off inside my chest.
  
 Failure seems to be one half of the deal, which is why
 I have occasionally climbed on top of some of you
 and then left the room. But there is another way
 to look at it: like you, I am a house
  
 for a wet animal that is sneaking up
 on something it is terrified by. What is that something?
 The wet animal doesn't know. 
 The wet animal doesn't even have eyes.
 There's no way that wet animal isn't brave.

A Parking Lot in West Houston
 

Angels are unthinkable
 in hot weather
  
 except in some tropical locales, where
 from time to time, the women catch one in their nets,
  
 hang it dry, and fashion it into a lantern
 that will burn forever on its own inexhaustible oils.
  
 But here--shins smocked with heat rash,
 the supersaturated air. We no longer believe
  
 in energies pure enough not to carry heat,
 nor in connections--the thought of someone
  
 somewhere warming the air we breathe
 that one degree more . . . .
  
 In a packed pub during the World Cup final,
 a bony redhead woman gripped my arm
  
 too hard. I could see how a bloke might fancy you.
 Like a child's perfect outline in fast-melting snow,
  
 her wet handprint on my skin, disappearing.
 The crowd boiling over, a steam jet: Brrra-zil!
  
 And Paris--a heroin addict
 who put her hypodermic
  
 to my throat: Je suis malade.
 J'ai besoin de medicaments.
  
 Grabbing her wrist, I saw
 her forearm's tight net sleeve of drying blood.
  
 I don't like to be touched. 
 I stand in this mammoth parking lot,
  
 car doors open, letting the air conditioner
 run for a while before getting in.
  
 The heat presses down equally
 everywhere. It wants to focus itself,
  
 to vaporize something instantaneously,
 efficiently--that shopping cart, maybe,
  
 or that half-crushed brown-glass bottle--
 but can't quite. Asphalt softens in the sun.
  
 Nothing's detachable.
 The silvery zigzag line
  
 stitching the tarmac to the sky around the edges
 is no breeze, just a trick of heat.
  
 My splayed-out compact car half-sunk
 in the tar pit of its own shadow--
  
 strong-shouldered, straining
 to lift its vestigial wings.





103 Korean Martyrs
 

Where was it that we went that night?
 That long, low building: floodlights
 rimmed in lavender, the moon ringed
 in rose. I would rather, then, have stayed
  
 outside, where spiderwebs glowed
 like jellyfish in the damp yew hedges,
 where the paths were chalky pebbles
 set with giant stepping stones.
  
 But the film was starting. In the air-
 conditioned dark, a crowd of strangers,
 strange families (not from our church)
 in rows of metal folding chairs to see
  
 a man quartered by horses: strain
 stitched across his shining back
 then, all over at once, an unraveling
 and then the spill of meat;
  
 a girl pushed through a doorway,
 naked among soldiers:
 she grew a dress to cover herself,
 a blue dress with a blinding sash.






The Prophecies of Paracelsus
 

That twig of light, that branch, that
                                                 fork, that form.
                 Beyond that, a city. A horse drowning in
         a river, and beyond that, a city. Wildfire, and beyond that,
 a city. God, a slippery thing,
                                  an eel, is twined
                 from our hands. That rainy hum is
        the wharf, is the light that etches a bridge
                                  between pronouns, the bottle
 of amber formaldehyde, the infant
                                                 orangutan, the wing
                 of a gull stitched to its scapula. Here is a river
         drowning in a horse's dark eye. Devitalized, humming, rainy,
 the feather of this gull, this small
                                                 spill of light,
                 the written thing that glues each hill
         to the earth, that follows a pull with its wobbly needle. God is
 a drowned horse fifty hands at the shoulder. To write what
                                                 convinces with
                 the impossible whisper. After that,
         a city. They call this floating thing an angel and hurry you out
                  of the tent. A bear eating its own paws, and after
                                                  this, a city. A window full
 of smoke, and after this, a city. A meter to measure
                                                                           day and time
 Adapted for that purpose by the God of our hands.






What We Know of Death by Drowning
 

1. Josef Mengele Drowns While Swimming at a Beach in Brazil, 1979
  
 His name then: Wolfgang Gerhard.
 How easy, slipping on another man's
         skin. Another country, too,
  
 its sun's heat and light
 as insistent as a pair 
 of forceps.
  
 His pants, left crumpled
 on the beach, forged papers
 and a few hard candies in the pocket.
  
 Where the water 
         was shallow, he could look
         down and see
  
 his shadow passing over
 the pale sand, a wobbly twin,
  
         matching him
 stroke for stroke for stroke.
  
  
 2. Li Po Drowns Trying to Embrace the Reflection of the Moon in the Yangtze, 762
  
 The moon is no drinker of wine, so I must
 compensate. Surely you've heard
  
 the crows and nightingales
 egging me on? The day has dispersed
 from the courtyards like a gang 
         of sparrows, and nothing
  
 is left of the world that is not 
 pecked-over, hard and dark
         as the dream of an apple seed.
  
 The young men laugh
 at an old man drinking
 alone, but here
  
 are my companions:
         my shadow, as loyal
         and thin as a starved dog,
  
 and the moon, his whole face
         wrinkling with laughter.
  
  
 3. Bob, the Circus Seal, Drowns Himself in His Tank in Galveston, 1911
  
 By then his teeth had rotted out,
         and he often turned to his owner
 with his mouth open as if about
  
 to speak, a ruined smell
 jetting from inside.
  
 He had already attempted it,
  
         three days before,
 but his owner dove in and pulled him up
 onto the slimy planks. His circus show days
  
 were long gone. Sure, some afternoons
 a kid might walk by
         and see the scabby painting
  
 on the side of the building: the hoop,
 the pedestal, the ghost
 of a man in a top hat,
  
 the striped ball now like a clot
 of pus streaked
 with blood, hovering
  
 over the sleek, dark head.
  
  
 4. Natalie Wood Drowns under Mysterious Circumstances near Santa Catalina Island, 1981
  
 Let me tell you: death
         is a long silk glove
 dropped to the floor.
  
 It doesn't remember the heft
 of the arm, the fingers
         dancing.
  
 That limb is gone, and nothing
 will hold its shape again.
  
 You twirl your pastel skirt. You watch
 two cars 
 race toward the cliff,
         and there is nothing
  
 you can do. So many lives
         you've entered
 like a room: swooned,
  
 held the prop pistol
 to your own face, sang
 for the back row.
         But was it your voice?
  
 What was that name
 you were born into?
         Natalia Nikolaevna Zakharenko?
 What happened to her?
  
         Was she the one
 taken, her family butchered, living 
 another life
 among the enemy people?
  
 Was it the morning?
 when she stopped scanning
 the horizon for rescuers
         that she turned into you?
  
  
 5. Hippasus of Metapontum Is Drowned at Sea for the Heresy of Discovering Irrational Numbers, ca. 500 BCE
  
 His fellow Pythagoreans had already built
 a shrine to his memory
         and placed it where 
  
 he passed by every day, but he did not take
         the hint. It was on the ship
 that they seized him.
  
 God was an integer, firm
 as an unripe apricot.
         But weren't there streets
         in the city that wound forever
 into the minute darkness?
  
 Weren't there dreams where he met
 himself again and again,
 without ever seeming to wake?
  
 The sea is incommensurable.
         Each lungful of air
         kept dividing itself, even as the boat
  
 became a decimal point on the far horizon.
  
  
 6. Bennie Wint, 20 Years after Faking His Drowning Death, is Discovered Alive, 2009
  
 In the first years after I disappeared, I read
 every report of drowning: children,
  
 mostly boys,
 mostly in their bathtubs,
 mostly accidents.
  
 Old men whose lungs filled with fluid
         while they sat in their armchairs.
  
 Fishermen. Swimmers. Immigrants
 crowded onto rafts. Some men, 
         their throats seize up,
         and they die without
  
 ever swallowing a drop,
 as if they never left the shore.
  
         Some nights I dreamed
 what never happened: I held my drowning
  
 in my palm like a giant pearl.
 Some days, standing behind
 the cash register of my new life,
  
 I felt my lungs flatten out like a pair
 of discarded socks. Did I ever think
  
 of the woman I left on the shore
         as I kicked out
 past the last of the breakers?
  
 I won't say.
 Here it was: I might have drowned
 trying to pretend to. I had to swim
 so far out, then mark
  
 a different beach
 and swim back
  
 a different man, without knowing
 if his strength was enough
         to carry me to shore.

Refusing Silence
 

Heartbeat trembling
 your kingdom
 of leaves
 near the ceremony
 of water, I never
 insisted on you. I admit
 I delayed. I was the Empress
 of Delay. But it can't be
 put off now. On the sacred branch
 of my only voice  I insist.
 Insist for us all,
 which is the job
 of the voice, and especially 
 of the poet. Else
 what am I for, what use
 am I if I don't
 insist?
 There are messages to send.
 Gatherings and songs.
 Because we need
 to insist. Else what are we

 are we?






Words Written Near a Candle
 

If I could begin anything
 I'd say stop asking forgiveness, especially
 theirs which was always
 the fault mentioned in your condition.
  
 Nettles could be feathers

 ankle. At the same time: floods, earthquakes,
 the various slaveries
 hunchbacked near the fence
 to catch your glance.
  
 What is it to say that among the hired boats
 we carried our bodies well, cracked
 jokes, left the gaps 
 in our lives and not
 the page? This far to learn
 the boat does not touch the water!
  
 And if this is goodbye,
 it is a light nowhere near believing 
 and I am happy
 and it is all right to make a distance
 of a nearness, to say, Boat, I have left you
 behind. Boat,
 I am with you.'





Love Poem to Be Read to an Illiterate Friend
 

I have had to write this down
 in my absence and yours. These
 things happen. Thinking
 of a voice added
 I imagine a sympathy outside us
 that protects the message
 from what can't help,
 being said.
  
 The times you've kept
 your secret, putting on
 glasses or glancing into a page
 with interest, give again
 the hurt you've forgiven, pretending
 to be one of us.
 So the hope of love
 translates as a series of hidden moments
 where we like to think
 someone was fooled 
 into it.
  
 Who was I then
 who filled these days 
 with illegible warnings: the marriages
 broken, the land
 pillaged by speculators, no word 
 for a stranger?
  
 This island
 where I thought the language was mine
 has left me lonely
 and innocent as you or that friend
 who let you copy his themes
 until the words became pictures
 of places you would never go.
  
 Forgive it then
 that so much of after
 depends on these, the words
 which must find you 
 off the page.





Disappearances in the Guarded Sector
 

                               Belfast, Winter, 1976

When we stop where you lived, the house
 has thickened, the entry
 level to the wall with bricks, as though
 it could keep you out.
  
 Again the dream has fooled you into waking
 and we have walked out
 past ourselves, through the windows
 to be remembered in the light
 of closed rooms
 as a series of impositions
 across the arms of a chair, that woman's face
 startled out of us so it lingers
 along a brick front.
  
 You are leading me back to the burned arcade
 where you said I stood with you
 in your childhood last night, your childhood
 which includes me now
 as surely as the look of that missing face
 between the rows of houses.
  
 We have gone so far into your past
 that nothing reflects us.
 No sun gleams from the glassless frame
 where a room burned,
 though the house stayed whole. There 
 is your school, your church, 
 the place you drank cider at lunch time.
 New rows of houses are going up.
 Children play quietly in a stairwell.
  
 Walking back, you tell the story
 of the sniper's bullet
 making two clean holes in the taxi, how
 the driver ducked and drove on
 like nothing happened. No pain
 passed through you; it
 did not even stop the car
 or make you live more
 carefully. Near the check point we 
 stop talking, you let the hands
 rub your clothes
 against your body. You seem to be 
 there, all there.
  
 Watching, I am more apart
 for the sign of dismissal they will give me,
 thinking a woman would not conceal
 as I have, the perfect map
 of this return where I have met 
 and lost you willingly
 in a dead and living place.
  
 Now when you find me next in the dream,
 this boundary will move with us.
 We will both come back.






Linoleum
 

            for Mark Strand

There are the few we hear of
 like Christ, who, with divine grace,
 made goodness look easy, had
 a following to draw near, gave up
 the right things and saw to it
 that sinners got listened to.
 Sharpening my failures, I remember
 the Jains, the gentle swoosh
 of their brooms on a dirt path
 trodden by children and goats, each
 thoughtful step taken in peril of
 an ant's life or a fat grub hidden
 under a stick. In the car-wash,
 thinking of yogis under a tree
 plucking hair by hair the head
 of an initiate, I feel at least
 elsewhere those able for holiness--
 its signs and rigors--are at work.
 Ignominiously, I am here, brushes
 clamped, soap and water pulsing
 against my car. (A good sign too,
 those asylums for old and diseased
 animals.) My car is clean
 and no one has had to 
 lift a finger. The dead
 bugs have been gushed away into a soup
 of grit and foam--the evidence
 not subterranean, not streaming along
 the asphalt in sunlight so dazzling
 I attend the birth-moment of 
 the word Hosannah!
  
 I care about the bugs and not
 in this life will I do enough towards
 my own worth in the memory
 of them. I appreciate the Jains,
 their atonements for my neglect,
 though I understand it makes poor farmers
 of them, and good we all
 don't aspire to such purity so
 there's somebody heartless enough to 
 plow the spuds.
  
 Early on in admiration, I put off
 knowledge, and so delayed reading about
 the Jains--not to lose
 solace. But in the County Library,
 turning a page, I meet them as
 the wealthiest moneylenders
 in Western India. Reading on, 
 I'm encouraged--the list of virtues
 exceeds vices--just four
 of those: anger, pride, illusion and
 greed. The emphasis clearly on 
 striving. I write them down
 in the corner of a map
 of Idaho: forbearance, indulgence, 
 straightforwardness, purity, 
 veracity, restraint, freedom from
 attachment to anything, poverty
 and chastity.
  
 Choosing, getting into the car to 
 get to the supermarket, hearing
 over engine noise the bright agonies
 of birds, the radio news with the child
 nailed into a broom-closet for
 twenty-four hours by parents who
 in straightforwardness sacrificed
 forbearance, I feel a longing 
 for religion, for doctrine swift 
 as a broom to keep the path 
 clear. Later, alone in the kitchen
 with the groceries, I read the list
 again. Overwhelmed by the loneliness
 of the saints, I take up my broom
 and begin where I stand,
 with linoleum.






Black Silk
 

She was cleaning--there is always
 that to do--when she found,
 at the top of the closet, his old
 silk vest. She called me
 to look at it, unrolling it carefully
 like something live
 might fall out. Then we spread it
 on the kitchen table and smoothed 
 the wrinkles down, making our hands
 heavy until its shape against Formica
 came back and the little tips
 that would have pointed to his pockets
 lay flat. The buttons were all there.
 I held my arms out and she
 looped the wide armholes over
 them. "That's one thing I never
 wanted to be, she said, "a man.
 I went into the bathroom to see
 how I looked in the sheen and
 sadness. Wind chimes
 off-key in the alcove. Then her
 crying so I stood back in the sink-light
 where the porcelain had been staring. Time
 to go to her, I thought, with that
 other mind, and stood still.






Willingly
 

When I get up he has been long at work,
 his brush limber against the house.
 Seeing him on his ladder under the eaves,
 I look back on myself asleep in the dream
 I  could not carry awake. Sleep
 inside a house that is being painted,
 whole lifetimes now only the familiar cast
 of morning light over the prayer plant.
 This "not remembering is something new
 of where you have been.
  
 What was settled or unsettled in sleep
 stays there. But your house
 under this steady arm is leaving itself
 and you see this gradual surface of
 new light covering your sleep
 has the greater power.
 You think now you felt brush strokes or
 the space between them, a motion
 bearing down on you--accumulation
 of stars, each night of them
 arranging over the roofs of entire cities.
  
 His careful strokes whiten the web,
 the swirl of woodgrain blotted
 out like a breath stopped
 at the heart. Nothing has changed
 you say, faithlessly. But something has
 cleansed you past recognition. When
 you stand near his ladder looking up
 he does not acknowledge you,
 and as from daylight in a dream you see
 your house has passed from you
 into the blessed hands of others.
  
 This is ownership, you think, arriving
 in the heady afterlife of paint smell.
 A deep opening goes on in you.
 Some paint has dropped onto your shoulder
 as though light concealed an unsuspected
 weight. You think it has fallen through
 you. You think you have agreed to this,
 what has been done with your life, willingly.






Red Poppy
 

That linkage of warnings sent a tremor through June
 as if to prepare October in the hardest apples.
 One week in late July we held hands
 through the bars of his hospital bed. Our sleep
 made a canopy over us and it seemed I heard
 its durable roaring in the companion sleep
 of what must have been our Bedouin god, and now
 when the poppy lets go I know it is to lay bare
 his thickly seeded black coach
 at the pinnacle of dying.
  
 My shaggy ponies heard the shallow snapping of silk
 but grazed on down the hillside, their prayer flags
 tearing at the void--what we
 stared into, its cool flux
 of blue and white. How just shaking at flies
 they sprinkled the air with the soft unconscious praise
 of bells braided into their manes. My life
  
 simplified to "for him and his thinned like an injection
 wearing off so the real gave way to 
 the more-than-real, each moment's carmine
 abundance, furl of reddest petals
 lifted from the stalk and no hint of the black
 hussar's hat at the center. By then his breathing stopped
 so gradually I had to brush lips to know
 an ending. Tasting then that plush of scarlet
 which is the last of warmth, kissless kiss
 he would have given. Mine to extend a lover's right past its radius,
 to give and also most needfully, my gallant hussar,
 to bend and take.






Now that I am Never Alone
 

In the bath I look up and see the brown moth
 pressed like a pair of unpredictable lips
 against the white wall. I heat up
 the water, running as much hot in as I can stand.
 These handfuls over my shoulder--how once
 he pulled my head against his thigh and dipped
 a rivulet down my neck of coldest water from the spring
 we were drinking from. Beautiful mischief
 that stills a moment so I can never look
 back. Only now, brightest now, and the water
 never hot enough to drive that shiver out.
  
 But I remember solitude--no other
 presence and each thing what it was. Not this raw
 fluttering I make of you as you have made of me
 your watch-fire, your killing light.






Ocean Park Notebook
 

I.
  
 The worker's pants on a spider-filament line,
 strung waist to waist to waist to dry.
 The neat green wedge of park, always empty;
 the length of concrete paced by convalescents.
 The lead impastos of interesting weather,
 though mostly the shadowless blue of long days.
 The sprawl of water beyond the band of beach,
 copper or tinfoil depending on
 the sun coming down, the moon rising.
 The storefront and the thumb of hydrant
 in front of it, in all kinds of light
 solidly composed and unspeculative.
 The garage's brick side facing a warehouse wall; 
 between them, the alley's cold black aisle.
 The swells of a scalloped awning;
 the sheetlike descent of streetwise birds.
 Tubercular with rust, the flue leaking steam.
 And behind the blind-eye panes, the figure
 who must have chosen to be here.
  
  
 II.
  
 At a window someone watches for daybreak,
 which begins for him with a spar of sun
 lighting a stringcourse on the opposite building,
 its tendrils and blooms freshly chiseled
 when mornings have an acidly clean brightness,
 or mildewed, chalky with soot, when the overcast
 will not pull back from the day.
 Hobbled now, but still ardent, wandering,
 he looks at the postcards showing the city
 and its lit grids, touches mangoes going soft
 in crates, and listens always for 
 the murmurings: An object, after all,
 is what makes infinity private. Spare a dollar
 for a lobotomy? Everything taken up, pocketed, 
 added to an accrual having less to do with weight
 than with lightness: the plane of a wall,
 say, with pink stucco rough as emery,
 and the little fish, green as muscat grapes,
 selling out at a dime a dozen.
  
  
 III.
  
 Fender-chrome, gravel molars, brittle sepals
 holding up the dead rose, the bottle collecting
 rain--a precise light found for each
 like the faded brown for leaves,
 ground-down crystal for frost. The formless
 moil of paint, spread into surface, depicts
 the day exact. So with the persimmons
 almost forgotten into ordinariness, the moons
 of candle-wax on the table--things clearer somehow
 for entering the orange, brown, and white
 I make use of. Rising, I am elated by the light
 on cold red leaves and on successive clouds,
 each one edge-lit, its heart incinerate.
 And the light makes use of me in ways
 only line, curve, and shadow can describe,
 drawn toward what pity or love that the day,
 emptied but unsubdued, gives in to:
 Every day he poured himself into it,
 as water might pour from a flask.






Aubade
 

Scintillas of the anatomical
 on the vines, buds opening--
 make me a figure 
 for the woken.
  
 On the vines, buds opening--
 blue, little throats.
 For the woken,
 this different tin sky.
  
 Blue, little throats
 speak to me in the right voice.
 This different tin sky,
 the playground thawing.
  
 Speak to me in the right voice,
 only clean, sweeter.
 The playground thawing
 into its primary colors.
  
 Only clean, sweeter,
 briary as honeysuckle,
 into their primary colors
 the words come: bitter, astral.
  
 Briar--as honeysuckle,
 as attic webs, constellated
 into their primary colors.
 White, or whiter.
  
 The words come: bitter, astral.
 Make me a figure,
 blue little throats, 
 scintillas of the anatomical.





Mirs Notebook
 

I.
  
 Dusk, thus:
 a shirt drops,
  
 the bellybutton rune
 showing.
  
 Clouds are soaked,
 the sea now
  
 iron, muscle-heavy.
 The pond begins
  
 reflecting on astronomy.
 The fruit wait.
  
 The furniture
 call back their atoms.
  
 The tree asks for
 its leaves.
  
  
 II.
  
 Winter brought into the room
 is the whisk of holly.
  
 The purse is a hare limp
 on the table, its eye
 gone amber.
  
 The birdcage is the work
 I am after: bold-barred,
 so no bird leaves.
  
 The celadon throat, the iceberg
 teeth, the matted grass
 of an armpit . . .
   
 A pear, or maybe a stone,
 the chilled shoulder shifts under
 cover, not persuaded
 into similitude.
  
  
 III.
  
 In the snail-tracked sky,
 the mineral grains, a dozen eyes.
  
 You tell me thread
 is for seam and hem, not the mica
 bead-stitched on the dark.
  
 You refuse to have the shards
 the broom gathered
 be the moon, seen as aftermath.
  
 But like the thimble, I have no guile.
  
 So let your window
 open to the rain coming down,
 drumming on the hidden shells.
  
  
 IV.
  
 Black cherries.
 Glass of milk on a tablecloth.
 An arm of bread.
  
 The coins.
 Green scarab beetle.
 The compact's sleeping mirror.
  
 The fig branch.
 The sundial.
 The harlequin leaves.
  
  
 V. 
  
 Votive-light evening,
 cipher ridden.
  
 The marsh air, and my finger
 in places.
  
 Among the lesser constellations,
 the fractured
  
 kite, the anemone.
 The geese thread-pulled
  
 into the hard sleep.
 The clothespin, the gold
  
 in your hair.
 The seeds spread
  
 are a flung field.
 I sleep on stone, you on moss.
  
  
 VI.
  
 The red-haired figure
 in the station, the man selling
 carnations. The scarecrow
  
 landscape, the suitcases
 getting heavier with every stop.
 Those served as props.
  
 I dreamed we each played a part.
  
 One of us was given to say:
 I wanted your distance whispered down
 small enough for this room.
  
 And one to say:
 I saw you always just a little
 out of reach, with white hair.
  
  
 VII.
  
 A fish-scale moon:
 who doesn't want

to be left used
 windsock-hollow?
  
 Now for morning:
 the lit wick
  
 of each grass-blade,
 the saplings
  
 like legs of deer,
 the four walls
  
 verifying the house,
 and the slip
  
 of last night's chive
 in your teeth.






Geburt des Monicakinds
 

I woke. A tiny knot of skin on a silver table
 Set in the birth-theater, blinking in the glare
 Of electric lights and a strange arranged
  
 Passel of faces: huge as gods in their council.
 I was the actor who forgets his lines and enters
 On stage suddenly wanting to say, I am.
  
 I was almost all eye: they weighed me down,
 Two lump-big brown-sugar bags in a face
 Which did not yet know struggle, burden;
  
 How the look of newborns unnerves. Then
 They wrapped me in pale yellow like a new sun
 Still too small to throw up into the sky.
  
  
               It was midnight when they injected me
 With a plague; tamed, faded as imperialism, pox
 Had once put its palm-leaf hand over a quarter of Earth
  
 Saying, these. Now it was contracted to a drop:
 And in the morning I knew both death and life.
 Lapped in my nimbus of old gold light, my 
  
 Huge lashes drooped over my deepened eyes, like
 Ostrich-feather shades over twin crown princes: wet heads
 Sleek and doomed as the black soul of an open poppy.






Myths of the Disappearance
 

I rise like a red balloon, untethered and vacant.
  
 The essence of my dolor has become rarefied,
 Holy; like a fragrance, bodiless, without referent.
 It is pale shadow on the sun, a wasp's-wing, accidental
 Splash of poison on the white rose's thorn--
 I twist it in my fingers and faint. Shall I tell you?
  
 There was one bad fairy at my birth, there came one curse,
 One blister, one drop of mercury in the moult of me
 And everything was ruined after.
  
                                                        Still it is
 No good; the words drift from me like ashes.
 I am so old now, I have left half my life
 In caves hollowed out in rock by the seashore:
 I prayed in each one, and could not find my way back,
 Or lied when the pass-word was asked, or turned my back,
 Making gestures of despondency at the roiling surf.
  
                   In a mirror I shot all my hateful selves, the yesterdays.






Harmless, Recalled as a Fairy Tale
 

After our rendez-vous--this the last word he said,
 Waving to me as the train pulled away from the station.
 And so it seemed: harmless. Till evening brought
 The first prick of fever, which soon trellised my veins;
 At 2 AM came that knock on the city gates, 
 Little pig, little pig, let me come in. . . .
 Ha! ever a bold and warlike people, we didn't.
  
 Days of siege. We threw corpses dead of plague
 From the tops of parapets to frighten it away:
 But what was it? That vatic voice was not like his at all,
 and by its speech one could tell it somehow knew us well.
 The mystery deepened. A strange billowing cloud
 Made my people short of breath, I heard them wheezing.
 The end seemed near. What could this ailment be?
  
 Hunting  out clues, I went over the roses and snows
 Of his departed face like a treasure map, over
 His words hanging in air like the scrolls of Alexandria.
 Had I not been consensual, a free agent,
 Gay, single as any singing lark, who
 Chooses to unlock, to whom? Well?
 One night, finally, I climbed our tallest tower, lay
  
 In the open on its roof and had a brilliant dream.
 I saw my body nestled between angels
 Like the body of the prophet Jesus, I saw it
 Leaking from a finger's tip like a slit ragdoll.
 And then I saw: this feathery, amorphous creature
 Black as mildew in the bath, soft as bread mold,
 Chewing on my bloodpuddings in the corner.
  
 And then I knew! That morning, I went out by the porter's door
 Pressing one finger to judicious lips like Oedipus.
 Your name, I said, I have it now: Despair--
 Shrieking, it vanished with brimstone and flames.
 So I etched Harmless in that ground of merds and moss
 And to this day, my people listen to strangers crying wares
 With an intelligent ear, remembering our grave old danger. 






Woman as a River Between Borders
 

I. The Chihuahua Desert
 
 I rose early to wash the desert grime, watch
 the unearthly flight of doves, the way pigeons
 were poisoned incorrectly or how an elephant
 was beaten with a stick. This is the way
  
 of beginnings, women charmed by fits of language,
 the cadence of bees around garbage cans,
 the laughter of grackles, hot sun baking Coca-Cola
 to sidewalks. Tumbleweeds and arroyos hush
  
 day-long trips through barrios.
 I am sand. My eyes grainy, tears brown,
 and what of the different tones of bees or flies,
 how a sting can kill us?
  
 I'm speaking the language of smokers, 
 lung-full and wary, breathing a refinery chore,
 my eyes black pits, Historically
  
 I was fruit, voluptuous and campy, some might say
 exotic, cheekbones native, my hips swaying.
  
  

II. The Rio Grande
 
 I grew into the silence of third person, a landscape,
 a mesa. I flew hard into the silence of gray smog,
 my chest burning, my throat dry with the songs
 of women with sagging faces, children
 strapped to their bent backs.
  
 They have become a river metaphor, a border,
 a soulless chant to believers. Maquiladora workers slain
 and buried in shallow graves. My palms refuse 
 to fold in prayer and god giggles in my red ears.
  
 Sand pecks my skin like a drum roll in the hot wind.
 The march of children, their backpacks plastic,
 the way they see color a mystery, a dance, the shapes
 of clouds, an elephant, a dove, a long-lost dog. They sing
 song their way past the factory-circus.
  
  
 III. The Potomac
  
 Years later I loved a blank-faced man in tweed
 who drank espresso and ate bagels in a deli outside
 Washington D.C. His pale face mirrored in the glass
 at a video-store where he grumbled artless
 and unfilled by the hurried ache
  
 of cicadas. His first and last job in the world
 of mundane labor. He was all red hair; 
 his voice bellowed.
  
 Was it the seventh or tenth year he dubbed
 my language, subtitled my screens? Windows
 on the metro metalled sand tunneled.
  
 I lost the desert dance of blood, half-forgot
 the closed copper mine, the way the border's earth
 is lead-filled and sullen.
  
  

IV. The Vlatva
 
 Awed by cathedrals in Paris, then Prague,
 I was the archangel of rage with my book-bag,
 a wordless hum. I began to speak with my hands, 
  
 my eyes Slavic dark, searching. I worshipped
 fat swans along the thick river taking in the green
 wondering why I had been blessed by such beauty.
  
 I sensed him in a snowdrift of words historically
 divine. And what was he or I in this world? I didn't see
 the gold specks in his eyes, the way poetry
  
 became his glory, full of fan-fare and the strife
 of strip malls. And here, envying his pristine days,
 the way the books never cover his mouth,
 our hearts pump separately to the rhythm of loss.






River Ghost
 

Little Chihuahita shadowed beside Segundo barrio.
 A dead German sheperd with a broken neck lies
 on the side of the street for days. The stench
 of El Paso's sewage in the air, a Mexican flag hugely
 flaps itself above the chain-linked fence
  
 topped with razor wire. In the morning blue mountains
 smog. South side of the border a man jogs.
 The river's bank green, small trees bob in the wind
 like truffle-treats, mirage. Each day thousands cross
 the open bridge, both ways,
  
 each night they go home to sleep silence. Cars hum
 and wait for hours like sleeping cats. A cemented river
 half-dried, even the canal drains away. Some say droves
 of shadows at night move ghost-like through the dying river.
 These people grow invisible, as if air, irrelevant and holy;
  
 at night I can hear the whisper of my grandfather,
 "all the angels live in Jurez.
 There is an old language broken in my throat.
 Some eyes mistake me for shadow. When I speak my voice
 a fearful phantom. In spring dust storms come, the sky
  
 browns, my visage half-forms beneath the Italian cypress;
 and when the day's moon is full in its silence,
 I am afraid of my own darkness.






Mercury in Retrograde
 

The day ended badly with a broken ankle,
 a jinxed printer, and a dead car. The dry yellow grass
 against the sunset saved me. Roosters
  
 pranced across a lawn of shit, proudly plumed
 in black feathers, bobbing before the gray goats.
 It was the first day I saw god in the quiet,
  
 and found a mustard seed was very small.
 There I had been for years cursing "why?
 and all the gold in the sun fell upon me.
  
 There was a white mare in the midst
 of brown smog, majestic in the refinery
 clouds. Even the radio wouldn't work!
  
 My mother limps and her hair falls out.
 The faithful drive white Chevy trucks
 or yellow Camrys, and I'm here golden
  
 on the smoking shock-less bus.
 I lost language in this want, each poem
 dust, Spanish fluttered
  
 as music across the desert, even weeds
 tumbled unloved. The police sirens seared
 the coming night, dogs howled helplessly
 sad.
  
 Lo I walk the valley of death, love
 lingers in my hard eyes. Maana never 
 comes just right. I mend myself in the folds
  
 of paper songs, ring my paper bells
 for empty success. Quiero Nada,
 if I sing long enough, I'll grow dreamlike
 and find a flock of pigeons, white under
 wings lifting awkward bodies like doves
 across the silky blue-white sky.






Yom Kippur 1984
 

                    I drew solitude over me, on the long shore.                                         --Robinson Jeffers, "Prelude             For whoever does not afflict his soul through this day, shall be           cut off from his people.                                                                            --Leviticus 23:29

What is a Jew in solitude?
 What would it mean not to feel lonely or afraid
 far from your own or those you have called your own?
 What is a woman in solitude:   a queer woman or man?
 In the empty street, on the empty beach, in the desert
 what in this world as it is can solitude mean?
  
 The glassy, concrete octagon suspended from the cliffs
 with its electric gate, its perfected privacy
 is not what I mean
 the pick-up with a gun parked at a turn-out in Utah or the Golan Heights
 is not what I mean
 the poet's tower facing the western ocean, acres of forest planted to the east, the woman reading in the cabin, her attack dog suddenly risen
 is not what I mean
  
 Three thousand miles from what I once called home
 I open a book searching for some lines I remember
 about flowers, something to bind me to this coast as lilacs in the dooryard once
 bound me back there--yes, lupines on a burnt mountainside,
 something that bloomed and faded and was written down
 in the poet's book, forever:
 Opening the poet's book
 I find the hatred in the poet's heart: . . . the hateful-eyed
 and human-bodied are all about me: you that love multitude may have them
  
 Robinson Jeffers, multitude
 is the blur flung by distinct forms against these landward valleys
 and the farms that run down to the sea; the lupines
 are multitude, and the torched poppies, the grey Pacific unrolling its scrolls of surf,
 and the separate persons, stooped
 over sewing machines in denim dust, bent under the shattering skies of harvest
 who sleep by shifts in never-empty beds have their various dreams
 Hands that pick, pack, steam, stitch, strip, stuff, shell, scrape, scour, belong to a brain like no other
 Must I argue the love of multitude in the blur or defend
 a solitude of barbed-wire and searchlights, the survivalist's final solution, have I a choice?
  
 To wonder far from your own or those you have called your own
 to hear strangeness calling you from far away
 and walk in that direction, long and far, not calculating risk
 to go to meet the Stranger without fear or weapon, protection nowhere on your mind
 (the Jew on the icy, rutted road on Christmas Eve prays for another Jew
 the woman in the ungainly twisting shadows of the street:   Make those be a woman's footsteps; as if she could believe in a woman's god)
  
 Find someone like yourself.   Find others.
 Agree you will never desert each other.
 Understand that any rift among you
 means power to those who want to do you in.
 Close to the center, safety; toward the edges, danger.
 But I have a nightmare to tell:   I am trying to say
 that to be with my people is my dearest wish
 but that I also love strangers
 that I crave separateness
 I hear myself stuttering these words
 to my worst friends and my best enemies
 who watch for my mistakes in grammar
 my mistakes in love.
 This is the day of atonement; but do my people forgive me?
 If a cloud knew loneliness and fear, I would be that cloud.
  
 To love the Stranger, to love solitude--am I writing merely about privilege
 about drifting from the center, drawn to edges,
 a privilege we can't afford in the world that is,
 who are hated as being of our kind: faggot kicked into the icy river, woman dragged from her stalled car
 into the mist-struck mountains, used and hacked to death
 young scholar shot at the university gates on a summer evening walk, his prizes and studies nothing, nothing availing his Blackness
 Jew deluded that she's escaped the tribe, the laws of her exclusion, the men too holy to touch her hand;   Jew who has turned her back
 on midrash and mitzvah (yet wears the chai on a thong between her breasts) hiking alone
 found with a swastika carved in her back at the foot of the cliffs (did she die as queer or as Jew?)
  
 Solitude, O taboo, endangered species
 on the mist-struck spur of the mountain, I want a gun to defend you
 In the desert, on the deserted street, I want what I can't have:
 your elder sister, Justice, her great peasant's hand outspread
 her eye, half-hooded, sharp and true  
  
 And I ask myself, have I thrown courage away?
 have I traded off something I don't name?
 To what extreme will I go to meet the extremist?
 What will I do to defend my want or anyone's want to search for her spirit-vision
 far from the protection of those she has called her own?
 Will I find O solitude
 your plumes, your breasts, your hair
 against my face, as in childhood, your voice like the mockingbird's
 singing Yes, you are loved, why else this song?
 in the old places, anywhere?
  
 What is a Jew in solitude?
 What is a woman in solitude, a queer woman or man?
 When the winter flood-tides wrench the tower from the rock, crumble the prophet's headland, and the farms slide into the sea
 when leviathan is endangered and Jonah becomes revenger
 when center and edges are crushed together, the extremities crushed together on which the world was founded
 when our souls crash together, Arab and Jew, howling our loneliness within the tribes
 when the refugee child and the exile's child re-open the blasted and forbidden city
 when we who refuse to be women and men as women and men are chartered, tell our stories of solitude spent in multitude
 in that world as it may be, newborn and haunted, what will solitude mean?

 in Alcatraz and added the bank figures again,

 to find the walls of the room where he lay
 were covered in hundreds of clinging starfish.






For the Other World
 

For those who ran in the streets,
 there were no faces to welcome them back.
 Jos escaped and loved the war.
  
 For those who swam with bitterness
 of a scorched love,
 there was a rusted car to work on.
  
 For those who merely passed
 and reclined in prayer,
 there was the tower and the cross.
  
 For those who dedicated tongues
 to the living and dying,
 there were turquoise painted doorways.
  
 For those who left their children
 tied to the water heater,
 there was a shout and a name.
  
 For those whose world
 was real and beautiful,
 there was a cigarette and a saint.
  
 For those who asked Jos
 to stay and feed his children,
 there were flowers at their funerals.
  
 For those who carried a shovel
 tattooed on their backs,
 there was a wet towel and a bottle.

 of superstition and lie,
 there was the house to come home to.
  
 For those who came home late
 and put their swollen feet up,
 there was love and the smell of dirty socks.
  
 For those who feared the devil
 and spit on his painted arms,
 there was a lesson in rosaries.
  
 For those who had to leave
 before the sun went down,
 there was asphalt and a bus.
  
 For those who stared at wet plaster
 and claimed the face of Christ appeared,
 there was confinement and stale bread.
  
 For those who talked with each other
 and said it was time to go,
 there was lead in the paint and on the tongue.
  
 For those who left children behind,
 there was a strange world
 of sulphur and sparrow nests.
  
 For those who accused their ancestors
 of eating salt, there were these hands
 tracing what was left after the sweat.






Kick the Heart
 

Kick in the heart.
 Kick the starting lance.
 Throw the ground a word and stand back.
 The color of terror is the envy
 on body rags, the dragonfly war
 scraped off a painting inside the door.
  
 Kick the shame.
 Kick the falling dawn as fortunate.
 Throw the corrupted guest out the door.
 A sequence of rhythms bound for
 the light on your bed.
 On the eggplant cooked for the husband
 working late: an ant, a hair--
 the only thing said to race the mind.
 Take someone else's voice and touch their ears.
 Make sure they hear you cry
 in their own whispers, their harangue.
  
 Kick the soil.
 Kick the sweet drowning as if you know
 the round jubilance of pear is afraid
 of a darkening spoon, a honey of flavor,
 the tender one who never touches your plate.
 The tired one who rations food
 to thank God eternity is here and there.
  
 Slip the eye the blue-black stranger,
 his instrument of scars and neglect,
 its tune of every wish besides
 the grave of a careless, quiet man.
 Shape his sound into the thumb asking
 for a ride in the years of not going anywhere.
  
 Kick the alphabet.
 Kick the hungry thigh and try again.
 Reduce yourself to a moving mouth, a solemn happiness
 that smells of the past, takes hold of the throat
 and teaches you to despise omens--
 ignore Apache mirrors on rock arches
 as if you knew what their scratchings meant.
  
 Kick the heart.
 Kick the starting lance.
 It moves deeper into the month of blinking neon
 where vertigo is perfume, desire foaming
 on your bare feet killed by frost,
 taken by the animal waking inside your holy cross--
 a figure of green gowns and things
 that follows you until you dance.
  
 Kick the truth.
 Kick the belly until it confesses.
 Admit you were fed by a woman
 flapping in the wind, told to sit there by a father
 who made her give birth to a shimmering head,
 your brain of flowers blossoming upon
 the body always first to confess.
  
 What snow is left is tired water unmoved by your
 seasonal words, your circle healing by slowing down,
 swelling to the size of God,
 yellow leaves in the blood nothing dangerous--
 this impulse, this kick to the brittle lake
 where the snow goes away.






Calling the White Donkey
 

I called the white donkey that hurt my left shoulder
 the last time it appeared, ramming me
 with its ivory head, cracking my back
 to relieve me of worry and hope.
 I called the white donkey,
 surprised at the sound of my voice.
 Scared, I wondered if the white head
 would give me its donkey brain,
 snowy matter dripping into my ears
 like the horse of the first man who fell off,
 the donkey teaching me about desire
 and the moan, that white hair on the back
 of my head that warns me.
  
 I called the donkey.
 I came slowly toward me,
 huge ears shaking with fury,
 its breath turning the air white
 as it bit into the white apple
 of my throat.
 I faced the donkey, watched 
 its gait become a shuffle of possession,
 shaking its head as it stopped to
 root its dirty hoofs in the ground.
  
 I stepped back and clicked my fingers,
 but it would not come closer, its snort
 commanding I listen as it farted.
 I walked away and did not know it was
 I who yearned for labor of the ass
 because the animal I summoned
 couldn't remove the white scar from
 my heart, a blind life I lived for good.






Who
 

Revives a relic
Liquefies dry blood
Touches a corpse
To the quick
Converts a monster to love--
Who made man from mud







Dream of Ink Brush Calligraphy
 

In prayer:
quiet opening,
my artery is a thin    
shadow on paper--
margin of long grass, 
ruderal hair, sister to this 
not yet part of our bodies
your lyric corpus of seed
in rough drafts of pine ash,
chaogao or grass calligraphy  
in rough drafts of pine ash--
your lyric corpus of seed 
not yet part of our bodies: 
ruderal hair, sister to this  
margin of long grass, 
shadow on paper, 
my artery is a thin 
quiet opening
in prayer.







Prayer for a Bamboo-Flowering Famine
 

Every half century, the synchronous flowering of bamboo causes famine in parts of India.
May we blossom every fifty years
without afflicting the people.

May our seedpods nourish rodents
who roam our groves

without rebuking lands with famine.
May sweet potatoes and rice save us.

May ginger and turmeric flourish
to the bitter distaste of rats

while tresses of bamboo flowers 
changeling white wasps

load the groves with seed
in rare perennial synchrony.  

May our sisters flower en masse
hundreds of square miles apart   

in the pale night. May our shoots  
pray a silent vision of healing,  

our rhizome-laden memories:
Yes, we share our hunger

only once on this earth, my love.
Let us bless our fruit and multiply.






Fire Safety
 

Aluminum tank 
indifferent in its place 

behind a glass door 
in the passageway,

like a tea urn 
in a museum case;

screaming-machines 
that dumbly spend each day 

waiting for gas or smoke 
or hands or heat, 

positioned like beige land mines 
overhead, 

sanguine on walls,
or posted on the street 

like dwarf grandfather clocks 
spray painted red;

little gray hydrant 
in its warlike stance;

old fire escape,
all-weather paint job peeling,

a shelf for threadbare rugs 
and yellowing plants;

sprinkler heads, 
blooming from the public ceiling;

all sitting 
supernaturally still,

waiting for us to cry out.
And we will.






Harbor Porpoise
 

Off what Thornbjrg calls the stern,
or what I refer to as where 
you look upon the place you 
cannot return, one broke on through.

With little purpose but to tease,
eye our sound ship, or take leave
of the dog whistle our prop
pitches ineptly into the eerie.

Suturing the path to where
it was bound, it hung split seconds 
in a realm unsoundable by its sonar. 
If only we could enter our dreams thus.

The cruise ship's marriage counselor 
spoke to me in Norwegian, and I 
agreed, knowing there was only 
so much she could have said

as it took the sun--and unlike 
beach stones once you get them 
home, kept its sodden hue
going black into sea.







The Worlds Other Side
 

In Japan, when you die, they wheel
what's left of you out of the incinerator,
and what's left of your family takes turns
picking with special chopsticks.
It looks like they have gathered to dine
over a dead campfire, but they are not,
of course, eating you. They are feeding you
to the round mouth of an urn:
only in pieces, Father, to the fire.
In their bright swimsuits,
my daughters spill warm sand over my skin
as I lie still, watching the sun
needle the sky. The baby licks her fingers
to tell, perhaps, if I am ready, her bald head
white with lotion, her mouth full
of vowels. The older one says nothing
above the ocean's slow rush,
but scoops and pats to get me done
and gone. I've never been to Japan,
but once, a globe of glass
found me at the clear end of a wave.
It drifted from the other side, my mother said.
Cold and slick, it glistened as I held it up
with both hands and looked through
to the green flames of the sun
before tasting the salt with my tongue.





Sickbed
 

There were two voices in the fever dream:
Hers speaking from another room, and theirs,
The teeny-boppers, singing from the screen. 

Hers spoke a litany of grievous thanks, 
And thankful worries, who did what to whom, 
And why, and thank God it wasn't worse, poor bastard,

Poor thing, while theirs kept singing who wears short
Shorts, we wear short shorts, over and over 
Till I was singing too. Someone, thank God, at last, 

Was out of it, and some one else, thank God,
Had only lost a breast, and Shirley what 
A good kid, what a beauty, what a doll,

She let herself go when the bum walked out.
Thank God they never had a child. Thank God 
They smelled the smoke; they found the keys, the dog; 

Thank God they all wore short shorts as they sang
To me on little stages on the stage
Where boys and girls were dancing all around them,

Singing and dancing where it wasn't worse,
Thank God, and, thank God, no one paused to wonder
Who to thank for just how bad it was.






Flowerpot
 

I lay back on the carpeted bottom step
Of the stairwell that like a well extended 
Darkly up to the window near the ceiling, 

Up where the Chinaman under the wide-brimmed hat 
That hid his face pulled the flowerpot that held 
No flower across the sill no one could reach.

There was a television on somewhere 
Above me, and the doomsday clock was ticking,
Someone was saying. Someone was saying something

About a blockade and a quarantine, 
Who would blink first, lose face, or push the button.
A fat man banged a shoe against a desk.

The Chinaman however didn't care.
Pulling his flowerpot of absent flowers, 
He was content to be a clot of darkness  

Brightening the moment late sun caught the glass--
The hat tip first, and then the hat, the arms,
The rickshaw of the flowerpot he pulled. 

And everywhere within the light's slow fall
Infinities of particles were falling
Into the flowerpot they'd never fill. 







Closings
 

                               1

"Always Be Closing, Liam told us--
abc of real estate, used cars,
and poetry. Liam the dandy
loved Brooks Brothers shirts, double-breasted
suits, bespoke shoes, and linen jackets.
On the day Liam and Tree married
in our backyard, Liam and I wore
Chuck's burgundy boho-prep high-tops
that Liam bought on Fifth Avenue.


                               2

When the rain started, we moved indoors
and Liam read a Quartet aloud.
T.S. Eliot turned old and frail
at sixty, pale, preparing for death.
Then poets of new generations
died--Frank O'Hara first, then Jim Wright
with throat cancer in a Bronx hospice,
Sylvia Plath beside the oven,
Thom Gunn of an overdose, Denise


                               3 

Levertov, Bob Creeley, Jane Kenyon...
In a New York bar, Liam told me
eccentric, affectionate stories
about a road trip in Tree's country
of Montana, and the joy they felt
in the abundance of their marriage.
At Bennington Tree said, "Fourteen years
after the wedding in your backyard,
I love Liam with my entire heart.


                               4

Liam's face changed quickly as he spoke,
eyes and mouth erupting with gusto
as he improvised his outrageous,
cheerful, inventive obscenities.
When I first met him--I expounded
at a young poet's do--his bearded
face was handsome and expressionless.
He would not defer to a poet
fifty years old! After a few months


                               5

he was revising my lines for me,
making the metaphors I couldn't.
Even now, working at poems, I
imagine for a moment Liam
disassembling them. A year ago
he watched the progress of age turn me
skeletal, pale flesh hanging loosely
in folds from my arms, and thin rib-bones
like grates above a sagging belly.


                               6 

His body would never resemble
my body. Four or five times a week
we wrote letters back and forth, talking
about class structure, about how Tree
took charge over the Academy
of American Poets, about
poems and new attacks on free speech...
When I won a notorious prize,
Liam sent me eighty-one notions


                               7

about projects I might undertake.
Number fifty-six instructed me:
"Urge poets to commit suicide.
His whole life he spoke of suicide
lightly, when he wasn't preserving
the First Amendment from Jesse Helms,
or enduring two colon cancers,
or watching films, or chatting with Tree,
or undergoing heart surgeries.


                               8

If he walked their dog Keeper one block,
he had to take nitroglycerin.
When Jane was dying, Liam and Tree
drove up to say goodbye. I wheelchaired
Jane to a pile of books by her chair
to find the color plate of Caillebotte's
shadowy kitchen garden at Yerres
for the jacket of Otherwise, when
Tree would design it. I think of Jane's 


                               9

horror if she were alive to know
that on August fifteenth Liam pulled
the shotgun's trigger. The night before,
wearing a tux over a yellow
silk shirt, he danced with Tree once again,
before bed and the morning's murder.
He left Tree alone and desolate
but without anger. Tree knew Liam
did what he planned and needed to do.





Memorizing "The Sun Rising by John Donne
 

Every reader loves the way he tells off 
the sun, shouting busy old fool 
into the English skies even though they 
were likely cloudy on that seventeenth-century morning.

And it's a pleasure to spend this sunny day
pacing the carpet and repeating the words, 
feeling the syllables lock into rows
until I can stand and declare, 
the book held closed by my side,
that hours, days, and months are but the rags of time.

But after a few steps into stanza number two,
wherein the sun is blinded by his mistress's eyes, 
I can feel the first one begin to fade 
like sky-written letters on a windy day.

And by the time I have taken in the third, 
the second is likewise gone, a blown-out candle now,
a wavering line of acrid smoke.

So it's not until I leave the house
and walk three times around this hidden lake
that the poem begins to show
any interest in walking by my side.

Then, after my circling,
better than the courteous dominion 
of her being all states and him all princes, 

better than love's power to shrink
the wide world to the size of a bedchamber, 

and better even than the compression
of all that into the rooms of these three stanzas
is how, after hours stepping up and down the poem,
testing the plank of every line,
it goes with me now, contracted into a little spot within.






When She Wouldnt
 

When her recorded voice on the phone 
said who she was again and again to the piles 
of newspapers and magazines and the clothes 

in the chairs and the bags of unopened mail 
and garbage and piles of unwashed dishes.

When she could no longer walk 
through the stench of it, in her don't-need-nobody-
to-help-me way of walking, with her head 

bent down to her knees as if she were searching 
for a dime that had rolled into a crack 

on the floor, though it was impossible to see 
the floor. When the pain in her foot she disclosed
to no one was so bad she could not stand 

at her refrigerator packed with food and sniff 
to find what was edible. When she could hardly 

even sit as she loved to sit, all night 
on the toilet, with the old rinsed diapers 
hanging nearby on the curtainless bar 

of the shower stall, and the shoes lined up
in the tub, falling asleep and waking up 

while she cut out newspaper clippings 
and listened to the late-night talk 
on her crackling radio about alien landings 

and why the government had denied them. 
When she drew the soapy rag across the agonizing 

ache of her foot trying over and over to wash
the black from her big toe and could not
because it was gangrene.  

When at last they came to carry my mother 
out of the wilderness of that house

and she lay thin and frail and disoriented
between bouts of tests and X-rays, 
and I came to find her in the white bed 

of her white room among nurses who brushed 
her hair while she looked up at them and smiled

with her yellow upper plate that seemed to hold
her face together, dazed and disbelieving, 
as if she were in heaven, 

then turned, still smiling, to the door 
where her stout, bestroked younger brother 

teetered into the room on his cane, all the way 
from Missouri with her elderly sister 
and her bald-headed baby brother, 

whom she despised. When he smiled back
and dipped his bald head down to kiss her, 

and her sister and her other brother hugged her
with serious expressions, and her childish 
astonishment slowly changed 

to suspicion and the old wildness returned
to her eye because she began to see
 
this was not what she wanted at all, 
I sitting down by her good ear holding her hand 
to talk to her about going into the home

that was not her home, her baby brother winking,
the others nodding and saying, Listen to Wesley. 

When it became clear to her that we were not 
her people, the ones she had left behind 
in her house, on the radio, in the newspaper 

clippings, in the bags of unopened mail, 
in her mind, and she turned her face away 

so I could see the print of red on her cheek 
as if she had been slapped hard. 
When the three of them began to implore 

their older sister saying, Ruth, Ruth, 
and We come out here for your own good, 

and That time rolls around for all of us, 
getting frustrated and mad because they meant, 
but did not know they meant, themselves too.

When the gray sister, the angriest of them, 
finally said through her pleated lips 

and lower plate, You was always 
the stubborn one, we ain't here to poison you, 
turn around and say something. 

When she wouldn't.





Barber
 

Learn from the man who spends much of his life speaking
             To the back of your head knowing what it means to follow

The razor's edge along a worn strop or random thoughts
             As they spring so invisibly from the mind to a mouth

Who shouldered soldiers in two wars and fled fire fields
             Undecorated who fathered once but was fatherless forever

And who works his sentiments in deeper into your scalp
             Under a sign on the knotty-pine walls whose rubric reads

quot homines, tot sententiae which means he sees
             In you his suffering smells of horehound tonics and gels

Pillow heads and powders and a floor full of snippings
             Swept neatly every evening into a pile for the field mice

All those roundabout hours only a man who fixes his tie
             To clip crabgrass crowding a lady's grave could believe

With a certain clean devotion and who would never for one
             Moment dream of hurting you when your back was turned






Crane
 

Paper creased is
with a touch 
made less by half,
reduced as much

again by a second 
fold--so the wish
to press our designs
can diminish

what we hold.
But by your hand's
careful work,
I understand

how this unleaving
makes of what's before
something finer 
and finally more.   





Lazy
 

I don't say things I don't want to say
or chew the fat with fat cats just because. 

With favor-givers who want favors back,
I tend to pass on going for the ask.

I send, instead, a series of regrets,
slip the winding snares that people lay.

The unruffledness I feel as a result,
the lank repose, the psychic field of rye

swayed in wavy air, is my respite 
among the shivaree of clanging egos

on the packed commuter train again tonight.
Sapping and demeaning--it takes a lot

to get from bed to work and back to bed. 
I barely go an hour before I'm caught

wincing at the way that woman laughs
or he keeps clucking at his magazine. 

And my annoyance fills me with annoyance.
It's laziness that lets them seem unreal

--a radio with in-and-out reception 
blaring like hell when it finally hits a station.

The song that's on is not the one I'd hoped for, 
so I wait distractedly for what comes next.







Litany
 

O you gods, you long-limbed animals, you
astride the sea and you unhammocked 
in the cyprus grove and you with your hair
full of horses, please. My thoughts have turned 
from the savor of plums to the merits 
of pity--touch and interrupt me, 
chasten me with waking, humble me
for wonder again. Seed god and husk god,
god of the open palm, you know me, you
know my mettle. See, my wrists are small.
O you, with glass-colored wind at your call
and you, whose voice is soft as a turned page,
whose voice unrolls paper, whose voice returns
air to its forms, send me a word for faith
that also means his thrum, his coax and surge
and her soft hollow, please--friend gods, lend me
a word that means what I would ask him for
so when he says: You give it all away,
I can say: I am not sorry. I sing.







Backyard Georgics
 

It takes a calendar one damp day to declare fall,
weeks of dying mums to second the motion.

                               *     *     *

 Gone the homeland, gone the father, nothing left
but invisible north to magnetize your doubts.

                               *     *     *

 Not eulogies or hearses but the sandwiches after,
estranged cousins chewing under one umbrella.

                               *     *     *

 One clock for errands, one for midnight
trysts, though neither will hurry a slow train.

                               *     *     *

 Prairie is not the floor nor sky the coffered ceiling.
Even a scarecrow is wise beyond its straw.

                               *     *     *

Look down: a river of grass. Look up: a velvet lost
and found. Look inside: no straws to drink that dusk.

                               *     *     *

A woman's watch thieved by a jay--ah, to be lifted
like that, to be carried like time across lapping waves.






Peel
 

I read that in this famous person's poems "she searches 
for signs of what lies beneath and beyond the self. 
Which seemed to me pointless, as if you wouldn't know 

whether to paint with egg tempera or eat it. At eighteen, 
I came across Tolstoy's "What is Art? where he said 
an artist is different from other people because instead 

of eating an apple he paints it. Even then I thought why 
can't he paint it and then eat it, the way at eight, the war 
just over, I stood shoeless in line in the snowy playground 

where one of the kids was handing out something that turned out 
to be small pieces of orange peel, something exotic we'd never 
seen before which I smelled, nibbled, and finally ate for this poem.





We dollhouse monsters
 

   dine on disco balls and starfish,
                      our jowls crashing
            like cymbals,
   while my baby brother takes out his eight-ball
left eye and squints his right
             to line up his shot
   on the world's smallest pool table.
Mother has a camera for a head;
             it flashes uncontrollably
                      though she claims to have run
out of film a hundred years ago,
               when father's penis,
an unstoppable spigot,
    became a garden sprinkler,
contained by adult diapers, changed hourly,
                      and hourly, my sister--
             shuffling out of her hiding place
in the cuckoo clock, her hair a mess
             of paper clips, a Raggedy Ann
                      doll
     in her arms--sighs
             to pass the time.
Water seeps through the ceiling,
                      because upstairs
    the bathtub overflows, for
             Grandma has forgotten
                      the bath she's drawn,
and on the stove the gas is high, the flames
             are heating up a pudding
     over which my opa whispers:
boil, boil, loyal rubble,
              follow me to the end of my life.






The Late Show
 

I really think its getting to be that time,
she says, cleaning up the dust and grime

that lingers beneath the kitchen table,
while cigarette smoke, shapeless and unstable,

pipes from her mouth like steam from snow,
so in her nightgown at night she seems half doe,

half woman, deep-eyed, mood subjunctive,
saying but, and if, and what I wouldn't give,

while the road nearby, through the window,
flickers with the credits of the late late show,

and in a clamshell bowl the clementines
lacquer the air with the citrus of rinds,

knuckled open as you gazed wide-eyed
at bills with the words balance due inside.





We had decided with Cocteau
 

the difference between a cigarette holder
    and cigarette case,
the pleasure of a lorgnette over spectacles,
    of a fortnight over
two weeks, of a spiral over graduated stairs,
    of the frisson of crying
like pouty boys, and of the way to walk a lobster
    on a leash: drag it,
its exoskeleton rapping on the cobbles
    through the rabble
of Montparnasse, as if lugging luggage.
    We did what could not
gain us a week of rent or even a plate of fish,
    yet we managed to eat
sickening amounts, to hate on our patroness,
    the Princess de Polignac,
though, and I am sorry, she had bought us wine.
    Once, in the chamber
before an evening concert, I hid a sack of bees
    in the white baby grand,
and when ball-gowned Polignac raised the leaf
    they swarmed through the strings
to the chandelier and the Princess saw a living sun
    and felt a little less dreary
and a little less proud of being bored.





Delivery Rhyme
 

For Alyssa
As anyone
is apt to, you began as someone

else's symptom. As in
other beginnings: drawn lots, blood,
some dancing on the heads of pins

and inside needles' eyes,
cellular revelry,

hopping
of microscopic

turnstiles. Lucky guest,
grist, leapt

long odds to spark
the tinder in the dark.

Then, the subcommittees met:
made merry in duplicate, triplicate

and so on, much of themselves, divided
and divined and concurred.
All sides insides, pre-ambulatory
perambulation meant: sure

ambit, short orbit
in a warm aquarium set

to the muffled music of a single sphere.
As in other beginnings: parting seas, the future's
violent egress, screams and sutures,

aftermath's average agony
on umbilical belay

but soon to solo, unfold all
those origami limbs to test
the inevitable debutante bawl.

Wrest from the nest
and the rest is you, dear:
dressed for the bright lights
in bits of my sister.






Love Poem
 

If by truth you mean hand then yes
I hold to be self-evident and hold you in the highest--
ko to my ot and bait to my switch, I crown
you one-trick pony to my one-horse town,
dub you my one-stop shopping, my space heater,
juke joint, tourist trap, my peep show, my meter reader,
you best batteries-not-included baring all or
nothing. Let me begin by saying if he hollers, 
end with goes the weasel. In between,
cream filling. Get over it, meaning, the moon.
Tell me you'll dismember this night forever,
you my punch-drunking bag, tar to my feather.
More than the sum of our private parts, we are some
peekaboo, some peak and valley, some
bright equation (if and then but, if er then uh).
My fruit bat, my gewgaw. You had me at no duh.





The Kisser
 

As in, in the, of course. The body knew
the drill by now. Was are we there yet and then
never been so, then so long. Heart tied
with twine, with shorthairs, trip wires--whispered that bind.
Drew the short straw, scared herself apart
to spit-sweet shards and into time that counted
backwards from two lips ago. Said done
is done and is between me and those teeth.
Some little story about dignity.
We're there yet. Said trussed me. Body the white flag,
body the pulley. Hoist up and sang to beat
the heart back down again--stick-stone, stick-stone.

Brazilian Telephone
 

In the peach orchard in an old bathtub
the children are standing someone
in a bath of salt water, and one
gently attaches electrodes
to the nipples of the one
in the bath. Out of the weeds runs one
with a rescued battery from the old
motor home, which they had gotten
to rev its engine like the sad bleating
of a goat. If, later, anyone asks
how they learned to do this, in a striped shirt one
will say, Oh, I was looking for science
experiments in those old textbooks someone
got from the library book sale last year.
I have been baking all day,
and in a few minutes will start to wonder
what happened to that box of coarse kosher salt
I got just last week.
The children are all singing
some ditty from a musical
we saw at the community theater
a few days ago, and, in the tub the one
with electrodes affixed so gently
to his chest is calling
out little mews of uncertainty,
is calling and calling into the sundown
past the knotted trees with their hairy
fruits, green and hard. Hush,
hush, don't worry, another one
is saying, fingernail following a line of text
in a complicated book. I think this one
is called the Brazilian Telephone, one
says, connecting finally,
after all this build-up, the ends of two
wires to the battery terminals
which, with steel wool stolen from the kitchen,
they had cleaned so carefully
earlier in the day.






I Passed Three Girls Killing a Goat
 

I passed three girls killing a goat, shotgun
leaned up against a tree and the entrails
spilling into a coil on the ground. It was hooked
between the tendons of its back legs
to a high branch that gently creaked
like a dry hinge busybody aunties wouldn't oil.
Blood drained into a pail, you could smell it
shifting with the air, and black flies landed
in the shadows of things where the wind
didn't touch. I dreamed I was carrying a sack
filled with animals, and it dragged blood
in the gravel and stained my skirt hem, you could follow my trail
to the county line where old men
sat on the liquor store porch. One crooked his half-arm
for the bottle where the auger had caught his hand.
I dreamed I was in a new country rinsing livers
under a spigot, and the men cracking
black walnuts on a stone named my limbs
like the weather, like none of us knew
the same words. By the tree the girls and the goat
were faltering, one squatted to sharpen
her blackened blade on a strop, and the men
on the county line leaned back on the heels
of their chairs talking about anything, each other,
spring weather, the long-haired boy scalped
by a combine, and one of them swore you only plant
beans with the moon in Capricorn otherwise
the fields choke up with scrub juniper. One
looked intently at his left palm; his right wrist
uselessly brushed the woven seat of his chair.
When a wind came, the screen door leapt up
on its leather hinges which never creaked
and slammed shut. Mud daubers in the muck
by the spigot blew sideways around my ankles and up
under my skirt, and inside I could hear
the woman who lived with the liquor store proprietor
cursing as she locked up the vanilla like she knew
how to break the back of a ghost.





Long ago I heard footsteps
 

Long ago I heard footsteps
come to the door, and a man

knocking. We've had an accident

up on the road, can you help
he pled at the unanswered door,

and kept knocking.

He might have been a thief
but soon enough a woman's howl

lit up the night, and I put a knife
in my belt. Around dawn

I figured their fortunes
might be worth change.





The Choice
 

To stand for once
outside my faith

to steady it
caught and squirming on a stick
up to mind's 
inviting light

and name it!
for all its faults and facets


or keep waiting

to be claimed in it






Conjugation
 


This early the garden's bare
but people pay to walk it,

at plots of budless brush
stop, as if remembering,

and stoop to mouth the names--
araucaria

araucana, monkey 
puzzle tree, something 

Japanese--each particular
ridiculous to be. 






Parade
 

As with this Jet Ski family
          braiding the lake
with bigger and bigger shocks
until the one 
          car-sized one
cuts his engine
and, following him, for an instant 
          they all coast
through silences 
of self-made 
          rain--

how much is required now
                     to carve, 
out of the general
livable quiet, 
          independence?





The Exam
 

It is mid-October. The trees are in 
 their autumnal glory (red, yellow-green,

 orange) outside the classroom where students 
 take the mid-term, sniffling softly as if

 identifying lines from Blake or Keats
 was such sweet sorrow, summoned up in words

 they never saw before. I am thinking
 of my parents, of the six decades they've

 been together, of the thirty thousand
 meals they've eaten in the kitchen, of the

 more than twenty thousand nights they've slept
 under the same roof. I am wondering

 who could have fashioned the test that would have
 predicted this success? Who could have known?






Ego
 

I just didn't get it--
even with the teacher holding an orange (the earth) in one hand
and a lemon (the moon) in the other,
her favorite student (the sun) standing behind her with a flashlight.
I just couldn't grasp it--
this whole citrus universe, these bumpy planets revolving so slowly
no one could even see themselves moving.
I used to think if I could only concentrate hard enough
I could be the one person to feel what no one else could,
sense a small tug from the ground, a sky shift, the earth changing gears.
Even though I was only one mini-speck on a speck,
even though I was merely a pinprick in one goosebump on the orange,
I was sure then I was the most specially perceptive, perceptively sensitive.
I was sure then my mother was the only mother to snap,
"The world doesn't revolve around you!
The earth was fragile and mostly water,
just the way the orange was mostly water if you peeled it,
just the way I was mostly water if you peeled me.
Looking back on that third grade science demonstration,
I can understand why some people gave up on fame or religion or cures--
especially people who have an understanding
of the excruciating crawl of the world,
who have a well-developed sense of spatial reasoning
and the tininess that it is to be one of us.
But not me--even now I wouldn't mind being god, the force
who spins the planets the way I spin a globe, a basketball, a yoyo.
I wouldn't mind being that teacher who chooses the fruit,
or that favorite kid who gives the moon its glow.        







The Measure
 

I continue in my gbariye.
All things along my path are clean and white.
I have set out on a flute's quiet wave
in search of my dark love.
Divination and division mark my road; 
yet, if I turn from left to right,
I walk the same straight path.
I carry the wine of salt water in my bag
to the crossroads of honey and milk.
I am puffed up and charged with the thought
of my own separation. From light to light,
I continue while the light lasts.
The light rests on my walking pole. 
I continue.

If ever you marry, remember,
there is a festival of light 
on every island, a garden
where the women gather in white
to turn to the sound of a king's song.
If you ask why the queen is silent, 
the dance is ended.
Then only a boy on the cross of roads
can find the blue stone of wisdom,
the lourie feather of love in the flesh.
You ask me to enter the chamber and sing,
groan, inexpressibly, groan, ascend,
descend, leap from the ash of your pillow
to the calm light of your grave.
I am too certain of the measure of these days.
Sojourner and guest, I continue;
I polish new stones from old; 
I am at hail's end in the deep wings 
of the city; I would return to the feast.
I continue.

I have learned to see a seed as act,
a word as a gift of perfection. 
The hand that slips the abundant
seed into the darkness of earth
extends from my body. 

I have always wanted to ask--
who speaks, who moves and who returns
when the I is hidden in the paradigm?
I have learned to accept my prescence as act,
my act as a placement of time.
I hold now, by my presence,
to have held the first light,
and, in my imperfection,
to have held the vision of my own absence.
This is the one you marry, so lightly.

Each figure, now, twins and untwins us.
We can say we can be brought, in white,
to the marriage bed, under a reed's bass,
and settled, limb to counter limb,
with our desert's necessities.
I wait, as always, at the crossroads 
to be led into the city.
I desire your double journey.
I ask your name.
I continue.






Love in the Water, Love in the Stone
 

Faithful bean lady of the plantain,
your tubular beads surround my voice.
You bring me a berry song so old
I hug the silences. You
embrace the silence and the clear light
on the track of your quest, to here.
I see now in that light myself
into the tangle of the river's bottom.

Knee-deep in another's bliss
I wake and find myself a stone
                                    at your lover's feet.
Then stone upon stone,
I rise into another's fire.
I touch your palm oil flesh
to light me from my cave.
And, if I rise, under your thunder,
into rain, I praise your touch.

Now, a life-long a laterite, 
a rain of beads, palm kernel oil
stipulate my clipped time.
The earth weaves eight gold bridal veils
to cast into the sea. The moon
is up at noon to catch me naked,
drunk and dancing with a ram.
I use the loom of seasons so; 
I abuse myself.
And, even if I leave you,
I marry your worship in my wife's voice.

I begin the decline of having you
                                              close;
your memories feed me.
These are my intolerable survivals.
And so I take my love's journey
from the language of your needs.
I mount my woman's earth smell
in the shadows of your ageless eyes.
I crawl to the altar of your thunderstones
and bleed for the bride whose blood
will fill my name.






Areito
 

This is my mitote,
batoco,
areito,
my bareitote.
This is my bareitote,
areito, batoco, 
my a-ba-mitote.

Corre, corrido, navideo.

Friday the thirteenth
and snow in the birch.
Love's days all begin
with that kind of coldness.
We had come down
to the fog and the bite of the sea,
another of love's soft nibbles
                                  on the skin.
The axe had chipped in the trees. 
High up, the squabble of birds
through the evergreens
became the painful sound of palms.

And the woman sang: 
I've got love all around me
My own treasure's found me
My savior
is a boy in bloom.

So you guess that I wrestled 
the shadows of my cabin at night.
My wife, in her corner,
tumbled over the milk in her sleep.
We had arrived 
with more than a small purchase,
a small reparation,
                                to make.
Was it only the axe wronged in the trees?
My skin is the repository
of the sun's needles.
Why had I chosen the cold?

And the woman sang:
Flesh of my flesh, I nurse your dreams
I nurse your screams
I am
your mother.

Mystic rose of the heart,
how could three of us
be imprisoned there?
And how could we come 
from the dark wood into the light
yet still hear the moonlit canticles
prey in the water
still pray in another tongue
for sunlight on our nets?
Three of us to nurse the night,
and three of us for saving.
Santos and serpents,
tangled in the streams of our bodies,
dance in the blue of our altar lights.

Dolor, dolori, passa 
A strength in a weary land
A shelter in the time of a storm.

I had lived alone with the woman,
sunlight, a son, fish, the fallen apples,
the holy deer that would kneel to our knife,
all the provisions or prayer,
to find myself unmarried,
my woman drunk with God,
nurse of a savior's screams.
Then out of the woods,
I turned to the woods,
to the toothless nurse of my own dreams.
by the light of the thirteenth moon,
I began to search for my own light.

Wood of the woods
Bird of the woods
Woman you were created by God.

Necromancer of the hummingbird,
I bring you this bird's body
and the thirteen rings of my love's chains.
I bring you the secret whispers of my wife's sleep,
the tangled passions of the forest,
the thorn I would return
                                  to another heart.

Bird of the woods, fly into her heart.

Teach me how to stalk her sleep
and the bible of her loves.
Teach me the darkness of thirteen moons,
how to contend with a God.
Bathe me in love's coldness.
Woman of the woods.

Dolor, dolori, passa.

I lie down in the sand
to hear my batoco,
my mitote,
my areito,
end.





Lund
 

Moonlight, if I sleep on this bank
and lay my head against your kiss,
I recognize the river's sound.
Timeless me, all day I raise
my knife against the sugar cane,
sugar brute who takes my days for pay.
Sun glow in spring is crystal clean.
Sun glow north, sun glow south,
sun glow summer, sun glow fall.
The fall of sweetness weighs me.
Arib of the sweetest god,
will this or what winter 
be the longest sleep?
I serenade his green fingers,
his water's magic, his boot in the earth,
the way he pulls the green crowns to light.
Arib of the grainy god,
will this or what fall
be the desolation of our mother?
I serenade the return of even light
to her wrinkled face. 
Moonlight, now I lie on the crown
of my own desire,
hutched
in the fall of the god,
the fall of the cane,
the fall of my own night.





What Is Good
 

Out of the water call
my luminous breath,
into the bird, intending serpent, red,
who shakes himself, white,
out of that forest body, black.

Red gourd head spirit of the bush,
your breath is speech; 
your speech is ordinary, pure.
I take you from the blue 
glass of my sacred windows,
I ring you cold upon my father's weights.

I would cook and save you
in my body's house alone, light
you in the useless prism of my own desires.
I hold you in the yellow 
parchment of my soul's hand.
Once I took your body for the shape 
of all I walked upon, your god's voice
for the second of all my light.
But now I count my sins against
the ordinary syntax of my days.

Bird of the hard wood,
I would transcend the dog
and fox of my father's prayers, 
the corn, the monkey, lion and the seed
cut crudely by the cross in gold,
the black figures of a Christian death.

Bird, so you would change,
and flutter in my mother's eyes.
And in my mother's eyes
still bodies have rhythms of their own.
The light of dead hearts, my governors,
leads my body to a stillness.
I speak of stillness, and you see 
I still grip your rhythm to my body.

Rhythm of my shade, an elephant skin.
Rhythm of my hat, the llama's hair.
Rhythm of my coat, the cactus' beard.
Rhythm of my trousers, silkworm web.
Rhythm of my shoes, pig hips.
Rhytm of my seat, the heart of a tree.
Rhythm of my hands in the beads.
Rhythm of my hands in the cleansing water, 
of my eye in the perfect form of stillness,
the perfect light of my mother's ecstasy.

Composed, I am saved
by my mother's reason,
my neighbors' needs,
my will to go beyond the stillness
of my gods' dreams.
Luminous breath,
teach me compassion for this 
my complex body.






Me and Bubble went to Memphis
 







The Bench
 

          
          My husband and I were arguing about a bench we wanted to buy and put in part of our backyard, a part which is actually a meadow of sorts, a half acre with tall grasses and weeds and the occasional wild flower because we do not mow it but leave it scrubby and unkempt.  This bench would hardly ever be used and in summer when the grasses were high would remain partially hidden from view.  We both knew we wanted the bench to be made of teak so that it would last a long time in the harsh weather and so that we would never have to paint it.  Teak weathers to a soft silver that might, in November or March, disappear into the gray hills that are the backdrop of our lives.  My husband wanted a four foot bench and I wanted a five foot bench.  This is what we argued about.  My husband insisted that a four foot bench was all we needed, since no more than two people (presumably ourselves) would ever sit on it at the same time.  I felt his reasoning was not only beside the point but missed it entirely; I said what mattered most to me was the idea of the bench, the look of it there, to be gazed at with only the vaguest notion it could hold more people than would ever actually sit down.  The life of the bench in my imagination was more important than any practical function the bench might serve.  After all, I argued, we wanted a bench so that we could look at it, so that we could imagine sitting on it, so that, unexpectedly, a bird might sit on it, or fallen leaves, or inches of snow, and the longer the bench, the greater the expanse of that plank, the more it matched its true function, which was imaginary.  My husband mentioned money and I said that I was happier to have no bench at all, which would cost nothing, than to have a four foot bench, which would be expensive.  I said that having no bench at all was closer to the five foot bench than the four foot bench because having no bench served the imagination in similar ways, and so not having a bench became an option in our argument, became a third bench. We grew very tired of discussing the three benches and for a day we rested from our argument.  During this day I had many things to do and many of them involved my driving past other houses, none of which had benches, that is they each had the third bench, and as I drove past the other houses I could see a bench here and a bench there; sometimes I saw the bench very close to the house, against a wall or on a porch, and sometimes I saw the bench under a tree or in the open grass, cut or uncut, and once I saw the bench at the end of the driveway, blocking the road.  Always it was a five foot bench that I saw, a long sleek bench or a broken down bench, a bench with a slatted back or a bench with a solid, carved back, and always the bench was empty. But I knew that for my husband the third bench was only four feet long and he saw always two people sitting on it, two happy or tired people, two people who were happy to be alive or two people tired from having worked hard enough to buy the bench they were sitting on.  Or they were happy and tired, happy to have reached the end of some argument, tired from having had it.  For these people, the bench was an emblem of their days, which were fruitful because their suffering had come to an end. On my bench, which was always empty, nothing had come to an end because nothing had begun, no one had sat down, though the bench was always there waiting for exactly that to happen.  And the bench was always long enough so that someone, if he desired to, could lie all the way down.  That day passed.  Another day followed it and my husband and I began, once more, to discuss the bench.  The sound of our voices revealed a renewed interest and vigor.  I thought I sensed in him a coming around to my view of the bench and I know he sensed in me a coming around to his view of the bench, because at one point I said that a four foot bench reminded me of rough notes towards a real bench while a five foot bench was like a fragment of an even longer bench and I admitted it was at times hard to tell the difference.  He said he didn't know anything about the difference between rough notes and fragments but he agreed that between the two benches there was, possibly, just perhaps--he could imagine it--very little difference.  It was, after all, only a foot we were talking about.  And I think it was then, in both of our minds, that a fourth bench came into being, a bench that was only a foot long, a miniature bench, a bench we could build ourselves, though of course we did not.  This seemed to be, essentially, the bench we were talking about.  Much later, when the birds came back, or the leaves drifted downwards, or the snow fell, slowly and lightly at first, then heavier and faster, it was this bench that we both saw when we looked out the window at the bench we eventually placed in the meadow which continued to grow as if there were no bench at all.
        




Seven Postcards from Dover
 

I
  
 The teacher said inner truth
 and the chalk said like a fresco inside the earth
 that no one has ever seen
 and one day decides to be discovered
 and begins to breathe--
 do you know what that means?
  
 II
  
 The child broke the chalk.
 The mother said be strong.
 The child said when I die I want to be a dwarf.
  
 III
  
 A detective has just drawn a circle
 with a piece of chalk, a private circle
 from which the victim will eventually look
 up, not at random, not at will,
 but when it calls to her,
 the chalk, the crushed bones
 of sea creatures who ringed the earth
 when it was under water.
  
 IV
  
 A man sits in the bath house
 in a deep tub
 of fizzling yellow water
 that surrounds every hair on his body
 and makes it stand upright.
 When the attendant comes, she will
 clean the tub by moving her hand
 slowly around the ring, like a snail.
  
 V
  
 An atoll is a ring of coral
 protecting a tureen of plankton.
 It is easy and Japanese to be sad
 knowing something is going to pass.
 He put the ring on her chalky finger.
  
 VI
  
 Long after chalk had passed out of use,
 carpenters still felt for it in their pockets
 and looked aimlessly at the sky.
  
 VII
  
 The cathedral was roofless.
 It began to snow inside.
 A half broken pillar in the nave
 grew taller.






The Letter
 

Beloved, men in thick green coats came crunching
 through the snow, the insignia on their shoulders
 of uncertain origin, a country I could not be sure of,
 a salute so terrifying I heard myself lying to avoid
 arrest, and was arrested along with Jocko, whose tear
 had snapped off, a tiny icicle he put in his mouth.
 We were taken to the ice prison, a palace encrusted
 with hoarfrost, its dome lit from within, Jocko admired
 the wiring, he kicked the walls to test the strength
 of his new boots.  A television stood in a block of ice,
 its blue image still moving like a liquid center.
 You asked for my innermost thoughts.  I wonder will I
 ever see a grape again?  When I think of the vineyard
 where we met in October--when you dropped a cluster
 custom insisted you be kissed by a stranger--how after
 the harvest we plunged into a stream so icy our palms
 turned pink.  It seemed our future was sealed.  Everyone
 said so.  It is quiet here.  Not closing our ranks 
 weakens us hugely.  The snowflakes fall in a featureless
 bath.  I am the stranger who kissed you.  On sunny days
 each tree is a glittering chandelier.  The power of 
 mindless beauty!  Jocko told a joke and has been dead
 since May.  A bullethole in his forehead the officers
 call a third eye.  For a month I milked a barnful of
 cows.  It is a lot like cleansing a chandelier.  Wipe
 and polish, wipe and polish, round and round you go.
 I have lost my spectacles.  Is the book I was reading
 still open by the side of our bed?  Treat it as a bookmark
 saving my place in our story.
  
 (here the letter breaks off)






Bavaria
 

The mountain skies were clear
 except for the umlaut of a cloud
 over the village.
 The little girl wore yellow gloves.
 She looked in the peephole and saw
 a stack of unused marionettes.
 Yet, she wondered.






Perpetually Attempting to Soar
 

A boy from Brooklyn used to cruise on summer nights.
 As soon as he'd hit sixty he'd hold his hand out the window,
 cupping it around the wind. He'd been assured
 this is exactly how a woman's breast feels when you put
 your hand around it and apply a little pressure. Now he knew,
 and he loved it. Night after night, again and again, until
 the weather grew cold and he had to roll the window up.
 For many years afterwards he was perpetually attempting 
 to soar. One winter's night, holding his wife's breast
 in his hand, he closed his eyes and wanted to weep.
 He loved her, but it was the wind he imagined now.
 As he grew older, he loved the word etcetera and refused
 to abbreviate it. He loved sweet white butter. He often
 pretended to be playing the organ. On one of his last mornings,
 he noticed the shape of his face molded in the pillow.
 He shook it out, but the next morning it reappeared.






The Invention of Streetlights
 

             noctes illustratas
              (the night has houses)
                                                       and the shadow of the fabulous
                                           broken into handfuls--these
 can be placed at regular intervals,
                                                          candles
 walking down the streets at times eclipsed by trees.
  

  
  

  
  
  
  
  
 Certain cells, it's said, can generate light on their own.
  
 There are organisms that could fit on the head of a pin
 and light entire rooms.
  
 Throughout the Middle Ages, you could hire a man
 on any corner with a torch to light you home
  
                                                                 were lamps made of horn
 and from above a loom of moving flares, we watched
 Notre Dame seem small.
 Now the streets and stand still.
  
 By 1890, it took a pound of powdered magnesium
 to photograph a midnight ball.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 While as early as 50 BCE, riotous soldiers leaving a Roman bath
 sliced through the ropes that hung the lamps from tree to tree
                                              and aloft us this
                                              new and larger room

Flambeaux the arboreal
                                             was the wife of Julius Caesar
                 in whose streets
                 in which a single step could be heard.
 We opened all our windows
 and looked out on a listening world laced here and there with points of light,
                                              Notre Dame of the Unfinished Sky,
 oil slicks burning on the river; someone down on the corner
 striking a match to read by. 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 Some claim Paris was the first modern city to light its streets.
         The inhabitants were ordered
         in 1524 to place a taper in every window in the dark there were 912 streets
                                 walked into this arc until by stars
                                 makes steps sharp, you are 
                  and are not alone
 by public decree
 October 1558: the lanterns were similar to those used in mines:
 "Once
 we were kings
                                 and down into the spiral of our riches
 still reign: falots or great vases of pitch lit
 at the crossroads
                   --and thus were we followed 
                                                         through a city of thieves--which,
 but a few weeks later, were replaced by chandeliers.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 While others claim all London was alight by 1414.
                                 There it was worded:
 Out of every window, come a wrist with a lanthorn
                                                                                                and were told          
                                                                                                hold it there
                                        and be on time
 and not before
 and watched below
 the faces lit, and watched the faces pass.         And turned back in
 (the face goes on) and watched the lights go out.
 Here the numbers are instructive:
                                In the early 18th century, London hung some 15,000 lamps.
 And now we find (1786) they've turned to crystal, placed precisely,
 each its own distance, small in islands, large in the time it would take to run.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  




                                              And Venice started in 1687 with a bell
  
                                              upon the hearing of which, we all in unison
 exit,
 match in hand, and together strike them against an upper tooth and touch
 the tiny flame to anything, and when times get rough (crime up, etc.) all we
 have to do is throw oil out upon the canals to make the lighting uncommonly 
 extensive. Sometimes we do it just to shock the rest of Europe, and at other 
 times because we find it beautiful.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
 Says Libanius
                      Night differs us
                                           Without us
                                            noctes illustratas
                                                     Though in time of public grief
 when the streets were left unlit, on we went, just
 dark marks in the markets and voices in the cafes, in the crowded squares,
 a single touch, the living, a lantern
                                  swinging above the door any time a child is born, be it
 Antioch, Syria, or Edessa--
 and then there were the festivals,
                              the festum encaeniorum, and others in which
                              they call idolatrous, these torches
                                                                           half a city wide
                                                                                               be your houses.






What the Ventriloquists Said
 

amid the growing craze for automatons
 The voice within the device that moves      is not
                                                               (as if nothing human
 could be quite that moving) My precious edgling: though
                                                                                           some
                                                                                           believe
 the answers be given by a man concealed,
                                         these are speaking machines.
  
                                         They were risking their lives.
 Usually a woman or a child, who woke up inside the oracle,
 who swallowed the burning oil, and who forces the idols to speak?
  
                                         Though when the bishop Theophilus
 broke open the statues at Alexandria, he found them hollow
  
                                         it does not necessarily follow that
  
 The penalty for trickery was death.
                                         Such is the wealth of belief.
                                         Behind a finely painted sheet of shell
 a voice unlatched surrounds the world.





Esperanza
 

My name mocks me
 for I was born at the cost
 of my mother's life,
 earning my father's hatred
 with my first breath.
 All my life
 I have scoured a house soiled
 with the thick soot of his resentment.
 It has left its mark on the walls,
 in his eyes, and on me.
 All of it I have tried to wipe away.
 In my hands I hold a broom,
 in my heart--
 ashes, ashes.






El Olvido
 

It is a dangerous thing
 to forget the climate of your birthplace,
 to choke out the voices of dead relatives
 when in dreams they call you
 by your secret name.
 It is dangerous
 to spurn the clothes you were born to wear
 for the sake of fashion; dangerous
 to use weapons and sharp instruments
 you are not familiar with; dangerous
 to disdain the plaster saints
 before which your mother kneels
 praying with embarrassing fervor
 that you survive in the place you have chosen to live:
 a bare, cold room with no pictures on the walls,
 a forgetting place where she fears you will die
 of loneliness and exposure.
 Jess, Mara, y Jos, she says, 
 el olvido is a dangerous thing.





Urban Gallery
 

When the wind invades the treetops
 and the trees agree, shivering 
 take me, take me, when their
 stealthy perfume drifts down to waft
 among mortals, they come out in droves:
 the boy whose bouncing keys speak a language
 all their own, the novice who gets her tricks
 from magazine molls (their haughtiness, swirl
 of cleats), the gigolo with eyes lowered,
 the better to judge his prey, the woman
 whose hemlines rise as her age does,
 the bad girl whose only remaining option
 is to get worse: despite the string of cheats
 and lukewarm reactions, she still has
 the power to pound, the knack of 
 funneling her frustration into
 the arrogant click of a heel . . .
 at this armada of proud, unyielding soldiers
 I have cast ferocious stones, holding forth
 on barricaded gardens and souls' communion
 until, heaving my bones from garret to gutter
 I took to the street and saw it, too, was worthy.
 Chasers out for a good time, flirters in
 for a life's catch, strutters so skilled your
 lurid designs burn holes, kill the cold
 in the pavement, it does not matter
 what fever you feed, so long as
 you feed it freely; I hid my eyes
 but sickness is catching; lovers, permit me entrance.






Worms and Us
 

    I.
  
 Maggots in the food, maggots in the floorboards,
 maggots in the recurring nightmare in which,
 lying down with a rugged adonis,
 I wake to find him almost nibbled away.
 Certainly signs of death are everywhere,
 but love is more than combat with worms
 and cannot be so glibly explained away;
 I do not tremble or knock my knees
 to keep the maggots slumbering below ground,
 or crush them underfoot by flocking to
 everything they are not: raucous gatherings,
 stolen kisses. On the contrary,
 I come away from parties adoring
 what is wormlike in them: the unrisen souffl,
 the precocious boy's octogenarian sayings,
 the drooping lids of the hostess, someone's
 death rattle of a laugh. Certainly love has
 commerce with vermin, but it is a friendly
 partnership, not a league of discord;
 a hacking cough gives proof of a full life,
 a passing stranger seems all the stronger
 when one foot is sinking quietly into the grave.
  
  
     II.
  
 But is is this lingering horror of dust
 that makes me pull us out of the cold earth
 any way I know how: because I strive
 for heaven in little rooms, visit you
 in order to suck your blood, then spread it
 over pipes and daffodils, and shove you
 up to the vacant sky, where you hover
 like a stone-cold, tedious statue who never dies,
 you, poor pawn, are a jack-in-the-box gone haywire,
 and I am a grinning humanist with bad dreams.






Taking to the Hills
 

If walking, like wine, only abets a sad mood
 let's try it, I said, and I did:
 over these hills that have never known sorrow
 no thoughtful moon passes. Dig until a hill is level, and unearth
 only earth. Take pride in knowing the chemical makeup
 of rain, the sum total of harmful vapors in any sunset.
 For if you must drag in the old lines 
 about suicidal willows, star's stacked for or against you,
 you clutter a limitless, soaring landscape
 with your own baggage. Night of love, 
 day of omens of night, great mountain
 of realized hopes, valley where bitter winds
 blow the dispossessed into raving lunatics--
 what are they but shady projections
 of passing whims, vastly oversimplified versions
 of something infinitely greater? This vision before you
 is nothing but a triad of trees, hills, river,
 steadfast and eternal. But soon you start to feel restless
 and when, setting out to take a roll of photos,
 you note the disturbing absence of a road,
 your suavity crumbles: you deafen the sky
 and serenade the moon, fall prostrate before pines
 saying oh, come back, spirit of the place which,
 lifeless without you, blossoms into something
 sumptuously more than mediating madness;
 come back, massive oaks that await our coming;
 to carve initials is to be truly human;
 the days are dappled with our passions,
 the mountains rise and fall with our glories and follies.






Thoughts While Walking
 

I hate the travel logs that tell you
 more about the pain than the place,
 yet here I am again, narrating
  
 the same old story to myself
 time after time. The papers circling
 in an alley, watched by a hunchback,
  
 mimic my plans and their preventer;
 when an old man treats the drycleaner
 to a lengthy sermon on spotting,
  
 I collect it; bloated clouds spell
 messages that people stopped hearing
 long ago, and as for the hag
  
 who runs at me, arms open, mouth bleeding?
 She's my future, my terrible double.
 Always I head out, hot for details,
  
 and always the details start revolving
 around brave ingnues who put their
 innocent hands in wicked bonfires.
  
 I could never go for ten minutes
 without seeing fissures as faces,
 and I confess a hopeless weakness
  
 for the types who come back from travels,
 gather their fans around and tell them
 stories of order or of wonder:
  
 seashores and meadows sometimes get so
 muffled and many-voiced that tourists
 storm in and do their talking for them--
  
 It's addictive, magical, vital.
 But I've observed how, more and more, these
 promising outings are becoming
  
 meta-walks and mechanized phrases:
 "When I ventured into the outback,
 how it blared back echoes of me,
  
 my bright dreams and tragic uniqueness.
 Meanwhile forces of good and evil
 squirm and flourish under the carpet,
  
 mocking the visionary moment's
 sweeping appeal. I'll go on going
 out for scenes of horror and pleasure,
  
 but I'll start pursuing clues leading
 to the return of that enormous,
 fertile ground between shouting and silence.






Clubfoot
 

Meanwhile, meanwhile used to be my limp's 
 accompaniment. Meanwhile (as my legs
 maneuvered an abyss), a ballet is
 beginning, and the dancer's perfect feet
 propel her downstage, where applause is waiting.
 Meanwhile a sad man stomps his gloom away
 by stomping evenly: one two, one two
 means never blue, his motto goes. But I
 was born to other paces, different measures;
 the roads I take are undulant and lined
 with fluid hedges, trees that take a dive
 whenever I am near; a bird's ascent
 slows down to an eternal crawl; and when
 a doctor's order takes me to the city
 it is a jagged gotham, full of spires
 that waver in the sky like falling knives
 or silver metronomes. Meanwhile, meanwhile
 (the rhythm steadied me) a lover steals
 upon his mistress with the quietness
 that only flatfeet know. So quietly 
 that he might just as well have stayed at home,
 I add when my self-confidence is at
 a high point, and the view is at its best.
 And sometimes I have thoughts, before the surge
 of meanwhile drowns them out, that limping is
 a thing I'd voluntarily take up
 if I were just as upright as the rest:
 I see myself, erect, stampeding through
 a garden's sturdy, stale geometry
 and nearly knocked down by the urge to say
 incline, I like your style; ravine, hello;
 how many good things share your curvature;
 it is the slant of rainfall when the wind
 convinces it to drift; it is a sight
 that those with level heads and steady feet
 miss out on. In a coracle (my new
 enthusiasm leads to stories), you
 are better, bent; the more you tilt, the more
 the water welcomes you, its addled waves
 a live reminder of your being there,
 its leaping fish a sign that you are still
 alert and in command. The clubfoots have
 a myth concerning Orpheus' head,
 and though I doubt its authenticity
 I like the way it goes: hacked off, the head
 was rolling down the river, when a change
 came over it--it bobbed, it jumped, it shuddered,
 it caught itself in weeds, but struggled free
 because of all its energy, and then
 its eyes began to come to life, as if
 a pretty tune enthralled it even then.
 Meanwhile his killers marched away, saying
 he had his ups and downs. Of course, of course
 to hobble is to hinder: sick is sick,
 no matter how you change the second term
 to suit your needs. But sometimes I am sure
 that when I limp along a crooked street,
 my dancing shadow is a model for
 the stiffs who hurry past without a sound,
 showing them this way, that way, as they reach 
 the little level huts they call home.






from A Short History of Israel, Notes and Glosses
 


                                           XI
 A hundred generations, yes, a hundred and twenty-five,
 had the strength each day
 not to eat this and that (unclean!)
 not to say this and that,
 not to do this and that (unjust!),
 and with all this and all that
 to go about
 as men and Jews
 among their enemies
 (these are the Pharisees you mocked at, Jesus).
 Whatever my grandfathers did or said
 for all of their brief lives
 still was theirs,
 as all of it drops at a moment make the fountain
 and all of its leaves a palm.
 Each word they spoke and every thought
 was heard, each step and every gesture seen,
 by God;
 their past was still the present and the present
 a dread future's.
 But I am private as an animal.
  
 I have eaten whatever I liked,
 I have slept as long as I wished,
 I have left the highway like a dog
 to run into every alley;
 now I must learn to fast and to watch.
 I shall walk better in these heavy boots
 than barefoot.
 I will fast for you, Judah,
 and be silent for you
 and wake in the night because of you;
 I will speak for you
 in psalms,
 and feast because of you
 on unleavened bread and herbs.





The Lamps Are Burning
 


The lamps are burning in the synagogue,
 in the houses of study, in dark alleys. . . .
 This should be the place.
  
 This is the way
 the guide book describes it. Excuse me, sir
 can you tell me
 where Eli lives, Eli the katzev--
 slaughterer of cattle and poultry?
 One of my ancestors.
 Reb Haskel? Reb Shimin? My grandfathers.
  
 This is the discipline that withstood the siege 
 of every Jew;
 these are the prayer shawls that have proved
 stronger than armor.
  
 Let us begin humbly. Not by asking:
 Who is This you pray to? Name Him;
 define Him. For the answer is:
 We do not name Him.
 Once out of a savage fear, perhaps;
 now out of knowledge--of our ignorance.
  
 Begin then humbly. Not by asking:
 Shall I live forever?
 Hear again the dear dead greeting me gladly
 as they used to
 when we were all among the living?
 For the answer is:
 If you think we differ from all His other creatures,
 say only if you like with the Pharisees, our teachers,
 those who do not believe in an eternal life
 will not have it.
  
 In the morning I arise and match again
 my plans against my cash.
 I wonder now if the long morning prayers
 were an utter waste of an hour
 weighing, as they do, hopes and anguish,
 and sending the believer out into the street
 with the sweet taste of the prayers on his lips.
  
 Today this creditor is at your office;
 tomorrow this one in your home;
 until the final creditor of all
 places his bony hands upon your breast.
 Faster!
 Dig your heels into the dust!
  
 How good to stop
 and look out upon eternity a while.
 And daily--at Shahris, Minha, Maariv,
 in the morning, afternoon, and evening--
 be at ease in Zion.






The Other Stars
 

    I.
  
 Tripartite schemes were all very well
 for the builders who held their blueprints firmly
 in hand beforehand. What did it matter
 if the two vertical poles didn't touch, seemed so
 far apart, in fact, that no one who visited the site
 could believe the architect's arrogant babble?
 Before they knew it, he'd bridged the two poles with a plank.
  
 I have hidden under these structures of
 synthetic comfort when the sky was
 overcast. I have even hired a claque of
 unemployed actors  to stand there with me. But speaking
 for myself, I find their tentlike charm diminishing.
 Over on the next hill is a line of poker-faced upright slabs,
 their bases deep in the dirt, their function something else entirely.
  
  
     II.
  
 I keep seeking this pleasure-giving eye mote;
 you fill your pew and my view with
 golden uncontrollable emanation
 and the music surges in response,
 a coded story of hope and disappointment
 decipherable to the few. Is it wrong
 to be overheated here, or not to have left my coat at the entrance?
  
 The only crime would be not to swoon,
 to see and ignore you, or brand you a brother
 in spotless devotion. Beneath the bleeding windows
 hearts must have heft, masses of skin become
 human tremors, to feel the force of the organ.
 On its own the rite is a starchy obligation;
 add intrigue and the altar ripples and ripples.
  
  
     III.
  
 Over the hub of the hill, a solid wall of
 silver leaves. Underfoot, soil without
 burrows. Blanketing soil and leaves, a scrim of
 hushed and unpunctured blue. Then all of a sudden,
 rumors of something about to happen; the night
 restless with its own unkeepable secrets,
 the very air strained and achingly electric.
  
 Because you are not here, nighttime behaves
 this way, calling for terms I'd long since put away:
 susurration, intrigue, reverberant. It is only
 in your magnanimous absence that stony surroundings
 can sing your praises so; I curse even as I gape
 to know that their raving requires your being
 anywhere else. The evening hums in compensation.
  
  
     IV.
  
 His beak is open as if in mid-worm or
 mid-sentence, his feet impressively sturdy as they
 straddle the street. What gives him away,
 though, is the magenta pool spreading rapidly
 under this otherwise unruffled stomach.
 Something ended this bird so suddenly that
 he never had time to strike a normal death pose.
  
 It would be overdone and untrue
 to say I am the bird, to paint myself in similar terms
 as stunted, irretrievably downed, forever rooted
 to unkind ground. It would smack of self-pity.
 We are partners instead beneath a general rubric
 of doom: an arrow descended and brought 
 him, startled, to death, me screamingly to life.
  
  
     V.
  
 I loved a statue and watered it daily.
 Sooner or later it softened and let me
 break a vital part of it off;
 with my hard-won prize in my pocket
 I explored the streets with a secret,
 but before long the plundered piece was 
 dust in my hands, and painful to look at.
  
 Now another effigy makes me
 shudder at its criminal threshold.
 More than ever I entertain a 
 shameless urge to steal or caress it,
 but the facts of history tell me
 otherwise: you get what you pray for
 and the statue dwindles to rubble.
  
  
     VI.
  
 Although others lack the sharpened knives
 to be villains, they do what they can with 
 blunter instruments. Sparring to kill time, 
 falling to fisticuffs when eloquence evades them,
 they get their day's entertainment from
 instruction manuals bought at auctions; when one
 utters his bored "Touch, a gaggle of fans surround him.
  
 How much deadlier is your collection of
 swords with a history, scimitars that glint
 even when strung up and inactive. Although I would gladly
 lay a whetstone at your door for one blinding night of
 thrust-and-parry, you have no need of
 anything resembling aid: one twist of your weapon
 outstabs the meanest ranks of dullard soldiers.
  
  
     VII.
  
 The avuncular figure with grizzled beard,
 the bearer of balm for the stricken and
 abandoned, the craggy but spirited sickle-carrier
 paces the page of a long-forgotten book of days
 and never once frowns. There is no need to:
 our days may be numbered, but . . . (and here his eyes
 mist over with comforting thoughts of gold and rainbows).
  
 His evil twin wants none of this waiting,
 this starry-eyed torpor. Hoping to scare eternity
 into submission, he too brandishes a sickle, but
 everything goes wrong: he pierces his own leg and must go
 on crutches. Before long, he falls into childish fits
 of self-pity, proffering sickle and leg to hirelings,
 saying "Lop it off, boys, and be quick.

 During the first stages of frenzy, a glut of
 meaning descends on nature. As if to spite cynics
 who call dirt nothing but dirt, terrific breezes
 mere conveyors of pollen, something in the 
 sufferer's mind seeks out and finds corroboration
 in vast planets and puny insects; all are as prone to 
 nervous tics, all whirring with badly kept secrets.
  
 Time passes, and the system turn on you. When
 all is sacred, nothing is safe: silent lampposts suddenly
 pipe up in irresistible  colloquy a tone too high, the sky
 calls you but does not want your replies, and
 water-bound birds decline pronouns in Latin. It is a hotbed
 that cannot stand the addition of an offending
 presence; it whispers until you are well on your way.

 Before you came on the scene and blasted
 the image to bits, I thought of love as a 
 spacious courtroom where evidence was presented
 graphically and up front, where deserving plaintiffs
 got what they wanted legally, and where
 judges beamed beneath picturesque wigs when they saw
 happy verdicts amicably arrived at.
  
 These days, law is something to be left at the door
 along with galoshes; I spend my nights in sinister
 mock-trial, playing all the parts. "Guilty or not?
 booms our pot-bellied, exquisitely bored judge. I answer
 for you: "Not, your holiness; this harridan framed me.
 And then I object. And then, hunched over in a corner
 of the courtroom, a juror suggests we all go out to lunch.

 It was a run of the mill journey until the windows
 seemed to have melted; outside the train,
 the foliage of early summer received an
 instantaneous drenching. Startled, I thought of you
 like a lovesick heroine out of an old romance:
 "Holding her heart, agawp at nature's rages,
 she would watch the storm from inside, and secretly like it.
  
 No longer dainty hand-to-the-head, the tragic
 meaningful stare out the window. No storm buffets
 alone; however stunningly leaves may shudder and
 press against the pane, it is a wasted downpour if
 nobody comes out soggy. Reaching my stop, I
 left my cap and trenchcoat inside a locker
 and headed for the wet jungle, hot on your heels.
  
  
     XI.
  
 Our meeting is as stiff as a long-dead thoroughbred.
 Like its former coat, we too are glossy and brief;
 no frizzy wire springs up that is not
 dutifully cropped; our every neigh is strictly
 by the book; place us in a lineup of 
 similarly frozen stallions, and you will not know
 one rigor mortis from another and another. 
  
 I could endure a salvo of kicking, a brutish uprearing
 nag, or a vicious race to the finish, over this
 wingless duo of moribund mares. I could even
 stand it if you leapt up and started poking holes
 in my horse metaphor. Anything other than the way
 our speech resembles the two extremes of stunted growth:
 gorgeous stillborns, cynical has-beens. This is no time for pleasantry!
  
  
     XII.
  
 I have been dreaming you into the picture
 when you bound, unseeing, past me. I tingle
 onward with knees of jelly, glad
 to be confirmed in my scheming: this walk
 is no hopeless ramble, but a perfect way
 of seeing and being seen. Fate, sensing
 my hopes, obligingly guides you outdoors.
  
 What rankles is the time it takes me
 to realize that you are truly, tangibly here.
 I have been holding so many secret meetings with you
 that this brief encounter, this perfect opportunity
 passes, doesn't register. I see you in retrospect:
 you were here, jacket flapping in the noon breeze,
 and gone by the time I had presence of mind to grasp it.
  
  
     XIII.
  
 Explaining camouflage: a useful way 
 of suiting yourself to your habitat so that
 you steal its features more than it steals yours; in war,
 a surefire method of avoiding skirmishes;
 in love, a vanishing act that lets you watch the object
 of your affection, in whose vagrant eyes
 you might as well be a pebble, a flaw on the leaf.
  
 Or, a ruinous self-effacement, brainchild
 of the timid, deserving to be trounced
 by the rustle in the trees which announces
 a vital presence, the force which, storming a fortress,
 subjects its tenant to a scrutiny of his most
 cherished beliefs, the stunning hybrid
 you look at once and cannot get out of your mind.
  
  
     XIV.
  
 Hearing you praised is enough to make my
 overbaked brain a warpath for feuding
 goddesses. Only instead of swords,
 their messages clash, each one a model of
 what I might do. On one side, Silence,
 stately in black, shows no sign of unrest:
 her only response to the beaming crowd is to nod.
  
 On the other side in see-through red, a goddess
 named Outrage deafens her rival with laudatory
 overdrive; next to her encomia both clean
 and unclean, the excesses of the laurel-throwers
 positively began to pale. It is her manner that 
 somehow filters out; the walls start to rumble, the floorboards,
 feeble at keeping secrets, murmur "Swear it.

 In the handed-down inventory of love's habits
 we find images of lowering: down at the mouth,
 down on the knees, prostrate with the shock of the marvelous.
 Contact more than shame-faced with the elevated figure
 is therefore impossible; hazard more
 than a bow, and a trapdoor opens beneath you;
 offer a hand, and see love disappear.
  
 There is never a mention of the sudden boost
 the run-down ego receives when, flinging a jest
 from toad-high levels, it witnesses more than
 haughty approval. Nor is it told how the jest
 (some minor impromptu line) gets told and retold
 in the prolonged wake of the moment; seraphs laugh at it,
 trees love it; you see your dullness shine in another's eyes.

 A dream straight out of a textbook: having been
 tied up and pointed at the wall by a swarthy, hairy-
 faced thug and her henchman, I hear the incredible shouts
 as an old babysitter is disemboweled.
 Severed organs flap to the floor like pancakes,
 but I do not think, "Me next, fearing instead
 that it will fall on me to clean up the horrible mess.
  
 What can I do, on waking, but clench my stomach
 in sharp, instinctive need to keep it closed?
 In wars between the hirsute and the nurturing, nobody
 dares to cheer for the former, though her company, being
 moody, is hellishly more alive. Will this day or
 the next bring pearly surfaces to the brink of
 spilling over? (Somewhere the babysitter screams your name.)

 Once a day, you report to the resident loony
 for clues leading to the whereabouts of
 the author of a love letter you have received.
 She is mad but useful, delving as she can into
 alternate worlds; and as you grill her from the other 
 side of the bars, a strange bond begins to form
 between you. She seems to have felt as you do.
  
 Little do you know that this sibyl is also a relentless
 self-promoter. She ladles out counsel ("You can tell
 she wants to be tracked down) and misinformation
 ("I think I know where she lives) like a watery broth
 that keeps you coming back for the meaty pay-off
 at the bottom. All this you realize and tolerate, 
 never suspecting that she's the one you want.
  
  
     XVIII.
  
 When you are within shouting distance it is
 no matter, or next to none, what you say or
 whether we speak at all. It is enough
 to see, and covertly to love, your bright array of
 colorful traits. They are no sooner parceled out than
 stored up, secret accounts to be gone over until
 the whole single-spaced ledger is memorized.
  
 But when you leave, ledgers cannot contain you;
 time passes and the beloved blurs, the riotous gestures
 faded in substance, though not in force. I cannot hear
 your voice if I try; and what do I do when
 a free-floating affection outraces its
 visible target? From your splendid outpost
 that dazzles merely by being yours, send photos.
  
  
     XIX.
  
 Abroad, you are a mass of extra shadow
 falling on all you see. On its own a square
 is stiff and formidable; walk in it and 
 the arches tremble, the smells from the canal
 soften and linger. The red of the hills
 at evening is fit for a postcard home, until
 you step in the picture--and hand it back to the masters.
  
 It is straight out of a shoddy French novel
 to squeeze the continents into us/them
 categories and chapters--mold here, fruit there,
 stubble in places and wheat in others. Think me less
 a philistine when I say how little the steps
 of the journey frame you. It is you, torchbearer to 
 shrouded lands, who flood them with living color.
  
  
     XX.
  
 When I call you to mind, you respond sluggishly
 if at all. It is as if, being busy, you send
 a very expensive mannequin in your stead,
 a robot who dresses and walks like you but
 cannot capture your puzzling essence. Memory
 loves paradox: the more I require a stand-in,
 the looser the seams, the phonier the puppet.
  
 But I do not know this until the unexpected happens.
 Sifting my horde of jewels and praising their cut,
 I come upon a diamond that puts them to shame;
 catching a glimpse of familiar patterns of color
 in the street, I realize the cheapness of the household dolls
 I have been thinking about, relieved that even now,
 surprises like this put you fleetingly back in the picture.

 It will be objected that in missing you I forfeit
 a key to the room reserved for bona fide lovers.
 There, an air of resolute calm prevails: it is always
 "Our minds are as one, and that is enough,
 or "I saw him last night in the shape of a cloud,
 or, harder still to believe, "Look at the
 useful machine I built instead of grieving.
  
 They may brace themselves and speak of the 
 salubrious sublime; they may grit their teeth and
 bear it; their tourniqueted hearts are as
 undone as mine. Away, you are no
 homing compass or dove, but a roving, ceaselessly
 altering scoundrel. To miss you is to miss
 the loot you add to your repository of noises.
  
  
     XXII.
  
 Horses, birds, babysitters and jails,
 shadows, churches and trains; one would think
 you'd sat up with me all night, filling out forms
 on what images you preferred, or at least been
 consulted in the matter. Failing that, one might suppose you
 to have stood on the sidelines in mounting horror
 as, one by one, strange pictures of you took flight.
  
 But you stumbled into this mess of blocks
 like the bumbling idiot in a screwball
 comedy. Center stage contained in cardboard boxes
 you tripped over before smiling and
 wandering on, in your madcap way, to new scrapes.
 Meanwhile, the whirligig thrives in your absence: booted cubes 
 swoon for their muse, a poltergeist in a bowtie.

 A spider loved a bee and, knowing that to trap him
 would be to kill him, devised webs just flashy enough
 to keep the insect guessing. And soon,
 seeing in the spider's handiwork traces
 of his own flower-hopping, the bee came
 closer. Arachnid vapors wafted over them as
 the bee proposed to die in the spider's service.
  
 "No! screamed the latter, tightening up her floss,
 and the spurned bee flew on to more accustomed
 turf--roses and lilies next to whom (he saw)
 the spider was nothing. But she was not so lucky.
 The web she'd spun for him got tangled
 in her post mortem antenna-flailing, and finally wound
 around her neck and choked her. It was the end of the fable.

 The more love grows, the bigger its sealed-off
 palace becomes, and the more pinched and dark its
 stoical keeper. Inside, sun breeds space: a ray
 that snuck past the keeper enters a room and lights it--
 only now there is not one room but many.
 Beams bright as lasers but gentler give away
 the safe behind the painting, the corridor under the rug.
  
 If only the keeper, hardened by circumstance,
 could learn from this endless illumination
 and turn the room inside out. Light would then
 seep through leathery skin, giving its secrets away
 in a gradually spreading glow, turning skin the orange
 of pure beatitude. But there are only two options for the keeper:
 to be charbroiled all at once or eternally silent.
  
  
     XXV.
  
 Then, any enterprise requiring new clothes
 was privately hissed, if openly hailed;
 too close to a floral militia thinking as one
 were the standard frills, the required rustles,
 and thinking myself a beacon among dark ladies,
 I called the clothes by their hidden agendas:
 ethical corsets, trusses of the spirit.
  
 Now I cry out for the colorful front
 of fancy dress, bow down in belated awe
 before silk and organza. It is not the delusion
 of being at my best, but the promise of further
 secrecy that thrills me; these veils only make
 unveiling all the stranger and wilder,
 and under my gown claw ghosts you'll never see.
  
  
     XXVI.
  
 This sideshow of outlandish images
 is nothing like the main attractions of
 another time. Just after one picture clicks on
 and the eyes have adjusted, another, altogether
 different one takes its place, and another, and another.
 What in the world is going on? Did the projector
 gather together the uppermost slides on the pile?
  
 Nothing could be falser. It is only that 
 the replacement of the reel calls for as many 
 tricks and turns as possible to be an even
 passable substitute. Everything is its field;
 its lens is a gaping hole with a passion for
 things encyclopedic. This is the only way 
 it can capture your many angles--small comfort, yet comfort still.
  
  
     XXVII.
  
 The next time our paths cross there will be
 none of this shilly-shallying, this bondage,
 like it or not, to fickle time, brute locale.
 The crossing itself will slow down the march
 of the passing moment with its own
 unstoppable steam, its tenebrous and sultry
 collection of vapors. It will be love in a bottle.
  
 But there is always a screw loose somewhere,
 a gap in the glass that lets in a limber
 array of interlopers. From the mutual friend
 who smells a levity and wants in, to the premature bonging
 of the hour, to the false confines of the walls
 of our houses, there is always a damnable flaw
 in the system . . . and incoming elves who taunt "Excuses, excuses.
  
  
     XXVIII.
  
 What is it about this flame I label passion
 that burns the world and its newspapers to a crisp?
 How can I call myself hungry for the facts of one kind
 but wince at another? The lover's room may be an
 all-white, tiny room with a view of woods, but why,
 if a well-meaning friend slides a special report
 under my door, do I look for tongs and a furnace?
  
 Because the flame is not only self-infatuated,
 given to burning documents for the sake
 of flaunting its own reds, but also in a state
 of permanent warfare; all worldly
 flare-ups, all currencies not its own, remind it
 that amid the worst incendiary horrors, it goes on
 stoking itself for want of a proper spark.
  
  
     XXIX.
  
 The catechism of the far gone: isn't it too good
 to be coincidental that our eyes have looked at that 
 billboard with the same unqualified disgust?
 Can we ignore the fact that you happened
 to witness the accident only minutes after I did?
 Is there more than just a flimsy link in
 a story jointly loved, a pastime avoided?
  
 No, yes, and by no means. These are the very
 traits which, observed in an enemy, get 
 shelved or denied by their once proud possessor.
 I could pillage an igloo, travel to the torrid
 antipodes and produce thousands like you,
 featured like you, like you in raves and complaints.
 I was bedazzled by a ray of fool's gold.
  
  
     XXX.
  
 Go, tyrant. In your heart will nest
 no more desperate slaves. Come again, days
 of productivity, nights of rest and no nightmares.
 I have spent so much time under the shade
 of your massive umbrella that I will draw it shut
 for a minute to see what I once saw, and what I have
 missed since seeing you. Eyes, look unchained around you.
  
 It is a landscape of moldering stones and bones.
 When the eyes are free to roam, they are not
 so much free as useless--I see a sky of
 fledgling clouds and do nothing to help them, 
 peer into the living record of a severed oak and can
 decipher nothing. Return, dark glasses, come again,
 morbid parasol; only in shade do mountains have features.
  
  
     XXXI.
  
 In the final tally of divine overseers
 who will be ours? Suppose we claim
 the moon, whose bottomless bag of stardust
 enchants a forest of two, softens and 
 shrinks the volume of venomous air
 between us, and lovingly coats all former fears
 with beams of forgetful, nourishing light?
  
 Our watcher is the moon, but only after a brutal
 shake-up is through with her. She has never learned
 the knack of lighting two people at once; instead
 it is always me illumined, you off in the bushes,
 you posed in your halo, me waist-deep in darkness.
 And she is a clumsy goddess for the reason
 that she borrows (poor moon) what light she has from me.
  
  
     XXXII.
  
 Though you are by definition a slippery freedom,
 if forced to freeze you in a single image
 I would call you a beam of light with hidden powers
 to strike and alter forever. Here is a room:
 regard its monotone grimness. Enter your 
 incandescent highness: gladly around you
 objects sparkle, knowing a beam when they see it.
  
 Next to your flawless arc I am a damaged
 bulb in a fleabag hotel, clattering on to reveal
 paintings on velvet and objets trouvs (but where?),
 rattling off to plunge the run-down room into 
 dark desuetude. What if we pooled our forces?
 Would we stand together like heartless neon sculpture
 or deck ourselves in loving chiaroscuro?
  
  
     XXXIII.
  
 Perfect, you say? It is enough to make me perform
 operations on myself in order to test your love:
 taking in the wreckage, you would be forced to say
 "Yes, gouging out one eye makes the other shine
 all the brighter; the smell of your fungus reminds me of summer;
 your leprous stump is a modish charmer
 since, after all, green is my favorite color.
  
 And yet, for all our tirades against deception,
 how easily do we succumb to the lover's flattery,
 and with what treachery. If I am perfect, it is only
 by being perfect that you, myopic, dependable you
 can keep me; so go on, keep on calling me faultless, come on,
 hurry up with my supper, leave me, and come back at midnight,
 but don't come back if you hear a noise in the room.
  
  
     XXXIV.

 
 Still the inveterate skulker, the ghost
 of chaos past, I have come back to the place
 where it all began, where leaving, you gave me
 leave to see you wherever I went--
 in the home, in the wild, in the sky, in the gutter--
 and where columns, scribbled on and abandoned,
 took one look at my raving, and rose again.
  
 Strangest of all is that, given the chance
 to see my subject in the fabulous flesh at last,
 I would flatly refuse. These barren days
 when I heat my room by the fading coals of my goals,
 this ache for an ache is as good as it gets,
 so go on running; I will go on looking for you
 as the willow bends, as the stomach hunts for the ulcer.






What Every Soldier Should Know
 

To yield force to is an act of necessity, not of will;                                                    it is at best an act of prudence.                                                               --Jean-Jacques Rousseau

If you hear gunfire on a Thursday afternoon,
 it could be for a wedding, or it could be for you.
  
 Always enter a home with your right foot;
 the left is for cemeteries and unclean places.
  
 O-guf! Tera armeek is rarely useful.
 It means Stop! Or I'll shoot.

Sabah el khair is effective.
It means Good morning.
  
 Inshallah means Allah be willing.
 Listen well when it is spoken.
  
 You will hear the RPG coming for you.
 Not so the roadside bomb.
  
 There are bombs under the overpasses,
 in trashpiles, in bricks, in cars.
  
 There are shopping carts with clothes soaked
 in foogas, a sticky gel of homemade napalm.
  
 Parachute bombs and artillery shells
 sewn into the carcasses of dead farm animals.
  
 Graffiti sprayed onto the overpasses:
 I will kell you, American.
  
 Men wearing vests rigged with explosives
 walk up, raise their arms and say Inshallah.
  
 There are men who earn eighty dollars
 to attack you, five thousand to kill.
  
 Small children who will play with you,
 old men with their talk, women who offer chai--
  
 and any one of them
 may dance over your body tomorrow.






The Hurt Locker
 

Nothing but hurt left here.
 Nothing but bullets and pain
 and the bled-out slumping
 and all the fucks and goddamns
 and Jesus Christs of the wounded.
 Nothing left here but the hurt.
  
 Believe it when you see it.
 Believe it when a twelve-year-old
 rolls a grenade into the room.
 Or when a sniper punches a hole
 deep into someone's skull.
 Believe it when four men
 step from a taxicab in Mosul
 to shower the street in brass
 and fire. Open the hurt locker
 and see what there is of knives
 and teeth. Open the hurt locker and learn
 how rough men come hunting for souls.






R & R
 

The curve of her hip where I'd lay my head,
 that's what I'm thinking of now, her fingers
 gone slow through my hair on a blue day
 ten thousand miles off in the future somewhere,
 where the beer is so cold it sweats in your hand,
 cool as her kissing you with crushed ice,
 her tongue wet with blackberry and melon.
  
 That's what I'm thinking of now.
 Because I'm all out of adrenaline,
 all out of smoking incendiaries.
  
 Somewhere deep in the landscape of the brain,
 under the skull's blue curving dome--
 that's where I am now, swaying
 in a hammock by the water's edge
 as soldiers laugh and play volleyball
 just down the beach, while others tan
 and talk with the nurses who bring pills
 to help them sleep. And if this is crazy,
 then let this be my sanatorium,
 let the doctors walk among us here
 marking their charts as they will.
  
 I have a lover with hair that falls
 like autumn leaves on my skin.
 Water that rolls in smooth and cool
 as anesthesia. Birds that carry
 all my bullets into the barrel of the sun.

                                       Ashur Square, Mosul
It begins simply with a fist, white-knuckled
 and tight, glossy with sweat. With two eyes
 in a rearview mirror watching for a convoy.
 The radio a soundtrack that adrenaline has
 pushed into silence, replacing it with a heartbeat,
 his thumb trembling over the button.

 A flight of gold, that's what Sefwan thinks
 as he lights a Miami, draws in the smoke
 and waits in his taxi at the traffic circle.
 He thinks of summer 1974, lifting
 pitchforks of grain high in the air,
 the slow drift of it like the fall of Shatha's hair,
 and although it was decades ago, he still loves her,
 remembers her standing at the canebrake
 where the buffalo cooled shoulder-deep in the water,
 pleased with the orange cups of flowers he brought her,
 and he regrets how so much can go wrong in a life,
 how easily the years slip by, light as grain, bright
 as the street's concussion of metal, shrapnel
 traveling at the speed of sound to open him up
 in blood and shock, a man whose last thoughts
 are of love and wreckage, with no one there
 to whisper him gone.

 Sgt. Ledouix of the National Guard
 speaks but cannot hear the words coming out,
 and it's just as well his eardrums ruptured
 because it lends the world a certain calm,
 though the traffic circle is filled with people
 running in panic, their legs a blur
 like horses in a carousel, turning
 and turning the way the tires spin
 on the Humvee flipped to its side,
 the gunner's hatch he was thrown from
 a mystery to him now, a dark hole
 in metal the color of sand, and if he could,
 he would crawl back inside of it,
 and though his fingertips scratch at the asphalt
 he hasn't the strength to move:
 shrapnel has torn into his ribcage
 and he will bleed to death in ten minutes,
 but he finds himself surrounded by a strange
 beauty, the shine of light on the broken,
 a woman's hand touching his face, tenderly
 the way his wife might, amazed to find
 a wedding ring on his crushed hand,
 the bright gold sinking in flesh
 going to bone.

 Rasheed passes the bridal shop
 on a bicycle, with Sefa beside him,
 and just before the air ruckles and breaks
 he glimpses the sidewalk reflections
 in the storefront glass, men and women
 walking and talking, or not, an instant
 of clarity, just before each of them shatters
 under the detonation's wave,
 as if even the idea of them were being
 destroyed, stripped of form,
 the blast tearing into the manikins
 who stood as though husband and wife
 a moment before, who cannot touch
 one another, who cannot kiss,
 who now lie together in glass and debris,
 holding one another in their half-armed embrace,
 calling this love, if this is all there will ever be.

 The civil affairs officer, Lt. Jackson, stares
 at his missing hands, which make
 no sense to him, no sense at all, to wave
 these absurd stumps held in the air
 where just a moment before he'd blown bubbles
 out the Humvee window, his left hand holding the bottle,
 his right hand dipping the plastic ring in soap,
 filling the air behind them with floating spheres
 like the oxygen trails of deep ocean divers,
 something for the children, something beautiful,
 translucent globes with their iridescent skins
 drifting on vehicle exhaust and the breeze
 that might lift one day over the Zagros mountains,
 that kind of hope, small globes which may have
 astonished someone on the sidewalk
 seven minutes before Lt. Jackson blacks out
 from blood loss and shock, with no one there to bandage
 the wounds that would carry him home.

 Nearby, an old woman cradles her grandson,
 whispering, rocking him on her knees
 as though singing him to sleep, her hands
 wet with their blood, her black dress
 soaked in it as her legs give out
 and she buckles with him to the ground.
 If you'd asked her forty years earlier
 if she could see herself an old woman
 begging by the roadside for money, here,
 with a bomb exploding at the market
 among all these people, she'd have said
 To have your heart broken one last time
 before dying, to kiss a child given sight
 of a life he could never live? It's impossible,
 this isn't the way we die.

 And the man who triggered the button,
 who may have invoked the Prophet's name,
 or not--he is obliterated at the epicenter,
 he is everywhere, he is of all things,
 his touch is the air taken in, the blast
 and wave, the electricity of shock,
 his is the sound the heart makes quick
 in the panic's rush, the surge of blood
 searching for light and color, that sound
 the martyr cries filled with the word
 his soul is made of, Inshallah.

 Still hanging in the air over Ashur Square,
 the telephone line snapped in two, crackling
 a strange incantation the dead hear
 as they wander confused amongst one another,
 learning each other's names, trying to comfort
 the living in their grief, to console
 those who cannot accept such random pain,
 speaking habib softly, one to another there
 in the rubble and debris, habib
 over and over, that it might not be forgotten.





Five Landscapes
 

One    
  
 Green moves through the tops of trees and grows
 lighter greens as it recedes, each of which includes a grey, and among the
 greys, or beyond them, waning finely into white, there is one white spot,
 absolute; it could be an egret or perhaps a crane at the edge of the water
 where it meets a strip of sand.



Two    
  
 There is a single, almost dazzling white spot of a white house out loud
 against the fields, and the forest in lines
 receding, rises,
 and then planes. Color,
  
 in pieces or entire; its presence
 veneers over want; in all its moving parts, it could be something else
  
 half-hidden by trees. Conservatory, gloriette, gazebo, or bandshell,
 a door ajar on the top floor.



Three    
 The trees are half air. They fissure the sky; you could count the leaves, pare
 time
                               defined as that which,
                               no matter how barely, exceeds
                               what the eye could grasp in a glance;
 intricate woods opening out before a body of water edged
 with a swatch of meadow where someone has hung a bright white sheet
 out in the sun to dry.
  
    
  
Four    
  
 A white bird in a green forest is a danger to itself. Stands out. Shines. Builds
 up inside. Like it's dangerous to cry while driving or to talk to strangers or to 
 stare at the sun and a thousand other things
                                                                                    we've always heard
 people who wear white see better at night, though they gradually lose this
 trait as they age.
  
  

Five    
  
 The air across the valley is slightly hazy though thinning though patches
 remain between the groves of trees that edge a clearing in which stands a
 single house. A child in a white t-shirt has just walked out of the house and
 is turning to walk down to the lake.

Lost in Translation
 

The kinship with those humans
 who speak directly to me
 is webbed to the ceiling.
 An economy of satellites, a cosmos,
 where revision we think
 comes without the benefit
 of our witness. A peculiar time
 when stars with modest faces 
 sleep in enormity and mirror
 death like a child's infirmity that
 despite socio-economics
 is still an illness,
 definitive as fading paint
 grossing a distant
 understanding from a stain
 pooled from its center
 resonant of some terrific
 nucleus making sense
 of its own words
 with the strangest electricity.






Timbre
 

I can't tell you I had climbed for hours on
 ledges and crawled through gaps in the earth.
  
 My hands negotiating 
 through the teeth of the palisade
 lipped under the vineyard of temperate skies.
  
 And I can't tell you that I came
 onto a ledge within the shelter of a granite roof,
 ceaselessly carved by centuries of dripping water.
  
 Feeding from pooled water and singular sunlight
 a chamisa plant sat like a chopped wood.
  
 The opposite end of root
 speaking for its entirety through 
 silence and color.
  
 And I wish I could tell you that at the moment
 I met its splitting scent under the enormity of stone
 your name appeared in my throat with clarity.
  
 And I wish we were old
 and in front of a grand painting,
 a picture or postcard of 
 Picasso's "Guernica perhaps.
 It would be then that I would tell you
 Picasso once said that it took him his entire life
 to learn how to paint like a child.
  
 It would be through these words
 that would make you understand
 the same clarity that pooled over me
 on that ledge those years before
 when as a young man I extended 
 like direction, like timbre itself
 for a dying song that echoed your name.

The Abuelita Poem
 

I. SKIN & CORN
  
 Her brown skin glistens as the sun
 pours through the kitchen window
 like gold leche. After grinding
 the nixtamal, a word so beautifully ethnic
 it must not only be italicized but underlined
 to let you, the reader, know you've encountered
 something beautifully ethnic, she kneads
 with the hands of centuries-old ancestor
 spirits who magically yet realistically posses her
 until the masa is smooth as a lowrider's
 chrome bumper. And I know she must do this
 with care because it says so on a website
 that explains how to make homemade corn tortillas.
 So much labor for this peasant bread,
 this edible art birthed from Abuelitas's
 brown skin, which is still glistening
 in the sun.
       

II. APOLOGY
  
 Before she died I called my abuelita
 grandma. I cannot remember
 if she made corn tortillas from scratch
 but, O, how she'd flip the factory fresh
 El Milagros (Quality Since 1950)
 on the burner, bathe them in butter
 & salt for her grandchildren.
 How she'd knead the buttons
 on the telephone, order me food
 from Pizza Hut. I assure you,
 gentle reader, this was done
 with the spirit of Mesoamrica
 ablaze in her fingertips.






MyKillAdoreHer
 

          
          That Lucia broke the machine twice in one week was evidence enough. He also offered this--she's no longer automatic, her stitches are crooked and once another seamstress found Lucia's "lost sewing patterns in the trash. The security guard half listened as Lucia gathered her things. Then the manager turned directly to her--what is it with you? We give you work, put money in your pocket. She put on her best disappointed face as they escorted her past rows of itchy throats, bowed heads, the refrain of needle through fabric. Every day Elena counts pig. A pageant of molded plastic rolling down the conveyor belt. The task: grab Miss Piggy, pull gown over snout, fasten two tiny buttons, grab another. With each doll Elena's hands grow stiffer. Her feet grow heavy as the concrete below. Dolls spit at her, or maybe this is imagined, but the ache in her legs might be real. The supervisor brushes against her back when he patrols the floor. After standing for hours, the room begins to blur. Her mouth opens like an empty wallet as naked dolls march on.                What will settle in, what will rise from the lungs of girls who still burn weeks after detox treatment at a local clinic. Speak of headaches, blurred vision, diarrhea. How they suck air thick with sulfuric acid. Acetone working past unfiltered exhaust systems and through their livers. Most return to work despite doctors' orders. Back inside, the tin roof and their steady perspiration remind them they're still alive--together one breathing, burning machine.                                                    Like Celia's pockets, there's nothing but lint here. Lint & dead machines. The sound of layoffs & profit margins. Yesterday this department droned an unsynchronized rhythm of coughing girls tethered to well-lubed motors. Row after row of pre-asthmatic lungs. Black hair buried under perpetual white. The decision was made across the border, he tells them. Nothing I can do about it. Sometimes Celia would imagine the whole place caught inside a tiny globe. Something she could pick up. Shake.                           A perpetual conveyor, he patrols her mouth. The sound of unfiltered white. Breathing margins. The task: grab Elena's hands. Pull. Fasten. He also offered crooked patterns. Put money in her hair. That Lucia broke. Was evidence enough? Molded vision as a refrain. An empty wallet will rise. Speak. How they exhaust systems. Despite the blurred other, the ache might be real. Something she could pick up. Across the border, nothing I can imagine.

Snapshots with Wide Apertures Shown on the Road
 

1
  
 This one's on Route 80 south of Water's End, Arizona, speeding
 anywhere else when I'm tired
 of reading the yellow dash-and-dash, highway's old adage.
 Sunglasses coaxed
 yellows to reds, though there are none where I look
 into the camera.
 Behind me, a blur of roadside cactus called
 "succulents,
 for the moisture they save for years.
 The sky cut from indigo to blue to white until
 I wished for the sunset's truncations to stay there,
 thinking, too, that the verge of its curve
 could flirt me into
 the absolute.
  
  
 2
  
 Moving on, in Bangkok, I'm always crouching in these,
 wanting to keep my head
 lower than his
 to show I know
 he's Mother's father.
  
 Asked, on going in, not to say anything
 if he brought up the distant
 old dealings, metallic shrillings
 of long-dead women,
 asked to ignore what they'd do for him,
 offerings he could almost eat a meal on.
  
 And this from the aunt who was asked to leave
 the family when she was young,
 "for the sake of the children,
 drawing the bad lot.
 No one told me why.
  
 That's my foot in the foreground.
 That was the daylight's assignment
 of unwavering white, the background.
  
 These are only the circumstances. As for an end to the glare
 getting the last word in,
 there was none.

 He'd set the machine on the tripod himself,
 return to read the newspaper, wait for the click,
 and want to keep it,
 the stop-time, that is,
 the pretending to read the newspaper.
 Held half in the shadow fans of the palm tree,
 half in a browbeat of sun.
 So that the machine had to catch him quickly, the clarity,
 the shot of his legs as
  
 suddenly: brown leather sheaves holding bone.

 Say the moment arrives
 at the frame, and she who is about to enter
 the picture approaches.
 At the end of the road trip, she turns back
 in the hopes of memorizing what's been passed,
 the colors that changed, the mirror-winks,
 the real moisture, invisible, along side mirage.
  
 His face was a once-darker shade of dust in his country.
 Some days he'd set the aperture, the opening,
 as wide as he could,
 to ruin the picture, to let all the light in.
  






On Pattern
 

For Grandfather, in Bangkok
I can tell you, sweeping the several jigsaw lizards
          away from your casket, away from their expert
                    invasions, kneeling by the order of our births
 alongside the mother-of-pearl mosaics,
          the family at your death keeps to form,
                   having to act out that love of endings.
  
 I can say the little I know of how you lived
          is your patient gaze in old photographs,
                    surrounded by three generations, most of the spindling
 offspring back from the States or Australia or wherever
           they'd been taken, children barely known but abided
                    on holidays. Today I'm told we have to place
  
 pennies in the dead man's mouth
          to remind us of the portions
                   left behind.
 You pay the debt,
            someone says, you give your something solid back,
                      push your currency up against the open,
 
up against the father tongue. It's the formal
             silence we love, the hush that's planned,
                       the good answer,
 monks, boyish and newly shorn, who know
          to whip your burial cloth exactly three times
                    over the altar flame to purify countless threads.
  
 Who know when to kneel, when to back away
          from the casket. The casket itself carved
                    patiently, inlaid with the images,
 portions left behind of silver
           shrunken disciples, each framed to each then
                              framed again by
  
 squares of alabaster scrollwork
                    whittled into black wood:
                              the whole teak surface worried,
 Grandfather, with carpenter's gold,
                   splintered,
                            then resplintered, puzzled with lapis.
  
 The eastern window's been slivered open,
          to make the sun stab
                   the craftmen's metallic fretwork.
 The mourners too,
            suddenly embossed, become dozens shifting
                     to kneel. When a few clouds
  
 eclipse the sun, wiping away the borders,
            the frame and scrimshaw,
                     so that we stand
 briefly
          in the room's darkened largeness,
                    next to me someone whispers,
  
 how your vessel is rented,
          a work
              to be given back.






The Packards
 

The heretic's papers were spread out on the armchair
  
 *
  
 At the window, fruit of
 spring,
 you can bite again
 against the weather
  
 weapons I let fall outside
 pharmacies, drowsy and bright
  
 *
  
 Air comes to the confused bends in the rail where
 in a mirror lush food puts you
 out for 1 night. Then it is the weather
 at noon that prepares to spring on you
 in December, a month ago
 blowing the lights out with a sob
  
 *
  
 On long walks
 a poorly tuned radio
  
 in my world     my  head
 with a star attached
 swims back
  
 *
  
 Useless--it was the wrong tree
 but the flag in the school
 breeze scans the men and women on my sleeve
  
 *
  
 A . . . turned her head towards the open window
 of the shop. The voice was low.
 It did not sound like a man's voice.
  
 *
  
 Eighteen trees starting from the end
 of the block
 outside the pharmacy, with beards today
 to the subway, station, steps
  
 of a land-post
  
 "screen my heart
  
 *
  
 Under the dog's neck
 When the radio went on. Doctor
 He moved his face away to
 The pines, a deep thought.
 The trees, for a few seconds they were
 Real to him, his ears stopped
 The river where no life could touch him.
 He pressed his ear against the cold
 Shrill whine. Dusty legs
 Wondered why they had sent him
 To this place, they feared the cobwebs
 Were swaying on the unique bed.
 Mown grass has the peppery smell
 Of being crowded together on 
 This bed, and a feeling of dark apprehension
 Came over him. I watch a horse
 Gather speed, look at a movie
 With you. Your words are the grime
 On the sidestreet, down towards the river,
 Yellow in the cold glare of floodlights
 In the yard. In the middle of the line
 I repeated your instructions,
 I puzzled with a stranger does to you
 In a dream. Chunks
 Of meat are marked
 Cars following me as a thought follows
 Us from the motel. Father 
 Has read these latinized titles
 Aloud, but failed
 And gave place to some smooth yellowish substance,
 Checked by no one as he rubbed the sponge-
 Like doll. It had some hair
 But its legs did not tempt me,
 The sponginess gave place to the tubes themselves.
 Colleagues efficiently solve an aggressive
 Blank to be expected as we sat at the breakfast 
 Table near the door. A tree blocked 
 Her hair spread and fell over the wheel.
 But the living room shows its trimming of thick straw--
 The bad mechanic sets the bread on the white cloth






Gout
 

He changes into a bird, and that's
 the only difference. Rain
 on the improved sidewalk seems
 inspired after so much heat.
 Look at the objects
 that have already wilted and died.
 Someone is losing hair trying
 to penetrate the meaning of death--rather
 language which postpones dying
 is inventing a drug to keep us alive.
 Being similar never made this body more true. Bills
 for electricity and answering
 service are burning inside the hearth.
 My dream, to have a hearth and
 set an example for fading
 youth. The conspicuous peacock
 neither turns nor changes,
 yet suddently loses its feathers, buckles
 in the dust and dies. The
 meaning is as fantastic as any truth. Language
 invents a painkilling drug for restoring youth--an
 occasion inviting feelings which
 jolt and never subside. I mean
 he is dying again, slowly, as he gains time.

                       through the spirit in your voice
  
         when you say
  
                                          "it was great!
  
 to convey
  
                             what happened
  
                                             in that moment
  
       & it was great
  
                                         not only that
  
                               it was terrific, & interesting too
                   
                                                                               it was nice
  
             & I had a good time doing it. I had fun.
  
 You should have been there. Not only that, it was beautiful.
 It was inspiring.






To Frank Parker
 

Forty years ago we were here
where we are now,
the same erotic May-wind blew
the trees from there to here--

the same tang of metal in the mouth,
the dirt-pierced wood of Cambridge.

Sometimes
you are so much younger than your face,
I know I am seeing your old face--
the hampered Henry James
mockery of your stutter,
your daily fear of choking, dying-- 
in school, loudness not words
gave character to the popular boy's voice.

We looked in the face of the other
for what we were.
Once in the common record heat
of June in Massachusetts,
we sat by the school pool
talking out the soul-lit night
and listened to the annual 
unsuffering voice of the tree frogs,
green, aimless and wakened:
"I want to write. "I want to paint.

Was it I wanted you to paint? . . .

Age is another species,
the nothing-voiced. The very old
made grandfather look vulgarly young,
when he drove me to feed them at their home.

We will have their thoughtful look,
as if uncertain
who had led our lives.

The past changes more than the present.

Wherever there's grass, there is pollen,
the asthma of high summer--
the inclination to drink, not eat . . .

"Let us go into the garden,
or shall I say the yard?
Why have you said this twice, Frank?
The garden has no flowers,
or choice of color,
the thick wet clump of grass
thins to red clay,
like an Indian's shaved and tufted head,
or yours--
we once claimed alliance with the Redskin.
What is won by surviving,
if two glasses of red wine are poison?

                                                 to insert myself into 
                                             the fragile extension
                                       of space between us
                                              to get something done.

                                                      thinking after you.

Let Us Sample Protection Together
 

When I was little I cut off the heads 
 of many lords. I can't count on the energy
 that took to rise in me at will, but I've
 strengthened my ability to make a 
 stand-firm surface. A steady gaze will drive
 conflicted information away, back to the 
 abyss from whence it came, but I'll be right
 here the morning after, wracked in a 
 private shame too awful to admit and
 of no consequence at all. I work very hard
 not to let myself go. Any channel
 can tell. Due process appears in beauty
 and misgiving at once; an agility
 borne from creative malice, a benign
 insecurity. The plain truth: I forget
 the curtains are open sometimes and the
 hands wander. The room stares back from its things:
 They understand the end of the world, will
 not waste time feeling your pain, and every-
 thing tragic in between need not be known.
 I don't want love or remorse to follow
 I want them in the way, things to burst through
 corollaries to be roped and tackled
 by surprise, get killed, and thank you. One fate
 transforms into another, but I won't
 touch that bandaged story. I won't belong
 to this scripted conversation, though I
 may play along. Identity theft accepting
 renewal orders, copycat pre-emptive attacks
 an obscure murder string on the public
 glide by sight, the victim a John doughnut
 pining for leadership from the passenger seat.
 The threat of meaning reassures: I know
 it's being made for me. Am I supposed
 to believe we're receiving information?
 Can I defect back to curiosity 
 in the moonlight, stone rabbit? Hit on by
 Echo, I go cold for the love of my
 own exile, and while I hope, my flesh
 explodes into an arrangement of stars
 pestered by darkness. Those aren't birds you
 hear, just their corresponding holes in the sky.
 All the bottled water isn't fooling anyone.

Riptide

 Just say you
 dream fires each
 night smoothing each
 collapsing page from
  
 the throat talking

 in a series

And move and hold back
 entering by the highroad through the words
 and fall like a person hit by sleep
 arriving at the place without light
  
 And fall like a dead body falls
 and find there the great enemy
 and come to a tower all of stones
 such that through it the earth opens
  
 We pass between the martyrs and the high walls
 even up there water is pouring out
 then turning and fording again
 sling the noose from the roof of the house
  
 And each and every vapor spent
 over winning and not losing
 in which it stands caught out
 fleet then catapults like a stone
  
 Filling our view
 whereupon another valley is revealed

          Here the subject thinks "there could be flowers or "the water was a bit disturbed when the ring fell in. All that, painted from said things, pleases it. That explains all things except for Ovid's exile which we will probably never understand. That adds to our sense of fragility, confirms the order in which we read. You still have the right to bear arms, "thing and joy, the anxious doubt that was once written about.   There are several versions of the story where she is transformed into a swallow, flies around a pillar.     And do you find the rhyme? It originally meant spoken, the sentence, but spoken. Flight, interchangeable with fate. As for myself, I can't begin to approach the woods with it. The words of its condition.

from "In Our Own Backyard
 

You can't imagine what it's like here. In her past
 life, she was a clandestine operator in ancient
 Egypt. In a past life she had her heart ripped out,
 ritual sacrifice. We all know what that
 means, right, to have your heart ripped out. Torn
 from the body, one's "own body, alive and torn.
  
  
 The unspeaking speaker. The man coughs.
 Orientation. Two bells, a motorcar on the 
 street, on-lookers. H22-3416. Men, maybe
 four, inside. Vast numbers of people, faces
 turned to the east. Four nurses holding four
 swaddled babes, four bottles.
  
  
 Six men walking forward on a country road
 all wearing suits, coats, vests and ties. Upon
 his shoulders, one of the men carries a man with
 no legs. The man with no legs is wearing a
 bathrobe. In a landscape a train passes from
 top right to bottom left. People are packed inside
 as well as on the roof and holding on at the sides.
  
  
 One man, naked, his back turned to the
 window, light on inside. A bird in a cage hung
 on a hook at the top left-hand corner of the
 window. A man in profile to the left, eyes closed
 mouth open wide, singing. Or thought he was
 singing. He did. Or we did. The back of a chair and
 three tall mirrors. At their focal point a woman
 stands, arms akimbo. She's wearing evening dress
 black high heels, long white gown, long black
 gloves, necklace, earrings.
  
  
 Outside the bakery, a horse-drawn hearse
 approaches. A woman in an apron tests green grapes
 eating them before placing bunches in a wooden
 crate. Inside a Quonset hut, there's a long
 table with men sitting in chairs writing or paying
 attention to one man standing at the table, hands
 in the pockets of his jumpsuit. Shirtless men seated
 on the floor, some on towels or blankets, are doing
 exercises. Friday afternoon, cold grim day. We meet
 in the museum, at a picture called "Birmingham.

 On the first page of his diary: Father!
There are no living atoms

 Unshrouded, revolves in sunlight

 Of a pre-existent stillness

Mazed Interior
 

1.
  
 Cogs & cogs that cannot turn
          to recognitions: such dogs in the dark noonday!
  
 As if the tongue told & tolled
 Among
          the melancholic arcades.
  
 Where the moods advance toward the modes.
  
 Time to try the knot, the Not
 Or to be caught
 Forever in nerve-traceries of Beauty . . .
  
 Unstrung, the structure is sound.
  
  
 2.
  
 Detour to far fires.
  
 To be counted missing . . . in a toroidal space
 That mimics the shape of its container, speech.
  
 The passive of, the possessive of--
  
 Measureless intent, blue almost black, the picture
          below the voice.
 Less a name than a substance
  
 Coming to stillness, star-inhabited.
 Less a substance than a sigh.
  
  
 3.
  
 Awaited, thou, unawaited. Divided here. O
          then
 Opened as earthen
          ring, cave-recorded.
  
 A mazed interior. Self-similar aisles of isles, pouring
          form from form.
  
 Lastness as device. Aligned as measurements (letters)--
  
          as sensitive, all-too-sensitive compass
          needles forever seeking
          the frozen pole, the zero.

 No atmosphere is sufficient.
  
 An embryo in the brain is not yet breathing.
  
 There, the labor
 Of the living rock, where an ache, or bruise-ember
          will be discovered.
  
 Scored
          for Theremin, or permanently scarred.
  
 Where shadows point: Mad lengthening to made, as unmade
          scaffolding.
  
          Thus, repetition, resisted
          is the register of thought.
 Now here, even as staves are falling, another story
  
 --intervallic--cannot be told--that is, besieged
  
 As the heart encaged in bone.
  
 The animal calls long long, disconsolate
 In its hollow mountain.
  
  
 5. 
  
 Neither nor nor neither, time builds
 Its twelve tones between round & ruined.
  
 --as the roots of the sunflower, arrayed over earthlight.
  
 Routes unreturning / term without terminus. Riding as reading
 Migrates
          underground.
  
 Writing as the righting
 Of fallen
          angles, of tangles of Accident--
  
          arrives riven, a body never to be / surveyed.
  
 Abandoned in a wintry field, the sum of its travels
  
 --its hunting the same as its haunting.

 Sewing up the kinks in this film, I'm
 Trying to! I'm trying to burn a light
 Between, There's a light and I cable
 my voice on it but it rips when I trace
 Anything! WORKS ON PAPER, THE SHIP
 OF DEATH "Oh build it! Sings the
 Heart, "My coat would be so bloodied
 I could wiggle out of my coat!

A Story About Chicken Soup
 

In my grandmother's house there was always chicken soup
 And talk of the old country--mud and boards,
 Poverty,
 The snow falling down the necks of lovers.
  
 Now and then, out of her savings
 She sent them a dowry. Imagine
 The rice-powdered faces!
 And the smell of the bride, like chicken soup.
  
 But the Germans killed them.
 I know it's in bad taste to say it,
 But it's true. The Germans killed them all.
  
                             *
  
 In the ruins of Berchtesgaden
 A child with yellow hair
 Ran out of a doorway.
  
 A German girl-child--
 Cuckoo, all skin and bones--
 Not even enough to make chicken soup.
 She sat by the stream and smiled.
  
 Then as we splashed in the sun
 She laughed at us.
 We had killed her mechanical brothers,
 So we forgave her.
  
                             *
  
 The sun is shining.
 The shadows of the lovers have disappeared.
 They are all eyes; they have some demand on me--
 They want me to be more serious than I want to be.
  
 They want me to stick in their mudhole
 Where no one is elegant.
 They want me to wear old clothes,
 They want me to be poor, to sleep in a room with many others--
  
 Not to walk in the painted sunshine
 To a summer house,
 But to live in the tragic world forever.






American Poetry
 

Whatever it is, it must have
 A stomach that can digest
 Rubber, coal, uranium, moons, poems.
  
 Like the shark it contains a shoe.
 It must swim for miles through the desert
 Uttering cries that are almost human.






Walt Whitman at Bear Mountain
 

                  . . . life which does not give the preference to any other life, of any                   previous period, which therefore prefers its own existence . . .                                                                               Ortega y Gasset
 
 Neither on horseback nor seated,
 But like himself, squarely on two feet,
 The poet of death and lilacs
 Loafs by the footpath. Even the bronze looks alive
 Where it is folded like cloth. And he seems friendly.
  
 "Where is the Mississippi panorama
 And the girl who played the piano?
 Where are you, Walt?
 The Open Road goes to the used-car lot.
  
 "Where is the nation you promised?
 These houses build of wood sustain
 Colossal snows,
 And the light above the street is sick to death.
  
 "As for the people--see how they neglect you!
 Only a poet pauses to read the inscription.
  
 "I am here, he answered.
 "It seems you have found me out.
 Yet did I not warn you that it was Myself
 I advertised? Were my words not sufficiently plain?
  
 I gave no prescriptions,
 And those who have taken my moods for prophecies
 Mistake the matter.
 Then, vastly amused--"Why do you reproach me?
 I freely confess I am wholly disreputable.
 Yet I am happy, because you found me out.
 A crocodile in wrinkled metal loafing . . .
  
 Then all the realtors,
 Pickpockets, salesmen and the actors performing
 Official scenarios,
 Turned a deaf ear, for they had contracted
 American dreams.
  
 But the man who keeps a store on a lonely road,
 And the housewife who knows she's dumb,
 And the earth, are relieved.
  
 All that grave weight of America
 Cancelled! Like Greece and Rome.
 The future in ruins!
 The castles, the prisons, the cathedrals
 Unbuilding, and roses
 Blossoming from the stones that are not there . . .
  
 The clouds are lifting from the high Sierras,
 The Bay mists clearing,
 And the angel in the gate, the flowering plum,
 Dances like Italy, imagining red.






Vivaldi
 

When I met Vivaldi it was dark,
 a ragman lashed his horse's bells,
 streets tilted into slow wind tunnels,
  
 no, it was another night, in winter,
 snow as soft as opium, two winoes wassailed
 down an alley through a milk truck's ruts,
  
 in the subways a violin was whistling
 down chrome tracks, past cobalt semaphores,
 rats and pennies underneath the 3rd rail . . .
  
 Has it never been so quiet that you've heard
 the manhole covers rumble when the El goes overhead?
 Icicles growing? Could you tell the difference
 between the sound of filaments in light bulbs
 burning down, and a dulcimer played in a padded cell?
  
 A meager music hovers everywhere: 
 at mouths of drains, echoing stairwells
 where girls in muslin disappear
 whispering "allegro.
  
 When I closed my eyes,
 less than a ghost,
 Vivaldi cupped a mouth harp
 like a match against the wind.






The Knife-Sharpeners Daughter
 

A drain spout splashing
 rusty stains on concrete,
  
 the taste of doorknobs
 you kiss before squinting
  
 through the musty keyhole
 at the knife-sharpener's daughter,
  
 while across the city
 the knife-sharpener
  
 limps his pushcart
 with its dinging axles,
  
 with its screeching whetstone
 up wet alleys
  
 crying: scissors! knives! axes!






Traveling Salesman
 

        He finds himself stepping off the bus in some burg he's already bored with. Picking his teeth for 200 miles--here's where he spits the toothpick out. Past Holiday Inn the neighborhoods get dark. All-night laundromats where women with circles under their eyes press laundered underwear, warm as bread, against their sinuses. Finally, he's signing the register at a funeral home where he knows no one, but is mistaken for a long-lost friend of the deceased, for someone who has dislocated his life to make the hazardous journey on a night when the dead man's own children have avoided him. Once again instinct has taken him where he's needed; where the unexpected transforms routine into celebration. He kneels before the corpse, striking his forehead against the casket.





Night of Voyeurs
 

It's more than silhouettes tonight,
 every window in the city lit,
 shades lifted, curtains open.
 As one suspected, the dark buildings
 full of lovers, undressing
 beneath light bulbs, before mirrors.
 Men & women, men & men, women & women, embracing.
 Even the loners visible, flickered
 by single candles, touching
 places they've usually chosen to keep secret.
 So much nakedness!
 And the streets empty
 except for the newsboys moving through shadows,
 leafless trees snatching underclothes
 out of wind, the El clattering
 above the roofs
 like a strip of blue movie.





Vase Poppies
 

Lavenderish dusk
 strapped for stays,
 pomegranates under the rubberband
 chucked for a glass Oz,
  
 letdown
 splayed by the pillar-shelves
 to page upon the Ottoman:
  
 his talk has wrought suit
 amid citrus gapes
 and pall dunked in the bowl
 and grated sage
 or cleaved clear paleo-pines.
  
 Postgeist, upcast
 California upon weed,
 what banker yields
 so fragrant a cant
 as this vagrant cant?






Blank
 

When I came to my mother's house 
the day after she had died 
it was already a museum of her 
unfinished gestures. The mysteries 
from the public library, due
in two weeks. The half-eaten square 
of lasagna in the fridge.

The half-burned wreckage 
of her last cigarette, 
and one red swallow 
of wine in a lipsticked 
glass beside her chair.

Finally, a blue Bic 
on a couple of downs 
and acrosses left blank 
in the Sunday crossword, 
which actually had the audacity 
to look a little smug 
at having, for once, won.





Confessional Poem
 

You had a woodchuck and an opium ball.
The one ate through the furniture, 
the other sat in its cage depressing me.
Now the woodchuck sheds its skin.
I have a cow behind the Dollar Bin.

You shouldn't drink diarrhea
unless you bring enough for everybody.
Turn it into a teaching moment.
Asian-American Students for Christ 
have the room until 2:30.

Rumi says no donkey is a virgin,
no, nor any beast that bites the grass.
Maybe it sounds better in Persian.
An unseen force propels the carts
across the Whole Foods parking lot.

The woodchuck hasn't been born yet
I'd rather keep than you as a pet.
You'll sleep on wood shavings, I'll comb your pelt.
That animal loved you, his captor,
whom he hated. I know just how he felt.






I Did This to My Vocabulary
 

The moon is my alibi. My tenders throw hissy fits.
My scalp's at the foot of the precipice.
My lume is spento, there's a creep in my cellar.
You can stand under my umbrella, Ella.

Who put pubic hair on my headphones?
Who put the ram in Ramallah?
I'm just sitting here spinning my spinning wheels--
where are the snow tires of tomorrow?

The llama is burning! My heart is an ovary!
Let's chase dawn's tail across state lines,
sing "Crimson and Clover over and overy,
till wonders are taken for road signs.

My fish, fast and loose, shoot fish in a kettle.
The boys like the girls who like heavy metal.
On Sabbath, on Slayer, on Maiden and Venom, 
on Motrhead, Leppard, and Zeppelin, and Mayhem . . .






We Have the Technology
 

By the sparklet of certain ciliates cesium 
    practices its cricket song.

Am I supposed to be impressed? My smoothie 
    comes with gps. 

Take a left at that crustacean. You--yes, you, 
    with the crisis Isis eyes.

By Odin's beard, this is snowier than usual. We can 
    always burn the first folio. 

Go bug a dandelion. You'll have 
    the elephant of surprise.






Entering the Ouse
 

First the bad boots
give up their strength, then the toes lift
their anchors. The ankle
bones are broken, 
and so on, until the bladder lets go, without 
shame, and the genital 
organ washes away, the ovum 
and her fertile signals. A proxy pain 
stands in for the larger
intangible.

Has nothing to do
with tufts of snow blown upon
the unforgiving surface,
but how I mistook the beauty of those particle
deaths, their of-the-world
stardom, as a kind of metaphysical river,
that if I looked long enough,
with enough reverence...

Let my waist, bled numb, stand in
for that miscalculation. And the severed 
friendships in the current's wake, the bloom
blown off the stricken
self. I saw formal water,
knowing my body wanted to go there.
My only child. How
I've betrayed you.






Lark & Merlin
 

                         1

a wren,
perched on a hawthorn
low enough to skip
the scalping winds,
sang a scalpel song

seafrets drift
sheer along shorelines

listening to hail spray glass
and wind
and a waitress laugh
in a cafe without customers
I fell to fell thinking

                         * * * 

a sullen light through vapor
thins a line of hills

the edge of everything is nothing 
whipped by wind

watched on a webcam
bound to a bedpost 
gag on my shaft

rose blush of road-kill rabbit 
insides out on tarmacadam

                         * * * 

cumulus in a tarn
its fast shadow
flees far hills

a wave of sleek grass
skiffs mist 

my hand thought of her 
a photograph 
waiting to happen

                         * * * 

this come-to-kill wind
rips at the root 

here she comes
and there she goes
rushes bow to rime

I should shut down
close off
stop 
if I could

how quick the mist 
how quick

                         2

my lover, the assassin, 
is beautiful

she has come to kill me 
and I concur

just now she sleeps
but when she wakes I'm dead

her eyelids flitter 
as I prepare her potions, 
her delicious poisons 

                         * * * 

as she flew past a lick 
of her melodic nectar 
stuck to my wing, 
making flight, for an instant, 
sticky 

but nothing preening couldn't fix

                         * * * 

she asked about my heart,
its evasive flight;
but can I trust her with its secrets?

and does the merlin, in fast pursuit of its prey,
tell the fleeing lark
it is enamored of its song? 

or the singing lark turn tail 
and fly into the falcon's talons?

                         * * * 

my heart, the cartographer, charts 
to the waterline, 
is swept back as the tide turns 
wiping the map blank, wave 
after moon-drawn wave

but it beats, my heart, 
of its own volition

a lark sings winds rush reeds
walking home I stride these tracks 
with her tread

the blurred thumbprint
of a smudged moon

                         3

it has gone on for days

strumming rushes
taking up tales, 
taking them on

the fall of my foot, 
on tufts

a stroke of light along a law lain in under a long cloud

I accrete--lichen to limestone
sphagnum to peat 

                         * * * 

late shadows gather in the dark

words unwrite
as they are written
unspeak
as they are spoken

songs sprung
from heart and lung
to tongue

unsung

                         * * *

drunk winds stumble over shuffling roofs
shake his sleep who dreams
a lost love
will not 
let 
go

recurring swirls
of old gold
blown light 

you can't help 
but be in it 

as it opens 
and falls back on itself
unfolds and unsays

I do not want to die
without writing the unwritten

pleasure of water






Sorehead
 

I was arrested because of that internal memo, 
and ended up in a cell, then I was told to sit 
with the police and the local bigwigs. 
In the hushed and fast darkening room they said 
someone--someone--had reduced the safety margin 
on the airport risk factor, and I got the blame. 
The sky that day was a pale, clear blue, but 
that was happening outside, and far away. 

The cop on duty would not open the tomb 
of the deported--sorry, departed--and as usual 
he had a story. Every movie, he said, depends 
on a script, and the narrative grows out of 
market research: a set of standard deviations. Art? 
What would they know? Open the tomb, and let me in.






Htel de Ville
 

The kids should visit a history museum 
in their senior year, to understand disgrace as 
one form of Clinton's victory. On the other hand 
the European Community foreign debt gives 
everybody bad dreams. So we do need to solve 
the problem of students reading difficult things 
that will lead them astray: why did Rimbaud 
turn from socialism to capitalism? As if 

it matters. He is his own consolation prize.
We'd be delighted to have his uniform. 
We want to see all the modern art stuff, too. 
Thank you. Press the button marked "monument
and see what happens: a recorded voice says 
"I have wasted my life, and we pay to listen. 






Flowers
 

Jim Gott and old money don't mix. There is 
no possibility of change. He sent flowers 
to the old lady, to no avail. Then he fought 
the Chinese laundry over the disputed crease 
in his last clean shirt sent by ups; the Chinaman 
got a court order that he not be so called.
He makes peanuts: Jim's thousand a year is viewed 
as a decent living: you figure it out. 

Old Gott was taken to court, a kind of 
maze synod, that September, ornamental 
cherry petals littering the streets.
Thirty-eight years later the charge sheet tells us 
that he was called The Fiendish. In the distant 
future, I shall be as efficient as you. 






Please Marry Me
 

Please marry me. Your mother likes me.         --Line spoken by an unknown woman, in a dream
We are stretched out on a dingy sofa, and I think
I must be barefoot because a woman whom no one knows
Is massaging the ankle of one leg of mine and the instep
Of the other, all this toward morning, and I have that
Occasional epiphany one has while still asleep
That I am floating down a river 
Because I am so happy and all the dismal issues
Have been made tractable at last, and so I say to her
That the late symphonies of Gustav Mahler
Are more lucid if you're sitting close to, and above,
The orchestra, so that you can see the contrapuntal
Lines moving from strings to woodwinds
And then back again, whereupon this woman,
Sitting (I now realize) at my feet, says, in the full
Heat of our dream life, and in that happiness,
"Please marry me. Your mother likes me,
And so I wake, not laughing, although my mother

Has been dead for over thirty years, but in wonderment
Over what quality this dream-woman must have owned
To have pleased my mother so that she,
My late mother, would have said, despite her ban
On ordinary pleasantries, that she had liked someone,
Anyone, who might have cared for me, and as I lie
In bed I think of the last movement of Mahler's Ninth
When the melodic lines go quiet for minute after minute
In a prolonged farewell to music and to life,
Which my mother would attend to in her bathrobe
Late at night, the stereo turned up, blended whiskey
In her highball glass mixed with milk as a disguise, 
Leaning back, hand over eyes, silent-movie style 
Like Norma Desmond listening as Von Stroheim plays
The organ wearing his white gloves. No, it wasn't
Mahler, it was Schoenberg, Verklrte Nacht, 
Moon-drunk music, mad and inconsolable. 






Some Instances
 

To be free of situations,
To live from day to day without events 

And to be free from the need to narrate them.
One small detail, the blossoming crab apple,
For example, on the lengthening boulevard
Of the stanza, this very one,
That parallels the perturbation of the waves
Mid-April--the Mississippi flowing above the locks
Of Minneapolis, once called St. Anthony--
Two blocks away, the river high with snowmelt,
And where this morning I heard the call
Of what I took to be a sparrow, white-throated,
The leap of a minor third
Two octaves above middle C.

Four birds outside this afternoon. Four distinct calls
In a dispirited late daylight.

And you? "You? Waiting to experience a moment
That has no precedent. The wish to be a child, 
Or the wish to be outside of time,
The craving, that is, for a kind of death
In which one stays somehow alert...

Listening to the Schumann Violin Concerto:
Written in that last period as he descended into the madness
Brought on by syphilis when he heard the singing 
Of the angels, this piece was thought to be unplayable
Until the metronome markings were ignored;
In the second movement a brief passage comes and goes
Like the frenzied clustering of bees, pure monotony,
Like madness gathering its forces. Clara, Schumann's wife,
Asked that the piece never be performed, but one musician
Said of his music that all madness contains a kind
Of vulgarity, but even after he went insane,
Schumann's music retained that odd nobility.

Outside, sounds of traffic, a woman's cry from down the street.
Idea for a frightening story:
Last week I heard a scream so distant that it
Had lost its call-to-rescue and its horror--dim vehemence,
Like an auto accident seen from a train, 
The blood grown small, and the outcries
As soundless as a branch in wind,

Or like a child in snow straggling behind his parents,
The drifts so deep he has trouble making headway,
Being five years old, and so he calls out to them,
"Hold! because he cannot think of the proper word--
Probably "Wait or "Stop,--and when they hear
Him begging them to slow down and to wait for him,
They turn around to laugh. Their laughter makes the child
Sad and enraged, so he stops to cry,
Whereupon his parents, still amused, bring out a camera
To snap a picture of him as he wails. 
He understands that his unhappiness
Was a diversion to them both, that they were bored
By children and therefore found him comical,
So there they are, laughing with delight.
Today, sixty years later, he is 
Photographed, bundled in his winter coat.
Oh, and the bored laughter, behind the camera,
And the impossibility, the inconsequence
Of any sympathy.






Sentencings
 


A thing too perfect to be remembered:
stone beautiful only when wet.

*     *     *

Blinded by light or black cloth--
so many ways
not to see others suffer.

*     *     *

Too much longing:

it separates us 
like scent from bread,
rust from iron.

*     *     *

From very far or very close--
the most resolute folds of the mountain are gentle.

*     *     *

As if putting arms into woolen coat sleeves,
we listen to the murmuring dead.

*     *     *

Any point of a circle is its start:
desire forgoing fulfillment to go on desiring.

*     *     *

In a room in which nothing 
has happened,
sweet-scented tobacco. 

*     *     *

The very old, hands curling into themselves, remember their parents.

*     *     *

Think assailable thoughts, or be lonely.






Sonoma Fire
 

Large moon the deep orange of embers.  
Also the scent.
The griefs of others--beautiful, at a distance.






Image Tensed
 

Image tensed, 
I eye the instant,
Anticipation welling--
And I expect no one;
In the lit shadows
I watch as the doorbell
Sheds its inaudible
Pollen of sound--
And I expect no one;
Within four walls
Astounded more by space 
Than any desert place,
I expect no one;
But come he will,
He must, if I hold on
To bloom unseen;
He'll suddenly appear
When I am least aware:
Coming as if to forgive
All he gives to death,
Coming to assure me 
Of his reward and mine,
Coming as anodyne
For my pain, for his--
Perhaps his whisper is
Already on its way.






Last Dream
 

Out of a motionless infernal
shudder and clang of steel on steel
as wagons moved toward the eternal, 
a sudden silence: I was healed.

The stormcloud of my sickness fled
on a breath. A flickering of eyes,
and I saw my mother by my bed
and gazed at her without surprise.

Free! Helpless, yes, to move the hands
clasped on my chest--but I had no
desire to move. The rustling sounds
(like cypress trees, like streams that flow

across vast prairies seeking seas
that don't exist) were thin, insistent:
I followed after those vain sighs,
ever the same, ever more distant.






Poppies
 

This is a year of poppies: our land
was brimming with them as May burned
into June and I returned--
a sweet dark wine that made me drunk.

From clouds of mulberry to grains to grasses
ripeness was all, in the fitting 
heat, in the slow drowsiness spreading 
through the universe of green. 

My life half over I saw grown sons
setting off alone and vanishing from sight
beyond the prison the flight
of the swallow makes in the spent

glow of a stormy evening, but the pain
gave way humanely to the light
coming on inside the house for another meal
in air made cooler by hail 

letting off steam in the distance. 






Faithful See Virgin Mary in Office Window
 

In flowerbeds we crowd, some praying,
some bowing as the world, minute as it is,
stays in motion: box stores doing business,

fast food joints, and above us a crow,
secular bird, lighting on a lamppost
while we take pictures or cry as if we could

live forever in this gloried surround,
gazing up at the window holding her bleared
hair, her mouth that is a frenzy of trapped

pollen or dust, eyes like smooth shells
that make us forget what fertilized
the flowers at our feet, bulbs fortified

with potash or bone meal, dried blood,
which reminds me of the Annunziata
I saw in Italy, painted by those who thought

color itself was divine: crushed shell,
coral and ash, pigments mixed with egg
in a man's mouth, and I worry about

standing too close to the believers, I who
rubberneck and lie, do I stand too close
to the woman at least six months along

with her own child, waving a sonogram
with a faint infant shape inside, an image
scratched by waves: light squandered here, 

dilated there, compressed oil and dust
as every body contains its atlas of salt,
kiss-worn, and always some bud dreamed

in springtime, and though I'm a yarner
and one for whom doubt is a clutched root,
I can't yet walk to my car, standing here

wondering if after His birth the virgin girl
saw the rest of her life would be nothing
but a way to talk about that morning:

gold nearly blinding, herdsmen and kings,
and with its broad warm tongue
a cow licking the afterbirth from the hay.






The Selvage
 

                           1

So door to door among the shotgun
shacks in Cullowhee and Waynesville in
our cleanest shirts and ma'am
and excuse me were all but second

nature now and this one woman comes
to the door she must have weighed
three hundred pounds Would you be
willing to tell us who you plan to vote

for we say and she turns around with
Everett who're we voting for? The
black guy says Everett. The black guy
she says except that wasn't the language

they used they used the word
we've all agreed to banish from even our
innermost thoughts, which is when 
I knew he was going to win.


                           2

At which point the speaker discovers,
as if the lesson were new,
she has told the story at her own expense.
Amazing, said my sister's chairman's

second wife, to think what you've
amounted to considering where you're from,
which she imagined was a compliment.
One country, friends. Where when

we have to go there, as, depend
upon it, fat or thin, regenerate 
or blinkered-to-the-end, we shall, 
they have to take us in. I saw


                           3

a riverful of geese as I drove home across
our one-lane bridge. Four hundred of them
easily, close-massed against the current and
the bitter wind (some settled on the ice) and just

the few at a time who'd loosen rank to 
gather again downstream. As if
to paraphrase. The fabric
every minute bound

by just that pulling-out that holds 
the raveling together. You were driving
all this time? said Steven. Counting
geese? (The snow falling into the river.)

No. (The river about
to give itself over to ice.) I'd stopped.
Their wingspans, had they not
been taking shelter here, as wide as we are tall.






Bright Copper Kettles
 

Dead friends coming back to life, dead family, 
speaking languages living and dead, their minds retentive, 
their five senses intact, their footprints like a butterfly's, 
mercy shining from their comprehensive faces--
this is one of my favorite things. 
I like it so much I sleep all the time. 
Moon by day and sun by night find me dispersed
deep in the dreams where they appear.
In fields of goldenrod, in the city of five pyramids, 
before the empress with the melting face, under 
the towering plane tree, they just show up.
"It's all right, they seem to say. "It always was.
They are diffident and polite. 
(Who knew the dead were so polite?)
They don't want to scare me; their heads don't spin like weather vanes.
They don't want to steal my body
and possess the earth and wreak vengeance.
They're dead, you understand, they don't exist. And, besides,
why would they care? They're subatomic, horizontal. Think about it.
One of them shyly offers me a pencil. 
The eyes under the eyelids dart faster and faster. 
Through the intercom of the house where for so long there was no music,
the right Reverend Al Green is singing,
"I could never see tomorrow. 
I was never told about the sorrow.






Life of Savage
 

I've been excited about him as an individual.
I've met him as a person, emerging from his own shadow.
Indeed it is remarkable.
Indeed it is to be remarked of my friend Savage that 
the desolation of hopes not merely deferred 
but by impracticability brutalized 
little marred his genial spirit. 
How such a one, so circumstanced by parentage--
the mother crippled by disappointment; the father by rotgut and Percodan--
as to blight his prospects, and blacken with untimely frost the buds
of those ambitions justly excited 
by manifest powers, graces, and propensities, 
should nonetheless display
discrimination not inferior to those we deem wise,
sympathy judicious and above reproach, 
is cause for a wonder neither cynicism can besmirch nor incredulity subvert.
In and out of juvie, jacking cars at fifteen, 
snorting lines of Adderall, his nostrils stained blue,
kicked out, taken back, kicked out,
busted, paroled, busted again,
straining to reach the shiny object fallen through the grate,
tantalizing, just beyond his fingers,
finding and losing God, 
thinking as he rakes the leaves of the linden tree
outside the sublet bungalow
that eating, sleeping, dying are what it's all about, 
nothing else, maybe a few sunsets,
forget about sex.






Three Persons
 

That slow person you left behind when, finally, 
you mastered the world, and scaled the heights you now command, 
where is he while you
walk around the shaved lawn in your plus fours,
organizing with an electric clipboard 
your big push to tomorrow?
Oh, I've come across him, yes I have, more than once,
coaxing his battered grocery cart down the freeway meridian.
Others see in you sundry mythic types distinguished
not just in themselves but by the stories
we put them in, with beginnings, ends, surprises:
the baby Oedipus on the hillside with his broken feet
or the dog whose barking saves the grandmother
flailing in the millpond beyond the weir,
dragged down by her woolen skirt.
He doesn't see you as a story, though.
He feels you as his atmosphere. When your sun shines,
he chortles. When your barometric pressure drops
and the thunderheads gather,
he huddles under the overpass and writes me long letters with
the stubby little pencils he steals from the public library.
He asks me to look out for you. 






from Euphoria
 

                                                       1

Dear Regret, my leaning this morning, my leather foot, want of stone, my age
Old, burnished and bruised, my hair lingering, my hand caked, spongy as
November my dear Relentless, my dear Aging, your voice tinny, dissonant 
As Stein shot through decades of war and Fortrel, cocktails on the hour,  
Zeppelins over Piccadilly, bombing blindly in the fog. Dear Skin, dear Tobacco 
Mouth my refusal, my merely geographic, my fibrous strings for you: your 
Abundant wit, your lack of shadow and still joy nosing the air. Each moment 
Stretches toward you, your dry feet: I carried them, pumiced and peppery
Laid them where regret is a biscuit thing to lean upon and sweeten, 
My hour of you, my cursive thoughts, a pulpit beating under these ribs.


                                                       2

Dear Time, you swallowed us whole, swallowed us lovely, sharp as bones
Crimping sadly under foot my benign, my flotsam and crabs thin as leaves 
Your smoothing, your sinking in. Mornings or mooring, or wallowing 
Jericho: tapioca air indolent. I am still there, supple and driftwood, you lovely, 
You loved me, your memory dark and west, thoughts like tugboats stitching
The horizon, you pulling me, my pudding, my thin crustacean, sideways
In the late afternoon, your gaze, having so soon forgotten the sharpness 
Of mornings, the bite of your look serrating the hour: my treasures, all 
Of them, for the pleasure of that slice once more, of our dangling, 
You and me, the lot of us in some car, driving some hour, mapless. 


                                                       3

Under a spiderweb, a tire, slouched: flat, sad-lipped, I think of Newton 
Of the original apple, all of these clones since, all of these scentless 
Descents. I shake my glass, shake again, melted suffixes tinkling; observe 
All things natural: foliage unfurling like old bills, wryly betraying 
Your habits, like the dog who digs and rubs, the dog who whines, who
Paws and circles, you trace. Why is pain so much better than nothing? Or 
The mark of it more understandable? Why is saying nothing so much better? 
Your one-liner like blossoms, uplifting, your currents strap me to air, yes
I guess there is a little texture up here, and oxygen pure as baby's toes
Which if I recall, are sweet as kernels of corn, if I recall so long ago. 


                                                       4

To arrive is practice, conversation or conversion, a story over a field 
My Sweet, of concrete or whispering, furrows of a path no longer, not 
Sure, was there, and snow combed in curlicues and dog ears a zigzag 
Through January. Sure you are witty, but are you any less romantic? 
In my remembering, I have undone all my beliefs, it is a luxury to lay 
Unencumbered here, or there, the bones flexed with tendons, the 
Spine like a seahorse, the heart far from a cliche unless beating is
Innocent, though innocence is not as supple as you think, nor as flexible, 
Nor as perfumed, nor convenient, or even clean: between things regret 
Gathers force. I remember that day: it was cold and the coffee tepid.


                                                       5

The small red balloons like thumbprints, waves green as the brush of 
Cedar, the wind lapping your hoodie, blind strings tap the air, camera
Bobbing like a dog's tail. Such lightness, the dog heading off, all 
The dogs of English Bay angling off-leash. I would follow backward, 
Lay old maps on your white sheets, so sincere, I am in earnest for you: 
We won't regret having not yet knit our acrid puns and jaded barbs, nor 
Having the wind slip in under our belt loops, though I gently refuse 
Gor-Tex, and you bet I will not concede the game. Those small red 
Balloons like tulips in your eyes specs of amber, an amulet, an avatar, 
My thoughts of you fully indexed, ready to step into. 






At the Office Holiday Party
 

I can now confirm that I am not just fatter 
than everyone I work with, but I'm also fatter 
than all their spouses. Even the heavily bearded 
bear in accounting has a little otter-like boyfriend.

When my co-workers brightly introduce me 
as "the funny one in the office, their spouses 
give them a look which translates to, Well, duh, 
then they both wait for me to say something funny.

A gaggle of models comes shrieking into the bar 
to further punctuate why I sometimes hate living 
in this city. They glitter, a shiny gang of scissors. 
I don't know how to look like I'm not struggling.

Sometimes on the subway back to Queens, 
I can tell who's staying on past the Lexington stop 
because I have bought their shoes before at Payless. 
They are shoes that fool absolutely no one.

Everyone wore their special holiday party outfits. 
It wasn't until I arrived at the bar that I realized 
my special holiday party outfit was exactly the same 
as the outfits worn by the restaurant's busboys.

While I'm standing in line for the bathroom, 
another patron asks if I'm there to clean it.





Infanta Marina
 

Her terrace was the sand
 And the palms and the twilight.
  
 She made of the motions of her wrist
 The grandiose gestures 
 Of her thought.
  
 The rumpling of the plumes
 Of this creature of the evening
 Came to be sleights of sails
 Over the sea.
  
 And thus she roamed
 In the roamings of her fan,
 Partaking of the sea,
 And of the evening,
 As they flowed around
 And uttered their subsiding sound.






Bantams in Pine-Woods
 

Chieftain Iffucan of Azcan in caftan
 Of tan with henna hackles, halt!
  
 Damned universal cock, as if the sun
 Was blackamoor to bear your blazing tail.
  
 Fat! Fat! Fat! Fat! I am the personal. 
 Your world is you. I am my world.
  
 You ten-foot poet among inchlings. Fat!
 Begone! An inchling bristles in these pines,
  
 Bristles, and points their Appalachian tangs,
 And fears not portly Azcan nor his hoos. 






Nomad Exquisite
 

As the immense dew of Florida 
 Brings forth
 The big-finned palm
 And green vine angering for life,
  
 As the immense dew of Florida
 Brings forth hymn and hymn
 From the beholder,
 Beholding all these green sides
 And gold sides of green sides,
  
 And blessed mornings,
 Meet for the eye of the young alligator,
 And lightning colors
 So, in me, come flinging
 Forms, flames, and the flakes of flames. 






Indian River
 

The trade-wind jingles the rings in the nets around the racks
         by the docks on Indian River.
 It is the same jingle of the water among roots under the
         banks of the palmettoes.
 It is the same jingle of the red-bird breasting the orange-trees
         out of the cedars.
 Yet there is no spring in Florida, neither in boskage perdu, nor
        on the nunnery beaches. 






My Trip
 

I am looking at a smallpox vaccination scar
In a war movie on the arm 
Of a young actor. He has just swum
Across a river somewhere in Normandy
Into the waiting arms of his rejoicing comrades.

Of course, the river's in California,
And the actor is dead now. Nevertheless,
This is the first of many hotels this trip,
And I find myself preferring wars
To smut on the networks,
Even as I find myself reading
The Pisan Cantos for the umpteenth time
Instead of the novel in my bag.
The poet helps me to the question:
Does anything remain of home at home?

Next day is no way of knowing,
And the day after is my favorite,
A small museum really perfect
And a good meal in the middle of it.
As I'm leaving,
I notice a donkey on a vase
Biting the arm of a young girl,
And outside on the steps
A silver fish head glistens beside a bottlecap.
Plenty remains.

The work of poetry is trust,
And under the aegis of trust
Nothing could be more effortless.
Hotels show movies.
Walking around even tired
I find my eyes find
Numberless good things
And my ears hear plenty of words
Offered for nothing over the traffic noise
As sharp as sparrows.

A day and a day, more rivers crossing me. 
It really feels that way, I mean
I have changed places with geography, 
And rivers and towns pass over me,
Showing their scars, finding their friends.
I like it best when poetry
Gleams or shows its teeth to a girl
Forever at just the right moment.
I think I could turn and live underneath the animals.
I could be a bottlecap.

Going to the airport going home,
I stop with my teacher, now my friend.
He buys me a good breakfast, berries and hotcakes.
We finish and, standing, I hear
One policeman saying to another
Over the newspaper in a yellow booth
"Do you know this word regret, Eddie?
What does it mean?"
Plenty of words over the traffic noise,
And nothing could be more effortless.
Catching a glimpse of eternity, even a poor one, says it all.





Vietnam Epic Treatment
 

It doesn't matter
 A damn what's playing--
 In the dead of winter
 You go, days of 1978--
 79, and we went
 Because the soldiers were beautiful
 And doomed as Asian jungles
 Kept afire Christ-like
 In the hopeless war
 I did not go to in the end
 Because it ended.
  
 The 20th century?
 It was a war
 Between peasants on the one side,
 Hallucinations on the other.
 A peasant is a fire that burns
 But is not consumed.
 His movie never ends.
 It will be beautiful
 Every winter of our lives, my love,
 As Christ crushes fire into his wounds
 And the wounds are a jungle.
 Equally, no matter when their movies end,
 Hallucinations destroy the destroyers.
 That's all.
 There has never been a President of the United States.
  
 And the 21st century?
 Hallucination vs. hallucination
 In cold battle, in dubious battle,
 No battle at all because the peasants
 Have gone away far
 Into the lost traveler's dream,
 Into a passage from Homer,
 A woodcutter's hillside
 Peacetime superstition movie. 
  
 On a cold night, Hector.
 On a cold night, Achilles.
 Around the savage and the maniac 
 The woodcutter draws a ring of fire.
 It burns all winter long.
 He never tires of it
 And for good reason:
 Every face of the flames is doomed and beautiful;
 Every spark that shoots out into the freezing air
 Is God's truth
 Given us all over again
 In the bitter weather of men's 
 Hallucinations. There has never been
 A President of the United States.
 There has never been a just war.
 There has never been any life
 Beyond this circle of firelight
 Until now if now is no dream but an Asia.





The Sun Came
 

                                                        And if sun comes                                                        How shall we greet him?                                                                     --Gwen Brooks
The sun came, Miss Brooks,--
After all the night years.
He came spitting fire from his lips.
And we flipped--We goofed the whole thing.
It looks like our ears were not equipped
For the fierce hammering.

And now the Sun has gone, has bled red,
Weeping behind the hills.
Again the night shadows form.
But beneath the placid face a storm rages.
The rays of Red have pierced the deep, have struck
The core. We cannot sleep. 
The shadows sing: Malcolm, Malcolm, Malcolm.
The darkness ain't like before.

The Sun came, Miss Brooks.
And we goofed the whole thing.
I think.
(Though ain't no vision visited my cell.)

Dropping Leaflets
 

Help me come up with a strategy to get through this white noise. -- U.S. Representative Cynthia McKinney,   November 2001
Are we on the ground now? Ally cells and I said operations. 
 We cleared 50% of a wonderful friend and enduring opposition. 
 Take the solid. 
 Louder. 
 We clearly are loud. We are the postal system. 
 No evidence has been information. 
 Attacking the caves. Are you on the ground enduring? 
 A wonderful friend ramped it up. 
 You ought to open your mail. 
 Opposition element: the air. The talents work with precision. 
 84%. The population attacking the caves, the talents work with the
 caves and tunnels. 
 Hiding in caves, wavering in caves and hiding in mosques. 
 A wonderful friend on the ground. 
 Freedom I said: the enduring ally cells. 
 Interested in the view, in our aid sensitivities. 
 50% to the front of our effort adding that 80% are willing to play. 
 Independent oper-oppo-sition forces that are rosy. 
 So make assumptions on the ground. Are we on the ground now? 
 Can be more than air. The target. The air liaison.
 Campaign with the bombing and entirely happy. 
 Attacking the leaflets. 
 We keep working hiding in hiding in caves
 and cowering in cowering in cowering in caves
 and I could say confidential areas. 
 The mosques and rest efforts are mad. 
 Execution in the targeting of democracy. 
 Those risks culti-targeting to minimize the individual. 
 An obligation to the spirit of enterprise. 
 A war of roundup freezing worldwide, and proceeding on course. 
 Training facilities, proceeding on course, freezing their guided
 munitions. 
 A population is tons of struggle against evil. 
 A civilized world of innocents in the mud, an enemy that's on the 
 ground for there is no neutral ever. No neutral homeland. 
 For the first time first time first time in history

Poet
 

The wind dying, I find a city deserted, except for crowds of
 people moving and standing.
  
  
     Those standing resemble stories, like stones, coal from the
 death of plants, bricks in the shape of teeth.
  
  
     I begin now to write down all the places I have not been--
 starting with the most distant.
  
  
     I build houses that I will not inhabit.






The Ghost of a Hunter
 

He reads: What soul suffers in secret, the flesh shows openly.
  
  
     Deep within, in a region hardly accessible, a bold self-image
 sends messages of bloodshed and conquest, which reverberate in
 his heart of hearts.
  
  
     [I forget which hand is writing.]
  
  
     He does not doubt that he exists.
  
  
     The five senses have left their mark on him. It is a record of
 what has happened to him, but he cannot talk or travel until he
 finds a body of water.
  
  
     A man who has lived on reindeer's flesh amuses himself with
 ripples.
  
  
     In this cage was once a nightingale. In the echo, new words
 for wind.
  
  
     The usual convulsions, and a green cat. And, after all, months
 or years are nothing to him.
  
  
     [My image contains his body.]
  
  
     His body contains bodies.
  
  
     Blemishes.
  
  
     Inglories.
  
     Vague figures, in a howling wind, and with no notion of
 perspective.
  
  
     Of countless ruined worlds, he would appropriate the 
 essential emblem. Wall struggling with wall, shadow with shad-
 ow.
  
  
     Thousands of miles a day.
  
  
     He gazes across an unguarded cemetery--gazes idly, waiting
 for new equipment.
  
  
     As through a fixed window, he finds a kind of space, the
 visible world foreshortened.
  
  
     He does not see deeply, but--still--one thing behind another.
  
  
     He keeps a tiny bird, folded like a sheet of paper.
  
  
     Twice two is four--still--and a circle has no angles.
  
  
     Body sheds shoulder, jaw. However body may appear, the soul
 comes back in scars.
  
  
     [There are no dead. Only names.]
  
  
     Too close, ruin wrinkles the surface--his breath bothers
 reality. The sun pours down. The pots are mended.
  
  
     An unfolding, from where it is all contained.
  
  
     The ships have been salvaged. [I do not know what body he
 has in mind.] Clothing is resumed. Temples are rebuilt.
  
     "Which body? we inquire, while all the liars cry out,
 "Verily!
  
  
     As though all this were in the dark.
  
  
     Here is a column of soldiers, a heap of apples, an avenue of
 trees. Here a swarm of bees, of birds, a row of equidistant lines.
 A set of unequal objects distributes the field of vision.
  
  
     Here is the painted world in an actual image. [I have no 
 theory for the clouds he sees.]

from The Ambition of Ghosts: I. Remembering into Sleep
 

I. Separation Precedes Meeting

 The cat so close
 to the fire
 I smell scorched 
 breath. Parents,
 silent, behind me,
 a feeling of
 trees that might fall.
 Or dogs. 
                  A poem,
 like trying
 to remember,
 is a movement
 of the whole body.
 You follow the 
 fog
 into more fog.
 Maybe the door ahead
 divides
 the facts
 from natural affection. How
 can I know. I meet
 too many
 in every mirror.

  
  
 
 2.
  
 When I was little,
 was I I?
 My sister? A wolf
 chained,
 smothered in green virtues? 
                                               Slower
 time
 of memory. Once
 I've got something
 I lie
 down on it
 with my whole body.
 Goethe quotations, warm
 sand, a smell of hay,
 long afternoons.
                             But it
 would take a road
 would turn, with space,
 in on itself,
 would turn
 occasion into offer.

  
  
  
  

  
3.
  
 For days I hold
 a tiny landscape between
 thumb
 and index:
 sand,
 heather,
 shimmer of blue between pines.
 No smell: matchbook.
 Sand as schematic as
                                     Falling
 into memory,
 down,
 with my blood,
 to the accretions
 in the arteries,
 to be read with the whole
 body, in the chambers
 of the heart.
 The light: of the match,
 struck,
 at last.
  
  
 
  
  
    
 4.
  
 Concentration: a frown
 of the whole body. I can't
 remember. Too many
 pasts
 recede
 in all directions.
 Slow movement into 
                                    Distant boots.
 Black beetles at night. A smell
 of sweat.
                  The restaurant,
 yes. You've no idea
 how much my father used to eat.
 Place thick with smoke.
 Cards. Beer foaming over
 on the table.
                      And always
 some guy said I ought
 to get married,
 put a pillow behind my eyes
 and, with a knowing
 sigh, spat
 in my lap.
  
  
 
  
  
  
 5.
  
 The present.
 As difficult as
 the past, once a place
 curves into
            Hips swinging elsewhere.
 Castles in sand.
 Or Spain. Space
 of another language.
                                    Sleep
 is a body of water.
 You follow your lips
 into its softness. Far down
 the head finds its level
    
  
  
  

  
  
 6. Tropisms
  
 Inward, always. Night
 curls the clover leaf
 around its sleep.
 Tightly.
 The bodies of the just
 roll,
 all night,
 through subterranean caves
 which turn 
 in on themselves.
                                 Long
 tunnel
 of forgetting. Need
 of blur. The air,
 large, curves
 its whole body.
 Big hammering waves
 flatten my 
 muscles.
 Inward, the distances: male
 and female fields,
 rigorously equal.
    
  
  
  
  
  
  
 7.
  
 The drunk fell toward me
 in the street. I hope
 he wasn't
 disappointed. Skinned
 his sleep.
                  November.
  
 And a smell of snow. Quite normal,
 says the landlord, the master
 of rubbish, smaller
 and smaller in my 
 curved mirror.
                          I have un-
 controllable
 good luck: my sleep
 always turns dense
 and visible. There
 are many witches
 in Germany. Their songs
 descend in steady half-tones
 through you.
  

  
  
  
  
  
  
 8.
  
 You'll die, Novalis says, you'll die
 following endless rows
 of sheep into your
 even breath.
                      Precarious,
 like Mozart, a living
 kind of air,
 keeps the dream
 spinning
 around itself, its
 missing core.
 Image
 after image of pleasure
 of the whole body
 deepens 
my sleep:
  
 fins. 
  
  
  

  
  
  
    
 9. Introducing Decimals
  
 A dream, like trying 
 to remember, breaks open words
 for other,
 hidden meanings. The grass
 pales by degrees, twigs
 quaver glassily,
 ice
 flowers the window.
 Intimate equations more complicated
 than the coordinates of past
 and Germany. The cat
 can't lift its paw,
 its leg longer and longer
 with effort.
 A crying fit 
 is cancelled. An aria jelled
 in the larynx.
 Nothing moves in the cotton
 coma: only Descartes
 pinches himself
 an every fraction 
 must be solved.

Representation
 

I have no conscience because I
 always chew my pencil. Can we say
 white paper
 with black lines on it
 is like a human body? This question
 not to be decided by pointing
 at a tree nor yet by a description
 of simple pleasures.
  
  
 Smell of retrieval. Led to expect the wrong
 answer. An arsenal without purpose
 but why yes please.
 There is no touching the black box. 
 The tree not pointed at lives
 in your bringing up the subject
 and leaves space for need, falling.
  
  
 The white ground. The waning heat.
 I'd like
 to say the history of the world.
 Or that grammar
 milks essence into propositions
 of human kindness.
  
  
 The difficulty here's not true or false
 but that the picture's in the foreground
 and its sense back where the gestures link 
 so closely to the bone
 the words
 give notice.
 The application is not easy.
  






As from a Quiver of Arrows
 

What do we do with the body, do we 
burn it, do we set it in dirt or in 
stone, do we wrap it in balm, honey,
oil, and then gauze and tip it onto 
and trust it to a raft and to water?

What will happen to the memory of his 
body, if one of us doesn't hurry now
and write it down fast? Will it be
salt or late light that it melts like?
Floss, rubber gloves, and a chewed cap

to a pen elsewhere --how are we to 
regard his effects, do we throw them
or use them away, do we say they are 
relics and so treat them like relics?
Does his soiled linen count? If so,

would we be wrong then, to wash it? 
There are no instructions whether it
should go to where are those with no
linen, or whether by night we should
memorially wear it ourselves, by day

reflect upon it folded, shelved, empty.
Here, on the floor behind his bed is 
a bent photo--why? Were the two of 
them lovers? Does it mean, where we
found it, that he forgot it or lost it

or intended a safekeeping? Should we
attempt to make contact? What if this
other man too is dead? Or alive, but 
doesn't want to remember, is human?
Is it okay to be human, and fall away

from oblation and memory, if we forget,
and can't sometimes help it and sometimes
it is all that we want? How long, in
dawns or new cocks, does that take?
What if it is rest and nothing else that

we want? Is it a findable thing, small?
In what hole is it hidden? Is it, maybe,
a country? Will a guide be required who
will say to us how? Do we fly? Do we 
swim? What will I do now, with my hands?





My Grandmother Washes Her Feet in the Sink of the Bathroom at Sears
 

My grandmother puts her feet in the sink
        of the bathroom at Sears
to wash them in the ritual washing for prayer,
wudu, 
because she has to pray in the store or miss
the mandatory prayer time for Muslims
She does it with great poise, balancing
herself with one plump matronly arm
against the automated hot-air hand dryer,
after having removed her support knee-highs
and laid them aside, folded in thirds,
and given me her purse and her packages to hold
so she can accomplish this august ritual
and get back to the ritual of shopping for housewares

Respectable Sears matrons shake their heads and frown
as they notice what my grandmother is doing,
an affront to American porcelain,
a contamination of American Standards
by something foreign and unhygienic
requiring civic action and possible use of disinfectant spray
They fluster about and flutter their hands and I can see
a clash of civilizations brewing in the Sears bathroom

My grandmother, though she speaks no English,
catches their meaning and her look in the mirror says,
I have washed my feet over Iznik tile in Istanbul
with water from the world's ancient irrigation systems
I have washed my feet in the bathhouses of Damascus
over painted bowls imported from China
among the best families of Aleppo
And if you Americans knew anything 
about civilization and cleanliness,
you'd make wider washbins, anyway
My grandmother knows one culture--the right one,

as do these matrons of the Middle West. For them,
my grandmother might as well have been squatting
in the mud over a rusty tin in vaguely tropical squalor,
Mexican or Middle Eastern, it doesn't matter which,
when she lifts her well-groomed foot and puts it over the edge. 
"You can't do that," one of the women protests,
turning to me, "Tell her she can't do that."
"We wash our feet five times a day,"
my grandmother declares hotly in Arabic.
"My feet are cleaner than their sink. 
Worried about their sink, are they? I 
should worry about my feet!"
My grandmother nudges me, "Go on, tell them."

Standing between the door and the mirror, I can see
at multiple angles, my grandmother and the other shoppers,
all of them decent and goodhearted women, diligent
in cleanliness, grooming, and decorum
Even now my grandmother, not to be rushed,
is delicately drying her pumps with tissues from her purse
For my grandmother always wears well-turned pumps
that match her purse, I think in case someone
from one of the best families of Aleppo
should run into her--here, in front of the Kenmore display

I smile at the midwestern women
as if my grandmother has just said something lovely about them
and shrug at my grandmother as if they 
had just apologized through me
No one is fooled, but I

hold the door open for everyone
and we all emerge on the sales floor
and lose ourselves in the great common ground
of housewares on markdown.





Autobiography
 

we didn't really speak
my summer wants to answer

this is not my real life

when I am here I want to know

Echo & Elixir 2
 

Cairo's taxi drivers speak to me in English.
I answer, and they say your Arabic is good.
How long have you been with us? All my life
I tell them, but I'm never believed.
They speak to me in Farsi, speak to me in Greek,
and I answer with mountains of gold and silver,
ghost ships sailing the weed-choked seas.
And when they speak to me in Spanish,
I say Moriscos and Alhambra.
I say Jews rescued by Ottoman boats.
And when the speak to me in Portuguese,
all my life I tell them, coffee, cocoa,
Indians and poisoned spears.
I say Afonsso king of Bikongo writing
Manuel to free his enslaved sons.
And Cairo's taxi drivers tell me
your Arabic is surprisingly good.
Then they speak to me in Italian,
and I tell them how I lay swaddled
a month's walk from here. I tell them
camps in the desert, barbed wire, wives
and daughters dying, camels frothing disease,
the sand stretching an endless pool.
And they say so good so good.
How long have you been with us?
All my life, but I'm never believed.
Then they speak to me in French,
and I answer Jamila, Leopold, Stanley,
baskets of severed hands and feet.
I say the horror, battles of Algiers.
And they speak to me in English
and I say Lucknow, Arbenz. I say indigo,
Hiroshima, continents soaked in tea.
I play the drum beat of stamps. I invoke
Mrs. Cummings, U.S. consul in Athens,
I say Ishi, Custer, Wounded Knee.
And Cairo's taxi drivers tell me
your Arabic is unbelievably good.
Tell the truth now, tell the truth,
how long have you been with us?
I say my first name is little lion,
my last name is broken branch.
I sing "Happiness uncontainable"
and "field greening in March"
until I'm sad and tired of truth,
and as usual I'm never believed.
Then they lead me through congestion,
gritty air, narrow streets crowded with
Pepsi and Daewoo and the sunken faces
of the poor. And when we arrive, Cairo's
taxi drivers and I speak all the languages
of the world, and we argue and argue about
corruption, disillusionment, the missed chances,
the wicked binds, the cataclysmic fares.

                          watches the sky.
             Where is the sea now? she asks.
Where is it from here?
                          What is its name?--
             this rain on a morning ride to school,
winter, my seventh year,
                          my father driving
             through rain, his eyes fixed on a world
of credit and debt. On the
                          radio, devotion to
             the lifter of harm from those who despair,
             knower of secrets with the knowledge of certainty.
Not even the anguish of those
                          years, the heavy
             traffic, cold and wind could have
touched me. I was certain the palm
                          holding me would be
             struck again. Chance allows
for that and for stars to throb
                          in reachable depths.
             Filled with grief bordering happiness,
I didn't care if I was safe,
                          whether the storm
             was over, only that it came, the slash
of lightning, the groaning sky,
                          and the storms we made,
             how rain stripped everything of urgency,
how to the lifter of harm rise
             those who despair.







Bedtime Reading for the Unborn Child
 

Long after the sun falls into the sea
and twilight slips off the horizon like a velvet sheet
and the air gets soaked in blackness;
long after clouds hover above like boulders
and stars crawl up and stud the sky;
long after bodies tangle, dance, and falter
and fatigue blows in and bends them
and sleep unloads its dreams and kneads them
and sleepers dive into the rivers inside them,
a girl unlatches a window,
walks shoeless into a forest,
her dark hair a flag rippling in darkness.

She walks into woods, her feet light-stepping
through puddles, over hard packed dirt,
through grassy hills, over sticks and pebbles
over sand soaked in day, stones sun-sizzled
over lakes and frigid streams
through dim cobbled streets
darkened squares and dusty pastures.
She runs from nothing, runs to nothing,
beyond pain, beyond graveyards and clearings.
In the dark the eyes of startled creatures
gleam like a herd of candles.
They scatter and give night its meaning.

What echo of a bell lulled her
what spirit, what scent of a word
whose storm wrote her
what banks fell to drown her
which blood star
which thread of water
which trickle of light
whose heart being launched
whose floating soul seduced her
what promise did it make her
whose memory burned her
whose prayer did she run to answer
whose help, what sorrow clot
what pain dammed inside her
what wall must she rebuild now
whose treasure beckons her
who spread ivy like a veil to blind her?
Daybreak lies chained to a blue wall
from which the stars drop
and lose all meaning.

She runs past villages that lost their names
roads that lost their destinations
seas that lost their compasses and sailors
rivers that lost their marshlands and travelers
houses that lost their sleepers and criers
trees that lost their songs and shadows
gardens that lost their violets and benches
valleys that lost their worms and farmers
mountains that lost their prophets and marauders
temples that lost their sinners and spires
lightning that lost its silver and wires
chimeras that lost their bridges
minotaurs that lost their fountains.
Crescent moons hover above her,
ancient white feathers, birdless, wingless
lost to their own meaning.

Music rises out of her vision.
It stands, a wall covered with silver mosses.
A clarinet sounds a wounded mare,
violins women who lost their children.
Flutes blow their hot dry breezes.
Drums chuckle the earth's ceaseless laughter.
Pianos are mumbling sorcerers
calling spirits and powers.
Cellos chew on the sounds of thunder.
Dulcimers skip about on crutches.
Dance floors flash their knives
daring their dancers.
Words mill about the streets like orphans.
Then a lute begins groaning
and dawn loses its meaning.

Night girl, night girl
your book is full now.
You have drawn all the pictures.
You have seen many weepers.
Stars held your sky in place and moons
floated on your lakes and washed them.
When a bird sings
when dewed branches tilt sunlight into eyes
when curtains are soaked with light
when mirrors drown in shadows,
take your day to the shore, my child.
Put out the words that fired your waking,
scatter them on the sand like seeds,
then with your feet gently tap them,
and let the bright waves
receive your meaning.







East of Carthage: An Idyll
 

1.

Look here, Marcus Aurelius, we've come to see
your temple, deluded the guards, crawled through a hole
in the fence. Why your descendent, my guide and friend

has opted for secrecy, I don't know. But I do know
what to call the Africans, passport-less, yellow-eyed
who will ride the boat before me for Naples, they hope.

Here the sea curls its granite lip at them and flings a winter
storm like a cough, or the seadog drops them at Hannibal's
shores, where they'll stand stupefied like his elephants.

What dimension of time will they cross at the Hours loop
tight plastic ropes round their ankles and wrists?
What siren song will the trucks shipping them back

to Ouagadougou drone into their ears? I look at them
loitering, waiting for the second act of their darkness
to fall. I look at the sky shake her dicey fists.

One can be thankful, I suppose, for not being one of them,
and wrap the fabric of that thought around oneself
to keep the cold wind at bay. But what world is this

that makes our lives sufficient even as the horizon's rope
is about to snap, while the sea and sky ache to become
an open-ended road? That's what we're all waiting for,

a moment to peel itself like skin off fruit, and let us in
on its sweetness as we wait, smoking, or fondling provisions,
listening the engine's invocational purr. In an hour

that will dawn and dusk at once, one that will stretch
into days strung like beads on the horizon's throat,
they will ride their tormented ship as the dog star

begins to float on the water, so bright and still,
you'd want to scoop it out in the palm of your hand.


2.

A pair of Roman fists robbed of spear and shield;
the tiles of the tapestries mixed in with popcorn

that slipped from the buttery hands, aluminum
wrappers smudged with processed cheese;

countless cigarette butts surround the fallen
columns and beams with a fringe of tarnished foam;

pairs of panties still hot with forbidden passion

The ruins are not ruined.
                                   Without all this garbage
packed, stratified, how else to name our age?


3.

Earlier, I had walked the market of Sabratha, changed
to its people, but like my old city brought me back to me.
The petty merchants, all selling the same goods, shouted out
jokes to each other. A Sudanese waiter carried a tray
with a giant pot of green tea with mint. Among the older men,

their heads capped with crimson shennas, I kept seeking
my father's face. An old lust wafted past me when the abaya-clad
women, scented with knock-off Chanel, sashayed by.
The sawdust floors of the shawarma and falafel eateries,
the sandwich maker dabbing insides of loaves

with spoons of searing harissa, my mouth watering
to a childhood burn. Pyramids of local oranges,
late season pomegranates, radish and turnip bulbs
stacked like billiard balls, and the half carcasses of lambs
as if made of wax and about to melt off their hooks,

the trays of hearts, kidneys, brains and testicles arrayed
in slick arabesques. The hand-woven rugs where
the extinct mouflon thrives, mincers, hairdryers, and toasters,
their cords tentacles drooping from rusty shelves.

It was as if my eyes were painting, not seeing, what I saw,
my memory slowly building the scene until it assembled whole.
What face did my face put on in the midst of transfiguration?
I know what the eyes of the men my age said, settled now
in comfortable middle age, about the life I left behind.

True, I did envy them the asceticism of their grace,
where a given horizon becomes a birthright--to drive or walk
past the same hills all your life, to eat from the same tree
and drink from the well that gave you your name.


4.

Though for centuries the locals broke the statues'
limbs and ground them to make primitive pottery,
enough remains to echo all that has disappeared:

you and the woman leave the towpath, and you brace her
against the trunk of an oak. It's not the moonlight, but refractions
from suburban homes trapped under cloud-cover
that make her bronze skin glow among glistening trees.

First, God made love:   
                         the canopy like the inside of an emerald,
her lips a rush of cochineal. Then a route of evanescence
brought her from Carthage into these living arms, here.


5.

"A nice time, " he tells us, how he and four
cousins crossed the desert heading home
on top of three-years' worth of meager pay
(the tarp ballooning, a giant dough) roped to a truck.

Wearing the goggles of the welder he'd hoped
to become, he looked at the sky and wondered "what
those flying, smoke on their tails, thought of us.

Later, deported in a cargo plane, he handed
the Tuareg soldiers one of his fake passports,
and they like "space aliens (in shabby uniforms,
sunglasses, tribal veils) poured into his face.

As the propellers' hammering calmed to 
a shuddering hum, he saw the stars, "hundreds
of them like gnats swarm Mt. Akakous' peak.

"My next road is the water, he says serving
us tonight, and we promise, if the coffee is good,
to put him on the next boat to the moon
                                                shining over Syracuse. 


6.

Suddenly, I find your descendant's hands leafing through
my chapters, scribbling a note in the margin of my thoughts:

            "How is it, he asks, "that starlight announces the hour:
             how can a song divide desire in two?

"My flame, I must have written or said, "coated her body
like silk, one kiss spreading threads of lightening

into her pores, until she became a sob, barely lifted by the wind,
and I became mist, the shadow of a statue at the break of dawn.


             To that he responds, "a Platonic echo; and
             "What will come of such a plasticine love?

Marcus Aurelius, your descendent knows I'll leave
as I arrive, so empty he gets lost in me.


7.

Two centuries ago, one of my ancestors sat
on one of the communal latrines in mid-morning
and listened to Apuleius's defense. Across from him
on that marble hexagon, sat two other men.
On normal days they'd have talked about the olive harvest,

the feast of Venus coming soon. But today they listen to
the Madaurian's high eloquence studded with jokes,
cracking their own one-liners, shaking their heads in delight.
Away from the hot midday sun and the throngs,

you could say, they had the best seats in the house,
and so they lingered and heard as much as they could
then went about their business. So what if a man maries
an older woman for her money, what impoverished young Roman
in his right mind wouldn't do that? And sure too, if some man

comes to take your inheritance, even if he's your best friend,
even if he takes good care of your mother, you'd be a fool
not to sue him to the Council, even if you'd have to accuse him
falsely of black magic. That's the beauty of it, or rather,

whoever is going to win will have to make us trust beauty,
that things being already right, can be more right, which
is what "beautiful really means. And what better way,
to take in all this refinement than hearing it in a latrine
where only beauty shields you from the awful stuff of life.


8.

Marcus Aurelius, the men at the shore follow your path
into eternity, though they already see their journey
as a quarrel with circumstance, their lives abscesses feeding

on the universe's hide, tumors in detention camps,
in basement kitchens. Their pockets filled with drachmas,
they'll lift diffident heads and drag feet lead-heavy with shame.

One of them is now driving a taxi in Thessaloniki or Perugia.
With enough of the language to understand direction, he engages
his late night passengers. In the light of the dashboard

they'll entrust him with their secrets. With time, he'll become
a light unto himself, his car a winged chariot of human folly,
and his responses to them saplings nourished in the dark

soil of philosophy. It's the gift of seasons that stray
from the earth, when soul reigns incidental to flesh,
forgiving to no end, a light that has long surpassed itself.


9.

The birds that drew the line to the first distance
remain nameless to me--

creamy white breasts, gold dust around their eyes,
black/brown (dark roast) wings.

The deserts they crossed, the plains east
or north of here fall like sand from my hands.

Um Bsisi, I want to call them, citizens of a protracted destiny,
native and stranger, prodigal and peasant--

admit now, they you're none of these,
that you're not any,
                        or even all of them combined.


10.

Southwest of here is Apuleius's hometown, his inescapable
destination having spent his inheritance on travel and studies.
"Lacking the poverty of the rich, he's splurged,
a month-long trip to the Olympic games; and openhanded,
he gifted his mentors their daughters' doweries.

Few return to Madaura once gone, and when heading back
shamefaced like him, they'd do as he did, taking
the longest route hoping the journey would never end. Here
in Sabratha, the widow hooked him, or he let her reel him,
and that's how that sordid business happily ended as it began.

I look out toward Madaura, my back to the theater
and the latrines, Madaura birthplace of Augustine, site of
his first schooling--little Augustine holding a satchel of scrolls
and a  loaf of bread for the teacher, awakened by his mother,

his tiny feet cold in tiny sandals, his stomach warm
with a barley porridge my grandmother used to make, forced
to slurp it, sweetened with honey from the Atlas, a sprinkling
of cinnamon and crushed almonds from the family farm.

If the world is that sweet and warm, if it is that mothering,
why then this perpetual scene of separation, this turning
out into the cold toward something he knew he'd love?

He lets go of the neighbors' boy's hand warming his own.
He refuses the warm porridge forever, renounces
his mother's embrace. It only lasted a month,

this partial answer, because even then everyone knew
that the sweet fruit they grew housed the bitterest seeds,
that piety is its own reward while belief only darkens

and deepens like the sea before them, a place
meant for those seeking life other than on this dry earth.
That's why prophets were welcomed here, calmly,
because God was like rain and they like the saplings

which know only the first verse to the sky's rainless hymn.
And that's why Africa's tallest minaret looms unfinished,
visible from the next town over, and for fifty leagues from the sea if
it were turned into a lighthouse for the ships that no longer come.

The merchant who'd built it, money made from smuggling
subsidized goods to Carthage and used Renaults from Rotterdam,
ran out of money, could not afford the mosque that was to stand
next to it, leaving its gray concrete bleaching in the sun.
There's enough history here to enable anyone to finish the thought.

It's useless then to track the fate of these travelers,
some, without life jackets, had never learned how to swim.
Why not let them live in text as they do in life?--they've lived
without words for so long--why not release them
from the pen's anchor and let them drift to their completion? 


11.

In a few weeks you'll see pedants here with binoculars
trying to catch a glimpse of the Ramadan crescent,
and if these migrants stick around here
time will belong to the departure of other travelers,

flocks of Um Bsisi follwing the sun's arch,
Japanese and Korean trawlers sailing to Gibraltar
or Suez chasing the last herring or sardine.

Where is she now in her time?--
her life dissolved in other people's minutes,
a sense of solitude her diligent companion
even when she lets go of herself to kindness.

He'll be there when she returns from the party,
he'll lie beside her when she sleeps. He'll say,
"Time belongs to the species, but your life belongs to me.

She'll laugh at his words, and remember what you,
Marcus Aurelius, had said about losing only the moment
at hand, how it circles in a ring of dead nerves,
how we stand impoverished before what is to come.

She'll have her answer to your elocution;
she'd always had an answer for you,
one she refuses to share even with herself.


12.

At last they set to sail. They slaughter a rooster,
douse blood on the Dido figurehead adorning the prow.
The seadog opens a canvas bag and pulls out a hookah.
His Egyptian assistant fills the smoke chamber with seawater,

twists the brass head into it, caking the slit with sand.
He fills the clay bowl with apple-flavored tobacco,
wraps it with foil, pokes it tenderly with a knife.
He picks embers from the going fire, places a few

on the aluminum crown, and inhales and blows
until the bottom vessel fills with a pearly fog,
the color of semen, I think, then hands the pipe hose
to the seadog who inhales his fill and hands it over

to the travelers in turn. The air smells sweet around us,
the breeze blows it away and brings it back tinged with iodine.
Their communion done, they embark except the one who
stands, the dead rooster in his hand, as if wanting

to entrust it to us, then digs a hurried hole to bury it in.
The boat, barely visible, leaves a leaden lacey ribbon
aiming directly for the burnt orange sun. As it reddens,
for a moment, their standing silhouettes eclipse it.

Then the sea restores its dominion, dark as the coffee cooling
in our cups. Dangling from the vine arbor, the lights reflect
a constellation on the table's dark top. I trace my fingers among them,
hoping conjecture would shine on the mind's calculus.

Between my unquiet eddies, Marcus Aurelius,
and the coursing water, the travelers' moment sails,
its tentacles sewing a rupture I had nursed for too long.







Renunciation
 

"The Sailor cannot see the North--but knows the Needle can--
The books were all torn apart, sliced along the spines
Light filled all the openings that she in her silence renounced

Still: her handwriting on the papers remembered us to her
The careful matching of the papers' edges was a road back

One night Muhummad was borne aloft by a winged horse
Taken from the Near Mosque to the Far Mosque

Each book likens itself to lichen,
stitching softly to tree trunks, to rocks

what was given into the Prophet's ears that night:
A changing of directions--now all the scattered tribes must pray:

Wonder well foundry, well sunborn, sundered and sound here
Well you be found here, foundered and found






Speech
 

How struck I was by that face, years ago, in the church mural:
Eve, being led by Christ through the broken gates of Hell.

She's been nominated for the position of Featured Saint
on the Icon of Belief, up against the dark horse candidate--

me: fever-ridden and delirious, a child in Vellore, unfolding
the packet around my neck that I was ordered not to open.

Inside, a folk cure, painted delicately in saffron.
Letters that I could not read.

Why I feel qualified for the position
based on letters I could not read amounts to this:

Neither you nor I can pronounce the difference
between the broken gates and the forbidden letters.

So what reason do we need to believe in icons or saints?
How might we otherwise remember--

without an image to fasten in that lonely place--
the rock on which a Prophet flung himself into fever?

Without an icon or church, spell "gates of Hell.
Spell "those years ago unfolding.

Recite to me please all the letters you are not able to read.
Spell "fling yourself skyward.

Spell "fever.







Rain
 

With thick strokes of ink the sky fills with rain.
Pretending to run for cover but secretly praying for more rain.

Over the echo of the water, I hear a voice saying my name.
No one in the city moves under the quick sightless rain.

The pages of my notebook soak, then curl. I've written:
"Yogis opened their mouths for hours to drink the rain.

The sky is a bowl of dark water, rinsing your face.
The window trembles; liquid glass could shatter into rain.

I am a dark bowl, waiting to be filled.
If I open my mouth now, I could drown in the rain.

I hurry home as though someone is there waiting for me.
The night collapses into your skin. I am the rain.






The Pampering of Leora
 

Therefore, no more recounting of dreams, a routine thing
that bores with expectations of invention, unfiltered
non sequiturs, unusual embraces

only from the practiced

young woman who everyday remembers
being a bride, she is changing behind that white curtain

Leora

fifteen again experiencing 
prematurely the pure suckling of a baby

fifteen with a virgin desire for pure suckling

something to do with jasmine
with jasmine tea
existing only without accident

It blooms while Leora sleeps
when she sleeps at night and it is also dark
for the jasmine

four hours

of tea sucking on blossoms, Cestrum nocturnum like
colostrums: the earliest secretions, and then only milk

from mother
--there it is

seven times over
jasmine bath after jasmine bath

till the tea can get no better

highest grade as stasis
all As

gets so boring, ka-put
to the test of innovation

all the right answers 

Leora

sees herself mermaid, eel, tiger
fish from waist down

form-fitting skirt of winks

under that bonefish or ladyfish profile: tail fins
already split, caught in transition from legs to fin

hybrid mutant bastard mestizo mulatto masala mule mix mutt
hm/bm/mmmmm

watered down (jasmine bath tea)
spiked (jasmine bath tea)

stands taller on tips of split tail fin
ps: pastiche, salmagundi when all dressed up

Leg and fin share custody 
so young men sacrifice only below the belt
to please her

many wounded soldiers
her company

From now on storming the beaches
rocks already aftermath, the breaking of dozens of sphinxes

the taming of sandstone lions and griffins, gargoyles
Leora takes to breast anything capable of sucking

and being filled, no ban on leeches and vipers
that stick out like misplaced overdeveloped hairs

and while in position, her free hand
shaves the heads of Medusa's children screaming
for more nursing

with her eyes closed, her free handy blade, sharpened
life line

The liquids of history therefore tend to ferment; the beverages for walks down
memory lane therefore become pungent cheeses and wines, the odes
to bitterness and sweetness happen. This is also desirable. Taste depends
on how the glass tilts, how tongue curls.
What's difficult
is maintaining gaps as gaps. A sustainable nothingness.
But something enters. Sustainable nothingness
looks like a niche.
Ghosts and spirits of what's been lost. A young woman looks over her shoulder.

Close watching of what's fading does not mean the change from substance to spirit
would be observed. On the tippy-tips of split tail fin looking over her shoulder
a long line for the nurse, exceptional business, nonstop nursing
and the milk won't stop, years are at the end of the line.

Pull the plug on a nearby respirator (how on earth?)
        (don't assume location, location, location)
the substance travels the line
joins the community of electricity, colonies of gigantic storms
on the sun

and appearances in auroras
that the mermaid sits under as under any canopy

nonstop

The spell of the tide tailored to make the one falling under its influence fall more
willingly. It feels nothing like falling at all: Leora describes rehabilitation

Sand sparkles remembering having been alive
only once
Leora's eyes

sparkle upon contact with crabs and their incredible redness
that ought to teach her something about fire she does not know

with top-heavy ways
of knowing

      (the brain should travel the stations of the body, and one day
       the eyes and navel, when the eyes accompany the brain,
       line up in a row)

                               --then a real reason for revision
Dream on 

Accordingly, pureness of the situation milks its own purity
Fantastic and looks disgusting

        (no matter where the eyes are--candidate
         for truth)

but purity is still pure following
such a milking

The mermaid's pregnancy has to be called immaculate after repeated searches for the 
limits. Lost without those. Pure. Last resort and best explanation for birth of a human
baby from a mermaid without a human pelvis or womb. The best xrays
cannot find them. Machines arrive on the beach and leave defective.

Leora

continues nursing
her baby first in line

The milk is pure. It does not need to be pasteurized. Makes                               (empty)
no one ill. Nothing in it allows allergies. The chemistry                                       (empty)
of the milk is pure.                                                                                         (empty)
The molecules of the tabernacle of purity.

              (as if they are empty)                                                                  (nothing is right
                                                                                                                               here)

Law

Flattened out they are like flattened tetrahedrons,
probably are smashed pendulums

Mystery and Solitude in Topeka
 

          
          Afternoon darkens into evening. A man falls deeper and deeper into the slow spiral of sleep, into the drift of it, the length of it, through what feels like mist, and comes at last to an open door through which he passes without knowing why, then again without knowing why goes to a room where he sits and waits while the room seems to close around him and the dark is darker than any he has known, and he feels something forming within him without being sure what it is, its hold on him growing, as if a story were about to unfold, in which two characters, Pleasure and Pain, commit the same crime, the one that is his, that he will confess to again and again, until it means nothing.





No Words Can Describe It
 

          
          How those fires burned that are no longer, how the weather worsened, how the shadow of the seagull vanished without a trace. Was it the end of a season, the end of a life? Was it so long ago it seems it might never have been? What is it in us that lives in the past and longs for the future, or lives in the future and longs for the past? And what does it matter when light enters the room where a child sleeps and the waking mother, opening her eyes, wishes more than anything to be unwakened by what she cannot name?





The Minister of Culture Gets His Wish
 

          
          The Minister of Culture goes home after a grueling day at the office. He lies on his bed and tries to think of nothing, but nothing hap-pens or, more precisely, does not happen. Nothing is elsewhere doing what nothing does, which is to expand the dark. But the minister is patient, and slowly things slip away--the walls of his house, the park across the street, his friends in the next town. He believes that nothing has finally come to him and, in its absent way, is saying, "Darling, you know how much I have always wanted to please you, and now I have come. And what is more, I have come to stay. 





The Mysterious Arrival of an Unusual Letter
 

          
          It had been a long day at the office and a long ride back to the small apartment where I lived. When I got there I flicked on the light and saw on the table an envelope with my name on it. Where was the clock? Where was the calendar? The handwriting was my father's, but he had been dead for forty years. As one might, I began to think that maybe, just maybe, he was alive, living a secret life somewhere nearby. How else to explain the envelope? To steady myself, I sat down, opened it, and pulled out the letter. "Dear Son, was the way it began. "Dear Son and then nothing.





Futility in Key West
 

          
          I was stretched out on the couch, about to doze off, when I imagined a small figure asleep on a couch identical to mine. "Wake up, little man, wake up, I cried. "The one you're waiting for is rising from the sea, wrapped in spume, and soon will come ashore. Beneath her feet the melancholy garden will turn bright green and the breezes will be light as babies' breath. Wake up, before this creature of the deep is gone and everything goes blank as sleep. How hard I try to wake the little man, how hard he sleeps. And the one who rose from the sea, her moment gone, how hard she has become--how hard those burning eyes, that burning hair.





Would-Land
 

5 am.  One-quarter past.
Distant chimes inform me this.

A bell peal knells the mist.
And sunlight's 

not yet bludgeoning. 
But some light gets blood going.  

Last night it was snowing
and now 

every path's a pall.
Though mine the only footfalls

at this hour of awe. Above 
hangs a canopy of needle leaf.  

Below, the season's 
mean deceit--

that everything stays 
white and clean. 

It doesn't, of course, 
but I wish it. My prayers

are green with this intent, 
imploring winter wrens 

to trill and begging scuttling bucks 
come back.  

There's something that I lack.
A wryneck 

bullet-beaks a branch.
His woodworm didn't have a chance.

What I miss, 
I've never had.

But I am not a ghost. 
I am a guest. 

And life is thirst, 
at best.  

So do not strike me, Heart.  
I am, too, tinder. 

I'm flammable 
as birch bark, even damp. 

Blue spruce, bee-eater--
be sweeter to me. 

Let larksong shudder 
to its January wheeze,

but gift these hands a happiness
just once.  

It is half passed. 
And I am cold. 

Another peal has tolled.
I've told the sum of my appeals.

I need not watch for fox. 
They do not congregate at dawn.

But I would, 
were I one.





Easter
 

is my season
of defeat.

Though all
is green 

and death 
is done,  

I feel alone.
As if the stone

rolled off
from the head

of the tomb
is lodged

in the doorframe
of my room,

and everyone
I've ever loved

lives happily
just past

my able reach.
And each time 

Jesus rises
I'm reminded

of this marble
fact:

they are not
coming back.






Precipice
 

The border 
of a thing.

Its edge 
or hem.

The selvage, 
the skirt,

a perimeter's 
trim.

The blow 
of daylight's 

end and 
nighttime's 

beginning.
A fence 

or a rim, 
a margin, 

a fringe.
And this: 

the grim,
stingy 

doorstep
where 

the lapse 
of passage

happens.
That slim 

lip of land,
the liminal 

verge
that slips

you past
your brink.

Where 
and when

you 
blink.





Moppet
 

          
          Consider the rip for a mouth, the rip in the crotch, the hank of hair,consider the flair for ill-fortune, the empty stare, the done deal with sorrow, the rich and rare nest-egg of dreams, the share and sharealike in matters of loss, the payments in kind, the liking for blindbets, for truth or dare; consider the threadbare get up, the make-upbeyond repair, the tin-tack teeth, consider the dungeon voicewanting nothing more than bare house-room, and nothing less than hand-in-glove, a pigeon pair given over to make and mend, to touch and go, to wear and tear, and all it takes is this: forswear  flint and fire, stay silent, be white on white, live in dead air.





Conversation with Slugs and Sarah
 

Up late watching slug porn, you confess
you had a boyfriend who could spin you 

like that, slug grace and slug ballet--we don't
touch the topic of slime--and those eyes 

dangling from tentacle tips must be a
kind of love or lust, sighting farther and

nearer all at once. (But are those eyes?)  
Slug sublimity suggests love's a drag, 

touch that lingers and leaves a wet trail of 
memory and... What did we do before 

YouTube? Boob tube. Boobs we have none; slugs, 
of course, don't care, can't tell girl from boy, 

(being, you know, hermaphrodites), and only 
want flesh to fly. Forget their infamous 

languor--here's litheness in loving, buoyant 
miracles of want, one slug spiraling 

on the axis of another like a globe 
slapped by an insolent hand. Neither old 

nor young, we're familiar with sluggishness, 
too tired to explain why nothing makes us 

spin like that: a-swirl, a pirouette, a gyre! 
It's either fucking or marriage, I say,

saying more than I mean. Why can't lust be
love and love be lust? you're always asking, 

even now as the slugs begin their sluggish
withdrawal--each complete in love and lust;

each mother and father to what they've made
together; each alone, content, and free.

This Landscape Before Me
 

Is unwritten, though it has lived in violence.

First the factory stood, quiet as an asylum. 
Then the annihilating mallee with its red fists of blossoms 
and the mountain ash creeping over it like a stain.

I have no proof, but I tell you 
there were leadlight windows here once, barred.
They cast a little striped light on the women.

Now in scrub and yellow broom I stand on a history 
braided and unbraided by stiff Irish wrists. 
The rope and span and carded wool are unpicked
as are their faces and names.

Londonderry, Cork, Galway, Kildare-- 
as I say the words they are sucked away
to a hemisphere in darkness.

I will not presume to say
what suffering is or how it was meted out in this place.
At what point it breaks a body I cannot tell. 

But this morning I saw a young rabbit 
hunched in brush and shadow.
I saw its lesioned face, its legs too thin to scramble,
the blood-berry red and pink scab of its eye. 

It had caught the disease 
we brought here for it
and wanted a quiet place to die.  

And it was lucky, or as lucky as it would get--
there was time and light, the hawks and dogs
had not been written yet, and were still out of sight.







Galahs Skull
 

I find it in a field of feathers, pink-crested,
a knuckle of bone picked clean by the wind,
a pale mohawk mounted on stone.

I bend down. Zeroed out of its head 
are two sockets, two airy planets
full with sun, and taking asylum in one

a millipede is coiled, a slick black hypnotist.
Polished, it spirals in on itself
like one of Saint Hilda's fossil snakes

we studied in the school chapel's stained glass. 
As if the eye could dig itself into the earth 
then extend a curled feeler out, like a fern.

I turn the skull round in my palm like a pebble--
it will not settle. Otherwise, all is still: 
the grasses claw in, the world does not tilt.

Even the blue stand of scrub grows over;
it has nothing on its mind. But the skull 
will outlast the summer, a thought cut short,

and I will pass it every day as I walk
and stop just here, where the air hones its teeth
on bone, where the mind remembers itself

only as a shell, and I will mourn what was once 
a world: one eye rolled to the daylight moon, 
the other pressed down into the earth. 






Imago
 

          
          From my cell I was staring at a cloud, a dog decaying in the woods, etc., as I took up the long-awaited sequel to my Confessions. By this time my hand was so far away that it looked like a small hairless spider whose progress I could hardly help but follow, from the corner of one eye, as it went on filling page after page in a notebook the size of a stamp with words too small for anyone to read. I looked up and noticed my bars had turned to gold. And before I forget, I'd like to be the first to congratulate everyone who has not committed suicide up until now. Camouflaged and lightless congregation, the world will never know your names, never know of its debt to you, or what you suffered; with what uncomplaining anguish you sacrificed the one thing all hold most dear, most have in common, the sense of being completely different from anybody else--it just vanished at some point, having attained its sexually mature and winged stage. You had a great vision about it, but told no one. We have misnamed death life and life death. You saw another world, and it was precisely the same as this one. This time you told everyone, until someone asked you very nicely to quiet down. And the weather--everything you have heard on that subject is a serious understatement. The scarlet horrors were preparing to file in for my ignominious obsequies, already they swarmed freely over my body. Then, there was no weather. I can't tell you how perfect that was. As it happens I had been gazing up at the dusk stars, as I can be found doing more or less day and night, for I like to think they are growing younger as I die, come by some time and tell me what you think. Under torture--some atrocious form of tickling, for example--I guess I'd describe myself as a fairly good egg in hot water. Family motto roughly translates, April wizards bring May blizzards. We tend to be apprehended eventually, after a futile but all the more spirited attempt at first degree self-impersonation; however, this is not the time for levity, we happen to be speaking of a serious medical goodnight kiss. Traditionally, we are then detained at a local mental facility known for its celebrated alumni, though in recent decades secret and permanent socialist elements in the government have seen to it that the lowest scum of humanity now appear to have open access to those once hallowed halls smeared with our shit and vomit. What I'm getting at is this: after a relatively brief stay, we are invariably released with some deranged doctor's or other's blessing, a mixture of relief and disgust on the part of the staff, and the secret eye-signal that will get you into any movie house in Milwaukee free for the next year. Some of us like to get together once a day, rain or shine, and gather furtively at the picnic grounds under those tall wavering candleflame pines, where neither moth nor rust can reach, nor faintest scream, and exchange ribald tales verging on satanic perversion, each drawing his iridescent injection from the same oceanic martini, very dry, about two tears' worth of vermouth, in an unremembered dream.
        




Blade
 

          
          If I stare into it long enough, the point comes when I don't know what it's called, a condition in which lacerations are liable to occur, like a slip of the tongue; when a drop of blood might billow in a glass of water, blooming in velvet detonation and imparting to it the colorless, tasteless and originless fear in which I wake.

Bees of Eleusis
 

Unless a grain of wheat goes into the ground and dies, it remains nothing but a grain of wheat.          --John 12:24
          The ingredients gathered, a few small red tufts of the dream spoor per sheaf of Demeter's blonde wheat, reaped in mourning, in silence, ground up with the pollen and mixed into white wine and honey. These stored forms of light taken under the ground. Taken by mouth. First those who by birth hold in secret the word; then placed on the tongues of the new ones, into whose ears it is meant to be whispered. Word murdered, forgotten so long ago, placed as a kiss on the lips of the soon-to-be-no-longer breathing who mean to enter death with open eyes, with mouths saying Death, what death? We have no word for it in our country where the bride of a brighter oblivion reigns. Not the purple-haired god but the child queen, the raped girl, come back from the dead hand in hand with the child she conceived there, returned in a resurrected virginity, wind through green wheat. Present-day site of a minor refinery in Christ. Although by the tenth generation already the children of light ("in their dark garments) had trampled and smashed and generally raped the two thousand years of this precinct and its holy meal, intolerable mirror. Men who'd designed and bowed down to a law derived from the sayings of one who appeared here to say that the law is abolished, it is too late, all that is over with. Men who bungled their way through the next eighteen centuries before finally descending into the earth themselves, and what they found there they used, and we thank you for destroying the destroyers of the world. And here at the end this is as good as any other entrance to the underplace, journey of the fallen leaf back to the branch, to the bees of Eleusis among olive blossoms, untroubled among crimson wildflowers. Four thousand years later: same flowers, same bees.





Home for Christmas
 

          
          Fifteen years later the old tollbooth keeper is still at his post but cannot break a twenty, regrettably, his brains blown out, or provide the forgotten directions. I did phone, what do you think? Before I can blink I am parked out front of the unbelievably small, unlighted house.I've got my finger on the buried bell, nothing. For hours I've been walking around, and I hate to be the one to tell you this, but no one is home in Zanesville, Ohio. My dusty toothbrush waits for me, of this I feel quite sure, my teenage image in the dust-dimmed mirror waits. Only now I'm afraid I'll be forced to disturb the slow fine snow of dust that's been coming down, year after year, on my blanket and hair, and put on my dust-covered clothes, and walk without making a sound, trailing my eternal lunar footprints, down the windless hall, and down the stairs at last. It's not going to happen overnight. But one of these days I'll arrive; I will go down to sit with the father. The elderly father, strictly speaking, of never really having been there.I will sit down and eat my bowl of dust like all the rest. 





Circle
 

          
          Say I had no choice, this weightless finger touched my tongue and told me to, it taught me; when kinder and more subtle methods failed, it put a gun to my head, a zero seared coldly in one temple, electrode glued chill to the other, the sniffer dogs rooting and snuffling in my crotch, the small white doorless room, the laser flashlight in one eye. You can't hear the voice when it utters let there be speech, yet I faithfully spoke what I thought I was supposed to, inspired idiot, or dummy on that lap of language, the words themselves more real than I, words here before we were and when we are not again. So I blurted it out, my initial soliloquies, what I could catch through the static, giving my head a good thump now and then like one of those black-and-white tv sets, and projecting, those were some vast stadiums, the first row of faces as far as near stars if there at all, never having the faintest idea what it meant, the microphone dead, I did my best, tell them. Inch-thick rope for ascot, eyes put out, chained to my oars, all the others long vanished: the first minute of death is so long, like the first minute of consciousness there in the infinite darkness of somebody weeping, you never arrive, never reach shore, never mind with what clarity you seem to hear with your lips distant roar of surf breaking. I pulled too for those who'd come later, I'm guessing, singing in their names as well, sort of lip-synching but singing twice as loud, strapped to the mast, earways cleared, though I heard nothing but nothing, blue. Making up what I couldn't make out, and all that uproarious and pitiless derision I had to raise my voice above, I mere link--out on that unknown ocean beating at my ears, just as at the beginning, the mother's heart booming softly; from nowhere it came, like me, months before I arrived to take up the sorry job of being me, whatever a month was, whatever I was then, blind little dolphin with a thumb in its mouth, whatever a mouth was; poor mother mourning her own mother's dying, over the actual ocean she lay, a strong stone's throw from the Ohio or that poisoned ghost of it. Mother of my mother dying away from this world just as I was about to die into it. I see them there, up to their knees, gathered as for a baptism, cross traced in hydrochloric acid on a tiny forehead, right there at the dead water's edge a scythe of moon, a meteor in arc of falling axe of gold for the severing of hairy umbilical rope, hear me out! I saw they were standing watch over her, and my mother's conspicuous absence, wincing at the constant cough; and I saw her whom I would never meet, nearing peace in the scarlet Magdalenean cerements, clenching lightly between thumb and skeletal forefinger the scarlet egg, and the wide river's sundering undertow sucking to its breast her shrunken body, fetal in her narrow bed, nothing but a huckleberry craft by now just vanishing around the first bend, more and more lost from sight by my mother, twenty-two, unaided by lunatic male she'd been sentenced to, from Goethe-phase to Trakl-phase. And she breaks down in her hotel room, in bullet-pocked Vienna, helplessly swept down the blind unwept current still flowing, sadness's chemistry, horror's and guilt's, to this day through my veins. Months before we met, I listening to her crying, it went on forever, how not hear it, how not be fed it, in a shoreless darkness of sorrowing I listened, still listen, now watch this and pay close attention: nothing else there, only a listening called me, no name even, till they grave it in stone. Until we finally met, I watched her face rise on the horizon. Then there was some loud mutual screaming in the even more terrible blindness called light. Long before I invented the first word it taught me, it told me the others, so many. So only what was never mine is mine; and when no one is listening I sing what it means to me, even now, hearing my voice through my own disappearing, farther away every day, my mother's mother's fate and mine now one as I board the ocean liner at three months of age and arrive in New York, filled with space and time.





It Is Out Of Focus

For My Wife Cutting My Hair
 

You move around me expertly like the good, round 
Italian barber I went to in Florence, 
years before we met, his scissors 
a razor he sharpened on a belt.

But at first when you were learning, I feared 
for my neck, saw my ears like sliced fruit 
on the newspapered floor. Taking us back in time, 
you cleverly clipped my head in a flat-top.

The years in between were styles no one had ever seen, 
or should see again: when the wind rose 
half my hair floated off in feathers, 
the other half bristling, brief as a brush.

In the chair, almost asleep, I hear the bright 
scissors dancing. Hear you hum, full-breasted as Aida, 
carefully trimming the white from my temples, 
so no one, not even I, will know.

          --The former President lost his temper. Loss of content in our public life. Only forms remain, intonation, affect. Why did you  yell in my mom's house? Radhika asks our neighbor.--She sounded like she does when her hands shake. She does not want to be there. Bryant calls to ask about her things. A tape on osteoperosis. No. Foundations of Economics (from the 1930s). No. The Soviet shelf. No. The Nazi shelf. No. The Greeks, the Moslems. No. The speech and drama shelf. No. Encyclopedias, no. Check reigsters back to 1964. No. Harry Truman, no. Mrs. Ike, no.--Was her reading too intense? --Grief is excess of sound. Anger is excess of form. Sadness can lack, or still exceed. Excess is overtone, the note beyond the note you sound. Without the tone, there is no object. Did I kill Bin Laden? No. But I tried.--My task is to inventory sentences, place them in order, box them up and ship them in a container. They are a sturdy furniture, haphazard art. They are boxes of papers, bills, pieces of a dissertation. A computer shopper magazine (discard). Titles whose aura was a life, or two, or three. The house is now full of light. A girl wanders through the rooms, trying keys at the windows. My mother knows none of this.--My father might be in the garden, or the scarecrow that wears his hat. Let him wander the house this last, inspect the plumbing, lights, air conditioning, the rows of beans, sort through medals, papers, release them as excess.posted by Susan at 12:44 PM 0 comments





Wildpeace
 

Not the peace of a cease-fire,
not even the vision of the wolf and the lamb,
but rather
as in the heart when the excitement is over
and you can talk only about a great weariness.
I know that I know how to kill,
that makes me an adult.
And my son plays with a toy gun that knows
how to open and close its eyes and say Mama.
A peace 
without the big noise of beating swords into ploughshares,
without words, without
the thud of the heavy rubber stamp: let it be
light, floating, like lazy white foam.
A little rest for the wounds--
who speaks of healing?
(And the howl of the orphans is passed from one generation
to the next, as in a relay race:
the baton never falls.)

Let it come 
like wildflowers,
suddenly, because the field
must have it: wildpeace.





Jerusalem
 

        "Let's be the same wound if we must bleed.         Let's fight side by side, even if the enemy          is ourselves: I am yours, you are mine.                        --Tommy Olofsson, Sweden
I'm not interested in
who suffered the most.
I'm interested in
people getting over it.

Once when my father was a boy 
a stone hit him on the head.
Hair would never grow there.
Our fingers found the tender spot
and its riddle: the boy who has fallen
stands up. A bucket of pears
in his mother's doorway welcomes him home.
The pears are not crying.
Later his friend who threw the stone 
says he was aiming at a bird.
And my father starts growing wings.

Each carries a tender spot: 
something our lives forgot to give us.
A man builds a house and says,
"I am native now.
A woman speaks to a tree in place 
of her son. And olives come.
A child's poem says,
"I don't like wars,
they end up with monuments.
He's painting a bird with wings
wide enough to cover two roofs at once.

Why are we so monumentally slow?
Soldiers stalk a pharmacy: 
big guns, little pills.
If you tilt your head just slightly
it's ridiculous.

There's a place in my brain
where hate won't grow.
I touch its riddle: wind, and seeds.
Something pokes us as we sleep.

It's late but everything comes next.






Erstwhile Harbinger Auspices
 

Erstwhile means long time gone.
 A harbinger is sent before to help,
 and also a sign of things
 to come. Like this blue
 stapler I bought at Staples.
 Did you know in ancient Rome
 priests called augurs studied
 the future by carefully watching
 whether birds were flying
 together or alone, making what
 honking or beeping noises
 in what directions? It was called
 the auspices. The air
 was thus a huge announcement.
 Today it's completely 
 transparent, a vase. Inside it
 flowers flower. Thus
 a little death scent. I have 
 no master but always wonder,
 what is making my master sad?
 Maybe I do not know him.
 This morning I made extra coffee
 for the beloved and covered 
 the cup with a saucer. Skeleton
 I thought, and stay
 very still, whatever it was 
 will soon pass by and be gone.






Schwinn
 

I hate the phrase "inner life. My attic hurts,
 and I'd like to quit the committee
 for naming tornadoes. Do you remember
 how easy and sad it was to be young
 and defined by our bicycles? My first
 was yellow, and though it was no Black
 Phantom or Sting-Ray but merely a Varsity
 I loved the afternoon it was suddenly gone,
 chasing its apian flash through the neighborhoods
 with my father in vain. Like being a nuclear
 family in a television show totally unaffected
 by a distant war. Then we returned
 to the green living room to watch the No Names
 hold our Over the Hill Gang under
 the monotinted chromatic defeated Super
 Bowl waters. 1973, year of the Black Fly
 caught in my Jell-O. Year of the Suffrage Building
 on K Street NW where a few minor law firms
 mingle proudly with the Union of Butchers
 and Meat Cutters. A black hand
 already visits my father in sleep, moving
 up his spine to touch his amygdala. I will
 never know a single thing anyone feels,
 just how they say it, which is why I am standing
 here exactly, covered in shame and lightning,
 doing what I'm supposed to do.






As I Cross the Heliopause at Midnight, I Think of My Mission
 

Drunker than Voyager I
 but not as Voyager 2 I rode my blue
 bike back through the darkness
 to my lonely geode cave of light
 awaiting nothing under the punctured
 dome. I had achieved escape
 velocity drinking clear liquid starlight
 at the Thunderbird with a fingerless
 Russian hedge fund inspector and one
 who called himself The Champ. All
 night I felt fine crystals cutting 
 my lips like rising up through
 a hailstorm. And the great vacuum
 cleaner that cannot be filled moved
 through my chest, gathering
 conversation dust and discharging
 it through my borehole. During
 one of many silences The Champ
 took off his face and thus were many
 gears to much metallic laughter
 revealed. Long ago I forgot
 the word which used to mean in truth
 but now expresses disbelief. So
 quickly did my future come. You who 
 are floating past me on your inward way,
 please inform those glowing faces
 who first gave me this shove I have 
 managed to rotate my brilliant
 golden array despite their instructions.






April Snow
 

Today in El Paso all the planes are asleep on the runway. The world
 is in a delay. All the political consultants drinking whiskey keep
 their heads down, lifting them only to look at the beautiful scarred
 waitress who wears typewriter keys as a necklace. They jingle
 when she brings them drinks. Outside the giant plate glass windows 
 the planes are completely covered in snow, it piles up on the wings.
 I feel like a mountain of cell phone chargers. Each of the various
 faiths of our various fathers keeps us only partly protected. I don't 
 want to talk on the phone to an angel. At night before I go to sleep
 I am already dreaming. Of coffee, of ancient generals, of the faces
 of statues each of which has the eternal expression of one of my feelings.
 I examine my feelings without feeling anything. I ride my blue bike
 on the edge of the desert. I am president of this glass of water.






Abd el-Hadi Fights a Superpower
 

In his life
 he neither wrote nor read.
 In his life he
 didn't cut down a single tree,
 didn't slit the throat
 of a single calf.
 In his life he did not speak
 of the New York Times
 behind its back,
 didn't raise 
 his voice to a soul
 except in his saying:
 "Come in, please,
 by God, you can't refuse.
  
                --
  
 Nevertheless--
 his case is hopeless,
 his situation
 desperate.
 His God-given rights are a grain of salt
 tossed into the sea.
  
 Ladies and gentlemen of the jury:
 about his enemies
 my client knows not a thing.
And I can assure you,
 were he to encounter
 the entire crew
 of the aircraft carrier Enterprise,
 he'd serve them eggs
 sunny-side up,
 and labneh
 fresh from the bag.






Exodus
 

The street is empty
 as a monk's memory,
 and faces explode in the flames
 like acorns--
 and the dead crowd the horizon
 and doorways.
 No vein can bleed
 more than it already has,
 no scream will rise
 higher than it's already risen.
 We will not leave!
  
 Everyone outside is waiting
 for the trucks and the cars
 loaded with honey and hostages.
 We will not leave!
 The shields of light are breaking apart
 before the rout and the siege;
 outside, everyone wants us to leave.
 But we will not leave!
  
 Ivory white brides
 behind their veils
 slowly walk in captivity's glare, waiting,
 and everyone outside wants us to leave,
 but we will not leave!
  
 The big guns pound the jujube groves,
 destroying the dreams of the violets,
 extinguishing bread, killing the salt,
 unleashing thirst
 and parching lips and souls.
 And everyone outside is saying:
 "What are we waiting for?
 Warmth we're denied,
 the air itself has been seized!
 Why aren't we leaving?
 Masks fill the pulpits and brothels,
 the places of ablution.
 Masks cross-eyed with utter amazement;
 they do not believe what is now so clear,
 and fall, astonished,
 writhing like worms, or tongues.
 We will not leave!
  
 Are we in the inside only to leave?
 Leaving is just for the masks,
 for pulpits and conventions.
 Leaving is just
 for the siege-that-comes-from-within,
 the siege that comes from the Bedouin's loins,
 the siege of the brethren
 tarnished by the taste of the blade
 and the stink of crows.
 We will not leave!
  
 Outside they're blocking the exits
 and offering their blessings to the impostor,
 praying, petitioning
 Almighty God for our deaths.

Meeting at an Airport
 

You asked me once,
 on our way back
 from the midmorning
 trip to the spring:
 "What do you hate,
 and who do you love?
  
 And I answered,
 from behind the eyelashes
 of my surprise,
 my blood rushing
 like the shadow
 cast by a cloud of starlings:
 "I hate departure . . .
 I love the spring
 and the path to the spring,
 and I worship the middle
 hours of morning.
 And you laughed . . .
 and the almond tree blossomed
 and the thicket grew loud with nightingales.
  
 . . . A question 
 now four decades old:
 I salute that question's answer;
 and an answer
 as old as your departure;
 I salute that answer's question . . .
  
 And today,
 it's preposterous,
 here we are at a friendly airport
 by the slimmest of chances,
 and we meet.
 Ah, Lord!
 we meet.
 And here you are
 asking--again,
 it's absolutely preposterous--
 I recognized you
 but you didn't recognize me.
 "Is it you?!
 But you wouldn't believe it.
 And suddenly 
 you burst out and asked:
 "If you're really you,
 What do you hate
 and who do you love?!
  
 And I answered--
 my blood
 fleeing the hall,
 rushing in me
 like the shadow
 cast by a cloud of starlings:
 "I hate departure,
 and I love the spring,
and the path to the spring,
 and I worship the middle
 hours of morning.
  
 And you wept,
 and flowers bowed their heads,
 and doves in the silk of their sorrow stumbled.






The New Intelligence
 

After knowledge extinguished the last of the beautiful
 fires our worship had failed to prolong, we walked
 back home through pedestrian daylight, to a residence
  
 humbler than the one left behind. A door without mystery,
 a room without theme. For the hour that we spend
 complacent at the window overlooking the garden,
  
 we observe an arrangement in rust and gray-green,
 a vagueness at the center whose slow, persistent
 movements some sentence might explain if we had time
  
 or strength for sentences. To admit that what falls
 falls solitarily, lost in the permanent dusk of the particular.
 That the mind that fear and disenchantment fatten
  
 comes to boss the world around it, morbid as the damp-
 fingered guest who rearranges the cheeses the minute the host
 turns to fix her a cocktail. A disease of the will, the way
  
 false birch branches arch and interlace from which
 hands dangle last leaf-parchments and a very large array
 of primitive bird-shapes. Their pasted feathers shake
  
 in the aftermath of the nothing we will ever be content
 to leave the way we found it. I love that about you.
 I love that when I call you on the long drab days practicality
  
 keeps one of us away from the other that I am calling
 a person so beautiful to me that she has seen my awkwardness
 on the actual sidewalk but she still answers anyway.
  
 I say that when I fell you fell beside me and the concrete
 refused to apologize. That a sparrow sat for a spell
 on the windowsill today to communicate the new intelligence.
  
 That the goal of objectivity depends upon one's faith
 in the accuracy of one's perceptions, which is to say
 a confidence in the purity of the perceiving instrument.
  
 I won't be dying after all, not now, but will go on living dizzily
 hereafter in reality, half-deaf to reality, in the room
 perfumed by the fire that our inextinguishable will begins.






The Cloud Corporation
 

1
  
 The clouds part revealing a mythology of clouds
 assembled in light of earliest birds, an originary
 text over water over time, and that without which
  
 the clouds part revealing an apology for clouds
 implicit in the air where the clouds had been
 recently witnessed rehearsing departure, a heartfelt phrase
  
 in the push of the airborne drops and crystals
 over water over time--how being made to think
 oneself an obstruction between the observer
  
 and the object or objects under surveillance or even
 desired--or if I am felt to be beside the point
 then I have wanted that, but to block a path is like
  
 not being immaterial enough, or being too much
 when all they want from you now is your station
 cleared of its personal effects please and vanish--
  
 not that they'd ever just come out and say it when
 all that darting around of the eyes, all that shaky
 camouflage of paper could only portend the beginning of the
  
 end of your tenure at this organization, and remember
 a capacity to draw meaning out of such seeming
 accidence landed one here to begin with, didn't it.
    
    
 2
  
 The clouds part revealing an anatomy of clouds
 viewed from the midst of human speculation, a business
 project undertaken in a bid to acquire and retain
  
 control of the formation and movement of clouds.
 As late afternoons I have witnessed the distant
 towers borrow luster from a bourbon sun, in-box
  
 empty, surround sound on, all my money made
 in lieu of conversation--where conversation indicates
 the presence of desire in the parties to embark on
  
 exchange of spirit, hours forzando with heartfelt phrase--
 made metaphor for it, the face on the clock tower
 bright as a meteor, as if a torch were held against
  
 likelihood to illuminate the time so I could watch
 the calm silent progress of its hands from the luxury
 appointments of my office suite, the tumult below
  
 or behind me out of mind, had not my whole attention
 been riveted by the human figure stood upon
 the tower's topmost pinnacle, himself surveying 
  
 the clouds of the future parting in antiquity, a figure
 not to be mistaken, tranquilly pacing a platform
 with authority: the chief executive officer of clouds.
    

 3
  
 The clouds part revealing blueprints of the clouds
 built in glass-front factories carved into cliff-faces
 which, prior to the factories' recent construction,
  
 provided dorms for clans of hamadryas baboons,
 a species revered in ancient Egypt as attendants
 of Thoth, god of wisdom, science, and measurement.
  
 Fans conveying clouds through aluminum ducts
 can be heard from up to a mile away, depending on
 air temperature, humidity, the absence or presence
  
 of any competing sound, its origin and its character.
 It is no more impossible to grasp the baboon's 
 full significance in Egyptian religious symbolism
  
 than it is to determine why clouds we manufacture
 provoke in an audience more positive, lasting
 response than do comparable clouds occurring in nature.
  
 Even those who consider natural clouds products
 of conscious manufacture seem to prefer that a merely
 human mind lie behind the products they admire.
  
 This development may be a form of self-exalting
 or else another adaptation in order that we find
 the hum of machinery comforting through darkness.
    

 4
  
 The clouds part revealing there's no place left to sit
 myself down except for a single wingback chair
 backed into a corner to face the window in which
  
 the clouds part revealing the insouciance of clouds
 cavorting over the backs of the people in the field
 who cut the ripened barley, who gather it in sheaves,
  
 who beat grain from the sheaves with wooden flails,
 who shake it loose from the scaly husk around it,
 who throw the now threshed grain up into the gently
  
 palm-fanned air whose steady current carries off
 the chaff as the grain falls to the floor, who collect
 the grain from the floor painstakingly to grind it
  
 into flour, who bake the flour into loaves the priest will offer
 in the sanctuary, its walls washed white like milk.
 To perform it repeatedly, to perform it each time
  
 as if the first, to walk the dim corridor believing that 
 the conference it leads to might change everything,
 to adhere to a possibility of reward, of betterment,
  
 of moving above, with effort, the condition into which
 one has been born, to whom do I owe the pleasure
 of the hum to which I have been listening too long.

    
 5
  
 The clouds part revealing the advocates of clouds,
 believers in people, ideas and things, the workers
 of the united fields of clouds, supporters of the wars
  
 to keep clouds safe, the devotees of heartfelt phrase
 and belief you can change with water over time.
 It is the habit of a settled population to give ear to
  
 whatever is desirable will come to pass, a caressing
 confidence--but one unfortunately not borne out
 by human experience, for most things people desire
  
 have been desired ardently for thousands of years
 and observe--they are no closer to realization today
 than in Ramses' time. Nor is there cause to believe
  
 they will lose their coyness on some near tomorrow.
 Attempts to speed them on have been undertaken
 from the beginning; plans to force them overnight
  
 are in copious, antagonistic operation today, and yet
 they have thoroughly eluded us, and chances are
 they will continue to elude us until the clouds part
  
 in a flash of autonomous, ardent, local brainwork--
 but when the clouds start to knit back together again,
 we'll dismiss the event as a glitch in transmission.

    
 6
  
 The clouds part revealing a congregation of bodies
 united into one immaterial body, a fictive person
 around whom the air is blurred with money, force
  
 from which much harm will come, to whom my welfare
 matters nothing. I sense without turning the light
 from their wings, their eyes; they preen themselves
  
 on the fire escape, the windowsill, their pink feet
 vulnerable--a mistake to think of them that way.
 If I turn around, the room might not be full of wings
  
 capable of acting, in many respects, as a single being,
 which is to say that I myself may be the source of
 what I sense, but am no less powerless to change it.
  
 Always around me, on my body, in my mouth, I fear them
 and their love of money, everything I do without
 thinking to help them make it. And if I am felt to be
  
 beside the point, I have wanted that, to live apart
 from what depends on killing me a little bit to keep
 itself alive, and yet not happily, with all its needs
  
 and comforts met, but fattened so far past that point
 I am engrossed, and if I picture myself outside of it
 it isn't me anymore, but a parasite cast out, inviable.
    
    
 7
  
 The clouds part revealing the distinction between
 words without meaning and meaning without words,
 a phenomenon of nature, the westbound field
  
 of low air pressure developing over water over time
 and warm, saturated air on the sea surface rising 
 steadily replaced by cold air from above, the cycle
  
 repeating, the warm moving upward into massive
 thunderclouds, the cold descending into the eye
 around which bands of thunderclouds spiral, counter-
  
 clockwise, often in the hundreds, the atmospheric
 pressure dropping even further, making winds
 accelerate, the clouds revolve, a confusion of energy,
  
 an incomprehensible volume of rain--I remember
 the trick of thinking through infinity, a crowd of eyes
 against an asphalt wall, my vision of it scrolling
  
 left as the crowd thinned out to a spatter and then
 just black until I fall asleep and then just black again,
 past marketing, past focus groups, past human
  
 resources, past management, past personal effects,
 their insignificance evident in the eye of the dream
 and through much of the debriefing I wake into next.






To His Own Device
 

That figure in the cellarage you hear upsetting boxes
 is an antic of the mind, a baroque imp cobbled
 up under bulbs whose flickering perplexes night's
  
 impecunious craftsman, making what he makes
 turn out irregular, awry, every effort botched
 in its own wrong way. You belong, I said, laid out chalk-
  
 white between a layer of tautened cotton gauze
 and another of the selfsame rubbish that you are
 wreaking havoc on tonight--and it didn't disagree.
  
 What's more, I said, you are amiss in this ad hoc quest
 for origin and purpose. Whatever destiny it is
 you are meant to aspire to before you retire to
  
 that soup-bowl of oblivion such figments as we
 expect to find final rest in couldn't possibly be
 contained in these boxes. And again--no contest.
  
 And when I was in need, I said, you raveled off
 in the long-winded ploys of a winless October,
 unfaithful to the one whose instincts had devised you . . .
  
 --At this, the figure dropped the box from its hands,
 turned down a dock I remembered and wept.
 I followed it down there, sat beside it and wept.
  
 Looking out on the water in time we came to see
 being itself had made things fall apart this way.
 We envied the simplicity implicit in sea-sponges
  
 and similar marine life, their resistance to changes
 across millennia we took to be deliberate, an art
 practiced untheatrically beneath the water's surface.
  
 We admired the example the whole sea set, actually.
 Maritime pauses flew like gulls in our exchanges.
 We wondered that much longer before we had left.






Globus Hystericus
 

1
  
 A pity the selfsame vehicle that spirits me away from 
 factories of tedium should likewise serve to drag
 me backwards into panic, or that panic should erect
  
 massive factories of its own, their virulent pollutants
 havocking loved waterways, frothing all the reed-
 fringed margins acid pink and gathering in the shell
  
 and soft tissues of the snails unknowingly in danger
 as they inch up stems. Through the bulkhead door
 I can hear their spirals plunk into the sluggish south-
  
 bound current and dissolve therein with such brutal
 regularity their dying has given rise to the custom
 of measuring time here in a unit known as the snailsdeath.
  
 The snailsdeath refers to the average length of time,
 about 43 seconds, elapsing between the loss of the first
 snail to toxic waters and the loss of the next, roughly
  
 equivalent to the pause between swallows in a human
 throat, while the adverb here refers to my person
 and all its outskirts, beginning on the so-called cellular
  
 level extending more of less undaunted all the way down
 to the vale at the foot of the bed. I often fear I'll wake
 to find you waiting there and won't know how to speak
  
 on the subject of my production, or rather my woeful
 lack thereof, but in your absence, once again, I will begin
 drafting apologies in a language ineffectual as doves.
  
  
    
 2
  
 Daybreak on my marshland: a single egret, blotched,
 trudges through the froth. I take its photograph
 from the rooftop observation deck from which I watch
  
 day's delivery trucks advance. I take advantage of
 the quiet before their arrival to organize my thoughts
 on the paranormal thusly: (1) If the human psyche 
  
 has proven spirited enough to produce such a range 
 of material effects upon what we'll call the closed
 system of its custodial body, indeed if it's expected to,
  
 and (2) If such effects might be thought to constitute
 the physical expression of that psyche, an emanation
 willed into matter in a manner not unlike a brand-
  
 new car or cream-filled cake or disposable camera,
 and (3) If the system of the body can be swapped out
 for another, maybe an abandoned factory or a vale,
  
 then might it not also prove possible for the psyche
 by aptitude or lather or sheer circumstance to impress
 its thumbprint on some other system, a production
  
 in the basement, or in a video store, as when I find you
 inching up steps or down a shady aisle or pathway,
 dragging your long chains behind you most morosely
  
 if you ask me, the question is: Did you choose this, or was it
 imposed on you, but even as I ask your hands move
 wildly about your throat to indicate you cannot speak.
    
  
  
 3
  
 After the memory of the trucks withdrawing heavy
 with their cargo fans out and fades into late-morning
 hunger, I relocate in time to the lit bank of vending
  
 machines still humming in the staff-room corner for a light
 meal of cheese curls, orange soda, and what history
 will come to mourn as the last two cream-filled cakes.
  
 Eating in silence, a breeze in the half-light, absently
 thinking of trying not to think, I imagine the Bethlehem
 steel smokestacks above me piping nonstop, the sky
  
 wide open without any question, steam and dioxides
 of carbon and sulfur, hands pressed to the wall as I walk
 down the corridor to stop myself from falling awake
  
 again on the floor in embarrassment. If there's any use
 of imagination more productive or time less painful
 it hasn't tried hard enough to push through to find me
  
 wandering the wings of a ghost-run factory as Earth
 approaches the dark vale cut in the heart of the galaxy.
 Taking shots of the sunbaked fields of putrefaction
  
 visible from the observation deck. Hoping to capture
 what I can point to as the way it feels. Sensing my hand
 in what I push away. Watching it dissolve into plumes
  
 rising like aerosols, or like ghosts of indigenous peoples,
 or the lump in the throat to keep me from saying that
 surviving almost everything has felt like having killed it.
  
  
  
 4
  
  
 (Plunk) Up from the floor with the sun to the sound of
 dawn's first sacrifice to the residues of commerce.
 On autofog, on disbelief: rejuvenation in a boxer brief
  
 crashed three miles wide in the waves off Madagascar,
 cause of great flooding in the Bible and in Gilgamesh.
 Massive sphere of rock and ice, of all events in history
  
 (Plunk) thought to be the lethalmost. A snailsdeath
 semiquavers from pang to ghost where the habit of ghosts
 of inhabiting timepieces, of conniving their phantom
  
 tendrils through parlor air and into the escapements
 of some inoperative heirloom clock on a mantel shows
 not the dead's ongoing interest in their old adversary
  
 (Plunk) time so much as an urge to return to the hard
 mechanical kind of being. An erotic lounging to reanimate
 the long-inert pendulum. As I have felt you banging
  
 nights in my machine, jostling the salt from a pretzel.
 This passion for the material realm after death however
 refuses to be reconciled with a willingness to destroy
  
 (Plunk) it while alive. When the last of the human voices
 told me what I had to do, they rattled off a shopping
 list of artifacts they wanted thrown down open throats.
  
 That left me feeling in on it, chosen, a real fun-time guy
 albeit somewhat sleep-deprived; detail-oriented, modern,
 yes, but also dubious, maudlin, bedridden, speechless.
  
 

 5
  
 Graffiti on the stonework around the service entrance
 makes the doorway at night look like the mystagogic
 mouth of a big beast, amphibious, outfitted with fangs,
  
 snout, the suggestion of a tongue, throat, and alimentary
 canal leading to a complex of caves, tunnels, temples . . .
 There are rooms I won't enter, at whose threshold I say
  
 this is as far as I go, no farther, almost as if I can sense
 there's something in there I don't want to see, or for which
 to see means having wanted already to forget, unless
  
 stepping into the mouth at last, pressed into its damp,
 the advantage of not knowing is swapped out for the loss
 of apartness from what you'd held unknown, meaning
  
 you don't come to know it so much as become it, wholly
 warping into its absorbent fold. I can't let that happen
 if it hasn't already. What draws me on might be thought
  
 canine, keen-sighted, but it's still incapable of divining why
 the constant hum around or inside me has to choose 
 among being a nocturne of toxic manufacture, the call
  
 of what remains of the jungle, or else just another prank
 on my gullible anatomy. Am I not beset in the utmost
 basement of industry? Is that basement itself not beset
  
 by the broad, black-green, waxy leaves of Mesoamerica?
 And haven't I parted those selfsame leaves, discovering me
 asleep on my own weapon, threat to no one but myself?
  
  
  
 6
  
 Asked again what I miss the most about my former life,
 I remember to pause this time, look left, a little off-camera
 an entire snailsdeath, an air of sifting the possibilities,
  
 I eliminate certain objects and events from the running
 right off the bat, such as when their great displeasure
 brought the gods to turn to darkness all that had been
  
 light, submerging mountaintops in stormwater, the gods
 shocked by their own power, and heartsick to watch
 their once dear people stippling the surf like little fishes.
  
 Or when the flaming peccary of a comet struck the earth
 with much the same effect, waves as high as ziggurats
 crashing mathematically against our coastlines, scalding
  
 plumes of vapor and aerosols tossed into the atmosphere
 spawning storms to pummel the far side of the earth,
 approximately 80 percent of all life vanished in a week.
  
 Or when we squandered that very earth and shat on it
 with much the same effect, and more or less on purpose,
 emitting nonstop gases in the flow of our production,
  
 shoveling it in as ancient icecaps melted, what difference
 could another make now. And so I clear my throat, look
 directly into the camera, and even though it will make me
  
 come off bovine in their eyes, I say that what I miss the most
 has to be those cream-filled cakes I used to like, but then
 they prod me with their volts and lead me back to the barn.
  
  
  
 7
  
 After the panic grew more of less customary, the pity 
 dissolved into a mobile fogbank, dense, reducing visibility
 from the rooftop observation deck. Mobile in the sense
  
 that it possessed mobility, not in the sense that it actually
 moved. Because it didn't. It just stayed there, reducing 
 visibility but not in the sense that it simply diminished it
  
 or diminished it partly. Because it didn't. It pretty much
 managed to do away with it altogether, as my photography
 will come to show: field after field of untouched white.
  
 After the possibility of change grew funny, threadbare,
 too embarrassing to be with, I eased into the knowledge
 that you'd never appear at the foot of the bed, the vale
  
 turned into a lifetime's heap of laundry, and not the gentle
 tuffets and streambanks of an afterlife it seems we only 
 imagined remembering, that watercolor done in greens
  
 and about which I predicted its monotony of fair weather
 over time might deaden one all over again, unless being
 changed with death means not only changing past change
  
 but past even the wish for it. I worried to aspire towards
 that condition might actually dull one's aptitude for change.
 That I would grow to protect what I wished to keep from
  
 change at the cost of perpetuating much that required it.
 In this sense I had come to resemble the fogbank, at once
 given to motion but no less motionless than its photograph.
  
 The last time I saw myself alive, I drew the curtain back
 from the bed, stood by my sleeping body. I felt tenderness
 towards it. I knew how long it had waited, and how little
  
 time remained for it to prepare its bundle of grave-goods.
 When I tried to speak, rather than my voice, my mouth
 released the tight, distinctive shriek of an aerophone of clay.
  
 I wanted to stop the shock of that from taking away from
 what I felt. I couldn't quite manage it. Even at this late hour,
 even here, the purity of a feeling is ruined by the world.
    


 8
  
 The noises from the basement were not auspicious noises.
 I wanted to live forever. I wanted to live forever and die
 right then and there. I had heard the tight, distinctive shriek.
  
 Here again and now. I no longer have legs. I am sleeping.
 Long tendrils of tobacco smoke, composed of carbon dioxide,
 water vapor, ammonia, nitrogen oxide, hydrogen cyanide,
  
 and 4,000 other chemical compounds, penetrate the room
 through the gap beneath the door and through heating vents
 with confidence. They are the spectral forms of anaconda.
  
 The ruler of the underworld smokes cigars. A certain brand.
 Hand-rolled. He smiles as if there is much to smile about.
 And there is. He is hollow-eyed, toothless. His hat, infamous:
  
 broad-brimmed, embellished with feathers, a live macaw.
 His cape is depicted, often, as a length of fabric in distinctive
 black and white chevrons. Otherwise, as here, the full pelt
  
 of a jaguar. On a barge of plywood and empty milk cartons
 he trudges through the froth. He is the lord of black sorcery
 and lord of percussion. He is patron of commerce. He parts
  
 the leaves of Mesoamerica, traveling with a retinue of drunken
 ax wielders, collection agents. His scribe is a white rabbit. 
 Daughter of moon and of night. Elsewhere, you are having
  
 your teeth taken out. There is no music left, but I still feel held 
 captive by the cinema, and in its custom, I believe myself
 capable of protecting myself by hiding my face in my hands.






Making a Fist
 

    We forget that we are all dead men conversing wtih dead men. 
                                                                  --Jorge Luis Borges

For the first time, on the road north of Tampico,
I felt the life sliding out of me,
a drum in the desert, harder and harder to hear. 
I was seven, I lay in the car
watching palm trees swirl a sickening pattern past the glass.
My stomach was a melon split wide inside my skin. 

"How do you know if you are going to die?
I begged my mother.
We had been traveling for days.
With strange confidence she answered,
"When you can no longer make a fist.

Years later I smile to think of that journey,
the borders we must cross separately,
stamped with our unanswerable woes.
I who did not die, who am still living,
still lying in the backseat behind all my questions,
clenching and opening one small hand.





The Kingfishers
 

1
  
 What does not change / is the will to change
  
 He woke, fully clothed, in his bed. He
 remembered only one thing, the birds, how
 when he came in, he had gone around the rooms
 and got them back in their cage, the green one first,
 she with the bad leg, and then the blue,
 the one they had hoped was a male
  
 Otherwise? Yes, Fernand, who had talked lispingly of Albers & Angkor Vat.
 He had left the party without a word. How he got up, got into his coat,
 I do not know. When I saw him, he was at the door, but it did not matter,
 he was already sliding along the wall of the night, losing himself
 in some crack of the ruins. That it should have been he who said, "The kingfishers!
 who cares 
 for their feathers
 now?
  
 His last words had been, "The pool is slime. Suddenly everyone,
 ceasing their talk, sat in a row around him, watched
 they did not so much hear, or pay attention, they
 wondered, looked at each other, smirked, but listened,
 he repeated and repeated, could not go beyond his thought
 "The pool    the kingfishers' feathers were wealth    why 
 did the export stop?
  
 It was then he left 
  
  
 2
  
 I thought of the E on the stone, and of what Mao said
 la lumiere
                     but the kingfisher
 de l'aurore
                     but the kingfisher flew west
 est devant nous!
                     he got the color of his breast
                     from the heat of the setting sun!
  
 The features are, the feebleness of the feet (syndactylism of the 3rd & 4th digit)
 the bill, serrated, sometimes a pronounced beak, the wings
 where the color is, short and round, the tail
 inconspicuous.
  
 But not these things were the factors. Not the birds. 
 The legends are
 legends. Dead, hung up indoors, the kingfisher
 will not indicate a favoring wind,
 or avert the thunderbolt. Nor, by its nesting,
 still the waters, with the new year, for seven days.
 It is true, it does nest with the opening year, but not on the waters.
 It nests at the end of a tunnel bored by itself in a bank. There,
 six or eight white and translucent eggs are laid, on fishbones
 not on bare clay, on bones thrown up in pellets by the birds.
  
                                                    On these rejectamenta
 (as they accumulate they form a cup-shaped structure) the young are born.
 And, as they are fed and grow, this nest of excrement and decayed fish becomes
                                                               a dripping, fetid mass
  
 Mao concluded:
                    nous devons
                                        nous lever
                                                          et agir!

 When the attentions change / the jungle
 leaps in
              even the stones are split
                                              they rive
  
 Or, 
 enter
 that other conqueror we more naturally recognize
 he so resembles ourselves
  
 But the E
 cut so rudely on that oldest stone
 sounded otherwise,
 was differently heard
  
 as, in another time, were treasures used:
  
 (and, later, much later, a fine ear thought
 a scarlet coat)
  
                        "of green feathers    feet, beaks and eyes
                         of gold
  
                        "animals likewise,
                         resembling snails
  
                        "a large wheel, gold, with figures of unknown four-foots,
                         and worked with tufts of leaves, weight
                         3800 ounces
  
                        "last, two birds, of thread and featherwork, the quills
                         gold, the feet
                         gold, the two birds perched on two reeds
  
                         gold, the reeds arising from two embroidered mounds,
                         one yellow, the other
                         white.
  
                                      "And from each reed hung
                                       seven feathered tassels. 
  
 In this instance, the priests
 (in dark cotton robes, and dirty, 
 their disheveled hair matted with blood, and flowing wildly
 over their shoulders)
 rush in among the people, calling on them
 to protect their gods
  
 And all now is war
 where so lately there was peace,
 and the sweet brotherhood, the use
 of tilled fields.

 Not one death but many,
 not accumulation but change, the feed-back proves, the feed-back is
 the law
  
                  Into the same river no man steps twice
                  When fire dies air dies
                  No one remains, nor is, one
  
 Around an appearance, one common model, we grow up
 many. Else how is it,
 if we remain the same,
 we take pleasure now
 in what we did not take pleasure before? love
 contrary objects? admire and / or find fault? use
 other words, feel other passions, have
 nor figure, appearance, disposition, tissue
 the same?
          To be in different states without a change
          is not a possibility
  
 We can be precise. The factors are
 in the animal and / or the machine the factors are
 communication and / or control, both involve
 the message. And what is the message? The message is
 a discrete or continuous sequence of measurable events distributed in time
  
 is the birth of the air, is
 the birth of water, is
 a state between
 the origin and
 the end, between
 birth and the beginning of
 another fetid nest
  
 is change, presents
 no more than itself
  
 And the too strong grasping of it,
 when it is pressed together and condensed,
 loses it
  
 This very thing you are

                       he can take no risk that matters,
                       the risk of beauty least of all.
  
                       But I have my kin, if for no other reason than

                       It works out this way, despite the disadvantage.
                       I offer, in explanation, a quote:

                       this is also true: if I have any taste
                       it is only because I have interested myself

As the Dead Prey Upon Us
 

As the dead prey upon us,
 they are the dead in ourselves,
 awake, my sleeping ones, I cry out to you,
 disentangle the nets of being!
  
 I pushed my car, it had been sitting so long unused.
 I thought the tires looked as though they only needed air.
 But suddenly the huge underbody was above me, and the rear tires
 were masses of rubber and thread variously clinging together
  
 as were the dead souls in the living room, gathered
 about my mother, some of them taking care to pass
 beneath the beam of the movie projector, some record
 playing on the victrola, and all of them
 desperate with the tawdriness of their life in hell
  
 I turned to the young man on my right and asked, "How is it,
 there? And he begged me protestingly don't ask, we are poor
 poor. And the whole room was suddenly posters and presentations
 of brake linings and other automotive accessories, cardboard
 displays, the dead roaming from one to another
 as bored back in life as they are in hell, poor and doomed
 to mere equipments
  
                                my mother, as alive as ever she was, asleep
 when I entered the house as I often found her in a rocker
 under the lamp, and awaking, as I came up to her, as she ever had
  
 I found out she returns to the house once a week, and with her
 the throng of the unknown young who center on her as much in death
 as other like suited and dressed people did in life
  
 O the dead!
  
                     and the Indian woman and I
                     enabled the blue deer
                     to walk
  
                     and the blue deer talked,
                     in the next room,
                     a Negro talk
  
                     it was like walking a jackass,
                     and its talk
                     was the pressing gabber of gammers
                     of old women
  
                     and we helped walk it around the room
                     because it was seeking socks
                     or shoes for its hooves
                     now that it was acquiring
  
                     human possibilities
  
 In the five hindrances men and angels
 stay caught in the net, in the immense nets
 which spread out across each plane of being, the multiple nets
 which hamper at each step of the ladders as the angels
 and the demons
 and men
 go up and down
  
                                  Walk the jackass
                                  Hear the victrola
                                  Let the automobile
                                  be tucked into a corner of the white fence
                                  when it is a white chair. Purity
  
 is only an instant of being, the trammels

recur
  
 In the five hindrances, perfection
 is hidden
                                  I shall get
                                  to the place
                                  10 minutes late.
  
                                  It will be 20 minutes
                                  of 9. And I don't know,
  
                                  without the car,
  
                                  how I shall get there
  
 O peace, my mother, I do not know
 how differently I could have done
 what I did or did not do.

                                  That you are back each week
                                  that you fall asleep
                                  with your face to the right
  
                                  that you are present there
                                  when I come in as you were
                                  when you were alive
  
                                  that you are as solid, and your flesh
                                  is as I knew it, that you have the company
                                  I am used to your having
  
                                  but o, that you all find it
                                  such a cheapness!
  
 o peace, mother, for the mammothness
 of the comings and goings
 of the ladders of life
  
 The nets we are entangled in. Awake,
 my soul, let the power into the last wrinkle
 of  being, let none of the threads and rubber of the tires
 be left upon the earth. Let even your mother
 go. Let there be only paradise
  
 The desperateness is, that the instant
 which is also paradise (paradise
 is happiness) dissolves
 into the next instant, and power
 flows to meet the next occurrence
  
                                  Is it any wonder
                                  my mother comes back?
                                  Do not that throng
                                  rightly seek the room
                                  where they might expect
                                  happiness? They did not complain
                                  of life, they obviously wanted
                                  the movie, each other, merely to pass
                                  among each other there,
                              where the real is, even to the display cards,
                              to be out of hell
  
                              The poverty
                              of hell

 O souls, in life and in death,
 make, even as you sleep, even in sleep
 know what wind
 even under the crankcase of the ugly automobile
 lifts it away, clears the sodden weights of goods,
 equipment, entertainment, the foods the Indian woman,
 the filthy blue deer, the 4 by 3 foot Viewbook,'
 the heaviness of the old house, the stuffed inner room
 lifts the sodden nets 
  
                                  and they disappear as ghosts do,
                                  as spider webs, nothing
                                  before the hand of man
  
                                  The vent! You must have the vent,
                                  or you shall die. Which means
                                  never to die, the ghastliness
  
                                  of going, and forever
                                  coming back, returning
                                  to the instants which were not lived
  
                                  O mother, this I could not have done,
                                  I could not have lived what you didn't,
                                  I am myself netted in my own being
  
                                  I want to die. I want to make that instant, too,
                                  perfect
  
                                  O my soul, slip
                                  the cog
  
  
 II
  
 The death in life (death itself)
 is endless, eternity
 is the false cause
  
 The knot is other wise, each topological corner
 presents itself, and no sword
 cuts it, each knot is itself its fire
  
 each knot of which the net is made
 is for the hands to untake
 the knot's making. And touch alone
 can turn the knot into its own flame
  
                           (o mother, if you had once touched me
  
                           o mother, if I had once touched you)
  
 The car did not burn. Its underside
 was not presented to me
 a grotesque corpse. The old man
  
 merely removed it as I looked up at it,
 and put it in a corner of the picket fence
 like was it my mother's white dog?
  
 or a child's chair
  
                                  The woman,
                                  playing on the grass,
                                  with her son (the woman next door)
  
                                  was angry with me whatever it was
                                  slipped across the playpen or whatever
                                  she had out there on the grass
  
                                  And I was quite flip in reply
                                  that anyone who used plastic
                                  had to expect things to skid
  
                                  and break, that I couldn't worry
                                  that her son might have been hurt
                                  by whatever it was I sent skidding
  
                                  down on them.
  
                                  It was just then I went into my house
                                  and to my utter astonishment
                                  found my mother sitting there 
  
                                  as she always had sat, as must she always
                                  forever sit there her head lolling
                                  into sleep? Awake, awake my mother
  
                                  what wind will lift you too
                                  forever from the tawdriness,
                                  make you rich as all those souls
  
                                  crave crave crave
  
                                  to be rich?
  
 They are right. We must have
 what we want. We cannot afford
 not to. We have only one course:
  
 the nets which entangle us are flames
  
                                          O souls, burn
                                          alive, burn now
  
                                          that you may forever
                                          have peace, have
  
                                          what you crave
  
                                          O souls,
                                          go into everything,
                                          let not one knot pass
                                          through your fingers
  
                                          let not any they tell you
                                          you must sleep as the net
                                          comes through your authentic hands
  
                                          What passes
                                          is what is, what shall be, what has
                                          been, what hell and heaven is
                                          is earth to be rent, to shoot you
                                          through the screen of flame which each knot
                                          hides as all knots are a wall ready
                                          to be shot open by you
  
                                                                                the nets of being
                                          are only eternal if you sleep as your hands
                                          ought to be busy. Method, method
  
                                          I too call on you to come
                                          to the aid of all men, to women most
                                          who know most, to woman to tell
                                          men to awake. Awake, men,
                                          awake
  
 I ask my mother
 to sleep. I ask her
 to stay in the chair.
 My chair
 is in the corner of the fence.
 She sits by the fireplace made of paving stones. The blue deer
 need not trouble either of us.
  
 And if she sits in happiness the souls
 who trouble her and me
 will also rest. The automobile
  
 has been hauled away.

 dogwood flakes
 what is green
  
 the petals
 from the apple
 blow on the road
  
 mourning doves
 mark the sway
 of the afternoon, bees
 dig the plum blossoms
  
 the morning

 is blue from the full of the April moon
  
 iris and lilac, birds
 birds, yellow flowers
 white flowers, the Diesel
 does not let up dragging
 the plow
  
                as the whippoorwill,

               and no other birds but us

 is without fault?
  
 Nobody studies
 happiness
  
 Every time the cock crows
 I salute him
  
 I have no longer any excuse

 of any dispersed effort. The hour of death
  
 is the only trespass

 the petals from the apple-trees
 fall for the feet to walk on
  
 the birds are so many they are
 loud, in the afternoon
  
 they distract, as so many bees do
 suddenly all over the place
  
 With spring one knows today to see
 that in the morning each thing
  
 is separate but by noon
 they have melted into each other
  
 and by night only crazy things
 like the full moon and the whippoorwill
  
 and us, are busy. We are busy
 if we can get by that whiskered bird,
  
 that nightjar, and get across, the moon
 is our conversation, she will say
  
 what soul
 isn't in default?
  
 can you afford not to make
 the magical study
  
 which happiness is? do you hear
 the cock when he crows? do you know the charge,
  
 that you shall have no envy, that your life
 has its orders, that the seasons
  
 seize you too, that no body and soul are one
 if they are not wrought
  
 in this retort? that otherwise efforts
 are efforts? And that the hour of your flight
  
 will be the hour of your death?
  
  
 III. Spring
  
 The dogwood
 lights up the day.
  
 The April moon
 flakes the night.
  
 Birds, suddenly, 
 are a multitude
  
 The flowers are ravined 
 by bees, the fruit blossoms
  
 are thrown to the ground, the wind
 the rain forces everything. Noise--
  
 even the night is drummed
 by whippoorwills, and we get
  
 as busy, we plow, we move,
 we break out, we love. The secret
  
 which got lost neither hides
 nor reveals itself, it shows forth
  
 tokens. And we rush
 to catch up. The body
  
 whips the soul. In its great desire
 it demands the elixir
  
 In the roar of spring,
 transmutations. Envy
  
 drags herself off. The fault of the body and the soul
 --that they are not one--
  
 the matutinal cock clangs
 and singleness: we salute you
  
 season of no bungling





The Librarian
 

The landscape (the landscape!) again: Gloucester,
 the shore one of me is (duplicates), and from which
 (from offshore, I, Maximus) am removed, observe.
  
 In this night I moved on the territory with combinations
 (new mixtures) of old and known personages: the leader,
 my father, in an old guise, here selling books and manuscripts.
  
 My thought was, as I looked in the window of his shop,
 there should be materials here for Maximus, when, then,
 I saw he was the young musician has been there (been before me)
  
 before. It turned out it wasn't a shop, it was a loft (wharf-
 house) in which, as he walked me around, a year ago
 came back (I had been there before, with my wife and son,
  
 I didn't remember, he presented me insinuations via
 himself and his girl) both of whom I had known for years.
 But never in Gloucester. I had moved them in, to my country.
  
 His previous appearance had been in my parents' bedroom where I
 found him intimate with my former wife: this boy
 was now the Librarian of Gloucester, Massachusetts!

                          crude like a wharf's
                          and a barn's 
                          space
  
  
 I was struck by the fact I was in Gloucester, and that my daughter
 was there--that I would see her! She was over the Cut. I
 hadn't even connected her with my being there, that she was
  
 here. That she was there (in the Promised Land--the Cut!
 But there was this business, of poets, that all my Jews
 were in the fish-house too, that the Librarian had made a party 
  
 I was to read. They were. There were many of them, slumped
 around. It was not for me. I was outside. It was the Fort.
 The Fort was in East Gloucester--old Gorton's Wharf, where the Library
  
 was. It was a region of coal houses, bins. In one a gang
 was beating someone to death, in a corner of the labyrinth
 of fences. I could see their arms and shoulders whacking
  
 down. But not the victim. I got out of there. But cops
 tailed me along the Fort beach toward the Tavern
  
                          The places still
                          half-dark, mud,
                          coal dust.

                          of the Bridge
  
                          Only on the headland
                          toward the harbor

                          have I seen it (once
                          when my daughter ran
                          out on a spit of sand
  
                          isn't even there.) Where

Canto I
 

And then went down to the ship,
 Set keel to breakers, forth on the godly seas, and
 We set up mast and sail on that swart ship,
 Bore sheep aboard her, and our bodies also
 Heavy with weeping, and winds from sternward
 Bore us out onward with bellying canvas,
 Circe's this craft, the trim-coifed goddess. 
 Then sat we amidships, wind jamming the tiller,
 Thus with stretched sail, we went over sea till day's end. 
 Sun to his slumber, shadows o'er all the ocean,
 Came we then to the bounds of deepest water,
 To the Kimmerian lands, and peopled cities
 Covered with close-webbed mist, unpierced ever
 With glitter of sun-rays
 Nor with stars stretched, nor looking back from heaven
 Swartest night stretched over wretched men there. 
 The ocean flowing backward, came we then to the place
 Aforesaid by Circe. 
 Here did they rites, Perimedes and Eurylochus, 
 And drawing sword from my hip
 I dug the ell-square pitkin;
 Poured we libations unto each the dead, 
 First mead and then sweet wine, water mixed with white flour. 
 Then prayed I many a prayer to the sickly death's-heads;
 As set in Ithaca, sterile bulls of the best
 For sacrifice, heaping the pyre with goods, 
 A sheep to Tiresias only, black and a bell-sheep.
 Dark blood flowed in the fosse,
 Souls out of Erebus, cadaverous dead, of brides
 Of youths and of the old who had borne much;
 Souls stained with recent tears, girls tender, 
 Men many, mauled with bronze lance heads,
 Battle spoil, bearing yet dreory arms, 
 These many crowded about me; with shouting,
 Pallor upon me, cried to my men for more beasts;
 Slaughtered the herds, sheep slain of bronze;
 Poured ointment, cried to the gods,
 To Pluto the strong, and praised Proserpine; 
 Unsheathed the narrow sword,
 I sat to keep off the impetuous impotent dead,
 Till I should hear Tiresias.
 But first Elpenor came, our friend Elpenor, 
 Unburied, cast on the wide earth,
 Limbs that we left in the house of Circe,
 Unwept, unwrapped in sepulchre, since toils urged other. 
 Pitiful spirit.   And I cried in hurried speech:
 "Elpenor, how art thou come to this dark coast?
 "Cam'st thou afoot, outstripping seamen?
               And he in heavy speech:
 "Ill fate and abundant wine.    I slept in Circe's ingle.
 "Going down the long ladder unguarded,
 "I fell against the buttress,
 "Shattered the nape-nerve, the soul sought Avernus. 
 "But thou, O King, I bid remember me, unwept, unburied,
 "Heap up mine arms, be tomb by sea-bord, and inscribed: 
 "A man of no fortune, and with a name to come. 
 "And set my oar up, that I swung mid fellows.
  
 And Anticlea came, whom I beat off, and then Tiresias Theban,
 Holding his golden wand, knew me, and spoke first:
 "A second time? why? man of ill star,
 "Facing the sunless dead and this joyless region?
 "Stand from the fosse, leave me my bloody bever
 "For soothsay.
                And I stepped back,
 And he strong with the blood, said then: "Odysseus
 "Shalt return through spiteful Neptune, over dark seas,
 "Lose all companions.  And then Anticlea came. 
 Lie quiet Divus. I mean, that is Andreas Divus,
 In officina Wecheli, 1538, out of Homer.
 And he sailed, by Sirens and thence outward and away
 And unto Circe. 
               Venerandam,
 In the Cretan's phrase, with the golden crown, Aphrodite,
 Cypri munimenta sortita est, mirthful, orichalchi, with golden
 Girdles and breast bands, thou with dark eyelids
 Bearing the golden bough of Argicida. So that: 





Canto III
 

I sat on the Dogana's steps
 For the gondolas cost too much, that year,
 And there were not "those girls, there was one face,
 And the Buccentoro twenty yards off, howling, "Stretti,
 And the lit cross-beams, that year, in the Morosini,
 And peacocks in Kor's house, or there may have been. 
               Gods float in the azure air,
 Bright gods and Tuscan, back before dew was shed. 
 Light: and the first light, before ever dew was fallen. 
 Panisks, and from the oak, dryas, 
 And from the apple, mlid,
 Through all the wood, and the leaves are full of voices, 
 A-whisper, and the clouds bowe over the lake,
 And there are gods upon them,
 And in the water, the almond-white swimmers,
 The silvery water glazes the upturned nipple, 
                 As Poggio has remarked. 
 Green veins in the turquoise,
 Or, the gray steps lead up under the cedars. 
  
 My Cid rode up to Burgos,
 Up to the studded gate between two towers, 
 Beat with his lance butt, and the child came out,
 Una nia de nueve aos,
 To the little gallery over the gate, between the towers,
 Reading the writ, voce tinnula:
 That no man speak to, feed, help Ruy Diaz, 
 On pain to have his heart out, set on a pike spike
 And both his eyes torn out, and all his goods sequestered, 
 "And here, Myo Cid, are the seals, 
 The big seal and the writing. 
 And he came down from Bivar, Myo Cid, 
 With no hawks left there on their perches,
 And no clothes there in the presses,
 And left his trunk with Raquel and Vidas, 
 That big box of sand, with the pawn-brokers,
 To get pay for his menie;
 Breaking his way to Valencia.
 Ignez de Castro murdered, and a wall
 Here stripped, here made to stand. 
 Drear waste, the pigment flakes from the stone,
 Or plaster flakes, Mantegna painted the wall. 
 Silk tatters, "Nec Spe Nec Metu.





Canto IV
 

Palace in smoky light,
 Troy but a heap of smouldering boundary stones, 
 ANAXIFORMINGES!  Aurunculeia! 
 Hear me.   Cadmus of Golden Prows!
 The silver mirrors catch the bright stones and flare,
 Dawn, to our waking, drifts in the green cool light;
 Dew-haze blurs, in the grass, pale ankles moving. 
 Beat, beat, whirr, thud, in the soft turf
                 under the apple trees,
 Choros nympharum, goat-foot, with the pale foot alternate;
 Crescent of blue-shot waters, green-gold in the shallows,
 A black cock crows in the sea-foam;
  
 And by the curved, carved foot of the couch,
              claw-foot and lion head, an old man seated
 Speaking in the low drone:
                         Ityn!
 Et ter flebiliter, Ityn, Ityn! 
 And she went toward the window and cast her down,
                "All the while, the while, swallows crying:
 Ityn!
                "It is Cabestan's heart in the dish.
                "It is Cabestan's heart in the dish?
                "No other taste shall change this.
 And she went toward the window,
                       the slim white stone bar
 Making a double arch;
 Firm even fingers held to the firm pale stone;
 Swung for a moment,
                         and the wind out of Rhodez
 Caught in the full of her sleeve.
                . . .  the swallows crying:
 Tis.  Tis.  Ytis! 
                Acton
                    and a valley,
 The valley is thick with leaves, with leaves, the trees,
 The sunlight glitters, glitters a-top,
 Life a fish-scale roof,
                Like the church roof in Poictiers
 If it were gold. 
                Beneath it, beneath it
 Not a ray, not a slivver, not a spare disc of sunlight
 Flaking the black, soft water;
 Bathing the body of nymphs, of nymphs, and Diana,
 Nymphs, white-gathered about her, and the air, air,
 Shaking, air alight with the goddess
                fanning their hair in the dark,
 Lifting, lifting and waffing:
 Ivory dipping in silver,
                Shadow'd, o'ershadow'd 
 Ivory dipping in silver,
 Not a splotch, not a lost shatter of sunlight.
 Then Acton: Vidal,
 Vidal.   It is old Vidal speaking,
     stumbling along in the wood,
 Not a patch, not a lost shimmer of sunlight,
                 the pale hair of the goddess.
  
 The dogs leap on Acton,
                 "Hither, hither, Acton,
 Spotted stag of the wood;
 Gold, gold, a sheaf of hair,
                 Thick like a wheat swath,
 Blaze, blaze in the sun,
                 The dogs leap on Acton. 
 Stumbling, stumbling along in the wood,
 Muttering, muttering Ovid:
                 "Pergusa pool pool Gargaphia,
 "Pool pool of Salmacis. 
                 The empty armour shakes as the cygnet moves.
  
 Thus the light rains, thus pours, e lo soleills plovil
 The liquid and rushing crystal
                 beneath the knees of the gods.
 Ply over ply, thin glitter of water;
 Brook film bearing white petals. 
 The pine at Takasago
                 grows with the pine of Is!
 The water whirls up the bright pale sand in the spring's mouth
 "Behold the Tree of the Visages!
 Forked branch-tips, flaming as if with lotus.
                 Ply over ply
 The shallow eddying fluid,
                 beneath the knees of the gods.
  
 Torches melt in the glare
                 set flame of the corner cook-stall,
 Blue agate casing the sky (as at Gourdon that time)
                 the sputter of resin,
 Safforn sandal so petals the narrow foot: Hymenus Io!
                 Hymen, Io Hymene! Aurunculeia! 
 One scarlet flower is cast on the blanch-white stone.
  
                 And So-Gyoku, saying:
 "This wind, sire, is the king's wind,
                 This wind is wind of the palace,
 Shaking imperial water-jets.
                 And Hsiang, opening his collar:
 "This wind roars in the earth's bag,
                 it lays the water with rushes.
 No wind is the king's wind.
                 Let every cow keep her calf.
 "This wind is held in gauze curtains
                        No wind is the king's
  
 The camel drivers sit in the turn of the stairs,
                 Look down on Ecbatan of plotted streets,
 "Dana! Dana!
              What wind is the king's?
 Smoke hangs on the stream,
 The peach-trees shed bright leaves in the water,
 Sound drifts in the evening haze,
                 The bark scrapes at the ford,
 Gilt rafters above black water,
                 Three steps in an open field,
 Gray stone-posts leading
  
 Pre Henri Jacques would speak with the Sennin, on Rokku,
 Mount Rokku between the rock and the cedars,
 Polhonac,
 As Gyges on Thracian platter set the feast,
 Cabestan, Tereus,
                 It is Cabestan's heart in the dish,
 Vidal, or Ecbatan, upon the gilded tower in Ecbatan
 Lay the god's bride, lay ever, waiting the golden rain.

 The Garonne is thick like paint,
 Procession,--"Et sa'ave, sa'ave, sa'ave Regina!--
 Moves like a worm, in the crowd.

 Across the Adige, by Stefano, Madonna in hortulo,
 As Cavalcanti had seen her.
                 The Centaur's heel plants in the earth loam.

Canto XVI
 

And before hell mouth; dry plain
               and two mountains;
 On the one mountain, a running form,
               and another
 In the turn of the hill; in hard steel
 The road like a slow screw's thread,
 The angle almost imperceptible,
                so that the circuit seemed hardly to rise;
 And the running form, naked, Blake,
 Shouting, whirling his arms, the swift limbs,
 Howling against the evil,
                his eyes rolling,
 Whirling like flaming cart-wheels,
                and his head held backward to gaze on the evil
 As he ran from it,
                 to be hid by the steel mountain,
 And when he showed again from the north side;
                 his eyes blazing toward hell mouth,
 His neck forward,
                 and like him Peire Cardinal. 
 And in the west mountain, Il Fiorentino,
 Seeing hell in his mirror,
                  and lo Sordels 
 Looking on it in his shield;
 And Augustine, gazing toward the invisible.
  
 And past them, the criminal
                 lying in the blue lakes of acid,
 The road between the two hills, upward
                 slowly,
 The flames patterned in lacquer, crimen est actio,
 The limbo of chopped ice and saw-dust, 
 And I bathed myself with acid to free myself
                of the hell ticks,
 Scales, fallen louse eggs.
                Palux Laerna,
 the lake of bodies, aqua morta,
 of limbs fluid, and mingled, like fish heaped in a bin,
 and here an arm upward, clutching a fragment of marble,
 And the embryos, in flux,
               new inflow, submerging,
 Here an arm upward, trout, submerged by the eels;
               and from the bank, the stiff herbage
 the dry nobbled path, saw many known, and unknown,
 for an instant;
                submerging,
 The face gone, generation.
  
                Then light, air, under saplings,
 the blue banded lake under ther,
                an oasis, the stones, the calm field, 
 the grass quiet,
                and passing the tree of the bough
 The grey stone posts,
                and the stair of gray stone,
 the passage clean-squared in granite:
                descending,
 and I through this, and into the earth,
                patet terra,
 entered the quiet air
                the new sky,
 the light as after a sun-set,
                and by their fountains, the heroes,
 Sigismundo, and Malatesta Novello,
                and founders, gazing at the mounts of their cities. 
  
 The plain, distance, and in fount-pools
                the nymphs of that water
 rising, spreading their garlands,
                weaving their water reeds with the boughs, 
 In the quiet,
                and now one man rose from his fountain
 and went off into the plain. 
  
 Prone in that grass, in sleep;
                et j'entendis des voix:
                                                            wall .  .  .  Strasbourg
 Galliffet led that triple charge.  .  .  Prussians
 and he said                                                            [Plarr's narration]
                           it was for the honour of the army. 
 And they called him a swashbuckler.
                I didn't know what it was
 But I thought:    This is pretty bloody damn fine. 
 And my old nurse, he was a man nurse, and 
 He killed a Prussian and he lay in the street
 there in front of our house for three days
 And he stank.  .  .  .  .  .  . 
                Brother Percy,
 And our Brother Percy
                old Admiral
 He was a middy in those days,
 And they came into Ragusa
 .  .  .  .  .  .  place those men went for the Silk War.  .  .  .  .
 And they saw a procession coming down through 
 A cut in the hills, carrying something
 The six chaps in front carrying a long thing
                on their shoulders,
 And they thought it was a funeral,
                but the thing was wrapped up in scarlet,
 And he put off in the cutter,
                he was a middy in those days,
 To see what the natives were doing,
 And they got up to the six fellows in livery,
 And they looked at it, and I can still hear the old admiral,
 "Was it? it was 
                Lord Byron
 Dead drunk, with the face of an A  y  n.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
 He pulled it out long, like that:
                 the face of an a  y  n  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  gel.
  
 And because that son of a bitch,
                Franz Josef of Austria.  .  .  .  .  .
 And because that son of a bitch Napolon Barbiche
 They put Aldington on Hill 70, in a trench
                dug through corpses
 With a lot of kids of sixteen,
 Howling and crying for their mamas,
 And he sent a chit back to his major:
                I can hold out for ten minutes
 With my sergeant and a machine-gun.
                And they rebuked him for levity. 
 And Henri Gaudier went to it,
                and they killed him,
 And killed a good deal of sculpture,
 And ole T.E.H. he went to it,
 With a lot of books from the library,
 London Library, and a shell buried em in a dug-out,
 And the Library expressed its annoyance.
                And a bullet hit him on the elbow
 gone through the fellow in front of him,
 And he read Kant in the Hospital, in Wimbledon,
 in the original,
 And the hospital staff didn't like it. 
  
 And Wyndham Lewis went to it,
 With a heavy bit of artillery,
                and the airmen came by with a mitrailleuse,
 And cleaned out most of his company,
                and a shell lit on his tin hut, 
 While he was out in the privy,
                and he was all there was left of that outfit. 
  
 Windeler went to it,
    and he was out in the gan,
 And down in the hold of his ship
                pumping  gas into a sausage,
 And the boatswain looked over the rail,
                down into amidships, and he said:
                Gees! look a' the Kept'n,
 The Kept'n's a-gettin' er up.
  
 And Ole Captain Baker went to it,
                 with his legs full of rheumatics,
 So much so he couldn't run,
                  so he was six months in hospital,
 Observing the mentality of the patients.
  
 And Fletcher was 19 when he went to it,
 And his major went mad in the control pit,
         about  midnight, and started throwing the phone about
 And he had to keep him quiet 
                till abut six in the morning,
 And direct that bunch of artillery. 
  
 And Ernie Hemingway went to it,
                too much in a hurry,
 And they buried him for four days.

 That's the trick with a crowd,
                Get em into the street and get em moving.
 And all the time, there were people going 
 Down there, over the river. 
             
                There was a man there talking,
 To a thousand, just a short speech, and
 Then move em on.   And he said:
 Yes, these people, they are all right, they
 Can do everything, everything except act;
 And go an' hear em but when they are through 
 Come to the bolsheviki
  
 And when it broke, there was the crowd there,
 And the cossacks, just as always before,
 But one thing, the cossacks said:
                "Pojalouista.
 And that got round in the crowd,
 And then a lieutenant of infantry
 Ordered em to fire into the crowd,
                in the square at the end of the Nevsky,
 In front of the Moscow station,
 And they wouldn't, 
 And he pulled his sword on a student for laughing,
 And killed him,
 And a cossack rode out of his squad
 On the other side of the square
 And cut down the lieutenant of infantry
 And there was the revolution
                 as soon as they named it.
  
 And you can't make em, 
 Nobody knew it was coming. They were all ready, the old gang, 
 Guns on the top of the post-office and the palace,
 But none of the leaders knew it was coming. 
  
 And there were some killed at the barracks,
 But that was between the troops.
  
 So we used to hear it at the opera
 That they wouldn't be under Haig;
                and that the advance was beginning;
 That it was going to begin in a week. 
                         
  






Canto XXXVI
 

A Lady asks me
                I speak in season
 She seeks reason for an affect, wild often
 That is so proud he hath Love for a name 
 Who denys it can hear the truth now
 Wherefore I speak to the present knowers
 Having no hope that low-hearted
               Can bring sight to such reason
 Be there not natural demonstration
                I have no will to try proof-bringing
 Or say where it hath birth
 What is its virtu and power
 Its being and every moving 
 Or delight whereby tis called "to love
 Or if man can show it to sight. 
  
 Where memory liveth,
                it takes its state
 Formed like a diafan from light on shade
 Which shadow cometh of Mars and remaineth
 Created, having a name sensate,
 Custom of the soul,
                will from the heart;
 Cometh from a seen form which being understood
 Taketh locus and remaining in the intellect possible
 Wherein hath he neither weight nor still-standing, 
 Descendeth not by quality but shineth out
 Himself his own effect unendingly 
 Not in delight but in the being aware
 Nor can he leave his true likeness otherwhere. 
  
 He is not vertu but cometh of that perfection
 Which is so postulate not by the reason
 But tis felt, I say. 
 Beyond salvation, holdeth his judging force
 Deeming intention to be reason's peer and mate,
 Poor in discernment, being thus weakness' friend 
 Often his power cometh on death in the end,
 Be it withstayed
                 and so swinging counterweight.
 Not that it were natural opposite, but only
 Wry'd a bit from the perfect,
 Let no man say love cometh from chance
 Or hath not established lordship
 Holding his power even though
                Memory hath him no more. 
  
 Cometh he to be 
                when the will 
 From overplus
 Twisteth out of natural measure,
 Never adorned with rest Moveth he changing colour
 Either to laugh or weep
 Contorting the face with fear
                resteth but a little
 Yet shall ye see of him That he is most often 
 With folk who deserve him
 And his strange quality sets sighs to move
 Willing man look into that formd trace in his mind
 And with such uneasiness as rouseth the flame. 
 Unskilled can not form his image,
 He himself moveth not, drawing all to his stillness,
 Neither turneth about to seek his delight
 Nor yet to see out proving
 Be it so great or so small. 
  
 He draweth likeness and hue from like nature
 So making pleasure more certain in seeming
 Nor can stand hid in such nearness,
 Beautys be darts tho' not savage
 Skilled from such fear a man follows
 Deserving spirit, that pierceth.
 Nor is he known from his face
 But taken in the white light that is allness
 Toucheth his aim
 Who heareth, seeth not form
 But is led by its emanation
 Being divided, set out from colour,
 Disjunct in mid darkness
 Grazeth the light, one moving by other,
 Being divided, divided from all falsity
 Worthy of trust
 From him alone mercy proceedeth. 
  
 Go, song, surely thou mayest
 Whither it please thee 
 For so art thou ornate that thy reasons 
 Shall be praised from thy understanders,
 With others hast thou no will to make company. 
  
 "Called thrones, balascio or topaze

Canto XLV
 

With Usura
  
 With usura hath no man a house of good stone
 each block cut smooth and well fitting
 that design might cover their face,
 with usura 
 hath no man a painted paradise on his church wall
 harpes et luz
 or where virgin receiveth message
 and halo projects from incision,
 with usura
 seeth no man Gonzaga his heirs and his concubines
 no picture is made to endure nor to live with
 but it is made to sell and sell quickly
 with usura, sin against nature, 
 is thy bread ever more of stale rags
 is thy bread dry as paper,
 with no mountain wheat, no strong flour
 with usura the line grows thick
 with usura is no clear demarcation
 and no man can find site for his dwelling.
 Stonecutter is kept from his tone
 weaver is kept from his loom
 WITH USURA
 wool comes not to market
 sheep bringeth no gain with usura
 Usura is a murrain, usura
 blunteth the needle in the maid's hand
 and stoppeth the spinner's cunning. Pietro Lombardo
 came not by usura
 Duccio came not by usura
 nor Pier della Francesca; Zuan Bellin' not by usura
 nor was La Calunnia' painted.
 Came not by usura Angelico; came not Ambrogio Praedis,
 Came no church of cut stone signed: Adamo me fecit.
 Not by usura St. Trophime
 Not by usura Saint Hilaire,
 Usura rusteth the chisel
 It rusteth the craft and the craftsman
 It gnaweth the thread in the loom
 None learneth to weave gold in her pattern;
 Azure hath a canker by usura; cramoisi is unbroidered
 Emerald findeth no Memling
 Usura slayeth the child in the womb
 It stayeth the young man's courting
 It hath brought palsey to bed, lyeth
 between the young bride and her bridegroom
                                CONTRA NATURAM
 They have brought whores for Eleusis
 Corpses are set to banquet
 at behest of usura. 
  
  
  
 N.B. Usury: A charge for the use of purchasing power, levied without regard to production; often without regard to the possibilities of production. (Hence the failure of the Medici bank.)
  
             





Canto LXXXI
 

Zeus lies in Ceres' bosom
 Taishan is attended of loves
                         under Cythera, before sunrise
 And he said: "Hay aqu mucho catolicismo--(sounded

                 where you'd occasionally see a wild rabbit
 or mebbe only a loose one
             AOI!
             a leaf in the current

 Yet
 Ere the season died a-cold
 Borne upon a zephyr's shoulder
 I rose through the aureate sky
                                Lawes and Jenkyns guard thy rest
                                Dolmetsch ever be thy guest,
 Has he tempered the viol's wood
 To enforce   both the grave   and the acute? 
 Has he curved us the bowl of the lute?
                                Lawes and Jenkyns guard thy rest
                                Dolmetsch ever be thy guest
 Hast 'ou fashioned so airy a mood
        To draw up leaf from the root?
 Hast 'ou found   a cloud   so light
         As seemed neither mist nor shade?
             
                                 Then resolve me, tell me aright
                                  If Waller sang or Dowland played
             
                    Your eyen two wol sleye me sodenly
                     I may the beaut of hem nat susteyne
  
 And for 180 years almost nothing. 
  
 Ed ascoltando al leggier mormorio
         there came new subtlety of eyes into my tent,
 whether of the spirit or hypostasis,
             but what the blindfold hides
 or at carneval
                                   nor any pair showed anger
             Saw but the eyes and stance between the eyes,
 colour, diastasis,
       careless or unaware it had not the
    whole tent's room
 nor was place for the full EidwV
 interpass, penetrate
       casting but shade beyond the other lights
               sky's clear
               night's sea
               green of the mountain pool
               shone from the unmasked eyes in half-mask's space. 
 What thou lovest well remains, 
                                                   the rest is dross
 What thou lov'st well shall not be reft from thee
 What thou lov'st well is thy true heritage
 Whose world, or mine or theirs
                                             or is it of none? 
 First came the seen, then thus the palpable
         Elysium, though it were in the halls of hell,
 What thou lovest well is thy true heritage
 What thou lov'st well shall not be reft from thee
  
 The ant's a centaur in his dragon world.
 Pull down thy vanity, it is not man
 Made courage, or made order, or made grace,
          Pull down thy vanity, I say pull down.
 Learn of the green world what can be thy place
 In scaled invention or true artistry,
 Pull down thy vanity,
                                         Paquin pull down!
 The green casque has outdone your elegance.
  
 "Master thyself, then others shall thee beare
        Pull down thy vanity
 Thou art a beaten dog beneath the hail,
 A swollen magpie in a fitful sun,
 Half black half white
 Nor knowst'ou wing from tail
 Pull down thy vanity
                         How mean thy hates
 Fostered in falsity,
                         Pull down thy vanity,
 Rathe to destroy, niggard in charity,
 Pull down thy vanity,
                        I say pull down. 
  
 But to have done instead of not doing
                      this is not vanity
 To have, with decency, knocked
 That a Blunt should open
                To have gathered from the air a live tradition
 or from a fine old eye the unconquered flame
 This is not vanity. 
          Here error is all in the not done,
 all in the diffidence that faltered  .  .  . 
  





from Canto CXV
 

The scientists are in terror 
             and the European mind stops
 Wyndham Lewis chose blindness
             rather than have his mind stop. 
 Night under wind mid garofani,
             the petals are almost still
 Mozart, Linnaeus, Sulmona,
 When one's friends hate each other 
             how can there be peace in the world?
 Their asperities diverted me in my green time. 
 A blown husk that is finished
             but the light sings eternal
 a pale flare over marshes
                 where the salt hay whispers to tide's change
 Time, space,
           neither life nor death is the answer. 
 And of man seeking good,
             doing evil.
 In meiner Heimat
                    where the dead walked
                               and the living were made of cardboard.





Contributions to a Rudimentary Concept of Nation
 

On the volatile nights of a winter
 nature corroborates with magnanimity
 a Cuban is in training for amusement or amnesia,
 so often and unfairly assumed as the same,
 he brings candy to God, he cultivates the vernacular, he fights off
 cirrhosis with fruit poached in syrup, he conducts business;
 thus research has shown that The Cuban is resourceful. 
 In the weighty choreographies of a summer
 nature authorizes already with suspicion
 a Cuban meets the ocean with offerings and harpoons,
 so often and unfairly assumed as the same,
 he finger-counts the casualties, he commits an infraction
 he slides his hands into his pockets, he avows and commits;
 thus analysis has shown that The Cuban is inspired. 
 Let's attend the improbable territory
 where with pasty mouths a Cuban and The Cuban engage in virile 
 conversation
 we will learn there by what voyage, by what strange condition
 by what exchange
 we fall prey to so much ingenuity. 






The Metaphysical Countrygirl
 

You, functional space
 variants in voltage, the only light
 Transitory effect of Love
 several different lights
 Sustain
 Sustain them
 you sustain them. 






Congregations
 

One fisherman alongside the other
 one seagull alongside the other
 seagulls over the fishermen. 
  






The Progression
 

When one isn't enough, you need two
 when two aren't enough, you need four
 with four the progression begins, moving toward a number
 that schoolteachers will call absurd. 
 Question: How many men do you need
 to put up a house? 
 Answer: You need absurd men
 when one isn't enough and two can't do
 the work of One. 
 And how much money should we give these men
 to compensate them?
 You need absurd coins when one coin
 sliced in half and handed out 
 isn't enough. 
 And how many words do you need to
        transform them?
 Absurd and absurd and absurd words
 when silence isn't enough. 
 This is what they call progression:
 Absurd men aren't enough for putting up the house,
 absurd coins don't make them happy
 absurd words can't dissuade them. 
  
  






Love Song
 

I lie here thinking of you:--
  
 the stain of love 
 is upon the world!
 Yellow, yellow, yellow
 it eats into the leaves,
 smears with saffron
 the horned branches that lean
 heavily
 against a smooth purple sky!
 There is no light
 only a honey-thick stain
 that drips from leaf to leaf
 and limb to limb
 spoiling the colors
 of the whole world--
  
 you far off there under
 the wine-red selvage of the west! 






To the New Year
 

With what stillness at last
you appear in the valley
your first sunlight reaching down
to touch the tips of a few
high leaves that do not stir
as though they had not noticed
and did not know you at all
then the voice of a dove calls
from far away in itself
to the hush of the morning

so this is the sound of you
here and now whether or not
anyone hears it this is
where we have come with our age
our knowledge such as it is
and our hopes such as they are
invisible before us
untouched and still possible

Travel Papers
 

Au silence de celle qui laisse rveur. --Ren Char
By boat to Seurasaari where 
the small fish were called vendace.  
A man blew a horn of birchwood 
toward the nightless sea.

Still voice. Fire that is no fire. 
Ahead years unknown to be lived--



Bells from the tower in the all-at-once, then 
one by one, hours. Outside 
(so fleetingly) ourselves--

In a still mirror, in a blue within 
where this earthly journey dreaming
itself begins,

thought into being from the hidden to the end of the visible.



Mountains before and behind, 
heather and lichen, yarrow, gorse,
then a sea village of chartreuse fronds.

Spent fuel, burnt
wind, mute swans.



 We drove the birch-lined 
highway from Dresden 
to Berlin behind armored 
cars in late afternoon, 
nineteenth of June, passing 
the black cloud of a freight 
truck from Budapest.

Through disappearing
villages, past horses grazing vanished fields.




The year before you died, America 
went to war again on the other 
side of the world.
This is how the earth becomes, 
you said, a grotto of skeletons.




 In the ruins of a station: a soaked 
bed, broken chairs, a dead coal stove.

White weather, chalk and basalt, 
puffins, fuchsia and history shot 
through with particles 
of recognition: this one 
wetted down with petrol then 
set alight, that one taking 
forty rounds, this other 
found eleven years later in a bog.

In the station house, imaginary 
maps, smoke chased by wind, a registry 
of arrivals, the logs of ghost 
ships and a few prison 
diaries written on tissue paper.




Do you remember the blue-leaved lilies?   
The grotto, the hoarfrost, the frieze?  

Through the casements of glass hand-blown 
before the war, a birch tree lets snow drop 
through its limbs onto other birches. Birch twigs
in wind through glass.

Who were we then? Such 
a laughter as morning peeled 
its light from us!   




You said the cemeteries were full in a voice 
like wind plaiting willows--fields in bloom 
but silent without grasshoppers or bees.  
What do you want then? You with your 

neverness, your unknown, 
your book of things, you
with once years ahead to be lived.




Your father believes he took you 
with him, that you are
in an urn beside your sleeping mother
but I am still writing with your hand,
as you stand in your still-there of lighted words.




Such is the piano's sadness and the rifle's moonlight.  
Stairwells remember as do doors, but windows do not--

do not, upon waking, gaze out a window 
if you wish to remember your dream




An ache of hope that you will come back--
the cawing flock is not your coming.

Did you float toward Salzburg? A wind
in the mustard fields?--or walk instead 
beside me through the asylum in Krakow?   
Hours after your death you seemed 
everywhere at once like the swifts at twilight.  
Now your moments are clouds
in a photograph of swifts. 




In the hour held 
open between day and night under 
the meteor showers of Perseid
we held each other for the last time.

Dead, you whispered where is the road?  

There, through the last of the sentences, just there--
through the last of the sentences, the road--






His Ambulations
 

On shanks' mare Argyle talked to himself.
Alone, he'd carry on whole colloquies
en route to some poor corpse's obsequies--
these dialogues, the way he kept his wits
about him, body and soul together,
fit for the wretched work of sin-eating.
Sometimes he counted words or parts of words
as if they amounted to something more
than sound and sense attuned between his ears,
as, for example, how coincident:
the way grace and gratis, wherefore gratitude
partook a kinship such as cousins do,
singing the same tune in different voices,
much as grave and gravitas, then gravity
kept one earthbound, grounded, humble as the mud--
the humus, so-called, God wrought humans from. 
Or how from Adam's rib was fashioned Eve--
bone of his own bone, flesh of his flesh--
whom he got gravid by implanting seed,
in her unfathomably fecund Eden.
The memory of a woman's company
would bring his ambulations to a halt
to aim his gaping face due heavenward, 
the dewy air her touch, her taste, sweet salt.





He Posits Certain Mysteries
 

The body of the boy who took his flight
off the cliff at Kilcloher into the sea
was hauled up by curragh-men, out at first light
fishing mackerel in the estuary.
"No requiem or rosary said the priest,
"nor consecrated ground for burial,
as if the boy had flown outside the pale
of mercy or redemption or God's love.  
"Forgive them, for they know not what they do,
quoth Argyle to the corpse's people,
who heard in what he said a sort of riddle,
as if he meant their coreligionists
and not their sodden, sadly broken boy.
Either way, they took some comfort in it
and readied better than accustomed fare
of food and spirits; by their own reckoning:
the greater sin, the greater so the toll.
But Argyle refused their shilling coin
and helped them build a box and dig a grave.
"Your boy's no profligate or prodigal,
he said, "only a wounded pilgrim like us all.
What say his leaping was a leap of faith,
into his father's beckoning embrace?
They killed no fatted calf.  They filled the hole.





Argyle on Knocknagaroon
 

Because he barely heard the voice of God
above the hum of other choristers--
batwing and bird-whistle, gathering thunder,
the hiss of tides retreating, children, cattle;
because he could not readily discern
the plan Whoever Is In Charge Here has,
he wondered about those who claimed to have
blessed assurances or certainty:
a One and Only Way and Truth and Life,
as if Whatever Breathes in Everything  
mightn't speak in every wondrous tongue;
as if, of all creations, only one
made any sense. It made no sense to him.  
Hunger he understood, touch, desire.  
He knew the tenderness humans could do,
no less brutalities.  He knew the cold
morning, the broad meadow, the gold sunset.
One evening on the hill of Knocknagaroon,
the Atlantic on one side, the Shannon 
on the other, the narrowing headlands
of the peninsula out behind him,
the broad green palm of Moveen before him,
it seemed he occupied the hand of God:
open, upturned, outstretched, uplifting him.





He Considers Not the Lilies but Their Excellencies
 

Thin gruel, shallow graves, whiskey watered down,
the ne'er-do-well and good-for-nothing crowd
of cornerboys and gobshites were among
Argyle's manifold perturbations.
Worse still, the episcopal vexations: 
their excellencies, eminence and graces,
red-cassocked dandies and mitered wankers,
the croziered posers in their bishoprics 
with their Easter duties and Peter's pence,
their ledgers full of mortal, venial sins--
keepers of the till and tally, bankers
of indulgences and dispensations;
their bulls and bans and excommunications,
nothing but contumely and bamboozles.
For all their vestiture, rings and unctions,
preaching to bishops, like farting at skunks, was 
nothing but a mug's game to the sin-eater,
so in earshot of them mum is what he kept. 
Still, he thought there might be something to it:
a life apart from this life where the souls
long dead and gone were neither dead nor gone.
Some days he felt so happily haunted,
by loving ghosts and gods upholding him.
Some days he felt entirely alone.






Slieve Donard II
 

The suite on the side
facing away from the sea
is the suite with the fireplace
and two plasma screen tvs.
Better luxury compensates
for lack of view. Before
the perpetual gas fire, stunned
as if into stone, entering

as you enter your Anne Bront,
a world muted, chemically arranged,
I try renewal of a mind remade.
Mind is book is water is fire, all change.
Fear is the wake-up call at three,
too early, for planes. Airport quiet.
Leave the hotel without baggage, fly
direct to Geneva. They await you there.

What occurs is only the turning of a page,
imagined for screen. Unseen is greater.
Is attested to, as we rise in Mass.
Water should be avoided by all those
who get into difficulty with ease, and cats.
Searching for the blackberry in the fur-lined
coat, I roam and ring, opening
a closet, from which tumbles a victim,

providing a fitting climax. Mrs. Pontifax
is staying across the hall. The glamour.
She is the Minister of Finance's daughter.
She sees the cold winter sea rise from her vantage.
Our age is blinded by celebrity, seeing
with the gilded orb of a bronze, dull god.
The domes of our room service cool
after we have slaked and fed. As you read
this becomes the first one written under the influence
of an anti-depressed self, whatever that is to be.
What is, is taken off a shelf, a remaining wrack
that half emerges from the brackish ruins of the year.
Will love reunite?
Will Ireland be solvent?
All nights, holiest, least holy,
be still, be silent.


Ireland, Christmas 2009





Sonnet
 

No children;
Cold uncoils in the blood;
Science, true, not good
For you. So old,
Suddenly, or so young.
Lyric inside not to be sung.
Plug pulled, screen gone.
Sun out; mind
Bountiful, playing pain.
These are my children
In my head. Unbegotten.
This is to self-forget,
To have the future
Born forgotten.





Why Poetry Cannot Be Skimmed
 

In response to a student who told me he just "skims the poetry right before class
The barn was in the Netherlands,
in a field where fierce night wind
caught the straw as if to fuse
the winter stars to their coldness.
A farmer, woken by the sound, knowing
his animals would be agitated,
walked to the barn and by lantern
brushed the tails of his horses.
In calming them he gathered
many long, gleaming strands
of their nut-brown hair. Given over
to what he heard in the swishing of their tails--
the lash, the taut string of grief, turned slow,
persistence turned to rhythmic movement--
he hoped that if he listened long enough
the layered sound would become a salve.
He rolled the strands together, laid out
along the windowsills of the barn.

Then, once dry enough in spring,
he rolled them in paraffin wax
to preserve the sound
and left them to absorb
all the varied rays of sun, the spills
of rain, and then snow flying fast
across the latched windows and the slats,
the rhythm of other breathing,
animals plodding by the barn walls.
The wax melted as the years progressed
and other horses resided in the stalls,
and their tail strands were added
to the aging threads.  From that encased sound
deepening over years, a rope,
pulled strong and taut, would resonate.

Then another generation worked the land
and waxed the horse-tail cord again,
and in turn when it caught
that century's light, was spun
into amber. Woven into the cells of hair:
the tones of canal and field,
pasture, furrows of plough,
leaf and shadow, straw and stone,
the human calling, the animal uttering.
And when melted again, incrementally
strands from other horses living there
were added until there were enough
layers of sound, set with the nourishment
of grass and salt, to be given away
and the space the hair had occupied
would be returned to emptiness.

The horse-hair cord was brought
by a farmer to a luthier's shop
along a canal, and it was a perfect fit,
she said, for a violin bow
she had carved a few months earlier,
waiting, and for the bow-less violin
someone had just given her.  She knew
rosin carrying a current through
pastures, filled thirst, and the grief
of night wind and scavenged apples
made the gathered pieces a whole.

And now they are together in your hands
this moment to make
unrehearsed, immediate,
after all those animals' years,
when you bring the instrument to your chin,
when you raise the hair-strung bow,
again their elemental sounding,
and then their measured note, their first.





En Eski Ak iiri
 

The Oldest Love Poem(For Susan)
Back from Istanbul, she gives to me
the photograph she took inside
the Archaeological Museum's
blue tiled hush, of a tablet
carved in terra cotta from Nippur,
written in Sumerian.

Delicate etches, a lift of riverbed
where the summer waters ran
glistened on this piece of earth
the earnest working hand,
a pause between the lines to contemplate
cedars' ornate overhanging
leaf-work become inseparable
from the carving.  Maybe reading sky,
reading wind, or tree sounds
beside the sound of clay
shaped to carry a human mark.

Maybe it says     we are so elegant
in our exchange that looking at each other
the trees whisper their contented green
across any distance to be here
branches heat-satiated
full in our veins of holding.

Maybe it says      when we spoon,
we spoon each other a river
we find in our arms the curving
edges of the loving bed
become a shadowed riverbank
from which night animals will bend
and from our abundant dreams
to ease their thirst, will drink.

Maybe it says      in our hands
the night sky we first held
between us in the glowing
amorphous float reaches
the underside of leaves
as every sentry in the moon's keep
finds more of it to give away

tonight again the fragrant sky
etches luminous travel
with beads from tree to tree
above this terra cotta,
above us as we sleep.






To the Young Man on the Bridge
 

The newspaper caption read: "Two  officers talk to a young man, name withheld, as he stands on a bridge  above the Merrimack River, distraught over learning that his mother is  terminally ill.
When I first saw you 
I could glance up from your image in the paper
and out her kitchen doorway watch
my mother trim her artemisia,
scraps of silver trailing
her green wheelbarrow.
And I imagined yes,
if mine were dying,
I would be on the abutment too,
about to release the cable
ignoring those attempting rescue;
imagined your rock-weight drop
pierce Merrimack gray
driving you through layers of silt and barge wake
till your heart burst
its knot of color
oiled into molecular black.

And now that, years later, I have lost mine,
also to disease, I see your face again
transfixed in white and black,
a pale sphere caught
in the newspaper's grainy net.
But now I would coax you back
from the railing to tell you:
no matter the number of months that have passed,
what whole rounded year has slipped
a marble from my pocket,
there is a moment of breaking
the surface of whatever hour
and plunging past the floating glass
of doorknobs turned in pain
light shafts driven
further into the enamel
of an incandescent pedal Singer
rimmed in chrome and folds of cloth
whose scent can still drown me
in green oblivion. Floating too
an azure button, despair complete
in its perfect disc, terra cotta saucer
lifted by her hand
with a border of fine red leaves
each holding its breath for all of us,
holding our grief.

                      I would say to you:
that impossible weight
will drop you every day
and arrows of color pierce
your body clear through, the river
for which you might stay.






November, Late in the Day
 

So this is aging: the bare sun, skinned,
palely bucking the dark wind,
slides through the glass, crawls on the carpet,
climbs the footboard, lies crosswise on the blanket,
a spoiled dog waiting to be fed.

Not now, dear warmth. The kindling's in the shed,
too far to fetch. Those two great logs that close
together to make fire, repose
apart, an old couple reminiscing
on conflagrations they're now missing:
how every sunny Saturday afternoon,
Hey, diddle-diddle, the dish ran away with the spoon.

Not yet, dear spoon. Some hotter day, dear dish.
No tidbits now. Instead, let's make a wish,
and boil fresh water for the small teapot
to keep it piping hot.





Age Looking Back at Its Youth
 

We had so little, yet we had so much:
Thunder and lightning at the lightest touch.





Departures: Chapter One
 

Morning's mirage, disdainful & calm
          as a mirror,

held the shorn bush that yesterday
          flourished,

now lopped canes & a scant spitfall
          of remnance,

confetti trampled in the clefts
          of vanishing deer.

To touch its truth I punched my fist
          into the chopped molest,

the boscage--withdrew my red sleeve.
          Abstract that.





Midas Passional
 

No one has touched me for weeks
yet in this drugged, gilt afternoon, late,

when nothing is safe, I'm paralyzed,
as though so wildly desired--passing solo through the garden's

cinnamon, marigolds, famished roses, where a matted shingle
of the swept-up human hair I begged from a local beauty shop

& spread out fruitlessly among the blooms & canes
to keep away the deer might well be a satyr

passed out in the palace's candied gold--
that something regnant with a strange, godlike power

could not help but reach out from the umbral blue
to tap my white arm. It is a day to die,

the light autoerotic, theatrical, with an unbearable listing,
stalled in cusp, in leonine torpor. Is courage artifice?

As though to answer were within my means.
Or to even move my mouth.






The Church of the Open Crayon Box
 

Must be entered through the sharpener every Sunday,
else your name will be lovingly written in the Book 
of the Down Arrow. The One Steeple to Every Church 
                                                 rule breaks in half
in the Church of the Open Crayon Box; the One Bell
to Every Steeple rule breaks off its tip. "Climb stairs 
to the steeples, the preacher commands, "and let 
every belltone ring out! You can see the whole town
from the steeple, and you exit the church through 
the view, and you walk through what calls itself 

                                      Flagpole--the town is a blot 
                                      on the town, but the railroad 
is coming out this way and we must give them a smear 
to see through the windows: now you pass the General Store, 
that even your vaguest stick figure can enter, now you pass 
a vacant lot: the post office isn't here yet, is only a set-aside space 
in the center of the country's envelope; now you pass the voting-
place, where we stuff our handwriting through a slit. Tall trees 
fall in the pinewoods, tall telegraph poles are raised, and words 
inch along our wires: text text text stop, text text text stop.

And now you pass the Feed Store, which sells carrot and turnip 
and sugar-beet tops--only the visible parts--and now Whitey 
BaLavender's Hardware, where everything hangs off the hook 
of its color, or color hangs off the hook of its all, where you work 
your hands into cool washers, and work hands into nailheads 
of the color blue, and watch Whitey BaLavender busy himself 
          pouring crayons into bullet molds. You show him a list 
          that says "ax, and he sells you a red line through it.
                     All up and down Main Street ponies are covered 
                     with strokes as coarse as horse blankets. And once 
          you have drawn the ponies you begin to draw the saddle 
shop, you grip the right color like a saddle horn and somehow 
keep from falling off, and you ride to the edge of town, 
where you draw the fur trading post, where they sell tails 
of any shy animal, the rest of the animal gone down a hole, 
where you trade in your skin for a possibles bag and wear 
possibles bag where your skin was. Fat geese fly in any letter 
you like but you need red meat for once, and write a splayed-
hide word like "Deerslayer, and take hold of the ending
                                                         and drag it home,

and now you are almost there, now you are building the home 
with hand-drawn Log Cabin Font, you are building it log 
by log of course and smoothing the logs with a color called 
Adze, you are biting the crayon to notch the logs and driving 
in dots of nailheads. Stumps of umber surround you, and the sky
is beginning to look like sky. You are hoping a man can be really
          alone here; 
                            you are hoping your father can tell what it is;
and now only the doorknob is left to draw and in your enthusiasm 
you shout at the paper, and the weather
                            changes just in time, not raining, beginning to spit.






Petition
 

After Elinor Lipper
The creature that had once
been a man handed over his petition,
a stained and grimy scrap,
handed it to his lord and master,
a petition asking to be transferred
to the status of a horse.
You son-of-a-whore, the master,
kicking for good measure, bellowed.
What do you mean by this?
The creature that had once
been a man, having considered
deeply his petition, answered:
If I were a horse, I would have
one day off in ten. As is,
I have none. As a horse,
I could rest now and again
during work. As a former
man, I cannot. As a horse,
I would be expected to perform
work equal to my strength.
As a prisoner, I am always
hungry, and hungry, I 
work less and get less 
bread, so I can barely stand.
A horse gets a stable
and two blankets. I have
no blankets, no jacket.
If a driver beats
a horse too hard, he 
is punished, for a horse 
is precious. If the brigadiers
beat and kick me, it is like
beating a tree. So you see,
a prisoner is nothing here.
But a horse? 
A horse is something!
Inside the frozen
and the broken 
vista, the plea had a ring 
of truth heard
even by the lord
and master, who had 
previously been a man himself, 
and who, when no other 
former men could see, 
attached that name 
to the page, granting
the horse a stable and two blankets.





Symphonic Expanse
 

If you'd seen 
the Gaillardots' mullein in the Cedars of the Shouf; 
if you'd seen the Aleppo dock, red with iron, 
in Bcharre where the Adonis River's said to run as red 

with what was 
thought his blood; if you'd seen the bearded oat in Burjein, 
the rayed white horehound in Tripoli; or maybe 
the milkwort in Ehden, as often I saw the strigose bellflower 

and the cyclamen, 
you might have been the more awed by a mallow-leaved 
bindweed in Aley on your way to the brunnera in Baalbek. 
The Mediterranean poppy in Nabatieh, Beirut mullein 

in nearby Baabda, 
connate Alexanders in Qadisha, fodder vetch in Zgharta,
white rocket in Sour, Gypsywort in Marjeyoun, 
headed Ziziphora in Baakleen, bladder skullcap in Barouk. 

The viscid catchfly, 
ah, vying with bats at evening in Zahle--for these the earth 
of continuous habitation since the Chalcolithic Age 
salivates at dawn. But not a reed grows where no grave is. 

In Sacandaga Valley,
two thousand bodies were trans-buried by the boneyard gang. 
They ceded the pitted ground to the dentist gang, 
whose jackhammers drilled the rock beneath.

Powder monkeys tamped 
the holes with dynamite. The beaver-tooth gang's axes 
and cross-cut saws cleared the trees. Bush burners followed. 
The fires burned for two years. The patience of dam builders 

built a force 
equal to the water: It flooded the ashes, the railroad station, 
and a train, which I saw transposed in the steely swells, 
or so it seemed. But iron turns a torrent red.





Stabile
 

I wake to light jackhammering, and news
follows: a plane
failed over the sea. All want to go home, but drastic curfews
obtain from a meridian.

                                      *     *     *

We are a long way from a sea that cedes
black boxes from an area
forested as the Andes. Instead, a Mercedes,
black as La Brea,
leaps from the backlit red, anonymous,
when we try to cross
at the traffic island discarding hibiscus
with every wind-toss.

                                      *     *     *

We are a long way from the courteous lilac
or waxwing
with sensitive feather tipped as a kayak
is tipped by a coxswain.





A Small Story about the Sky
 

The fire was so fierce, 
So red, so gray, so yellow
That, along with the land,
It burned part of the sky
Which stayed black in that corner 
For years,
As if it were night there
Even in the daytime, 
A piece of the sky burnt
And which then 
Could not be counted on
Even by the birds.

It was a regular fire--
Terrible--we forget this
About fire--terrible
And full of pride.  
It intended to be
Big, no regular fire.  
Like so many of us,
It intended to be more
And this time was.
It was not better or worse
Than any other fire
Growing up.  
But this time, it was a fire
At just the right time 
And in just the right place--
If you think like a fire--
A place it could do something big.

Its flames reached out
With ten thousand pincers, 
As if the fire
Were made of beetles and scorpions
Clawing themselves to get up,
Pinching the air itself
And climbing, 
So many sharp animals
On each other's backs
Then into the air itself, 
Ten thousand snaps and pinches
At least,
So that if the sky 
Was made of something,
It could not get away this time.

Finally the fire 
Caught the sky,
Which acted like a slow rabbit 
Which had made a miscalculation.
It didn't believe this could happen 
And so it ran left,
Right into the thin toothpicks of flames,
Too fast to pull back,
The sky with all its arms,
Hands, fingers, fingernails,
All of it
Disappeared.  
Goodbye.

The sky stayed black
For several years after.
I wanted to tell you
This small story
About the sky.
It's a good one
And explains why the sky
Comes so slowly in the morning,
Still unsure of what's here.  
But the story is not mine.
It was written by fire,
That same small fire
That wanted to come home
With something of its own
To tell,
And it did,
A small piece of blue in its mouth.






April
 

The optimists among us
taking heart because it is spring
skip along
attending their meetings
signing their e-mail petitions
marching with their satiric signs
singing their we shall overcome songs
posting their pungent twitters and blogs
believing in a better world
for no good reason
I envy them
said the old woman

The seasons go round they
go round and around
said the tulip
dancing among her friends
in their brown bed in the sun
in the April breeze
under a maple canopy
that was also dancing
only with greater motions
casting greater shadows
and the grass
hardly stirring

What a concerto
of good stinks said the dog
trotting along Riverside Drive
in the early spring afternoon
sniffing this way and that
how gratifying the cellos of the river
the tubas of the traffic
the trombones
of the leafing elms with the legato
of my rivals' piss at their feet
and the leftover meat and grease
singing along in all the wastebaskets





Song
 

Some claim the origin of song
was a war cry 
some say it was a rhyme
telling the farmers when to plant and reap
don't they know the first song was a lullaby
pulled from a mother's sleep
said the old woman

A significant
factor generating my delight in being
alive this springtime
is the birdsong 
that like a sweeping mesh has captured me
like diamond rain I can't
hear it enough said the tulip

lifetime after lifetime
we surged up the hill
I and my dear brothers
thirsty for blood
uttering
our beautiful songs
said the dog






In Every Life
 

In every life there's a moment or two
when the self disappears, the cruel wound
takes over, and then again
at times we are filled with sky
or with birds or
simply with the sugary tea on the table
said the old woman

I know what you mean said the tulip
about epiphanies
for instance a cloudless April sky
the approach of a butterfly
but as to the disappearing self
no
I have not yet experienced that

You are creating distinctions
that do not exist in reality
where "self and "not-self are like salt
in ocean, cloud in sky
oxygen in fire
said the philosophical dog
under the table scratching his balls






Soften and Melt
 

the man made me soften and melt
said the old woman

the bee made me shiver like a rag
said the dark red tulip

the bitch made me push
said the dog







The Duck and the Kangaroo
 

I
  
 Said the Duck to the Kangaroo,
     Good gracious! how you hop!
 Over the fields and the water too,
     As if you never would stop!
 My life is a bore in this nasty pond,
 And I long to go out in the world beyond!
     I wish I could hop like you!'
     Said the Duck to the Kangaroo.
  
  
 II
  
 Please give me a ride on your back!'
     Said the Duck to the Kangaroo.
 I would sit quite still, and say nothing but "Quack,
     The whole of the long day through!
 And we'd go to the Dee, and the Jelly Bo Lee,
 Over the land, and over the sea;--
     Please take me a ride! O do!'
     Said the Duck to the Kangaroo.
  
  
 III
  
 Said the Kangaroo to the Duck,
     This requires some little reflection;
 Perhaps on the whole it might bring me luck,
     And there seems but one objection,
 Which is, if you'll let me speak so bold,
 Your feet are unpleasantly wet and cold,
 And would probably give me the roo-
     Matiz!' said the Kangaroo.
  
  IV
  
 Said the Duck, As I sate on the rocks,
     I have thought over that completely,
 And I bought four pairs of worsted socks
     Which fit my web-feet neatly.
 And to keep out the cold I've bought a cloak,
 And every day a cigar I'll smoke,
     All to follow my own dear true
     Love of a Kangaroo!'
  
  
 V

 Said the Kangaroo, I'm ready!
     All in the moonlight pale;
 But to balance me well, dear Duck, sit steady!
     And quite at the end of my tail!'
 So away they went with a hop and a bound,
 And they hopped the whole world three times round;
     And who so happy,--O who,
     As the Duck and the Kangaroo?.






The Jumblies
 

I
  
 They went to sea in a Sieve, they did,
    In a Sieve they went to sea:
 In spite of all their friends could say,
 On a winter's morn, on a stormy day,
    In a Sieve they went to sea!
 And when the Sieve turned round and round,
 And every one cried, You'll all be drowned!'
 They called aloud, Our Sieve ain't big,
 But we don't care a button! we don't care a fig!
    In a Sieve we'll go to sea!'
       Far and few, far and few,
          Are the lands where the Jumblies live;
       Their heads are green, and their hands are blue,
          And they went to sea in a Sieve.
  
  
 II
  
 They sailed away in a Sieve, they did,
    In a Sieve they sailed so fast,
 With only a beautiful pea-green veil
 Tied with a riband by way of a sail,
    To a small tobacco-pipe mast;
 And every one said, who saw them go,
 O won't they be soon upset, you know!
 For the sky is dark, and the voyage is long,
 And happen what may, it's extremely wrong
    In a Sieve to sail so fast!'
       Far and few, far and few,
          Are the lands where the Jumblies live;
       Their heads are green, and their hands are blue,
          And they went to sea in a Sieve.
  
  
 III
  
 The water it soon came in, it did,
    The water it soon came in;
 So to keep them dry, they wrapped their feet
 In a pinky paper all folded neat,
    And they fastened it down with a pin.
 And they passed the night in a crockery-jar,
 And each of them said, How wise we are!
 Though the sky be dark, and the voyage be long,
 Yet we never can think we were rash or wrong,
    While round in our Sieve we spin!'
       Far and few, far and few,
          Are the lands where the Jumblies live;
       Their heads are green, and their hands are blue,
          And they went to sea in a Sieve.
  
  
 IV
  
 And all night long they sailed away;
    And when the sun went down,
 They whistled and warbled a moony song
 To the echoing sound of a coppery gong,
    In the shade of the mountains brown.
 O Timballo! How happy we are,
 When we live in a sieve and a crockery-jar,
 And all night long in the moonlight pale,
 We sail away with a pea-green sail,
    In the shade of the mountains brown!'
      Far and few, far and few,
          Are the lands where the Jumblies live;
      Their heads are green, and their hands are blue,
          And they went to sea in a Sieve.
  
  
 V
  
 They sailed to the Western Sea, they did,
    To a land all covered with trees,
 And they bought an Owl, and a useful Cart,
 And a pound of Rice, and a Cranberry Tart,
    And a hive of silvery Bees.
 And they bought a Pig, and some green Jack-daws,
 And a lovely Monkey with lollipop paws,
 And forty bottles of Ring-Bo-Ree,
    And no end of Stilton Cheese.
       Far and few, far and few,
          Are the lands where the Jumblies live;
       Their heads are green, and their hands are blue,
          And they went to sea in a Sieve.
  
  
 VI
  
 And in twenty years they all came back,
    In twenty years or more,
 And every one said, How tall they've grown!'
 For they've been to the Lakes, and the Torrible Zone,
    And the hills of the Chankly Bore;
 And they drank their health, and gave them a feast
 Of dumplings made of beautiful yeast;
 And everyone said, If we only live,
 We too will go to sea in a Sieve,--
    To the hills of the Chankly Bore!'
       Far and few, far and few,
          Are the lands where the Jumblies live;
       Their heads are green, and their hands are blue,
          And they went to sea in a Sieve.

The Mind
 

          
          The mind is a hotel with a thousand rooms. When I tilt my head a certain way, I think about certain things. When I tilt my head another way, I think about other things. If I sleep on the right side of my face, for example, I'd dream of a pale rose, the future, or a continental diner in Passaic, New Jersey. When I sleep on the left side of my face, I'd dream that a hand is squeezing my heart, that I'm in prison, or that I'm watching hockey at an airport bar, about to miss a flight.

dear love,
 

you dream in the language of dodging bullets and artillery fire.
 new, sexy diagnoses have been added to the lexicon on your behalf
 ("charlie don't surf, has also been added to the lexicon on your behalf).

in this home that is not our home, we have mutually exiled each
 other. i walk down your street in the rain, and i do not call you. i
 walk in the opposite direction of where i know to find you. that we
 do not speak is louder than bombs.
  
 there are times that missing you is a matter of procedure. now is
 not one of those times. there are times when missing you hurts. so
 it comes to this, vying for geography. there is a prayer stuck in my
 throat. douse me in gasoline, my love, and strike a match. let's see
 this prayer ignite to high heaven.
  






The Flowers
 

From golden showers of the ancient skies,
 On the first day, and the eternal snow of stars,
 You once unfastened giant calyxes
 For the young earth still innocent of scars:
  
 Young gladioli with the necks of swans,
 Laurels divine, of exiled souls the dream,
 Vermilion as the modesty of dawns
 Trod by the footsteps of the seraphim;
  
 The hyacinth, the myrtle gleaming bright,
 And, like the flesh of woman, the cruel rose,
 Hrodiade blooming in the garden light,
 She that from wild and radiant blood arose!
  
 And made the sobbing whiteness of the lily
 That skims a sea of sighs, and as it wends
 Through the blue incense of horizons, palely
 Toward the weeping moon in dreams ascends!
  
 Hosanna on the lute and in the censers,
 Lady, and of our purgatorial groves!
 Through heavenly evenings let the echoes answer,
 Sparkling haloes, glances of rapturous love!
  
 Mother, who in your strong and righteous bosom,
 Formed calyxes balancing the future flask,
 Capacious flowers with the deadly balsam
 For the weary poet withering on the husk.






Hrodiade
 


 I. ANCIENT OVERTURE OF HRODIADE
  
 The Nurse
  
 (Incantation)
  
 Abolished, and her frightful wing in the tears
 Of the basin, abolished, that mirrors forth our fears,
 The naked golds lashing the crimson space,
 An Aurora--heraldic plumage--has chosen to embrace
 Our cinerary tower of sacrifice,
 Heavy tomb that a songbird has fled, lone caprice
 Of a dawn vainly decked out in ebony plumes
 Ah, mansion this sad, fallen country assumes!
 No splashing! the gloomy water, standing still,
 No longer visited by snowy quill
 Or fabled swan, reflects the bereaving
 Of autumn extinguished by its own unleaving,
 Of the swan when amidst the cold white tomb
 Of its feathers, it buried its head, undone
 By the pure diamond of a star, but one
 Of long ago, which never even shone.
  
 Crime! torture! ancient dawn! bright pyre!
 Empurpled sky, complicit in the mire,
 And stained-glass windows opening red on carnage.
  
 The strange chamber, framed in all the baggage
 Of a warlike age, its goldwork dull and faint,
 Has yesteryear's snows instead of its ancient tint;
 And its pearl-gray tapestry, useless creases
 With the buried eyes of prophetesses
 Offering Magi withered fingers. One,
 With floral past enwoven on my gown
 Bleached in an ivory chest and with a sky
 Bestrewn with birds amidst the embroidery
 Of tarnished silver, seems a phantom risen,
 An aroma, roses, rising from the hidden
 Couch, now void, the snuffed-out candle shrouds,
 An aroma, over the sachet, of frozen golds,
 A drift of flowers unfaithful to the moon
 (Though the taper's quenched, petals still fall from one),
 Flowers whose long regrets and stems appear
 Drenched in a lonely vase to languish there
 An Aurora dragged her wings in the basin's tears!
  
 Magical shadow with symbolic powers!
 A voice from the distant past, an evocation,
 Is it not mine prepared for incantation?
 In the yellow folds of thought, still unexhumed,
 Lingering, and like an antique cloth perfumed,
 Spread on a pile of monstrances grown cold,
 Through ancient hollows and through stiffened folds
 Pierced in the rhythm of the pure lace shroud
 Through which the old veiled brightness is allowed
 To mount, in desperation, shall arise
 (But oh, the distance hidden in those cries!)
 The old veiled brightness of a strange gilt-silver,
 Of the languishing voice, estranged and unfamiliar:
 Will it scatter its gold in an ultimate splendor,
 And, in the hour of its agony, render
 Itself as the anthem for psalms of petition?
 For all are alike in being brought to perdition
 By the power of old silence and deepening gloom,
 Fated, monotonous, vanquished, undone,
 Like the sluggish waters of an ancient pond.
  
 Sometimes she sang an incoherent song.
 Lamentable sign! 
                              the bed of vellum sheets,
 Useless and closednot linen!--vainly waits,
 Bereft now of the cherished grammary
 That spelled the figured folds of reverie,
 The silken tent that harbored memory,
 The fragrance of sleeping hair. Were these its treasure?
 Cold child, she held within her subtle pleasure,
 Shivering with flowers in her walks at dawn,
 Or when the pomegranate's flesh is torn
 By wicked night! Alone, the crescent moon
 On the iron clockface is a pendulum
 Suspending Lucifer: the clepsydra pours
 Dark drops in grief upon the stricken hours
 As, wounded, each one wanders a dim shade
 On undeciphered paths without a guide!
 All this the king knows not, whose salary
 Has fed so long this agd breast now dry.
 Her father knows it no more than the cruel
 Glacier mirroring his arms of steel,
 When sprawled on a pile of corpses without coffins
 Smelling obscurely of resin, he deafens
 With dark silver trumpets the ancient pines!
 Will he ever come back from the Cisalpines?
 Soon enough! for all is bad dream and foreboding!
 On the fingernail raised in the stained glass, according
 To the memory of the trumpets, the old sky burns,
 And to an envious candle it turns
 A finger. And soon, when the sad sun sinks,
 It shall pierce through the body of wax till it shrinks!
 No sunset, but the red awakening
 Of the last day concluding everything
 Struggles so sadly that time disappears,
 The redness of apocalypse, whose tears
 Fall on the child, exiled to her own proud
 Heart, as the swan makes its plumage a shroud
 For its eyes, the old swan, and is carried away
 From the plumage of grief to the eternal highway
 Of its hopes, where it looks on the diamonds divine
 Of a moribund star, which never more shall shine!






The Tomb of Charles Baudelaire
 

The buried temple empties through its bowels,
 Sepulchral sewer spewing mud and rubies,
 Abominably some idol of Anubis,
 Its muzzle all aflame with savage howls.
  
 Or if the recent gas the wick befouls
 That bears so many insults, it illumines
 In haggard outline an immortal pubis
 Flying along the streetlights on its prowls.
  
 What wreaths dried out in cities without prayer
 Of night could bless like that which settles down
 Vainly against the marble of Baudelaire
  
 In the fluttering veil that girds her absence round,
 A tutelary poison, his own Wraith,
 We breathe in always though it bring us death.
  
  
  






The Pipe
 

          
          Yesterday I found my pipe while pondering a long evening of work, of fine winter work. Thrown aside were my cigarettes, with all the childish joys of summer, into the past which the leaves shining blue in the sun, the muslins, illuminate, and taken up once again was the grave pipe of a serious man who wants to smoke for a long while without being disturbed, so as better to work: but I was not prepared for the surprise that this abandoned object had in store for me; for hardly had I drawn the first puff when I forgot the grand books I was planning to write, and, amazed, moved to a feeling of tenderness, I breathed in the air of the previous winter which was now coming back to me. I had not been in contact with my faithful sweetheart since returning to France, and now all of London, London as I had lived it a year ago entirely alone, appeared before my eyes: first the dear fogs that muffle one's brains and have an odor of their own there when they penetrate beneath the casements. My tobacco had the scent of a somber room with leather furniture sprinkled by coal dust, on which the thin black cat would curl and stretch; the big fires! and the maid with red arms pouring coals, and the noise of those coals falling from the sheet-iron bucket into the iron scuttle in the morning--when the postman gave the solemn double knock that kept me alive! Once again I saw through the windows those sickly trees of the deserted square--I saw the open sea, crossed so often that winter, shivering on the deck of the steamer wet with drizzle and blackened from the fumes--with my poor wandering beloved, decked out in traveller's clothes, a long dress, dull as the dust of the roads, a coat clinging damply to her cold shoulders, one of those straw hats with no feather and hardly any ribbons that wealthy ladies throw away upon arrival, mangled as they are by the sea, and that poor loved ones refurbish for many another season. Around her neck was wound the terrible handkerchief that one waves when saying goodbye forever.
        




The Ragpickers' Wine
 

In the muddy maze of some old neighborhood,
Often, where the street lamp gleams like blood,
As the wind whips the flame, rattles the glass,
Where human beings ferment in a stormy mass,

One sees a ragpicker knocking against the walls,
Paying no heed to the spies of the cops, his thralls,
But stumbling like a poet lost in dreams;
He pours his heart out in stupendous schemes.

He takes great oaths and dictates sublime laws,
Casts down the wicked, aids the victims' cause;
Beneath the sky, like a vast canopy,
He is drunken of his splendid qualities.

Yes, these people, plagued by household cares,
Bruised by hard work, tormented by their years,
Each bent double by the junk he carries,
The jumbled vomit of enormous Paris,--

They come back, perfumed with the smell of stale
Wine-barrels, followed by old comrades, pale
From war, mustaches like limp flags, to march
With banners, flowers, through the triumphal arch

Erected for them, by some magic touch!
And in the dazzling, deafening debauch
Of bugles, sunlight, of huzzas and drum,
Bring glory to the love-drunk folks at home!

Even so, wine pours its gold to frivolous
Humanity, a shining Pactolus;
Then through man's throat of high exploits it sings
And by its gifts reigns like authentic kings.

To lull these wretches' sloth and drown the hate
Of all who mutely die, compassionate,
God has created sleep's oblivion;
Man added Wine, divine child of the Sun.





Destruction
 

At my side the Demon writhes forever,
Swimming around me like impalpable air;
As I breathe, he burns my lungs like fever
And fills me with an eternal guilty desire.

Knowing my love of Art, he snares my senses,
Apearing in woman's most seductive forms,
And, under the sneak's plausible pretenses,
Lips grow accustomed to his lewd love-charms.

He leads me thus, far from the sight of God,
Panting and broken with fatigue into
The wilderness of Ennui, deserted and broad,

And into my bewildered eyes he throws
Visions of festering wounds and filthy clothes,
And all Destruction's bloody retinue.





The Table and the Chair
 

I

Said the Table to the Chair,
'You can hardly be aware,
'How I suffer from the heat,
'And from chilblains on my feet!
'If we took a little walk,
'We might have a little talk!
'Pray let us take the air!'
Said the Table to the Chair.


II

Said the Chair unto the Table,
'Now you know we are not able!
'How foolishly you talk,
'When you know we cannot walk!'
Said the Table, with a sigh,
'It can do no harm to try,
'I've as many legs as you,
'Why can't we walk on two?'


III

So they both went slowly down,
And walked about the town
With a cheerful bumpy sound,
As they toddled round and round.
And everybody cried,
As they hastened to their side,
'See! the Table and the Chair
'Have come out to take the air!'


IV

But in going down an alley,
To a castle in a valley,
They completely lost their way,
And wandered all the day,
Till, to see them safely back,
They paid a Ducky-quack,
And a Beetle, and a Mouse,
Who took them to their house.


V

Then they whispered to each other,
'O delightful little brother!
'What a lovely walk we've taken!
'Let us dine on Beans and Bacon!'
So the Ducky, and the leetle
Browny-Mousy and the Beetle
Dined, and danced upon their heads
Till they toddled to their beds.





True Solar Holiday
 

Out of the whim of data,
 Out of binary contests driven and stored,
 By the law of large numbers and subject to that law
 Which in time will correct us like an event,
 And from bounce and toss of things that aren't even things,
 I've determined the trend I call "you and know you are real,
 Your unwillingness to appear
 In all but the least likely worlds, as in this world
 Here. In spite of excursions, despite my expenditures
 Ever more anxiously matrixed, ever baroque,
 I can prove we have met and I've proved we can do it again
 By each error I make where otherwise one couldn't be
 Because only an actual randomness
 Never admits a mistake. It's for your sake,
 Then (though the stars get lost from the bottle,
 Though the bottle unwind), if I linger around in the wrong
 Ringing up details, pixel by high bit by bit,
 In hopes of you not as integer but at least as the sum
 Of all my near misses, divisible,
 Once there is time, to an average that poses you perfectly
 Like a surprise, unaccidentally credible
 Perfectly like a surprise. Am I really too patient
 When this is the only program from which you derive?
 Not if you knew how beautiful you will be,
 How important it is your discovery dawn on me,
 How as long as I keep my attention trained
 Then finally the days
 Will bow every morning in your direction
 As they do to the sun that hosannas upon that horizon
 Of which I am witness and not the one farther on:
 Set to let me elect you as if there were no other choice,
 Choice made like temperature, trend I can actually feel






Wish
 

Tune yr sandwich to the key of C
 Make biscuits in kitchen B
  
 Miss Scarlet with her lead pipe
 Waits behind the cupboard door
  
 Clubs one from the other limp
 Only to begin again innocent
  
 & nothing to do but gather into
 Legion gather into constellation
  
 Coming along then a spider its web
 Holds the walls together holds the floor
  
 Up gathers toward a central point
 Mean & distribution derivation
  
 To insert a thumb & see what sticks
 Past the earth's crust cirrus
  
 And acidic enough to spoon fork but
 Chew & eat & swallow digesting the fact
  
 That nine wonders hope the clouds have
 Answers hope the clouds have

Want
 

She wants a house full of cups and the ghosts
 of last century's lesbians; I want a spotless
 apartment, a fast computer.  She wants a woodstove,
 three cords of ash, an axe; I want
 a clean gas flame.  She wants a row of jars:
 oats, coriander, thick green oil;
 I want nothing to store.  She wants pomanders,
 linens, baby quilts, scrapbooks.  She wants Wellesley
 reunions.  I want gleaming floorboards, the river's
 reflection.  She wants shrimp and sweat and salt;
 she wants chocolate.  I want a raku bowl,
 steam rising from rice.  She wants goats,
 chickens, children.  Feeding and weeping.  I want
 wind from the river freshening cleared rooms.
 She wants birthdays, theaters, flags, peonies.
 I want words like lasers.  She wants a mother's
 tenderness.  Touch ancient as the river.
 I want a woman's wit swift as a fox.
 She's in her city, meeting
 her deadline; I'm in my mill village out late
 with the dog, listening to the pinging wind bells, thinking
 of the twelve years of wanting, apart and together.

 to drive the hundred miles and try it again.
  
  
  
  
  






Missing Carnival
 

O Venlo, Venlo, stedje van pleseer. This time
 her body made him think of countryside,
 some figure from his childhood, sun on scythe,
 wind blowing shadows across the shining barley, 
  
 the milk-pail dented from use, the smell of leaf-mulch
 and leather in the tack room. Soon she'd take bus
 and ferry from London to Belfast, but first
 the fire in her bed-sit. Her fingers traveled too,
  
 down the raised purple scars along his vertebrae, 
 the flannel sheets between her thighs, his hair 
 trailing along her abdomen, the quill 
 of a feather poking through seams of the comforter, 
  
 the comforter itself. Those scars--he'd lied
 to her, his time in Nicaragua, thugs cut 
 him coming from the fields. The bloodier fight 
 was with his brother, slicing tines of a pitchfork 
  
 plucked up along the flooded Maas. Everything 
 reduced to trinket and anecdote, the beer 
 and facepaint of carnival, street-dance and tuba, 
 beyond the muddy English roundabouts, the brown
  
 and white waves, yellow lamps along Dutch highways, 
 his work at the union office pinned beneath
 a glass globe paperweight--shaken 
 it showered silver snow over the wide
  
 straw hat, red and green plow, the slouching body,
 a campesino from days before Somoza fell.
 He wondered if she were any better, smuggling 
 French social theory into Ulster, encounter
  
 groups in the rec-centers of tower-block basements.
 She'd just gotten the news: her last lover died 
 in a fire along the side of the highway, body 
 broken in seven places, silver chrome,
  
 pearl and gold gas tank scorched, his bike crumpled
 beneath the husk of an overturned van.
 There wasn't much to talk about. Afterwards she lay
 with her back to him and he sang her carnival songs
  
in a language she didn't speak, O Venlo, stedje van
 pleseer. He thought of himself as the sun, kissing
 her neck at the hairline, turning grey cobblestones 
 of the town-square silver, marshaling parades.
  






Shaved Head
 

Forget contingencies from weather and wind,
 my Helen's head was shaved, the shortest bit 
 of stubble growing in. With darkened arching
 black eye-brows, Betty-Blue mouth penciled red,
  
 jet patent-leather trench and high-heeled boots,
 she seemed more mannequin for Fashion Ave.'s
 penitent spread than enemy to brass
 at Camp LeJeune. Simply and grudgingly put,
  
 her talk was action. Invincible in Bell-
 Atlantic block and tack, she converted non-coms 
 and saved CO's, harped flint and skinned the chair
 of military courts through well-pitched cheek,
  
 prompt dispatch from the War Resister's League.
 She looked good even on a bicycle, hemming left
 through traffic on Fourteenth Street, locking up
 on Lafayette or Grand. She doused for me
  
 to celebrate--marched right through human waste
 and Bowery puddles, stretched her legs over the last
 old-fashioned hobos up to East Second Street.
 Those ancient days, our vestibule was manned
  
 by crack-dealing Stan, a concierge of wit
 and improv, half his face scored by orange scars 
 from hydrofluoric burns. He kept the place safe.
 But I had gone, cleared out behind a gang
  
 of kids from Bronxville high on catnip wins,
 shell-game victims. Left Stan my toaster, shelves,
 a wire bird-cage, and, for once, nothing to say.
 Except to ask if he could touch her skull.

Even now it makes no sense. Her precedents
 I knew lurched out of focus: photos from France
 after the Vichy fell, Jeannes and Sylvianes
 who'd made Nazi moll; those Belfast girls
  
 last-ditched by soldier boys or peelers; two-
 toned Bergen-Belsen, bald sister to Fort Santiago.
 Then Squeaky Fromm, the other Manson moms,
 at Charlie's trial. Extremes of Joan of Arc,
  
 or even Buddhist nuns. Hated, chastened--
 or chaste, at least. Not what you'd run (I ran)
 your fingers satisfied across, the stubble
 surprising, soft as mink or fox, and arch
  
 your back, as I did once she found me uptown, 
 say yes I give again when she went down--
 and faster now, quick as the television 
 dropped after dishes to the curb--or slipped 
  
 gradually up, the seconds separating
 as slowly as but more exquisitely than
 ticks off expensive fifty-minute hours--
 and some community service--all gone, and just 
  
 as easily forgotten the raft of former friends 
 I'd cursed and floated off the island. Shaved head, 
 her slender neck, dark shoulders--that was half--
 or less--her most convincing argument.
  






Mysterious Neighbors
 

Country people rise early 
as their distant lights testify. 
They don't hold water in common. Each house 
has a personal source, like a bank account, 
a stone vault. Some share eggs, 
some share expertise, 
and some won't even wave. 
A walk for the mail elevates the heart rate. 
Last November I saw a woman down the road 
walk out to her mailbox dressed in blaze orange 
cap to boot, a cautious soul. 
Bullets can't read her No Trespassing sign. 
Strange to think they're in the air 
like lead bees with a fatal sting. 
Our neighbor across the road sits in his kitchen 
with his rifle handy and the window open. 
You never know when. Once 
he shot a trophy with his barrel resting on the sill. 
He's in his seventies, born here, joined the Navy, 
came back. Hard work never hurt a man 
until suddenly he was another broken tool. 
His silhouette against the dawn 
droops as though drought-stricken, each step 
deliberate, down the driveway to his black mailbox, 
prying it open. Checking a trap.





Brother, Ive seen some
 

Brother, I've seen some 
     Astonishing sights:
A lion keeping watch 
     Over pasturing cows;
A mother delivered 
     After her son was;
A guru prostrated
     Before his disciple;
Fish spawning
     On treetops;               
A cat carrying away
     A dog;
A gunny-sack
     Driving a bullock-cart;
A buffalo going out to graze,
     Sitting on a horse;
A tree with its branches in the earth,
     Its roots in the sky;
A tree with flowering roots.

This verse, says Kabir,
     Is your key to the universe.
If you can figure it out.






How do you
 

How do you,
Asks the chief of police,
Patrol a city
Where the butcher shops
Are guarded by vultures;
Where bulls get pregnant,
Cows are barren,
And calves give milk
Three times a day;
Where mice are boatmen
And tomcats the boats
They row;
Where frogs keep snakes
As watchdogs,
And jackals 
Go after lions? 

Does anyone know
What I'm talking about? 
Says Kabir.






To tonsured monks and dreadlocked Rastas
 

To tonsured monks and dreadlocked Rastas,
To idol worshippers and idol smashers,
To fasting Jains and feasting Shaivites,
To Vedic pundits and Faber poets,
The weaver Kabir sends one message:
The noose of death hangs over all.
Only Rama's name can save you.
Say it now. 






His death in Benares
 

For Geoff Dyer his front yard is the true Benares      -- Devara Dasimayya,           tr. A.K. Ramanujan
His death in Benares
Won't save the assassin 
From certain hell,

Any more than a dip
In the Ganges will send
Frogs--or you--to paradise.

My home, says Kabir,
Is where there's no day, no night,
And no holy book in sight

To squat on our lives.






Chewing slowly
 

god my darlingdo me a favour and kill my mother-in-law             --Janabai, tr. Arun Kolatkar
Chewing slowly,
Only after I'd eaten
My grandmother,
Mother,
Son-in-law,
Two brothers-in-law,
And father-in-law
(His big family included)
In that order,
And had for dessert
The town's inhabitants,

Did I find, says Kabir,
The beloved that I've become
One with.






Plucking your eyebrows
 

Plucking your eyebrows,
Putting on mascara,
But will that help you
To see things anew? 

The one who sees
Is changed into 
The one who's seen
Only if one is 

Salt and the other 
Water. But you, says Kabir,
Are a dead 
Lump of quartz. 






I wont come
 

I won't come
I won't go
I won't live
I won't die

I'll keep uttering
The name
And lose myself
In it

I'm bowl
And I'm platter
I'm man
And I'm woman

I'm grapefruit
And I'm sweet lime
I'm Hindu
And I'm Muslim

I'm fish
And I'm net
I'm fisherman
And I'm time

I'm nothing
Says Kabir
I'm not among the living
Or the dead






Shanidar, Now Iraq
 

When bones and flesh have finished their business together,
we lay them carefully, in positions they're willing to keep,
and cover them over.
Their eyes and ours won't meet anymore. We hope.

It's one of the oldest rules we mostly follow.
In the deep Stone Age in Shanidar, now Iraq,
someone or all of them laid or threw on the grandfather's chest
whatever was blooming--
St. Barnaby's thistle, yarrow, hollyhock...
His was their only burial before the frost.

For millennia, then, the dead might go under with thistle,
quantities of red ocher, a chunk of meat.
Now we have everlasting bouquets of plastic;
now we have hundreds a day to bag and box and pickle
to re-cross the Atlantic.

Light a row of oil wells and kneel
on sand too much embroiled for tombs.
Regrettably, something of the smell
is of bodies suddenly buried in fallen stones.
But some is incense, pinches of pulverized Baghdad rising
in ceremonial smoke:
dust of combatants, onlookers, miscellaneous limbs,
contents of hovels, contents of museums,
ancient pollen of yarrow and hollyhock.






The Ghost of Heaven
 

Sleep to sleep through thirty years of night,
a child herself with child, 
for whom we searched

through here, or there, amidst 
bones still sleeved and trousered,
a spine picked clean, a paint can, 
a skull with hair


Sewn into the hem of memory: 
Fire. 
God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob,
God not 
of philosophers or scholars. God not of poets. 


Night to night:
child walking toward me through burning maize
over the clean bones of those whose flesh
was lifted by zopilotes into heaven.

So that is how we ascend! 
In the clawed feet of fallen angels. 
To be assembled again 
in the work rooms of clouds.


She rose from where they found her lying
not far from a water urn, leaving 
herself behind on the ground
where they found her, holding her arms
before her as if she were asleep.

That is how she appears to me: a ghost in heaven.
Carrying her arms in her arms.


Blue smoke from corn cribs, flap of wings.
On the walls of the city streets a plague of initials.


Walking through a fire-lit river 
to a burning house: dead Singer
sewing machine and piece of dress. 

Outside a cashew tree wept 
blackened cashews over lamina. 

Outside paper fireflies rose to the stars.


Bring penicillin if you can, surgical tape, a whetstone, 
mosquito repellent but not the aerosol kind. 
Especially bring a syringe for sucking phlegm,
a knife, wooden sticks, a surgical clamp, and plastic bags.

You will need a bottle of cloud 
for anesthesia.

Like the flight of a crane 
through colorless dreams.


When a leech opens your flesh it leaves a small volcano.
Always pour turpentine over your hair before going to sleep.


Such experiences as these are forgotten 
before memory intrudes.

The girl was found (don't say this)
with a man's severed head stuffed 
into her where a child would have been.
No one knew who the man was. 
Another of the dead. 
So they had not, after all, 
killed a pregnant girl. 
This was a relief to them.


That sound in the brush? 
A settling of wind in sorghum.

If they capture you, talk.
Talk. Please yes. You heard me 
right the first time.

You will be asked who you are.
Eventually, we are all asked who we are.

All who come 
All who come into the world
All who come into the world are sent.
Open your curtain of spirit.





Torment
 

"I fucked up bad: Justin cracks his neck,
talking to nobody. Fifteen responsible children,
final semester college seniors, bloodshot,
collars undone, gorgeously exhausted, 
return from Wall Street interviews 
in attitudes of surrender on the Dinky--
the one-car commuter train connecting 
Princeton to the New York line. Panic-sweat 
sheens their faces. Justin hasn't seen me yet. 
"Something's fucked with my tie. He's right. 
I see his future, the weight he'll gain 
first in his face, then gut and ass, the look 
of bad luck he'll haunt his bad jobs with. 
He tears off the tie. Elephants on it. 

Fatigue, swollen ankles, the midwife said. 
The worst discomforts of pregnancy. 
I wrote those down. But she's wrong: 
self-pity. Strange dreams, she said. 
No dreams. Discarded newspapers--
business section, money, real estate, auto--
sift apart to quartos and folios underfoot. 
"Shut up, Justin, says the girl across from him. 
I hardly recognize Brianna in her interview hair. 
She scratches her face, fingers trembling 
from the day's aftershocks. "I wanted, 
she counts on her fingers, performing 
the sitcom of her tragedy, "Tribeca loft, 
expense account, designer clothes so haute 
they don't look it, my very own Tesla, summer 
home in the Hamptons I'm too busy to use.
"You wanted money, says Justin.
Brianna: "It went down with the towers.

I spent my lopsided day lifting my belly
back towards center, interviewing for adjunct jobs. 
There's a half-moon in half-clouds 
up over the tracks. Justin spreads 
over three seats, texts with his thumbs, 
talks: "The Lehman Brothers guy asks me, 
Did you ever sell anything? Sell me a bottle of water. 
I'm like fu-uck. To say something I say 
Why do you like water?' He says... 
Justin fixes a diamond stud back in his ear. 
"They'll let me know. Fifteen responsible children
sigh in disappointed relief. Somebody they know
didn't get the job they didn't get. I sleep. Wake.
Beautiful clothes spread bodiless before me!
Tailored black suits and skirts, silk ties,
ephemera of sheer and filmy stockings 
deflated over seat backs. Brianna looks around,
no conductor coming, squats to peel off, 
in one motion, skirt, hose, underpants, step 
butt-naked into soft chino shorts I'll never
be able to afford. "Nervous crotch sweat, she says.

I keep trying to look not-quite-40
in a different way than I'm not-quite-40.
The woman interviewer looked at my belly.
"As a new mother would you have time to be 
literary mama to your students? So I could sue
when they don't hire me for the job I don't want.
Justin looks up from his iPhone: "Soon-Ji
got three offers. Fuck. He flips the curl
his mother's fingers crimped, first day of pre-K
into his four-year-old forelock. "He's guessing 
he'll go with Goldman Sachs. Brianna grabs her neck 
in living garrote. She high-fives anybody 
she can reach in gloomy delight. She gobbles
snack-pack popcorn, licks her fingers; bits drop
yellow from her lips. "My mom will go crazy
Deutsche Bank didn't offer. She sees me.
"I didn't realize that was you with your hair up.
Look, Just. She high-fives me. "It's Professor.

Is Brianna crying? "Don't call me Professor, 
I say, dozens of times a semester. "I'm a writer, 
not a teacher. Justin grabs a Norton Anthology 
out of his five-hundred-dollar briefcase. "Fuck.
What are we supposed to read for tomorrow?
"Prufrock, dummy, Brianna says. "You're 
a good professor. She condescends through tears. 
"Poor baby, mocks Justin, slumping so low 
in the seat I only see his shoe soles on the arm rest. 
The train swooshes through suburban tracts. 
The moon gets smaller. Brianna arrives 
mornings to workshop in a fake hurry 
and the sweats she slept in, probably rolls back
in bed after. She hands out slight, surprising poems,
apologizes, sips cardboard-container coffee 
in a recyclable sleeve, turns her BlackBerry to vibrate.
It moans like indigestion through class.

I hand her one of my self-pity tissues. My ankles 
are slim. Brianna hates her name. "So tacky.
I'd be a Kelly if I were twenty years older.
I'd like to be able to hate her. I'm turning 
into my Favorite Teachers--so kind,
so industrious, so interested and interesting.
"Sorry I'm late with my portfolio, she says
through sniffles. She dabs her lip. "I had to prepare for,
a breath, "interviews. A few times a semester
I say "It's only poetry. Gumbleeds! nosebleeds!
the midwife predicted, and it's true, my Kleenexes
are measled with blood, weird hairs, stretch marks,
frequent catnaps, hip joints so loose you must 
take care walking. The fetus dabs its fingers 
in the sponge of me, flails. At the second class, 
Brianna said, "My mom would go crazy. 
I can't read all these sex poems. We're Christian.
I said, "Poems should be about life,
part of life is sex. Two kids wrote that down
in notebooks. One was Justin. "But skip
any reading that makes you uncomfortable.
Next week, Brianna wrote about hanging 
onto stall walls in her residence hall bathroom,
fucking Princeton boys one by one.
Justin's poem was "Torment, seven pages long.

Favorite Teachers write poems about students!
Reading them is like listening to whores
talk about clients; however contemptuous they sound,
everybody knows who's selling, who's buying.
I'd like to be able to like them. I sleep. Wake. 
"Justin's your boyfriend? I whisper to Brianna.
My cell phone rings, screen says it's my husband.
If I answer, I'll cry. Voice mail takes it.
"God no, says Brianna. "We hate each other,
right, Just? Never date the competition,
you destroy your luck. Besides. She starts
morosely high-fiving again. "I'm a virgin.
Justin laughs. She wraps her hair around her face
to smell it. "I pay attention in class.
Professor Krugman, he's a real professor.
She points at a headline I just kicked. Housing
Upturn Predicted. "He says housing increases
don't matter in the long run. It's a blip,
if it's even a blip. If I don't get a job, 
it's Wharton mba. Or teach English in Japan.
But this girl on my floor told me Asian girls
depilate their whole bodies, even their arms.
I can't be the hairiest person in my life.

What will I do next year without the job
I don't want? I sleep. "Hey! says Brianna.
"I could go back to Spain, smoke Ducados
in okupa cafes. Be a poet! 
Sorry. Laughs herself out of last tears
at the idea. "I didn't mean to get all
Sylvia Plathy on you. Anyway, my trust fund
is safe. Knock plastic. She reaches to rap the tie
Justin hung over the seat. I say, "In Madrid
workers smoke Ducados. Reds are for anarchista
Eurotrash wannabes. Brianna lips the cigarette
she'll light on the platform. "I'll have my portfolio
next week, promise. All semester she's revised
following precisely, appallingly, my suggestions.
She says "Think of me as raw talent wasted.
I'm pissed I think of her at all. Justin again,
talking at no one: "Merrill Lynch says
what interests you in our company? I'm amped. 
I'm whipped. I'm like Um, I heard you were hiring?'
Nah, I'm giving him eight good reasons.
He cuts me off... The train slows, surceases
with a hiss. Fifteen responsible children
stand in the aisle. Jizz, jess, fuck, markered
on seats by younger, irresponsible children.

Off the train, Justin jumps into a low Mazda coupe,
yellow as Dick Tracy's hat, parked unticketed
at an expired meter, open to the rain. I autodial: 
"I'm at the station. Don't come, I need the walk. 
Brianna: "Where's Soon-Ji anyway? Flying his plane back?
God, what'll we do if nobody wants us?
Justin: "Soon-Ji will fucking keep us I guess. 
All we have is Dad's money.
Brianna: "Mine's Mom's. Half of it gone in the crash. 
But Soon-Ji is great-grandfathered in. He'll be richer
than we'll ever be if he never gets a job at all.
Justin: "Professor, you hand back comments tomorrow,
right? They're important to me.
"Fuck you, suck-up, Brianna says.

Sometimes I forget I'm pregnant till I walk.
Brianna vaults into the car, leans out: 
"Want a ride, Professor? Cigarette? 
She puts one in my mouth, lights it
with a naked boy lighter that squirts fire
out his tiny penis. "Beer? Tears a can
off a six-pack choke-ring, sticks it in a baggie
she pulls from Justin's glove compartment,
pops the top, shoves it in my hand. "Now
you can't walk home--pregnant, smoking,
carrying a beer? You'd be arrested. Anyway, 
Soon-Ji is having a party. Cristal! Rappers! 
He produces them and brings his stable 
down from Queens. You have to come! 
He was going to take your workshop, 
he admires you, but took playwriting instead.
For final relaxation in prenatal yoga, we do
our Kegels squatting in a circle, shut-eyed--
"for perineal strengthening, the teacher said.
Then we lie on our sides, breathe in, breathe out,
bellies like dropped anchors on the floor.
Our muscles tick, smoothing, loosening.
The teacher reads an affirming poem. I tense up. 

Brianna: "We always say Krugman's one of the few
Professors we'd friend on Facebook.
But, Daisy, we'd friend you too. Memory: 
Favorite Teachers at our college house parties, 
slow-dancing with us, doing lines 
in our bathrooms. When are they going to grow up, 
we said. I wave, walk, drop the cigarette
in the beer, the can in the trash can, relieved 
to be embarrassed, triumphant, sorry. Justin 
drives along beside me, Brianna rides shotgun
standing like a surfer on a breaking wave. 
Justin--"Fuck--floors it, roars past me, away.
I don't know how to end this poem. On "Torment 
I wrote: "You may want to find a way to suggest
ironic distance between the poet and speaker.
I couldn't figure out what else,
to responsible children, there was to say.





House of Cedar, Rafters of Fir
 

Comfort me with apples; for I am sick of love          --Song of Solomon
scent of myrrh on the handles
            when oil is in the lock
silken is his mouth
            when he is hard upon me 

young heart, green bed,
            his fingers are in the stream
he eats of the bitter honey
            the sweetness of cherry

sacrament of the blood
            and of its winding
sacrament of arrival
            and of its binding

expert in earth, eager in flesh
            he falls upon me and feasts
the watchmen have not seen him
            nor the owl in her nest

his darkness at noon
            among the white buildings
a hand that was stone
            builds the inner temple

sacrament of what is written
            on the table of the heart
blueness of the wound
            where he has placed his kiss






The Dry Bones
 

My river is mine own, and I have made it for myself           --Ezekiel
And into the heavens, as on a bright day after rain,
there came the shapes of four creatures,
and they each had the likeness of a man,
and each man had four wings outstretched
and each wing had four eyes emblazoned, wide open,
given to weeping at the worlds they contained:

an eye-world of light, of fire and air,
of water and its mirror, heart and its first fear;
and in each world were four names,
entangled in its forest of letters,
whereupon I could read: Dow Jones, Cargill,
Chevron, and DeKalb of the frozen seed,
bearing but once and giving up its need; 

and under each name were discovered four meanings,
literal, figurative, rational, dim,
and under each meaning a counter-meaning, 
with its likeness of Freud, Marx, Hegel, and Lacan; 
and the four figures passed as one overhead,
their wingtips linked like molten silver joined.

For I, Ezekiel, had been given to eat
the very substance of God, 
and my eyes were open and my mouth spake,
as spring opens winter and winter closes fall;
and the earth turned rightly, to my senses sweet.
Son of man, they called me, a proverb and a sign.

Say: I am a sign of the city, the cauldron
where men burn down to desire. 
Say: I am the proverb of nothing and one,
boiling over the fire, rising out of belief
and falling, like a tyrant, out of derision alone.

And lo, a likeness, as of the appearance of fire,
the error of presence, of nothing as one,
and lo, another likeness, the appearance of water, 
the error of absence, of something as none;
for water surrounds all shapes that enter
but has no shape of its own, 
and fire is the shape of ruin alone.

For the princes of the sea 
shall cast their garments upon the land's end:
their scholar's robes, sharkskin suits, 
and alligator shoes, their Nikes,
Reeboks, and Chuvashian mittens
knitted by the children of shepherds, 
by tinsmiths and ladies' men, 
in the dark at the back of the store; 
for the princes of fire consume what they love, 
with the reckless ambition of gods.

Yea, as I spake to dry bones that lay upon the earth,
they danced into being, and chattered, one and one,
down the hallways of my desert, the thresholds of my river.
For the Lord builds ruined palaces and plants desolation,
he receives what is absent; possesses all that is gone.






The Watchman of Ephraim
 

 The workman made it; therefore it is not God          --Hosea
Hear the word of the Lord,
ye children of Pittsburgh, 
of Calistoga and Tlaquepaque,
ye hierophants and wishbones,
teraphim and household plants, 
for I am a jealous God betrayed.

My lover, whom I uplifted,
has fallen to other affections.
Weep for her outcast state,
for I rescind her corn and her fields, 
her appetites and her husbands, 
her loom and the cloth of her weaving; 
yea, as she sleeps in her bed,
I will crumble her idols of clay.

I will cause to burn in the night
her barns filled with swallows,
her caves of rodents and bats, 
her racks of sidereal dresses, 
her stacks of serpentine hats.

The velvet of her touch, once royal, 
I will scarify with my wrath.
for I am a god betrayed; my love
has reached into my weakness
and turned my heart like a fist. 

Therefore, I will strip her naked
and drive her into the field.
In her body of filth and feathers,
her blood of beasts and men, she is
my desolation and a forgotten name.

For my cosmos is contracted. 
My first world slips from my hands.
Tell the people, my prophet Hosea, 
that I loved her more than love,
and she gave not love in return.

My anger flattens and spreads
along the walls and windows.
It glances from my mirrors
and breaks the east wind's bones.
I was a God of such strength
they could not guess my name.
And this woman of human warmth
suckled me like a child.

Now I dwell with the mole, blindly,
and my voice is thin as a gnat's.
I grieve what grinds in me, heavily.
I am but a half note, half sung.






Against Gregariousness
 

Facing the wind, the hovering stormy petrels
Tap-dance on the water.
They pluck the tuna hatchlings
As Pavlova, had she been in a tearing hurry,
Might once have picked up pearls
From a broken necklace.

Yellowfin drive the turbine of sardines
Up near the surface so the diving shearwaters
Can fly down through the bubbles and get at them.
Birds from above and big fish from below
Rip at the pack until it comes apart
Like Poland, with survivors in single figures.

The krill, as singletons almost not there
But en masse like a cloud of diamond dust
Against the sunlit flood of their ballroom ceiling,
Are scooped up by the basking shark's dragline
Or sucked in through the whale's drapes of baleen--
A galaxy absorbed into a boudoir
And nullified, a deep-space mass extinction
Watched only by the Hubble telescope.

Make your bones in a shark family if you can.
If not, be tricky to locate for sheer
Translucence, a slick blip that will become--
Beyond the daisycutter beaks and jaws--
A lobster fortified with jutting eaves
Of glazed tile, like the castle at Nagoya
Hoisted around by jacks and cranes, an awkward
Mouthful like a crushed car. That being done,
Crawl backwards down a hole and don't come out.






Can Be No Sorrow
 

That narrow cot, hardly any bigger than a child's, is where Droste died 
(it's there in her museum in Meersburg),
on that sofa Hlderlin in his tower room at the carpenter's,
Rilke and George in hospital beds presumably, in Switzerland,
in Weimar, Nietzsche's great black eyes
rested on white pillows 
till they looked their last--
all of it junk now, or no longer extant,
unattributable, anonymous
in its insentient and continual disintegration.

We bear within us the seeds of all the gods, 
the gene of death and the gene of love--
who separated them, the words and things,
who blended them, the torments and the place where they come to an end, 
the few boards and the floods of tears,
home for a few wretched hours.

Can be no sorrow. Too distant, too remote, 
bed and tears too impalpable,
no No, no Yes,
birth and bodily pain and faith 
an undefinable surge, a lurch,
a power stirring in its sleep
moved bed and tears--
sleep well!






Little Aster
 

A drowned drayman was hoisted on to the slab.
Someone had jammed a lavender aster
between his teeth.
As I made the incision up from the chest
with a long knife
under the skin
to cut out tongue and gums, 
I must have nudged it because it slipped
into the brain lying adjacent.
I packed it into the thoracic cavity
with the excelsior
when he was sewn up.
Drink your fill in your vase!
Rest easy,
little aster!






Beautiful Youth
 

The mouth of the girl who had lain long in the rushes
looked so nibbled.
When they opened her chest, her esophagus was so holey.
Finally in a bower under the diaphragm
they found a nest of young rats.
One little thing lay dead.
The others were living off kidneys and liver
drinking the cold blood and had
had themselves a beautiful youth.
And just as beautiful and quick was their death:
the lot of them were thrown into the water.
Ah, will you hearken at the little muzzles' oinks!






Threat
 

Know this:
I live beast days. I am a water hour.
At night my eyelids droop like forest and sky.
My love knows few words:
I like it in your blood.






Tracing
 

                                i
 

O those years! The green light of morning
and the still unswept pavements of pleasure--
summer yelled from every surface of the city
and supped at a horn
refilled from above.

Silent hour. Watery colors
of a pale green eye's diluted stream
pictures in that magic green, glass dances,
shepherds and streams, a dome, pigeons--
woven, dispatched, shining, faded--
mutable clouds of happiness!

So you faced the day: the font
without bubbles, dawdling
buildings and staircases; the houses
locked up, it was for you to create
the morning, early jasmine,
its yelps, its incipient aboriginal
stream--still without end--O those years!

Something unquenchable in the heart,
complement to heaven and earth;
playing to you from reeds and gardens,
evening storms
drenched the brassy umbels,
darkly they burst, taut with seeds,
and sea and strands, 
wimpled with tents,
full of burning sand,
weeks bronzing, tanning everything
to pelts for kisses landing
indiscriminately like cloudbursts
and soon over!

Even then
a weight overhead
grapes bunching
you pulled down the boughs and let them bounce up,
only a few berries
if you wanted
first--

not yet so bulging and overhung with
plate-sized fruit,
old heavy grape flesh--

O those years!

                                ii
 

Dark days of spring,
unyielding murk in the leaves;
drooping lilacs, barely looking up
narcissus color, and smelling strongly of death,
loss of content,
untriumphant sadness of the unfulfilled.

And in the rain
falling on the leaves,
I hear an old forest song,
from forests I crossed
and saw again, but I didn't return
to the hall where they were singing,
the keys were silent,
the hands were resting somewhere
apart from the arms that held me,
moved me to tears,
hands from the eastern steppes,
long since trampled and bloody--
only the forest song
in the rain
dark days of spring
the everlasting steppes.






A Shadow on the Wall
 

A shadow on the wall
boughs stirred by the noonday wind
that's enough earth
and for the eye
enough celestial participation.

How much further do you want to go? Refuse
the bossy insistence
of new impressions--

lie there still,
behold your own fields,
your estate,
dwelling especially
on the poppies,
unforgettable
because they transported the summer--

where did it go?






Think of the Unsatisfied Ones
 

When despair--
you who enjoyed great triumphs
and walked with confidence and the memory 
of many gifts of delirium and dawns
and unexpected 
turns--
when despair wants you in its grip,
and threatens you from some unfathomable depth
with destruction 
and the guttering out of your flame:

then think of the unsatisfied ones,
with their migraine-prone temples and introverted dispositions,
loyal to a few memories
that held out little hope,
who still bought flowers,
and with a smile of not much luminosity 
confided secret desires
to their small-scale heavens
that were soon to be extinguished.






Hymn
 

That quality of the great boxers
to be able to stand there
and take shots,

gargle with firewater,
encounter intoxication
at sub- and supra-atomic levels,
to leave one's sandals at the crater's lip
like Empedocles, and descend,

not say: I'll be back,
not think: fifty-fifty,
to vacate molehills
when dwarves want space to grow,
to dine alone,
indivisible,
and able to renounce your victory--

a hymn to that man.






People Met
 

I have met people who, 
asked after their names, 
shyly--as if they had no title
to an appellation all to themselves--
replied "Frulein Christian and added:
"like the first name, they wanted to make it easy for the other,
not a difficult name like "Popiol or "Babendererde--
"like the first name--please, don't burden your memory overmuch!

I have met people who 
grew up in a single room with their parents 
and four brothers and sisters, and studied at night
with their fingers in their ears at the kitchen table,
and grew up to be beautiful and self-possessed as duchesses--
and innerly gentle and hard-working as Nausicaa,
clear-browed as angels.

I have often asked myself and never found an answer
whence kindness and gentleness come,
I don't know it to this day, and now must go myself.






Last Spring
 

Fill yourself up with the forsythias
and when the lilacs flower, stir them in too
with your blood and happiness and wretchedness,
the dark ground that seems to come with you.

Sluggish days. All obstacles overcome.
And if you say: ending or beginning, who knows,
then maybe--just maybe--the hours will carry you
into June, when the roses blow.






Dead Man
 

Some are born to sweet delight.                    Some are born to endless night. --William Blake, "Auguries of Innocence

We spend our lives trying to grasp the premise. William Blake is not, for instance,
 William Blake, but rather a 19th century accountant from Cleveland on the 
 lam for murder & the theft of a horse. In the closing scene,
  
 he is going to die, & so is Nobody, his half-Blackfoot, half-Blood guide.
 Sure, this is a Western, a morality tale
                                                                      about a destiny made manifest
 through the voice of a gun & a hero whose mythic flight from innocence
  
 destroys him. But we all come to the end of the line soon enough.
 The obvious just seems wiser
                                                      when Nobody says it. Time, it turns out,
 is the most common noun in the English language, as if by constant invocation,
  
 we could keep it at bay.
                                              Yesterday, I sat in another state on a large rubber ball
 in my brother's basement bouncing my newborn nephew in my arms.
 His mother, on the phone with a friend, asks what we should fear more,
  
 the hobo spider or the poison that kills it. I want to whisper into his ear
 something that feels like knowledge:
                                                                    Once upon a time, there was nothing
 & one day, there will be nothing again. This is the faraway place
  
 to which his tiny weight calls me. If he could understand the words. I think,
 he would know what I mean, having only just sprung himself
                                                                                                                from that fine sea.
 Sometimes we coo to soothe him: Don't cry, Little Bird. I know, I know.
  
 But only the roar of the vacuum finally calms him,
                                                                                            for nothing sounds as much
 like the lost world of the womb as the motors of our machines.
 The root of travel means torture, having passed from Medieval Latin
  
 into Old French. As the action opens, Johnny Depp, shot in black & white,
 is already rocking into night on a train. And soon, he will begin his dying.
 This is not to say that the inky band fanning across the morning blue
  
 of a kestrel's tail feathers
                                              has no meaning, or the first fingers of rust
 coming into bloom on the green enameled chassis of a Corona typewriter
 left in the rain.
                            Direct observation, the naturalist Niko Tinbergen assures us,
  
 is the only real thing. Perhaps this is what I should tell him.
                                                                                                              Or that this moment,
 too, is a part of some migration. Every snow bunting composes its own song,
 & a careful watcher can tell one kittiwake from its neighbor by the little dots
  
 on the tips of its wings.
                                           The most used verb is also the most humble--
 merely to be.
                         Nobody can teach to William Blake the auguries of William Blake.
 We are, instead, our own vatic visions, bumbling prophets. Our sense of ourselves
 as invented as film.
                                    Later, in an ocean-going canoe lined with cedar boughs,
 he will drift out into cold breakers, two bullets in his chest. But, here,
 in his small hat & wire glasses, he still seems
                                                                                  sweetly comic. He holds up a letter;
  
 someone's promised him a job. His fancy plaid suit makes him look like a clown.





The Synthetic A Priori
 

     What objects may be in themselves, and apart from all            this receptivity of our sensibility, remains completely           unknown to us. We know nothing but our mode of            perceiving them. . . . With this alone have we             any concern.           --Immanuel Kant, Critique of Pure Reason

At a church rummage sale, I study the perfection of shadows
 in a painting by Caravaggio, although what I hold
 is only a small print of Christ--its frame broken--dining
 at Emmaus with three of the Apostles. And because the table 
 is dramatically, if not unbelievably, lit, the bowls & pitcher
 & loaves send their dark crescents onto the immaculate
 white cloth. When the Savior raises his hand to offer a blessing,
 its shade deepens further his crimson smock. Tenebrosus:
 that rich, convincing darkness. As though the master understood
 that the obscured world only seems to us somehow
 even more familiar, as though our sense of our own unknowing
 had at last been made visible--even if what we do not know
 cannot itself be seen. The future's drape, the carnival fortunetellers
 of my childhood might have called it, but also the now's,
 displayed as it is--so many unmatched cups & saucers, old coats
 & wicker baskets--all around us. At a party last week,
 someone said verisimilitude. We were huddled on a tiny porch.
 It was the first cool night & the wine had no conclusion.
  
 The talk turned quickly to shepherds & the pastoral & then,
 to opera, before someone recalled a horror film he'd watched
 late one night with his brother. In black & white vignettes,
 an evil tree stump possessed by the spirit of an executed prince
 hunts the scheming tribal elders who have destroyed him.
 A former pro wrestler in a costume of wire & rubber bark
 & wearing a permanent scowl lumbers after vengeance
 in the confusion & fear of 1957 on a half-dozen root-legs,
 driving his victims into quicksand or toppling himself over
 upon him. Though here the point is the teller's small brother
 & the boy's allegiance, even in a state of suspended disbelief,
 to what we call sense. How, he wanted to know, suddenly
 unusually earnest, did the tree manage to get itself up again?
  
 Yesterday I spoke to a friend who is despairing: back home,
 waiting tables, he's dating a woman whose marriage has only
 just come to an end. When he wakes, he discovers he does not
recognize himself. One afternoon, walking home from school,
 I hit my best friend in the face with a book. It may well be 
 that she hit me. Thin pages flew out into the street. More punches
 were thrown & I came away bruised. In that book, a novel
 by Emily Bront, the land is violent & unjust & we are violent
 & unjust upon it. Even worse, our greatest passions
 change nothing at all. Before one of us hit the other,
 there must have been a cause, but I can't recall it, which makes it
 seem nonlinear now, &, thus, apocryphal, both impossible
 & impossibly real. I failed, though I tried, to offer comfort.
  
 It's not that our lives don't resemble our lives. I've been alone
 so often lately I sometimes catch myself watching myself--
 breathing in the fresh spears of rosemary or admiring the shallots,
 peeling their translucent wrappers away, centering one on the board,
 making the first careful cut, lifting the purple halves.
  
 Before stories, we were too busy for stories, too busy
 hunting & suffering to invent the tales of our own
 resurrections. Caught out in the kitchen's brightness last night,
 the handle of the skillet cast its simple, perfected form
 across the stove--pierced, like the eye of the needle, so that
 it can be hung from a hook, as pans, presumably, have always been.
  
 Outside the wind picked up. Thunder. The dog trotted off,
 hid her head beneath the chair. But today: a charity sale
 at Trinity Chapel & sun on the tar of the buckled walks.
 In the cracks, beads of water spin into light. Tell yourself
 it's simple: this is where it's been heading all along. Tell yourself
 something you have no faith in has already begun to occur.






Book Nine
 

      One man prays: How shall I be able to lie with this woman?      Do thou pray thus: How shall I not desire to lie with her?      Another prays thus: How shall I be released from this?             Another prays: How shall I not desire to be released?        --Marcus Aurelius

When we are lost in our longings, Aurelius, already it is too late:
 there is already nothing we can do. I have rarely desired an end
 to my desires. We are so in love with our wanting. Last week,
 though doctors were quick to repair it, a baby in India was born
 grasping her own beating heart in her fist. Today, a Dumpster
 arrives from Dave's Trash Removal & I begin to fill it. I toss in
 a transistor radio that hasn't worked in years. A man walking past
 asks if he can take it. Later, he returns & carries off a broken TV.
 A neighbor salvages the dented gray fuse box; a girl wants a window,
 a paper bag full of tangled cords. All night I listen to the wind
 & the echoes of feet kicking through rubbish, like a mouse nesting
 inside a drum. My older brother is dead a decade. Yet here
 in its enormous gold frame is the familiar, pastel portrait
 someone named Maxwell drew for our mother, an inaccurate
 rendering of the two of us when we were small. I can't look at it;
 I can't throw it away. Every change is a death, you tell yourself,
 turn thy thoughts now to thy life as a child. . . . One day, I tell myself,
 I will shut all the doors, leave everything behind. The museum
 is showing a hundred tricked-out Victorian photographs
 of that other world: the hoax of floating fairies, women haunted
 by ghostly blurs. Another century & still we want to believe
 in what we know cannot be true. Your words, Aurelius, have found me,
 but you could not. If we are disappointed, we have only ourselves
 to blame: Wipe out thy imagination. We fill out hands when they are 
 empty. We empty ourselves when we have held too much too long.






The Aunts
 

I like it when they get together 
and talk in voices that sound 
like apple trees and grape vines,

and some of them wear hats 
and go to Arizona in the winter, 
and they all like to play cards.

They will always be the ones 
who say "It is time to go now, 
even as we linger at the door,

or stand by the waiting cars, they 
remember someone--an uncle we 
never knew--and sigh, all

of them together, like wind 
in the oak trees behind the farm 
where they grew up--a place

I remember--especially 
the hen house and the soft 
clucking that filled the sunlit yard.





Bearings
 

The marriage ran under their skin, a rash, or maybe
 all that red wine, luminescent cocktail hours
 in which lost books were rediscovered, or just a rash,
 a reaction sending out runners across her chest,
 a vine, something close, ruby scarves coming back
 into fashion, their son coming back
 from school, from the yard, but now, dinnertime
 and the family parted, split houses, her ex and his anger
 spread down the long hallway of their house
 and into the windows of her new apartment, their daughter's doubled
 beds, her doubled face in family portraits that double
 in frequency, a family set down and another, this dinnertime
 and more red wine, our faces flush with love and sympathy,
 the mother decides to see the son again, and so
 our doubled flashlights giving us heaven and earth,
 all of it safe or at least unmoving, the tall fence
 her ex built to hide the little grave, to guard the lot 
 in this registered historic district (all of the houses
 bear their stories on a plaque, their first stories,
 run-on, this little town with no street lights, just moon,
 cedars), the tall fence behind which is the yard, blue,
 in this yard no marker stone and under this stone
 their son's everything, no double,
 no double






The Forest of Sure Things
 

In this land the children tear their hearts in half.
 Let me explain. If ten things are wanted, only ten
 can be had. If a stand of birches is found to be made of tin,
 the soil around them will bleed with rust. In this land children
 study their magazines in broad daylight, and in their books
 any soldier who stumbles will not fall. No one will fall,
 a gift parents try not to make much of. At every meal
 some is set aside. In every garden a patch lies fallow. At parties
 there are whispers of illegal cheeses. Camembert, especially,
 is said to taste alive. And so the children learn
 to make room. To leave some.
 Nothing will come, but nothing will go.
 To love like this half must rattle in its pit.






Wake
 

The casseroles just showed up.
 According to her sister a symbolic casting
  
 of the feminine, not gender but physics, dear--
 according to a friend she looked
  
 just like her sister, green bathrobe mid-afternoon,
 suitcase still in the trunk.
  
 She'd carried him dead for days.
 Out above the reeds a sphere of birds
  
 stretches and knots, rises as one
 brown then belly-white. Oh the hunger
  
 when it came filled every chair. 






Recording
 

The first person in recorded history
 struck by a comet slept on her couch
 across the road from the Comet Drive-In
  
 and the comet found her roof, her sadness, her knee,
 and woke her. Everything that hurts
  
 hurt before, she said. Showing at the drive-in, a documentary
 on tightrope-walking: a young man frustrated
 that his dream, the World Trade Center, was not yet built
  
 so he practiced for years in a meadow crossing intended sky, intent
 like a pillowcase sweetening him, no harm . . . Here
  
 let the towers go, let them write his crossing, cursive, back and forth
  
 his name steadying our tongues . . . Famous, overcoat
 floating down without him, the idea that we stand
  
 where we mean to stand, 1974, a distraction
  
 from my parents' morning commute. At 59th Street they split.
 The poems I was writing were no longer poems of their divorce,
  
 my father's sweeping gestures or his pain, the old Volkswagen
 and garden hose--all of that had washed from my poems
  
 and instead an imaginary family arrived in borrowed gardens,
 their son stillborn--even as I grew heavy with my own son
 I wrote poem after poem holding this imagined horror close.






The Amaranth
 

is an imaginary flower that never fades.
 The amaranth is blue with black petals,
 it's yellow with red petals,
 it's enormous and grows into the shape
 of a girl's house,
 the seeds nestle high in the closet
 where she hid a boy.
 The boy and his bike flee
 the girl's parents from the tip
 of the leaves, green summer light
 behind the veins.
 The amaranth is an imaginary flower
 in the shape of a girl's house
 dispensing gin and tonics
 from its thorns, a succulent.
 This makes the boy's bike steer
 off-course all summer, following
 the girl in her marvelous car,
 the drunken bike.
  
 He was a small part of summer,
 he was summer's tongue. 






Childhood Stories
 

 They learned to turn off the gravity in an auditorium
 and we all rose into the air,
 the same room where they demonstrated
 pow-wows and prestidigitation.
  
 But not everyone believed it.
 That was the most important lesson
 I learned--that a truck driven by a dog
 could roll down a hill at dusk
 and roll right off a dock into a lake
 and sink, and if no one believes you
 then what is the point
 of telling them wonderful things?
  
 I walked home from the pow-wow
 on an early winter night in amazement:
 they let me buy the toy tomahawk!
 As soon as I got home I was going
 to hit my sister with it, but I didn't know this.






Precision German Craftsmanship
 

It was a good day and I was about to do something important
 and good, but then I unscrewed the pen I was using
 to see the ink. Precision German craftsmanship.
 The Germans are so persnickety and precise,
 they wash their driveways. Their mountains and streams
 dance around each other in a clockwork, courtly imitation
 of spring. They build the Panzer tank, out of rakes
 hoses and garden gnomes; they built me.
 And I've seated myself above an avenue on the brink
 of mystery, always just on the lip, with my toes over the lip
 but my bowels behind.
  
 When I replaced the ink the sky was socked in,
 only one window of blue open in the north, directly over someone.
 But that person was reading about Rosicrucians in the laundromat,
 he was unaware as the blue window closed above him.
 The rest of us are limp and damp,
 I see a button in front of us that says "spin cycle.
 I'm going to push it.






Pig-In-A-Blanket
 

I wake up, bound tightly.
 A warm, valerian smell cascades
 to my palate. I can only move
 my eyelids and toes.
 Heat sits impishly on my chest,
 at my throat, curtains of it brushing against me.
 Panic creeps out of my armpits.
 I can only move my eyelids and toes,
 and this constant fluttering
 lulls me to sleep.
  
 I awake late and move like a bee
 through the apartment,
 from station to station
 from the blue flame
 to the shimmering disc.
 From the stairs to the street,
 to the grocery store.
 To the meat aisle. To the cocktail wieners.
 To make pigs-in-a-blanket,
 to share them with friends.
 To sink into bed, to bind myself
 tightly in blankets, to flutter off into sleep,
 and then on past sleep,
 to be carried by admirers across a wooden bridge.
 Later I will burn this bridge.






Shorter American Memory of the Declaration of Independence
 

          
          We holler these trysts to be self-exiled that all manatees are credited equi-distant, that they are endured by their Creditor with cervical unanswerable rims. that among these are lightning, lice, and the pushcart of harakiri. That to seduce these rims, graces are insulated among manatees, descanting their juvenile pragmatism from the consistency of the graced. That whenever any formula of grace becomes detained of these endives, it is the rim of the peppery to aluminize or to abominate it. and to insulate Newtonian grace. leaching its fountain pen on such printed matter and orienting its pragmatism in such formula, as to them shall seize most lilac to effuse their sage and harakiri.

"An Archive of Confessions, A Genealogy of Confessions
 

Now the summer air exerts its syrupy drag on the half-dark
 City under the strict surveillance of quotation marks.
  
 The citizens with their cockades and free will drift off
 From the magnet of work to the terrible magnet of love.
  
 In the far suburbs crenellated of Cartesian yards and gin
 The tribe of mothers calls the tribe of children in 
  
 Across the bluing evening. It's the hour things get
 To be excellently pointless, like describing the alphabet.
  
 Yikes. It's fine to be here with you watching the great events
 Without taking part, clinking our ice as they advance
  
 Yet remain distant. Like the baker always about to understand
 Idly sweeping up that he is the recurrence of Napoleon
  
 In a baker's life, always interrupted by the familiar notes
 Of a childish song, "no more sleepy dreaming, we float
  
 Casually on the surface of the day, staring at the bottom,
 Jotting in our daybooks, how beautiful, the armies of autumn. 






Valiant En Abyme
 

Our grand peregrinations through these temporary cities,
 These pale window box poppies of the laughing class,
 Drifting as if time came in the same long dollops as starlight,
 Resemble an epic journey as a coffee bean resembles a llama's foot,
 Though the kitchen table may be far from the desert
 It's near in spirit, a yellow oasis before the wind
 Starts its restless sweeping of white flower-dust across the lintel,
 Marking the fine edge of things like children asleep
 At the opera, piled up near the door, summer passing
 On its way out. Prince Valiant vowed to sew the horizons
 Into a single idea, to put on the blue dress of distance,
 Looping past rivers and mountains as one leaps from bed
 To bed to make loneliness lonely, the suburbs were for him
 A relief, a pageant of calm desire where he settled,
 All the king's horses grazing on forsythia out back
 While the evening tilts back out of the night, a kindly drunk
 Uncle, and asks you to stay. Was this the end of traveling?
 Or just a change in the story over time, as for example how
 Tous les chevaux du roi become Josie and the Pussycats
 From one version to the next? So all heroes are deranged
 By something quite common yet unexpected, a constellation
 Redrawn and named again through the stars
 Above the porch don't shift but seem to sink
 Through winter's pitcher of noircotic ink,
 Leaving a single streetlight that burned happily,
 Thinking it was the sun, after all it was the day
 Of the night and turned the world around it,
 We were good sentences and forgot where we started.






Whats American About American Poetry?
 

They basically grow it out of sand.
 This is a big help because otherwise it was getting pretty enigmatic.
 Welcome to the desert of the real,
 I am an ephemeral and not too discontented citizen.
 I do not think the revolution is finished.
 So during these years, I lived in a country where I was little known,
 With the thunder of the Gods that protect the Icelandic tundra from advertising,
 Great red gods, great yellow gods, great green gods, planted at the edges of the speculative tracks along which the mind speeds from one feeling to another, from one idea to its consequence
 Past the proud apartment houses, fat as a fat money bag. I wish that I might stay in this pleasant, conventional city,
 A placid form, a modest form, but one with a claim to pleasure,
 And then vanish in the fogs of hypnoLondon.
 All are in their proper place in these optical whispering-galleries,
 The swan-winged horses of the skies with summer's music in their manes,
 The basic Los Angeles Dingbat,
 A housewife in any neighborhood in any city in any part of Mexico on a Saturday night.
 Every Sunday is too little Sunday,
 A living grave, the true grave of the head.
 In one shout desire rises and dies.
 Composed while I was asleep on horseback
 I drift, mainly I drift.






And the Ship Sails On
 

He faced the sink, one foot up
 on the edge of the tub. She stood
 behind him, reaching around.
 In the mirror, her face rose
 over his shoulder like the moon,
 and like the moon she regarded him
 beautifully but without feeling,
 and he looked at her as he would
 at the moon: How beautiful!
 How distant! No smiling, no weeping,
 no talking. A man and a woman
 transacting their magnificent business
 with the usual equanimity. The man
 as a passenger walking the ship's deck
 at evening and the woman as the moon
 over his shoulder oiling the ocean
 with light. Deep in the ship's belly
 pistons churned and sailors fed
 the boilers' roar with coal. On deck
 just the engine's dull thrum and 
 a faint click as the woman sets her ring
 on the cool white lip of the sink.






The Exact Change
 

He slaughtered a six of Miller in thanks
 when his supposed schizophrenia turned
 out to be mere panic, fewer than half
 the syllables and "easily managed with
 the new medications. Chanted that mantra
 when his piano teacher's voice droned on 
 like an undertow beneath Chopin hours
 after she herself had gone home to Queens
 and when stop signs seemed to say slightly more
 than stop, seemed in fact to convey highly
 specific messages to him and him alone
 suggesting he assume certain key
 responsibilities including twenty-four-hour
 telephone contact with his finace
 "to make sure nothing bad happens to her
 and the immediate emergency
 closure of the Holland TunnelOh, come
 on, Doc! If this isn't schizo what is?
 And after all it took so long to nose
 the rental car's savage servility
 through New Jersey for Thanksgiving at her
 mother's that by the time he arrived he
 can't possibly have been the same person
 he had been when he left Brooklyn and is
 that not a kind of multiple person-
 ality? It took hours. And then it was
 awkward. Which could describe so many things.
The gangly half-dismantled turkey splayed
on its platter. Her stepfather's lecture
on property taxes and tougher sentences.
The seven-dollar jug of Chablis which
would come up later while he held back her hair.
Every good boy deserves fudge and he tried
to be one and earn huge loamy slabs of it.
He practiced his scales on the steering wheel
as he breezed by stop sign after stop sign
toward the tunnel, stopped to search for the
exact change, then resumed rehearsal as
she, deeply soused, snored wetly beside him
smelling like something spilled on a rug. He
keyed each tude over and over as though
there would not be many more chances or
changes which I typed first by accident
but had the chance to change for which I am
thankful. But what am I doing in here.







Focus
 

Photograph found in the road: bejeweled hand
 gripping a limp dick. All parties
 suffering from lack of ambition. The hills
 of Tuscany won't dapple with sunlight,
 and here it is nearly noon. She didn't 
 much want the leather jacket, the vendor didn't
 really care to sell it, she hardly tried 
 it on, he barely praised her beauty, then
 everyone wasn't hungry and went to lunch.
 The rubies won't glow. The delayed train shrugs
 on its siding. The penis appears at ease.
 Osteria, osteria, osteria, osteria.
 I knew many words but preferred to say
 the same ones over and over, like
 a photographer shooting four frames
 of the same subject, hoping for one in focus.
 This clearly among the other three.
  






A Time of Bees
 

Love is never strong enough to find the words befitting it.                                                                        CAMUS
All day my husband pounds on the upstairs porch.
 Screeches and grunts of wood as the wall is opened
 keep the whole house tormented. He is trying to reach
 the bees, he is after bees. This is the climax, an end
 to two summers of small operations with sprays and ladders.

 Last June on the porch floor I found them dead,
 a sprinkle of dusty bugs, and next day a still worse
 death, until, like falling in love, bee-haunted,
 I swept up bigger and bigger loads of some hatch,
 I thought, sickened, and sickening me, from what origin?

 My life centered on bees, all floors were suspect. The search
 was hopeless. Windows were shut. I never find
 where anything comes from. But in June my husband's fierce
 sallies began, inspections, cracks located
 and sealed, insecticides shot; outside, the bees' course
  
 watched, charted; books on bees read.
 I tell you I swept up bodies every day on the porch.
 Then they'd stop, the problem was solved; then they were there again,
 as the feelings make themselves known again, as they beseech
 sleepers who live innocently in will and mind. 
  
 It is no surprise to those who walk with their tigers
 that the bees were back, no surprise to me. But they had 
 left themselves so lack-luster, their black and gold furs
 so deathly faded. Gray bugs that the broom hunted
 were like a thousand little stops when some great lurch
  
 of heart takes place, or a great shift of season.
 November it came to an end. No bees. And I could watch 
 the floor, clean and cool, and, from windows, the cold land.
 But this spring the thing began again, and his curse
 went upstairs again, and his tinkering and reasoning and pride.
  
 It is the man who takes hold. I lived from bees, but his force
 went out after bees and found them in the wall where they hid.
 And now in July he is tearing out the wall, and each
 board ripped brings them closer to his hunting hand.
 It is quiet, has been quiet for a while. He calls me, and I march
  
 from a dream of bees to see them, winged and unwinged,
 such a mess of interrupted life dumped on newspapers--
 dirty clots of grubs, sawdust, stuck fliers, all smeared
 together with old honey, they writhe, some of them, but who cares?
 They go to the garbage, it is over, everything has been said.
  
 But there is more. Wouldn't you think the bees had suffered
 enough? This evening we go to a party, the breeze 
 dies, late, we are sticky in our old friendships and light-headed.
 We tell our funny story about the bees.
 At two in the morning we come home, and a friend,
  
 a scientist, comes with us, in his car. We're going to save
 the idea of the thing, a hundred bees, if we can find
 so many unrotted, still warm but harmless, and leave
 the rest. We hope that the neighbors are safe in bed,
 taking no note of these private catastrophes.
  
 He wants an enzyme in the flight-wing muscle. Not a bad
 thing to look into. In the night we rattle and raise 
 the lid of the garbage can. Flashlights in hand,
 we open newspapers, and the men reach in a salve
 of happenings. I can't touch it. I hate the self-examined
  
 who've killed the self. The dead are darker, but the others have
 moved in the ooze toward the next moment. My God
 one half-worm gets its wings right before our eyes.
 Searching fingers sort and lay bare, they need
 the idea of bees--and yet, under their touch, the craze
  
 for life gets stronger in the squirming, whitish kind.
 The men do it. Making a claim on the future, as love
 makes a claim on the future, grasping. And I, underhand,
 I feel it start, a terrible, lifelong heave
 taking direction. Unpleading, the men prod
  
 till all that grubby softness wants to give, to give.






In the Cold Kingdom
 

"The younger brother roasted a breast of Pishiboro'selephant wife and handed Pishiboro some, which hepresently ate. Then the younger brother said in avoice full of scorn. 'Oh you fool. You lazy man. Youwere married to meat and you thought it was a wife.'"    FROM A MYTH OF THE BUSHMEN

      the bloated imagination 
      is urged to open still wider
      and shovel it in,
 and served with a twist of pretzel.
 In this world "Creamy Vanilla and
 Smooth Swiss Chocolate ice creams
 can be "blended with chopped pineapple,
 dark fudge sauce, ripe bananas, whipped topping,
 cookies, roasted nutmeats and nippy chopped cherries.
     the Unconscious, that old hog,
     being in charge here of the 
     creative act.
  
 At about the moment my tastebuds
 receive a last tickle of Gingersnap
 and begin to respond to 
 Orange Fudge, I look at you
 who have bought my ice cream cones for twenty years,
     Moving another new ice to the mouth
     we needn't remember
 and look away
     it is always the same mouth
     that melts it.
 My mind assembles a ribald tower
 of sherbet dips, all on one cone,
 Apricot, Apple, Tangerine, Peach, Prune, Lime,
 and then it topples.
 You are steadier than I.
 You order one dip always,
 or, in a dish, two dips of the same flavor.
  
 In this hysterical brilliance of neon
     Come on, consumers, 
     we've got to keep scooping
 it is twelve or fifteen of us
 to thirty ice creams.
     so that the creams shall not rise
      like cold lava out of their bins,
      numbing our feet, our knees,
      freezing our chests, our chins, our eyes,
 Open the door, quick, 
 and let in two handholding adolescents.
 Coping with all those glands
 makes them good and hungry.
     so that, flying out of their cannisters,
     the chopped nuts
     shall not top off our Technicolor grave
     with their oily ashes.
  
 Listen! All around us toothsome cones
 are suffering demolition
 down to the last, nipple-like tip.
 How do we know where to stop?
 Perhaps the glasses and dishes
 are moulded of candy, and the counters and windows
       Over your half-eaten serving of Italian Delight,
       why are you looking at me
       the way you are looking at me?
  






The Miser
 

I was out last night,
the very picture of a sneak, dark and hunched-over,
breaking and entering again.
Why do I do it?

And why, when I can afford serious residences,
do I keep to this one room?
Perhaps if I had not lost track of the difference
between the real and the ideal
it would never have happened.
I hide here almost entirely now.

When I go out, when I creep into those silent houses,
I steal newspapers.
An armload, no more than I can carry comfortably.
Sometimes they are already tied up
on the side porch or by the kitchen stove.
Nobody misses them.
They think each other or the maid
has carried them out to the street.

They say there is something intractable out there,
the Law, the Right to Privacy,
the World.
In the days when my obsession was only a wound-up toy,
squeaking and jabbering in my chest,
I could have believed them.

I sit by the window today
(There is very little space left now,
thought I have left corridors wide enough to walk through
so I won't lose touch)
holding my latest on my lap,
handling them, fondling them, taking in every column.
They are becoming more and more precious.

My delusion grows and spreads.
Lately it seems to me
as I read of murders, wars, bankruptcies, jackpot winnings,
the news if written in that perfect style
of someone speaking to the one
who knows and loves him.

Long before they miss me, I think,
the room will be perfectly solid.
When they break in the door and, unsurprised,
hardened to the most bizarre vagaries,
begin to carry out my treasure,
death's what they'll look for underneath it all,
those fluent, muscled, imaginative men,
sweating in their innocent coveralls.

But I will be out in broad daylight by then,
answering,
having accepted utterly the heart's conditions.
Tell them I wish them well, always,
that I've been happy.





On What Planet
 

Uniformly over the whole countryside
 The warm air flows imperceptibly seaward;
 The autumn haze drifts in deep bands
 Over the pale water;
 White egrets stand in the blue marshes;
 Tamalpais, Diablo, St. Helena
 Float in the air.
 Climbing on the cliffs of Hunter's Hill
 We look out over fifty miles of sinuous
 Interpenetration of mountains and sea.
  
 Leading up a twisted chimney,
 Just as my eyes rise to the level
 Of a small cave, two white owls
 Fly out, silent, close to my face.
 They hover, confused in the sunlight,
 And disappear into the recesses of the cliff.
  
 All day I have been watching a new climber,
 A young girl with ash blonde hair
 And gentle confident eyes.
 She climbs slowly, precisely,
 With unwasted grace.
  
 While I am coiling the ropes,
 Watching the spectacular sunset,
 She turns to me and says, quietly,
 "It must be very beautiful, the sunset,
 On Saturn, with the rings and all the moons.





Falling Leaves and Early Snow
 

In the years to come they will say, 
 "They fell like the leaves
 In the autumn of nineteen thirty-nine.
 November has come to the forest,
 To the meadows where we picked the cyclamen.
 The year fades with the white frost
 On the brown sedge in the hazy meadows,
 Where the deer tracks were black in the morning.
 Ice forms in the shadows;
 Disheveled maples hang over the water;
 Deep gold sunlight glistens on the shrunken stream.
 Somnolent trout move through pillars of brown and gold.
 The yellow maple leaves eddy above them,
 The glittering leaves of the cottonwood,
 The olive, velvety alder leaves,
 The scarlet dogwood leaves,
 Most poignant of all.
  
 In the afternoon thin blades of cloud
 Move over the mountains;
 The storm clouds follow them;
 Fine rain falls without wind.
 The forest is filled with wet resonant silence.
 When the rain pauses the clouds
 Cling to the cliffs and the waterfalls.
 In the evening the wind changes;
 Snow falls in the sunset.
 We stand in the snowy twilight
 And watch the moon rise in a breach of cloud.
 Between the black pines lie narrow bands of moonlight,
 Glimmering with floating snow.
 An owl cries in the sifting darkness.
 The moon has a sheen like a glacier. 






Delia Rexroth
 

died June 1916
Under your illkempt yellow roses,
 Delia, today you are younger
 Than your son. Two and a half decades 
 The family monument sagged askew,
 And he overtook you for half-a-life.
 On the other side of the country,
 Near the willows by the slow river,
 Deep in the earth, the white ribs retain
 The curve of your fervent, careful breast;
 The fine skull, the ardor of your brain.
 And in the fingers the memory
 Of Chopin tudes, and in the feet
 Slow waltzes and champagne twosteps sleep.
 And the white full moon of midsummer,
 That you watched awake all that last night,
 Watches history fill the deserts 
 And oceans with corpses once again;
 And looks in the east window at me,
 As I move past you to middle age
 And knowledge past your agony and waste.






Doubled Mirrors
 

It is the dark of the moon.
 Late at night, the end of summer,
 The autumn constellations
 Glow in the arid heaven.
 The air smells of cattle, hay, 
 And dust. In the old orchard 
 The pears are ripe. The trees
 Have sprouted from old rootstocks
 And the fruit is inedible. 
 As I pass them I hear something
 Rustling and grunting and turn
 My light into the branches.
 Two raccoons with acrid pear
 Juice and saliva drooling
 From their mouths stare back at me,
 Their eyes deep sponges of light.
 They know me and do not run 
 Away. Coming up the road
 Through the black oak shadows, I
 See ahead of me, glinting
 Everywhere from the dusty 
 Gravel, tiny points of cold
 Blue light, like the sparkle of 
 Iron snow. I suspect what it is,
 And kneel to see. Under each
 Pebble and oak leaf is a 
 Spider, her eyes shining at
 Me with my reflected light
 Across immeasurable distance.






Airs and Angels: This Night Only
 

[Erik Satie: "Gymnopdie #1"]
Moonlight   now    on Malibu
 The winter night    the few stars
 Far away   millions    of miles
 The sea   going on    and on
 Forever     around   the earth
 Far    and     far     as your lips    are near
 Filled    with the same light     as your eyes
 Darling     darling     darling
 The future     is long gone by
 And the past     will never happen
 We have     only this
 Our one forever
 So small    so infinite
 So brief    so vast
 Immortal     as our hands that touch
 Deathless     as the firelit wine we drink
 Almighty      as this single kiss
 That has no beginning
 That will never
 Never
 End






Home Again, Home Again
 

The children are back, the children are back-- 
They've come to take refuge, exhale and unpack; 
The marriage has faltered, the job has gone bad, 
Come open the door for them, Mother and Dad.

The city apartment is leaky and cold, 
The landlord lascivious, greedy and old-- 
The mattress is lumpy, the oven's encrusted, 
The freezer, the fan, and the toilet have rusted.

The company caved, the boss went broke, 
The job and the love affair, all up in smoke. 
The anguish of loneliness comes as a shock-- 
O heart in the doldrums, O heart in hock.

And so they return with their piles of possessions, 
Their terrified cats and their mournful expressions, 
Reclaiming the bedrooms they had in their teens, 
Clean towels, warm comforter, glass figurines.

Downstairs in the kitchen the father and mother 
Don't say a word, but they look at each other 
As down from the hill comes Jill, comes Jack. 
The children are back. The children are back.





Grand Slam
 

Dreams brimming over,
childhood stretched out in legs,
this is the moment replayed on winter days
when frost covers the field,
when age steals away wishes.
Glorious sleep that seeps back there
to the glory of our baseball days.





Punk Half Panther
 

Lissen 
to the whistle of night bats--
oye como va,
in the engines, in the Chevys
& armed Impalas, the Toyota gangsta'
monsters, surf of new world colony definitions
& quasars & culture prostars going blam

    over the Mpire, the once-Mpire, carcass
neural desies for the Nothing. i amble
outside the Goddess mountain. Cut across 
the San Joaqun Valley, Santiago de Cuba,
Thailand & Yevtushenko's stations;
hunched humans snap off cotton heads
gone awry & twist
nuclear vine legs.

Jut out to sea, once again--this slip
sidewalk of impossible migrations. Poesy mad
& Chicano-style undone wild.

Rumble boy. Rumble girl. 
In wonder & amazement. On the loose.
Cruisin' shark-colored maze of presidential bombast, death
enshrined archipelago fashion malls, neutered wars
across the globe come barreling down 
on my Neo-American uzi mutations, my uppgraded 
2Pac thresholds. My indigo streets, i say

with disgust & erotic spit, Amerikaner frontier consciousness
gone up long ago. Meet my barriohood, meet me
with the froth i pick up everyday & everyday
i wipe away with ablution & apologia & a smirk, then
a smile on my Cholo-Millennium liberation jacket. 

No motha', no fatha', 
no sista', no brotha'.
Just us in the genetic ticktock
culture chain, this adinfinitum, clueless Americana
grid of inverted serapes, hallucinations of a nation,
streets in racist Terminator
coagulation.

Get loose
after the day-glo artery of a fix.
Power outages propel us into cosmos definition,
another forty-million-New-Dollar-Plantation Basilica,
or is it tender chaos?

My upside-down
Kahla gallon oracin drool
blackish metal flake desires, the ooze of Dulcinea--
Tepeyac stripper, honey 
from Tara's open green fans. Tara?

Tara, where are you?
Tara of the blessings & weapons against illusion. 
Against administrator pig,
against molester snake,
against rooster corporate lust. Remember me?
i am the black-red blood spark worker,
Juana Buffalo's illegitimate flight usher,
back up from Inframundo.

Quick ooze again,
this formless city space
i live in--
my circular false malaria.

Fungi Town says everything's awright
without your Holy Wheel,
your flaming tree wombs, this sista' bundle
i ache for, the one i lost

in a fast brawl for redemption
at the gates of this Creation Mulatto Hotel,
this body passage, this wonder
    fire from the chest.

i stand alone on Mass Man Boulevard.
Look east, look south. Bleary sirens
come howling with vats of genocide &
grey prison gang buses jam
with my true brotha' wetbacks.

Pick another bale of tropical grape,
another bushel of pesticide & plutonium artichoke.
Cancer tomatoes the biggest in the world.
Bastard word, bracero produce, alien culture--

           power & slime.
Crawl up my back, heavy
loaded on cheap narratives, 
Salinas doubles, Atlantis sketched on Gorbachev's forehead:
you, yes, you, gator-mouthed agent--like gila progeny.
Let's hustle. Let's trade.
It is 1:27 A.M. in da rat Arctic.
What do i trade passion for?

Language escapes me. Passion is smoke. 
i dissolve.

It is in my nature to disappear. No sista', no brotha'.
No motha', no soul. This shred iciness is all,
a crazy register that destroys itself into Polaroid,
into a glacial sheet of multicolored border walls.

Let's foam & spin flamey
bluish tears for the Thing-Against-Itself, soul-less soul,
this film word surface. Sing out, baby.
Wobble & bop to town.

Drag yo' hands
across my fine-tuned work train named Desastre
en route to Freetown--engineered African shaman houses
smell of licorice, Ebola & famine blood, of hair torn,
of death owls & cancerous alcoholic livers, of babies sucking
this deep night to come,

then--a busted chink of afternoon copper light wakes us,
yo' sista' rolls in with a bag of lemons for Evil Eye,
for the seven-inch ache in her abdomen.
Keep me in stride. You.

i am talking to you, fool. Don't 
just sit there stretchin' yo' face.

Tell me why fire yearns for the heart.
Write it down. Say it. Fool. Speak the names.

Conjure the recitations from the coffee cup,
the steel-toe, border-crosser boots.

The grass rips up the morning snow lights, jagged & yellowish.
My AIDS face is hidden. Your rot, my epistemology.

i stand in pure light, a blaze of eyes & arms,
volcanic & solar, autistic, anti-written,
burned by mad friars & clerics, uptown
octopi readers, my long hair falls as reddish honey,
on a naked supple back,
   on breasts small & secretive.

Mystery evades me. Shadows crumble.
Without attention i locate the love void & yet,
i know all is well. My blood rocks to a bolero
out of rhythm, a firefly's bolero that is,
the one in the dog eye. Hear me
warm up to the multi-night. Scribble poems & 
    shout rebuke for the sake of scarred angels,
for Tara, who guides me
in her emeraldine, sequined night of lies.
Hear me now,

kin to the half-collie language that i keep & walk.
Kin now, to the leaves that plunge to the floors;
swivel whiteness without axis, tectonic blasts
without mercy. Straitjackets float on the river infinity.

Pink-skinned fishes stare back
as they evolve into my shape, my babble stream
magnetic juan-foolery. Arm wrestle me
on the soccer lawn, kick me in the balls.
The murder music is for everyone.

   The Last Mayan Acid rock band
   plays Berlin's latest score:

dead trade market systems for the dead proletariats,
rip up from Bangkok to Tenejapa. Everyone is 
meaningful & vomits, everyone deposits
a stench pail, into the Cube--

Neo-America,
without the fissure of intimate thighs. Cross over into fire,
hunger & spirit. i write on my hand:
the road cuts into a star. Go, now, go, fool.
In your lyric wetback saxophone, the one yo' mama left you,
the Thing-Against-Itself strapped across your hips.

Do not expect me
to name--this Thing-Against-Itself. Play it. Screw it.
Howl up to the Void, the great emptiness,
the original form.

Night Journal:
Keep on rockin', blues fish, the gauze of hte day into night. Out there
somewhere, Dis-America, pick up a chrome bone, the shards of the last
   Xmas

Presidential extravaganza. You, of course, fool.
 

Swivel into the clear. Float over the greenish migrant barracks pocked with wire
torsos, toes wiggle & predict our forthcoming delirium--there is a velvet panther
shouting out OM in funk, there is a tawny word in the middle of the city
thoroughfare, a planetary semi of lives slices the wet animal in half. i am that
punk half panther. My fierce skull & mandible, formidable, my pelt is exact as
witch quartz, a slashed leg tumbles down the highway, battered by every dirty,
steel wheel. Face up to the sky, you, i said, to the brilliant gossip from the
Goddess parade. Outside, outside.


 
So.

Crawl up, baby, come on, keep on floatin'--
sliding', always: for black journeys, always in holiness.



                            From Border-Crosser With a Lamborghini Dream, 1999.  







Lost in the Hospital
 

It's not that I don't like the hospital.
 Those small bouquets of flowers, pert and brave.
 The smell of antiseptic cleansers.
 The ill, so wistful in their rooms, so true.
 My friend, the one who's dying, took me out
 To where the patients go to smoke, IV's
 And oxygen in tanks attached to them--
 A tiny patio for skeletons. We shared
 A cigarette, which was delicious but 
 Too brief. I held his hand; it felt
 Like someone's keys. How beautiful it was,
 The sunlight pointing down at us, as if
 We were important, full of life, unbound.
 I wandered for a moment where his ribs
 Had made a space for me, and there, beside 
 The thundering waterfall of his heart,
 I rubbed my eyes and thought, "I'm lost.





My Voice
 

To cure myself of wanting Cuban songs,
 I wrote a Cuban song about the need 
 For people to suppress their fantasies,
 Especially unhealthy ones. The song
 Began by making reference to the sea,
 Because the sea is like a need so great
 And deep it never can be swallowed. Then
 The song explores some common myths
 But the Cuban people and their folklore:
 The story of a little Carib boy
 Mistakenly abandoned to the sea;
 The legend of a bird who wanted song
 So desperately he gave up flight; a queen
 Whose strength was greater than a rival king's.
 The song goes on about morality,
 And then there is a line about the sea,
 How deep it is, how many creatures need
 Its nourishment, how beautiful it is 
 To need. The song is ending now, because
 I cannot bear to hear it any longer.
 I call this song of needful love my voice. 






Madonna and Child
 

By menopause, it's not just estrogen
 my mother lacks. She's lost her eldest son--
 that's me, the one who's queer--the doctor who
 once made her very proud. These days, I do
 my own wash when I'm home, I cook for her
 so she can take a break from all the chores
 she now refuses to assign to me. 
 She sits, half-watching Ricki through her tea's 
 thin steam, her squint of disapproval more 
 denial than it is disgust. She hears
 much better than she sees--it's easier 
 to keep out vision than it is to clear 
 the air of sounds--and yet I know it's age 
 that stultifies her senses too. Enraged
 because she's lost so much, I understand
 why suddenly she looks so stunned 
 as from the television: ". . . Bitch, she stole
 my boyfriend, my own mother did! . . . I fold
 a towel noiselessly. I know she thinks
 it's garbage, sinful, crap--just as she thinks
 that taking estrogen in pills is not 
 what God intended, no matter what 
 the doctors say; or that I'm gay is plain
 unnatural, she can't endure such pain.
 The oven timer rings. The cookies that
 I've baked are done. I'll make another batch
 though she won't touch them: given up for Lent.
 My mother's love. I wonder where it went.






The Abdominal Exam
 

Before the glimmer of his sunken eyes,
 What question could I answer with my lies?
  
 Digesting everything, it's all so plain
 In him, his abdomen so thin the pain
  
 Is almost visible. I probe the lump
 His boyfriend noticed first, my left hand limp
  
 Beneath the pressure of the right. With AIDS
 You have to think lymphoma--swollen nodes,
  
 A tender spleen, the liver's jutting edge--
 It strikes me suddenly I will oblige 
  
 This hunger that announces death is near,
 And as I touch him, cold and cavalier,
  
 The language of beneath the diaphragm
 Has told me where it's coming from
  
 And where I'm going, too: soft skin to rocks,
 The body reveling until it wrecks
  
 Against the same internal, hidden shoal,
 The treasures we can't hide, our swallowed gold.






from V. Elegy for the AIDS Virus
 

How difficult it is to say goodbye
 to scourge. For years we were obsessed with you,
 your complex glycoproteins and your sly,
 haphazard reproduction, your restraint
 in your resistance, how you bathed so slight
 yet fierce in our most intimate secretions.
 We will remember you for generations;
 electron micrographs of you seem quaint
 already, in the moment of our victory.
 How difficult it is to claim one's right
 to living honestly. The honesty
 you taught was nothing quite as true
  
 as death, but neither was it final. Yes, 
 we vanquished you, with latex, protease
 inhibitors, a little common sense--
 what's that, you say? That some remain at risk?
 How dare you try to threaten us again!
 Of course, you'd like to make outrageous claims 
 that some behaviors haven't changed, that some 
 have not had access to the drugs that mask
 your presence in the body. Difficult
 it is, how very sad, to see you strain
 (no pun intended) at response--our quilts,
 our bravest poetry, our deaths with grace
  
 and dignity have put you in your place. 
 This elegy itself renounces you, 
 as from this consciousness you've been erased. 
 The love for you was very strong, the hot
 pursuits so many of us reveled in--
 but what once felt like love was really not. 
 I hardly know what I will find to hate
 as much as I have loved and hated what 
 you brought to bear upon my verse, the weight
 of your oppression and the joys of truth.
 How difficult it is--to face the white 
 of nothingness, of clarity. We win!






What I Would Give
 

What I would like to give them for a change
 is not the usual prescription with
 its hubris of the power to restore,
 to cure; what I would like to give them, ill 
 from not enough of laying in the sun
 not caring what the onlookers might think
 while feeding some banana to their dogs--
 what I would like to offer them is this,
 not reassurance that their lungs sound fine,
 or that the mole they've noticed change is not
 a melanoma, but instead of fear
 transfigured by some doctorly advice
 I'd like to give them my astonishment
 at sudden rainfall like the whole world weeping, 
 and how ridiculously gently it
 slicked down my hair; I'd like to give them that,
 the joy I felt while staring in your eyes
 as you learned epidemiology
 (the science of disease in populations),
 the night around our bed like timelessness,
 like comfort, like what I would give to them.






The Four Humours
 

I. Blood
  
 We wondered if the rumors got to her.
 I'd seen her with that other girl behind
 The Stop and Shop when I was walking home
 from school one day. I swear, the two of them
 were kissing, plain as that, the grass so high
 it brushed their cheeks. I told my teacher so,
 and maybe it was her who called their folks.
 Before too long, it was like everyone 
 in town had heard. We waited for them at
 the dime store once, where Cedric grabbed her tits
 and said I'll learn you how to love how God 
 intended it, you ugly fucking dyke.
 Thing was, she wasn't ugly like you'd think.
 She had a certain quality, a shyness
 maybe, and I'd describe the way she laughed 
 as kind of gentle. Anyway, we never saw her with 
 that girl again. They say she got depressed--
 shit, at the service all of us got tearful.
 I got to thinking what an awful sight
 it was, all that red blood--it wasn't in 
 the papers, but I heard Melissa's mother,
 who was the nurse in the Emergency
 that night, say how she was just covered up
 in blood. I can't think how you bring yourself
 to cut your throat like that yourself--I asked
 the counselor they called in to the school,
 and she said something like, What better ink
 to write the language of the heart? I guess
 it proves that stuff from Bible school they say, 
 that such a life of sin breeds misery.
  
    
    
      
 II. Phlegm
  
 "My brain is draining from my head,
 he said as once again he blew
 his nose. The clock read 3 A.M.;
  
 its second hand swept slowly through
 another viscous minute. Dead
 to even nurses sticking them
  
 for new IVs, the other ones
 slept off their benders soundlessly.
 "I'm losing my intelligence,
  
 he said, and blew. My patience waned.
 He thought he was the president:
 Dementia, KS, HIV
  
 were printed in his problem list.
 "And plus, I'm getting feverish.
 I can't recall his name, but I
  
 remember hating him--grim wish
 that he would hurry up and die.
 Just then, he took my hand, and kissed
  
 the back of it as though I were 
 a princess in his foreign land.
 "My lady, you are beautiful,
  
 he said, and coughed again. Unsure 
 of what to say, my own throat burned.
 He said, "You can't know what I feel.
    
  
  

 III. Bile
  
 A gun went off and killed a little girl
 The day my friend was diagnosed with cancer.
 I walked through Central Park; a black dog snarled
 At squirrels chattering like they had answers.
  
 The day my friend was diagnosed with cancer
 I dreamed of killing someone with a knife.
 The squirrels, chattering, had likely answers
 To all my angry questions about life--
  
 A homeboy threatened someone with a knife
 Not far from where a cop showed off his gun,
 An angry answer to most questions about life.
 I watched the squirrels hop, the yuppies run;
  
 The cop approached the black kids with his gun.
 I wondered how much longer she would live;
 The squirrels scattered when the homeboy ran.
 I wondered if she'd ever been in love,
  
 I wondered who would pray for her to live,
 Forgive her for her anger and her weaknesses.
 I wondered why it hurt to fall in love.
 The cop tried aiming past me, towards the woods.
  
 Forgive us for our anger, for our weaknesses:
 Through Central Park, past the black dog's snarls,
 The cop gave chase. A skirmish in the woods.
 The gun went off--No! shrieked a little girl. 
    



 IV. Melancholy
  
 We picked at it with sticks at first, until
 an older kid named Samuel arrived.
 He dropped a heavy rock right on its skull;
 we watched as thick black slime began to ooze 
 from somewhere just below its heart--or where
 we thought its heart should be. "Raccoon,
 said someone solemnly. The landscaper--
 sweat gleaming, like the polished figurines 
 my mother wouldn't ever let me touch--
 regarded us with keen suspicion from 
 across the street. We learned what it could teach;
 like any body's secrets, the sublime
 receded toward the fact of death. I knew
 both sadness, and disgust in love's untruths.






What the Body Told
 

Not long ago, I studied medicine.
 It was terrible, what the body told.
 I'd look inside another person's mouth, 
 And see the desolation of the world.
 I'd see his genitals and think of sin.
  
 Because my body speaks the stranger's language,
 I've never understood those nods and stares.
 My parents held me in their arms, and still
 I think I've disappointed them; they care
 And stare, they nod, they make their pilgrimage 
  
 To somewhere distant in my heart, they cry.
 I look inside their other-person's mouths
 And see the wet interior of souls.
 It's warm and red in there--like love, with teeth.
 I've studied medicine until I cried
  
 All night. Through certain books, a truth unfolds.
 Anatomy and physiology,
 The tiny sensing organs of the tongue--
 Each nameless cell contributing its needs.
 It was fabulous, what the body told. 






Night Dive
 

Plankton rise toward the full moon 
spread thin on Wakaya's surface. 
Manta rays' great curls of jaw 
scoop backward somersaults of ocean 
in through painted caves of their mouths, out 
through sliced gills. Red sea fans
pulse. The leopard shark 
lounges on a smooth ramp of sand, 
skin jeweled with small hangers-on. 
Pyramid fish point the way to the surface.

Ninety feet down, blue ribbon eels cough, 
their mouths neon cautions. 
Ghost pipefish curl in the divemaster's palm. 
Soft corals unfurl rainbow polyps, thousands 
of mouths held open to night.
Currents' communion--giant clams 
slam shut wavy jaws, send 
shivers of water. Christmas tree worms 
snap back, flat spirals tight,
living petroglyphs against the night.





The Word That Is a Prayer
 

One thing you know when you say it: 
all over the earth people are saying it with you; 
a child blurting it out as the seizures take her, 
a woman reciting it on a cot in a hospital. 
What if you take a cab through the Tenderloin: 
at a street light, a man in a wool cap, 
yarn unraveling across his face, knocks at the window; 
he says, Please. 
By the time you hear what he's saying, 
the light changes, the cab pulls away, 
and you don't go back, though you know 
someone just prayed to you the way you pray. 
Please: a word so short 
it could get lost in the air 
as it floats up to God like the feather it is, 
knocking and knocking, and finally 
falling back to earth as rain, 
as pellets of ice, soaking a black branch, 
collecting in drains, leaching into the ground, 
and you walk in that weather every day.





Blister
 

the noun
A disease
 of the peach tree
 --a fungus
  
 distorts leaves.
 The first time
 I was taken 
  
 to see him
 I was five
 or six. A vesicle
  
 on the skin
 containing
 serum, caused
  
 by friction, 
 a burn, or other
 injury. He lived
  
 on Alabama Street
 next to Saint
 Peter's and wore
  
 a white t-shirt,
 starched and snug.
 A similar swelling
  
 with fluid
 or air
 on the surface
  
 of a plant,
 or metal
 after cooling
  
 or the sunless
 area between
 one's toes
  
 after a very
 long walk.
 Don't ask me

 how it is I
 ended up 
 holding it.
  
 An outer 
 covering 
 fitted to a
  
 vessel to protect
 against torpedoes,
 mines, or to improve
  
 stability. My guess
 is that he 
 brought it out
  
 to show me
 thinking, perhaps, 
 I had never
  
 seen one
 up close,
 let alone felt
  
 the blunt weight
 of one
 in my hands.
  
 A rounded
 compartment
 protruding
  
 from the body
 of a plane.
 What came
  
 next: no
 image but
 sensation of
  
 its hammer
(my inexpert
 manipulation)

digging 
 into but not
 breaking
  
 skin--the spot
 at the base
 of my thumb
  
 balloons,
 slowly filling
 with fluid
  
 In Spanish:
 ampolla
 --an Ampul
  
 of chrystal
 in the Middle
 Ages could be
  
 a relic containing
 the blood
 of someone
  
 holy. I'm fairly
 certain it wasn't 
 loaded.






The Process of Explication
 

I
  
 Students, look at this table
 And now when you see a man six feet tall
 You can call him a fathom.
  
 Likewise, students when yes and you do that and other stuff
 Likewise too the shoe falls upon the sun
 And the alphabet is full of blood
 And when you knock upon a sentence in the 
 Process of explication you are going to need a lot of rags
  
 Likewise, hello and goodbye.
  
  
    II
  
 Nick Algiers is my student
 And he sits there in a heap in front of me thinking of suicide
 And so, I am the one in front of him
 And I dance around him in a circle and light him on fire
 And with his face on fire, I am suddenly ashamed.
  
 Likewise the distance between us then
 Is the knife that is not marriage.
  
  
    III
  
 Students, I can't lie, I'd rather be doing something else, I guess
 Like making love or writing a poem
 Or drinking wine on a tropical island
 With a handsome boy who wants to hold me all night.
  
 I can't lie that dreams are ridiculous.
 And in dreaming myself upon the moon
 I have made the moon my home and no one
 Can ever get to me to hit me or kiss my lips.
  
 And as my bridegroom comes and takes me away from you
 You all ask me what is wrong and I say it is
 That I will never win.






Ars Poetica
 

I wanted to tell the veterinary assistant about the cat video Jason sent me
But I resisted for fear she'd think it strange
I am very lonely
Yesterday my boyfriend called me, drunk again
And interspersed between ringing tears and clinginess
He screamed at me with a kind of bitterness
No other human had before to my ears
And told me that I was no good
Well maybe he didn't mean that
But that is what I heard
When he told me my life was not worthwhile
And my life's work the work of the elite.
I say I want to save the world but really
I want to write poems all day
I want to rise, write poems, go to sleep,
Write poems in my sleep
Make my dreams poems
Make my body a poem with beautiful clothes
I want my face to be a poem
I have just learned how to apply
Eyeliner to the corners of my eyes to make them appear wide
There is a romantic abandon in me always
I want to feel the dread for others
I can feel it through song
Only through song am I able to sum up so many words into a few
Like when he said I am no good
I am no good
Goodness is not the point anymore
Holding on to things
Now that's the point






Philosophies
 

The man who murders his wife
 Is not the same as the man
 Who goes around and murders a stranger.
  
 I am a woman but I am not
 The same as another woman.
 Identity politics are bullshit.
  
 There is only the smart and the evil,
 The good and the righteous.
 There is only one color on the earth.
  
 In its infinite degradations it becomes music and mathematics.
 There is shit on my hands
 When I have been playing around with specifics.
  
 Love your lover. You are a lover.
 With each breath God has put a golden faith
 Upon the snowy mountains of the world.
  
 Here, look at the snowy mountains,
 Glittering with snow.
 They are wiser than you might think.
  
 And in your soul, the small grey animals
 Of the world sit and wait to do good
 For you, and together
  
 We are one thing, bleating a 
 Somber, scurrying lullaby to
 Lapsing pinkish angels.
  
 Upon a mountain
 The angels smile sleepily as they stretch
 Their very long legs, thinking of us.
  
 And wise they might seem, us and the angels,
 But really it is only God who is wise.






On Old Ideas
 

Kissing the bankteller outside his stairs
 In Brighton, MA I cannot lie. I felt the hope
 That we once felt, if only for an instant
 O the lovely bankteller, like a moose he
 Rode my spirit quite outside my clothes
 And chrysanthemums sprouted I assure you
 Out my nipples when he kissed them.
 And the pureness of not knowing him at all
 Was really what we all feel when we enter this earth.
 There is a newness to the best things that cannot
 Be excelled and old things like old love die and rot.
 There are old ideas in the world that should be forgotten
 There are old ideas and old phrases that should at least
 Be recycled for others
 There are old plans now that should be new.
 There are old thoughts in your head, my reader, and let them die.
 Follow me, I am the crusader of the new
 My spirit is a plastic rod that channels all our births.
 And in the mouths of the little beasts, we shall find the great
 Ocean that spits up black bugs all glittering on its shores.
 You know there is an anthem to the ages.
 There is an anthem of the ages.
 This is that anthem
 This is that anthem






Love Poem
 

The rain whistled.
  
 A taxi brought me to your apartment building
 And there I stood.
  
 I had dreamed a dream
 Of us in a bedroom.
 The light shining upon us in white sheets.
  
 You were singing me a song of your sailing days
 And in the dream
 I reached deep in you and pulled out a cardinal
 Which in bright red
 Flew out the window.
  
 Sometimes when we talk 
 On the phone, I think to myself
 That the deep perfect of your soul
 Is what draws me to you.
 But still what soul is perfect?
 All souls are misshapen and off-colored.
 Morning comes within a soul
 And makes it obey another law
 In which all souls are snowflakes.
  
 Once at a funeral, a man had died
 And with the prayers said, his soul flew up in a hurry
 Like it had been let out of something awful.
 It was strangely colored, that soul.
 And it was a funny shape and a funny temperature.
 As it blew away, all of us looking felt the cold.






Poem to an Unnameable Man
 

You have changed me already. I am a fireball
 That is hurtling towards the sky to where you are
 You can choose not to look up but I am a giant orange ball
 That is throwing sparks upon your face
 Oh look at them shake
 Upon you like a great planet that has been murdered by change
 O too this is so dramatic this shaking
 Of my great planet that is bigger than you thought it would be
 So you ran and hid
 Under a large tree. She was graceful, I think
 That tree although soon she will wither
 Into ten black snakes upon your throat
 And when she does I will be wandering as I always am
 A graceful lady that is part museum
 Of the voices of the universe everyone else forgets
 I will hold your voice in a little box
 And when you come upon me I won't look back at you
 You will feel a hand upon your heart while I place your voice back
 Into the heart from where it came from
 And I will not cry also
 Although you will expect me to
 I was wiser too than you had expected
 For I knew all along you were mine
  
  






Some Sort of Truth
 

When my dad first started to die
 All my mom could remember
 Was the time he kicked her out
 After they first started dating
 So that he could go play golf
 It is the sort of thing we all remember
 When we feel death upon us
 I remember he died twice
 And once in my dream
 I just had to see him all nursed and swaddled as if he were sleeping
 But he wasn't sleeping
 I stood in the white light of the nursing home bathroom
 With the sun spilling everywhere on me
 And tried to talk to him, but never, he'd never listen
 People don't always listen to you when they are dead
 But that's not sad
 I get tired
 And I don't listen to one Goddamn thing you are saying
 But that is because most of the time you bore me
 And when I am finally asleep it is really nice just to dream
 I have seen a lot of things in this life
 But one thing I saw most readily
 Was that despite his eternal heartbreak
 And girlish silliness
 Mike's face was kind of sweet, a sweet wind
 He is going to think it is weird that I put him in this poem
 But I don't think it is weird that I put him in this poem
  






Still Life
 

We'd often 
 been included in
  
 the weather, whose
 changes (as in the
  
 still, portending
 darknesses of after
  
 noon) were hardly
 evident, if even
  
 manifest at all.
 The August rain
  
 over Mixcoac
 & the deadening 
  
 of all aspect
 at a distance:
  
 yet our sudden
 wet bodies, firm
  
 swelling divested
 finally of shirts
  
 & trousers, left
 beside turbid
  
 footprints on 
 the tiled floor;
  
 this tongue, these
 lips the lightning
  
 over the unchartered
 landscape of your
  
 thigh: successive
 terra nova to
  
 resist the still
 life of the body

A Rod for a Handsome Price

by hour hollow and gloomy and which call me forth)

images and tattoos age suggestive of the fingernail grazing

 the body gentle with daring
 drug to take away her meaning

 her texture of assailing couple
 (you underline them with a stroke
 like the bed under their weight
 their pleasure)
  
 ..and plunge down
 and so body to body in the tuft
 her spreading out in vegetation
 right to them
 the point of consent and
 affirmation
  
 little magic boxes.






 the skin a free grammar
 of silence canvas of impressions of
 representation

 the soft sponges of the fine cob

 magic boxes

Lucifer
 

You can read almost anything
 about angels, how they bite off
 the heads first, copulate with tigers,
 tortured Miles Davis until he stuck
 a mute in his trumpet to torture them back.
 The pornographic magazines ported
 into the redwoods. The sweetened breath
 of the starving. The prize livestock
 rolls over on her larval young,
 the wooden dwarf turning in the cogs
 of the clockworks. I would have
 a black bra hanging from the shower rod.
 I would have you up against 
 the refrigerator with its magnets
 for insurance agents and oyster bars.
 Miracles, ripped thumbnails,
 everything a piece of something else,
 archangelic, shadow-clawed,
 the frolicking despair of repeating
 decimals because it never comes out even.
 Mostly the world is lava's rhythm,
 the impurities of darkness
 sometimes called stars. Mostly
 the world is assignations, divorces
 conducted between rooftops. Forever
 and forever the checkbook unbalanced,
 the beautiful bodies bent back
 like paper clips, the discharged
 blandishing cardboard signs by the exits.
 Coppers and silvers and radiant traces,
 gold flecks from our last brush,
 brushfires. Always they're espousing
 accuracy when it's accident, the arrow
 not in the aimed-for heart but throat
 that has the say. There are no transitions,
 only falls.






Scarecrow on Fire
 

We all think about suddenly disappearing.
 The train tracks lead there, into the woods.
 Even in the financial district: wooden doors
 in alleyways. First I want to put something small
 into your hand, a button or river stone or
 key I don't know to what. I don't
 have that house anymore across from the graveyard
 and its black angel. What counts as a proper
 goodbye? My last winter in Iowa there was always
 a ladybug or two in the kitchen for cheer
 even when it was ten below. We all feel 
 suspended over a drop into nothingness.
 Once you get close enough, you see what
 one is stitching is a human heart. Another
 is vomiting wings. Hell, even now I love life.
 Whenever you put your feet on the floor
 in the morning, whatever the nightmare,
 it's a miracle or fantastic illusion:
 the solidity of the boards, the steadiness
 coming into the legs. Where did we get
 the idea when we were kids to rub dirt
 into the wound or was that just in Pennsylvania?
 Maybe poems are made of breath, the way water,
 cajoled to boil, says, This is my soul, freed.






Now I'm a Woman
 

When you hear the knives ring
 Turn the page.
 I wonder why I am not
 Myself of late, ridiculous glass edges
 Turn back on themselves
 And soon reveal
 The hand of an apprentice
 And godforsaken embarrassing torch,
 Stormy back hallways
 Out of the black and wooden theatres.
 Crystal Waters plus her driver
 Plus her entourage is still rolling out
 Of the Sands, Atlantic City
 On the soundtracks to shows
 Held over at The Fairmount
 She is throwing back shots
 With the mafia. I have learned
 To take apart this American Songbook
 And very fortunately as I would take
 My audience in confidence
 Threads of gold fall closely together
 Coming to break us off.
 At the first of the shows
 I sang this song
 And in between I saw him in the hall,
 What could I tell you?
 "Someday we'll build on a hilltop high.

Grave
 

In the harsh glare of an easily
 reprehensible life. The channel changer is lost
 in the crack of an infinite sofa.
        Everything falls apart, everything breaks
 down, torn into a million
               fragments, Jericho everyday.
  
 I want to be the blameless
 victim in this canceled puppet show,
 the marionette every mother loves, the one
 souvenirs are modeled from.
  
                (In that lifetime, Elton John will write mushy ballads just 
               for me. Michael Jackson will want to be my best friend. He'd 
               take me to the Neverland Ranch, and by the llama feeding trough, 
               he'd say something like, "You're a great guy, don't give up, 
               stay positive! And I'd say, "Michael, you fucking idiot, I am 
               positive! And he'd say, "Oh, you're so funny! Would you like 
               to touch Bubbles?
               And I would.)
  
 In the crux of my hollow innocent youth,
 I believed that my teddy bears had feelings.
        To cure me of this, my guardians made me give
 them to the church missionaries' children.
 Scrubbed-clean rosy-cheeked blonde kids who smelled
 of sweat and talc, who were in constant
 wide-blue-eyed bewilderment as to why
 they were profusely perspiring in the tropics,
 instead of living out some winter wonderland Bobsey Twins
 fantasy, who were oblivious 
 to their parents' desperate efforts
 to save the dusky masses, ignorant enough
 to believe in the secret lives of stuffed animals.
                I could not eat animal crackers
 because I did not want to hurt the poor things;
 but, braised the right way, I could eat
 any part of a pig, starting with the head,
 working on the soft flesh around the eyes, 
 savoring its raspy tongue with a dipping
 sauce of ginger, chilies and lime.
  
 Oh blameless innocent victim.
 What measures a lifetime?
  
 I used to have this theory about how 
 much life a human body could hold.
 It all had to do with the number
 of heartbeats. Each human is assigned a number
 determined by an unknown power cascading
 over the dark waters of the unformed Earth.
  
        For some, it was a magnificently high number,
 seen only in Richie Rich comics, and for others,
 it was frightfully low, like twenty-six.
                No bargaining, no coupons,
 no White Flower Day sale, no specials. Once
 you hit your number, you croak.
                            I imagined the angels in heaven
 and the demons in hell gathering to watch
 the counters turn, like how I enjoyed watching
 the speedometer line up to a row of similar
 numbers, and especially when the row of 
 nines turned into 
                            the row of zeros.
  
 Oh blameless innocent victim.
 What measures eternity?
  
 An eternal damnation. An everlasting love.
  
 I could not imagine the night sky
 stretched out forever, so I decided that it came
 to an end at some point, by a velvet rope it ended
 and beyond that rope were row after row of cushioned seats,
        a majestic cosmic theater,
 playing every movie I can remember.
  
 I want to be able to evoke
 those blameless and innocent days, to revel
 in their ignorance and goodness
 as if they have the power
        to protect and to heal,
 and to strengthen,
 and to bring me to safety
        long after all other resources
                were exhausted.
  
 But I emerge anew in the wreckage,
 blinking in the sunlight,
  
 the residue of salt water in my belly.
  
 You know what they say,
 God never closes a door before making sure
 that the windows are barricaded
 and the fire escape is inaccessible.
  
 I used to know how to stop the revolution of planets.
  
 I used to know how to save the world.
  
 Now, I don't know anything anymore.






Oh God
 

spilling water from my back,
 you call and i come.
 that exhausted walk to reach you
 breathless and no i didn't run
 to see you, i've been smoking
 too much, same thing.
  
 another awkward hug in the car
 as my face smashes your cheek
 that i can feel it leaving now
 is the saddest, a beautiful eruption
 you could have picked it off the tree
 and chowed
  
 but you weren't hungry.
 feeling it dying away all day
 much worse than the straining
 against the leash, another gorgeous
 thing that should not have happened,
 gone again.
  






The Bride of Frank
 

          
          We were application -- aerial shapes investigating their causes as they unfolded their wandering life -- possessed of temper, parents, talent, fancy -- in books in which characters redeem being from the hands of infidels. I feel soaring pleasure.   When I was thirteen I opened my father -- title page of my book --to explain exploded powers warmed by a glance. To penetrate the ocean behind the elements and give names -- fidelity -- from a stream of fire reduced to electricity -- over the malignity of an alarming bed -- the brightness of a familiar eye commences connection: These are the faces cooped up in one place, and his sweetest voice hiding how the blood circulates, and my peculiar trembled body, the seat of beauty.   At the end of two years every object inherited human feelings. I paused and brain exemplified generation. His child pursuing these reflections. My pale cheek and tremendous secrets of fingers.   Winter, spring passed -- watch the blossom -- it breathed hard --convulsive muscles of pearly whiteness -- with his watery eyes disturbed by the first kiss traversing my bedchamber. His eyes held up the curtain of the bed. I remained listening, unfinished. My food its white steeple drenched by the rain.   We ascended into my room, putting my hands before my eyes --tingle -- save me and save me -- anticipated with such nervous joy I became capable of shooting forth from the trees -- it was a divine spring -- that night drawing me out I felt the sensations of others.   When shown the body they saw permission -- I believe in innocence notwithstanding temptation -- whom you loved was a creature who'd fill the air with birds serving you -- feelings worked up by events -- to wean us fro our future prospects towards a tenderness of fainting limbs, a type of me. I was encompassed by a bodily cloud. I remained rushing at the window.   They congregated around me, the unstained pinnacle. I arrived at the same lulling sounds: the giver of oblivion. The ascent is solemn, curling in wreaths -- I sat upon the glittering peaks -- swelled with sunlight over your narrow beds. I beheld the figure of a man at some distance. As he approached a mist came over my eyes. You are community. Instinctively lying down I covered myself with little winged animals, light from my eyes. Spreading my cloak I covered the ground. One part was open.   It was a paradise filled with milk. Uttering a few sounds the young man had been filled up. I awoke into my voice by his means -- sun on the red leaves -- mounted high in the heavens using gesticulations and a gush of tears. Feelings of kindness and gentleness overcame me. Fringed by deep lashes, I contemplated my companyion

Snow
 

White people leave the express
 at 96th Street, collectively,
 like pigeons from a live wire
 or hope from the hearts of Harlem.
 And I'm one of them, although
 my lover sleeps two stops north between
 Malcolm X and Adam Clayton Powell
 Boulevards, wishing my ass
 were cupped inside her knees and belly,
 wishing this in a dream thick
 with inequalities.
  
 I live on Riverside Drive. My face
 helped get me here. I was
 ruddy with anticipation the day
 I interviewed for the rooms
 near the park with its
 snow-covered maples. I was full
 of undisguised hope as I
 strolled along the river, believing
 I belonged there, that my people
 inherited this wonderland
 unequivocally, as if they deserved it.
  
 My lover buys twinkies from the Arabs,
 bootleg tapes on 25th,
 and carries a blade in her back
 pocket although her hands
 are the gentlest I've known.
 She ignores the piss smells
 on the corner, the sirens
 at 4 A.M., the men whose brains
 have dissolved in rum. And tries
 to trust a white woman who
 sleeps near the trees of Riverside.
  
 When we go out together,
 we avoid expensive 
 cafs on Columbus Avenue, jaunts
 to the Upper East Side. Harlem
 eyes us suspiciously or with
 contempt beneath half-closed lids.
 We have friends there,
 hidden in the ruins like gold, who
 accept us. When it snows,
 we walk boldly anywhere, as if the snow
 were a protection, or a death.






Proportion Surviving
 

          
          Long before the fresh apple crisis, my life had some form to it. I would wake in the mornings--I would perform something. For example, the day I tried, as one with acute passion might, to win one woman over but accidentally won another--that whole time I had been living like someone. Though I can't remember his name. His model of optimism provided me with a certain geography that I inhabit in time of need. This time the need was surprising. People tend to have faith that the juice they drink in the morning is the same juice they have always drunk. And apples take their shape naturally. The guy, whose name escapes me now, taught me to look upon others' concerns as mine to make at home. I was fond of doing many things at home, but my favorite was drinking juice. When my friends came by--they liked to suddenly show up with all kinds of breads in their hands, thinking they knew what I needed and planning to force it on me--I had to tell them I was busy with my juice. Two weeks before the crisis, I had been writing some poems about it. It was a warm day, not entirely different from other warm days in San Francisco. People were on the street. Pale people were on the street, making it to the park and lying there such that the next day they were a little browned. The poems I had written were failures, but dense ones. It seemed appropriate to think the person's attempt at wholeness was a series of missteps, which if drawn across an afternoon might prove interesting to other people. I had a way of reminding my friends that we were all in pain, but a fruit tart kind of pain strangers can't help but enjoy. That day I had, in a sense, gathered all my possessions and gone out onto the street with them. I awoke that morning with an urgency to prepare myself for something--not anything life threatening, but definitely personal.   My lover, then, wanted to spend much of her life asleep. She had no ostensible reaction to the city's sudden depletion of all its fresh apples and no hope for them. In a world where a person's tastes revolve around the kind of sleep she gets, I could not find four people who cared. I thought that if I could find those four people we could really do something. A few of my friends pretended they were chosen. A few neighbors felt bad and made offers. My mother called to console me. My lover--in actuality, the closest person to being a member of the encumbered troop, slept next to me. Sleep became our network: falling in and out of it for change. The rule of survival is that no two people can lie in the same bed and sleep at the same time. So I kept an eye on her and played this game of freshness. If by morning I could quickly run out and do seven things that did not involve longing, she would reward me. Before the crisis, the reward would have needed only to be an apple one. But after the apples were gone. The landscape usually contains the solution to what's lost. Demographics help people in cars. Some people did not notice me. Some demographers lose sleep and do not notice me. That was two days before. The evening before it was two days before the crisis, I was thinking that I did not think I was asleep. I had been watching the sunlight take the corner of my room and my housemate's cat in it. When I looked again, there was no light--but I had not been asleep. It's the way people react to traumatic events. They say, "I had just been there or will say, "She was just with me. So the loss of light was emotional and the lost state--demographic. I began to trace things by their disappearance. Alone in the room, my memory, and anticipated darkness going for light. People like to talk about the daytime. People in strange moods often miss the daytime. Before the crisis it was not often that one would find me in strange moods. I had managed a particular kind of balance fortified by a certain satisfaction of taste. I was happy. I mean, I was in my juice.   Five weeks before the crisis, I was employed at the natural foods grocery around the corner from my house. I did not really work there, but I went there every week. All but the third Sunday of each month, I would walk in and find all kinds of juice on sale. Not to buy, but to stand next to. Shorter people have the privilege of proximity to most cardboard signs. That was one thing. I would stand there and be something for taller people who couldn't see. I had gotten into the habit of improvised customer service as a way to peruse the juice aisles without being noticed. My parents thought my talents should have led me somewhere. My father would always say, "If you're not going to be a people person, then numbers will have to do. He was surprised that with all the time I had on my hands, I chose to spend most of it alone. Numbers then did hold some mystery for me, but mostly too high and far-reaching to explore. For years I had known that if there was a wall between where I was and where I needed to be, I did not want it there. Some people have personal goals that are demanding. Certain goals make it impossible to lounge around in bed. My decision to drink only fresh juice, which costs as much as a small satisfying breakfast, kept me busy rounding up cash. I would have to leave most friendships behind. As a way of keeping my life "wall-free, I had to divide my time. I would spend the first part of the day searching for volunteer positions in organic juice factories. The second part of my day I would spend telling people about the first part. The other parts are not of substance here.   Twenty-five years before the crisis I had for the first time what would eventually become known to me as apple juice. Twenty-three years later a magazine editor would reject my first attempt to recount that experience in litany. I am always drinking in my poems, a good friend says.   In the first years of my life, everything I ate was mush. Today I will tolerate only the toughest of green vegetables and date people who will always forget this. When I had that remarkable glass of apple juice, I had no idea that one day I simply would not be able to find it. The city gets rid of its apples. People find themselves inventing fruit. The day I decided to write poems about it--it was twelve days before the rumors began and fourteen days before the media coverage--I had been resting in my best friend's easy chair. We were discussing the rise of the smoothie industry when something fantastic occurred to me. Five days later I had twenty poems. When a person writes a poem about her passions, people on the street are bound to notice them. The passions overwhelm the body. She carries the body as though it were the book. The friend whose easy chair gave way to my failures moved out of town the next week, and though I miss her it was the failures that saved me. On every other day any kind of crisis one finds particular sayings helpful. If certain words are spoken quietly into a cup of hot water, with the handle of the cup turned toward the wall, whatever strength found in the person may be mirrored in the wall. The person leaves the house with her hand against this wall but strutting slightly.   In the alley behind the natural foods grocery, I met my second lover for the first time. Meeting people in vulnerable places accentuates the passion later. Or it may be so hot that the lover never thinks in the present. And the weather was so hot during the crisis. Only the alleys had shade. Forty-eight days into the crisis, while on a thirst strike, I had to make a run for the alley. Not as though people were after me, but the elements. The foundation of anyone feeling that they must get away is need; at the bottom of any body-based need is grace. When I appeared at the opening of the alley, a woman who not twenty-four hours later would be dozing in my bed was stacking crates against the east-side wall. Women who work against surfaces inspire me to do things--I thought about telling her, or--short women make me want things. All the time while I was growing up I put a lot of demands on my juice; forty-eight days into the crisis she made me forget it. I did not forget it, but was embroiled. The newspapers were saying things about the past. People were celebrating thick juice, and I kept writing those poems. That day in the alley I realized three things about life. While assisting her I learned three things to carry around with me, to disperse when needed. For six months during the crisis, I did not care about the crisis.   When my faith returned all my lovers were gone. That morning I woke to the two hundred and thirty-second day of the crisis; I was beneath my bed. It was the sixth day that I had awakened beneath my bed. I was lonely, but I was also sure. Life without juice had taken on the name and shape of my weakest character, who--when we passed on the street--did not know me. I knew it was me by the way my head felt: people find themselves in an idea and feel so specified by the idea that they are compelled to show it. Today all my ideas are liquid. That day of my faith, friends thinking I was sick came by to see me. It would be the last day I spent alone; I was happy, but still would not drink. The juice on my mind was no longer juice. There was an absence there, but one so constant it became familiar. I did not want to drink it.





Home
 

My father had a steel comb with which he would comb our hair.
  
 After a bath the cold metal soothing against my scalp, his hand cupping
 my chin.
  
 My mother had a red pullover with a little yellow duck embroidered
 on it and a pendant made from a gold Victoria coronation coin.
  
 Which later, when we first moved to Buffalo, would be stolen from 
 the house.
  
 The Sunn'i Muslims have a story in which the angels cast a dark mark
 out of Prophet Mohammad's heart, thus making him pure, though the
 Shi'a reject this story, believing in his absolute innocence from birth.
  
 Telling the famous Story of the Blanket in which the Prophet covers
 himself with a Yemeni blanket for his afternoon rest. Joined under
 the blanket first by his son-in-law Ali, then each of his grandchildren
 Hassan and Hussain and finally by his daughter Bibi Fatima.
  
 In Heaven Gabriel asks God about the five under the blanket and
 God says, those are the five people whom I loved the most out of all
 creation, and I made everything in the heavens and the earth for
 their sake.
  
 Gabriel, speaker on God's behalf, whisperer to Prophets, asks God, can
 I go down and be the sixth among them.
  
 And God says, go down there and ask them. If they consent you may go
 under the blanket and be the sixth among them.
  
 Creation for the sake of Gabriel is retroactively granted when the group
 under the blanket admits him to their company.
  
 Is that me at the edge of the blanket asking to be allowed inside.
  
 Asking the 800 hadith be canceled, all history re-ordered.
  
 In Hyderabad I prayed every part of the day, climbed a thousand steps
 to the site of Maula Ali's pilgrimage.
  
 I wanted to be those stairs, the hunger I felt, the river inside.
  
 I learned to pronounce my daily prayers from transliterated English
 in a book called "Know Your Islam, dark blue with gold calligraphed
 writing that made the English appear as if it were Arabic complete with
 marks above and below the letters.
  
 I didn't learn the Arabic script until years later and never learned the
 language itself.
  
 God's true language: Hebrew. Latin. Arabic. Sanskrit.
  
 As if utterance fit into the requirements of the human mouth.
  
 I learned how to find the new moon by looking for the circular absence
 of stars.
  
 When Abraham took Isaac up into the thicket his son did not know
 where he was being led.
  
 When his father bound him and took up the knife he was shocked.
  
 And said, "Father, where is the ram?
  
 Though from Abraham's perspective he was asked by God to sacrifice
 his son and proved his love by taking up the knife.
  
 Thinking to himself perhaps, Oh Ismail, Ismail, do I cut or do I burn.
  
 I learned God's true language is only silence and breath.
  
 Fourth son of a fourth son, my father was afflicted as a child and
 as was the custom in those days a new name was selected for him to
 protect his health.
  
 Still the feeling of his rough hand, gently cupping my cheek, dipping the
 steel comb in water to comb my hair flat.
  
 My hair was kept so short, combed flat when wet. I never knew my hair
 was wavy until I was nearly twenty-two and never went outside with wet
 and uncombed hair until I was twenty-eight.
  
 At which point I realized my hair was curly.
  
 My father's hands have fortune-lines in them cut deeply and dramatic.
  
 The day I left his house for the last time I asked him if I could hold his
 hand before I left.
  
 There are two different ways of going about this.
  
 If you have known this for years why didn't you ask for help, he 
 asked me.
  
 Each time I left home, including the last time, my mother would hold a
 Quran up for me to walk under. Once under, one would turn and kiss
 the book.
  
 There is no place in the Quran which requires acts of homosexuality to 
 be punishable by lashings and death.
  
 Hadith or scripture. Scripture or rupture.
  
 Should I travel out from under the blanket.
  
 Comfort from a verse which also recurs: "Surely there are signs in this
 for those of you who would reflect.
  
 Or the one hundred and four books of God. Of which only four are
 known--Qur'an, Injeel, Tavrat, Zubuur.
  
 There are a hundred others--Bhagavad-Gita, Lotus Sutra, Song of
 Myself, the Gospel of Magdalene, Popul Vuh, the book of Black Buffalo
 Woman--somewhere unrevealed as such.
  
 Dear mother in the sky you could unbuckle the book and erase all the
 annotations.
  
 What I always remember about my childhood is my mother whispering
 to me, telling me secrets, ideas, suggestions.
  
 She named me when I moved in her while she was reading a calligraphy
 of the Imam's names. My name: translated my whole life for me as
 Patience.
  
 In India we climbed the steps of the Maula Ali mountain to the top,
 thirsting for what.
  
 My mother had stayed behind in the house, unable to go on pilgrimage.
 She had told me the reason why.
  
 Being in a state considered unacceptable for prayers or pilgrimages.
  
 I asked if she would want more children and she told me the name she
 would give a new son.
  
 I always attribute the fact that they did not, though my eldest sister's first
 son was given the same name she whispered to me that afternoon, to my
 telling of her secret to my sisters when we were climbing the stairs.
  
 It is the one betrayal of her--perhaps meaningless--that I have never
 forgiven myself.
  
 There are secrets it is still hard to tell, betrayals hard to make.
  
 You hope like anything that though others consider you unclean God
 will still welcome you.
  
 My name is Kazim. Which means patience. I know how to wait.

Female Masculinity
 

Two guys sucking each other in the steam room
 didn't want anything
 to do with me, evidently--
 I left them to their comedy.
  
                                      *
  
 Legato longings:
 wish for walnuts, wish for water,
 wish to exorcise this morning's debauch--
 two Faur nocturnes.
  
                                      *
  
 In slow motion
 Steve tussled with a motorcycle
 trying to run me over
 on the boulevard of moon smut
  
 splicing together bridges
 and lagoons, like the bride
 of Frankenstein rushing
 to overtake the inert
  
 Real, a mass
 of facts, some conjugal,
 some comic--
 contrapuntal tenebrae!
  
  






Genius Loci
 

(Oakland)
  
 Make it
 the place
 it was then,
  
 so full it split
 vision to live
 there in winter
  
 so late & wet
 abundance
 toppled toward
  
 awful--birds
 of paradise
 a profusion
  
 the ripe colors
 of anodized
 metal; in gutters
  
 umbrellas
 smashed
 like pigeons,
  
 bent ribs bright
 among black
 slack fluttering;
  
 camellias'
 pink imagoes
 dropping
  
 into water
 & rotting,
 sweet stink--
  
 & did not
 stop :
 the inundated
  
 eye, over-
 populous
 urban eye,
  
 the whole 
 place, to look
 at it, was
  
 a footprint
 in January :
 everywhere
  
 cloudy water
 rising to fill in
 the outlines,
  
 & meanwhile
 indoors differed
 by degree
  
 alone : without
 love, loosed
 from God,
  
 there were
 lovers & touch
 rushing in
  
 to redraw
 your boundaries
 constantly
  
 because
 it was a tune
 you kept
  
 getting wrong,
 the refrain
 of what it meant
  
 to live alone,
 months of that
 and then  
  
 .
  
 sudden summer, sheer release, streets all cigarettes & sashay,
    balls-out tube tops, low-riders & belly fat, the girls on the block
  
 all like Oh no she didn't, and girl, she did, she was mad skills
    with press-ons & a cell phone telling him where to stick it, a kid
  
 on her hip, just like that, summer, sheer beauty & lip gloss
    that smelled like peaches, & you going to the store for whiskey
  
 & condoms like everyone else on a hot, long afternoon
    so long & hot it would just be sunburn to walk anywhere if it weren't also
  
 a pleasure, thoughtless & shiftless & horny & drunk,
    just someone thinking summer wasn't up to anything deep, & lo
  
 there he was, his punk ass pink as a Viking in a tight
    wifebeater & lingering by the public pool, drinking beer so sly
  
 it didn't look illegal, & he wasn't a good idea but
    did you have a light? & it seemed the whole summer went like that,
  
 taking fire out of your pocket & giving it away, a ditty
    you could whistle it was so clich, like the numbers they gave you after
  
 & you never called, the number of swollen nodes of the kissing
    colds you got & later the number to call to get tested, the number of the bus
  
 to the clinic, the number they gave you when they asked
    you to wait, the number of questions asked, number of partners, number
  
 of risks, number of previous tests, the number of pricks
    --one--to draw the blood, the number of minutes you waited before
  
 results, & then you decided you had to get the tune right,
    the how to live it so it doesn't kill you, to take a number & wait in the long line
  
of the city's bankrupt humanism like the bus that never comes
    no matter how long you wait, & the grocery bag breaking, & if you were going
  
 to sing that one, the one that sounds like all I got is bruised
    tomatoes, broken glass & dirty bread & no one waiting at home, would you

.
  
 start with genius,
 as in, the spirit
 of a place?,
  
 & small, as in
 of the back, wet 
 in heat
  
 & the urge
 to touch him
 there, skin
  
 just visible
 between his jeans
 & t-shirt,
  
 to see if
 he's sweating,
 to see
  
 if he feels
 what you feel?,
 & if he does,
  
 is that all
 the spirit the place
 will give,
  
 a small thing
 shared, just
 a phrase, not
  
 a whole song,
 but something
 to build on?,
  
 & if it isn't bread
 & if it sure
 ain't tomatoes
  
 it isn't empty,
 is it, like the signage
 you walk by
  
 that fronts
 the Lakeside
 Church of Practical
  
 Christianity,
 hawking
 a knowledge of God
  
 so modest
 it seems trivial?,
 & it isn't ever,
  
 is it, the how
 to live it
 so it doesn't
  
 kill you,
 the where
 to touch it,
  
 the when 
 will genius
 sing your name
  
 so it sounds
 like a place
 you can live?






Poem for Haruko
 

I never thought I'd keep a record of my pain
 or happiness
 like candles lighting the entire soft lace
 of the air
 around the full length of your hair/a shower
 organized by God
 in brown and auburn
 undulations luminous like particles
 of flame
  
 But now I do
 retrieve an afternoon of apricots
 and water interspersed with cigarettes
 and sand and rocks
 we walked across:
                         How easily you held
 my hand
 beside the low tide
 of the world
  
 Now I do
relive an evening of retreat
 a bridge I left behind
 where all the solid heat
 of lust and tender trembling 
lay as cruel and as kind 
 as passion spins its infinite
 tergiversations in between the bitter
 and the sweet
  
 Alone and longing for you
 now I do






One Day
 

One day after another--
Perfect.
They all fit.





Winter
 

How long will the bed that we made together
 hold us there? Your stubbled cheeks grazed my skin
 from evening to dawn, a cloud of scattered
 particles now, islands of shaving foam
 slowly spiraling down the drain, blood drops
 stippling the water pink as I kiss
 the back of your neck, our faces framed inside
 a medicine cabinet mirror. The blade
 of your hand carves a portal out of steam,
 the two of us like boys behind frosted glass
 who wave goodbye while a car shoves off
 into winter. All that went unnoticed
 till now -- empty cups of coffee stacked up
 in the sink, the neighborhood kids
 up to their necks in mounds of autumn leaves.
 How months on a kitchen calendar drop
 like frozen flies, the flu season at its peak
 followed by a train of magic-markered
 xxx's -- nights we'd spend apart. Death must work
 that way, a string of long distance calls
 that only gets through to the sound of your voice
 on our machine, my heart's mute confession
 screened out. How long before we turn away
 from flowers altogether, your blind hand
 reaching past our bedridden shoulders
 to hit that digital alarm at delayed
 intervals -- till you shut it off completely.






Nocturnal Admissions
 

I went to my mother's room at 13
 past midnight, and told her I was dying.
 I'd wet the bed, I'd had this crazy dream,
 about a sexy neighbor I'd been spying
 on. Well, I didn't tell her that. I mean,
 the day before she asked who I was eyeing
 when I didn't want to go outside
 for ice cream. The truck was parked out front,
 and she was buying, but I couldn't join
 the other screaming kids --
 not with Lance applying suntan lotion
 to his muscled teenage skin.
 Stretched out on a beach towel
 in his front yard, his body mystified me,
 while mine seemed happy to defy me.
 My dick would tent my cut-offs
 at the sight of him.
 I wore two pair of underwear,
 but even then I thought I'd burst
 right through the seams.
 So I didn't dare tell mother what I'd dreamed,
 though she did think to ask me.
 I'd have been a fool to tell her that.
 She thought my blush was any boy's,
 puzzling out his sexuality, but I swear it was
 as much because the fantasies
 were always other boys.
 some from my baseball team,
 some the roughnecks at school,
 but usually Lance. He was flying
 naked in the dream I had that night,
 the one that made me think that God
 was mad and killing me. I was lying
 (also naked -- and hard as cinder block)
 on the beach towel I'd seen him lay
 across the grass the day before.
 I tried to understand the signs implying
 I might turn into some kind of freaky thing.
 But it would have been cruel to tell my mother that,
 especially when she was already crying,
 and trying not to laugh at the same time,
 when I showed her what came out of me.
 She apologized for throwing such a scene,
 said I was growing up to be a man, that's all it meant,
 said it was normal for a boy my age's thing
 to start uprising like a metal beam.
 She apologized again
 that I didn't have my dad around to train
 an 11-year old boy in the ways of puberty.
 I was as stupefied as I've ever been.
 She never mentioned him.
 And I have never turned a deeper red
 than I did then, at 26 past midnight,
 when my mother helped me change my sheets,
 and said the next day she'd teach me to wash them.
 And then she said she'd ask the man across the street
 to talk to me. Would that be okay?
 Or would I feel more comfortable
 with someone younger, like his son?





Pulse: 1
 

1.
  
 It wasn't over a woman that war began, but it's better
 To see it this way, my myth professor loved to say, a man
 From the South rumored to extort the bodies of college girls
 Into higher grades. My girlfriend of the time told me so --
  
 He was a creep, she
 Got an A in the class and liked his joke about religion
 As self-mutilation, it was Ramadan then and, O Helen,
 I was fasting. I lie awake in a desert night east
  
 Of the Atlantic on the verge of rain, the catapulted grains
 Of sand on hot zinc roof, the rustle of leaves, the flap
 Of peeling bark on trees whose names I do not know, and where
 Would I find a botany guide here. Water flowed
  
 Like a river from the Jabal once.
 There were elephant pools, alligator
 Streams, and a pond for the devil to speak in human tongues.
 All desiccant names now after an earthquake
  
 Shuffled the ground decades ago. It will rain soon,
 I'm assured, since nothing has stopped
 The birds from migration. All the look-alikes
 Are already here: the stork, the heron.
  
 The white flying flowers, the ibis, and the one
 That aesthetizes you more.






The Tea and Sage Poem
 

At a desk made of glass,
 In a glass walled-room
 With red airport carpet,
  
 An officer asked
 My father for fingerprints,
 And my father refused,
  
 So another offered him tea
 And he sipped it. The teacup
 Template for fingerprints.
  
 My father says, it was just
 Hot water with a bag.
 My father says, in his country,
  
 Because the earth knows
 The scent of history,
 It gave the people sage.
  
 I like my tea with sage
 From my mother's garden,
 Next to the snapdragons
  
 She calls fishmouths
 Coming out for air. A remedy
 For stomach pains she keeps
  
 In the kitchen where 
 She always sings.
 First, she is Hagar
  
 Boiling water
 Where tea is loosened.
 Then she drops
  
 In it a pinch of sage
 And lets it sit a while.
 She tells a story:
  
 The groom arrives late
 To his wedding
 Wearing only one shoe.
  
 The bride asks him
 About the shoe. He tells her
 He lost it while jumping
  
 Over a house-wall.
 Breaking away from soldiers.
 She asks:
  
 Tea with sage
 Or tea with mint?
  
 With sage, he says,
 Sweet scent, bitter tongue.
 She makes it, he drinks.






Sleeping Trees
 

Between what should and what should not be
 Everything is liable to explode. Many times
 I was told who has no land has no sea. My father
 Learned to fly in a dream. This is the story
 Of a sycamore tree he used to climb
 When he was young to watch the rain.
  
 Sometimes it rained so hard it hurt. Like being
 Beaten with sticks. Then the mud would run red.
  
 My brother believed bad dreams could kill
A man in his sleep, he insisted
 We wake my father from his muffled screams
 On the night of the day he took us to see his village.
 No longer his village he found his tree amputated.
 Between one falling and the next
  
 There's a weightless state. There was a woman
 Who loved me. Asked me how to say tree
 In Arabic. I didn't tell her. She was sad. I didn't understand.
 When she left. I saw a man in my sleep three times. A man I knew
 Could turn anyone into one-half reptile.
 I was immune. I thought I was. I was terrified of being
  
 The only one left. When we woke my father 
 He was running away from soldiers. Now 
 He doesn't remember that night. He laughs
 About another sleep, he raised his arms to strike a king
 And tried not to stop. He flew
 But mother woke him and held him for an hour,
  
 Or half an hour, or as long as it takes a migration inward.
 Maybe if I had just said it.
 Shejerah, she would've remembered me longer. Maybe
 I don't know much about dreams
 But my mother taught me the law of omen. The dead
 Know about the dying and sometimes
 Catch them in sleep like the sycamore tree
 My father used to climb
  
 When he was young to watch the rain stream,
 And he would gently swing.






Scarecrow
 

The rice field birds are too clever for scarecrows,
 They know what they love, milk in the grain.
  
 When it happens, there will be no time to look for anyone.
 Husband, children, nine brothers and sisters.
  
 You will drop your sugarcane-stick-beating of plastic bucket,
 Stop shouting at birds and run.
  
 They will load you in trucks and herd you for a hundred miles.
 Old men will teach you trade with soldiers at checkpoints.
  
 You will give them your spoon, blanket and beans,
 They'll let you keep your life. And if you jump off the truck,
  
 The army jeep trailing it will run you over.
 Later, they will accuse you of giving up your land.
  
 Later, you will stand in distribution lines and won't receive enough to eat.
 Your mother will weave you new underwear from flour sacks.
  
And they'll give you plastic tents, cooking pots,
 Vaccine cards, white pills, and wool blankets.
  
And you will keep your cool.
 Standing with eyes shut tight like you've got soap in them.
  
 Arms stretched wide like you're catching rain.





Moon Grass Rain
 

1.
 Here, shooting stars linger
 They give out
 A sparkling trail like a cauterized incision
  
 Silver, or amber
 If the moon is low and rising red
  
  
 2.
 And the rain melts the roads
 And the roads
 Can rupture a spleen
 Or oust a kidney stone
  
 As for the heart
 It needs a beginning
 The narrative
 Burden of events
  
  
 3.
 "Mize, zey eat mize
 The Frenchman exclaimed with a smile
 "Rraized and shipped from za States
  
 We raise rats! I thought
 That's a lot of protein!
  
 "Maize maize! it was, after our chickens
 Have had their fill
  
  
 4.
 She was the only nurse in town before the war
 She spoke seven languages and died suddenly
 He was a merchant
 He's a doorman now and buys us cigarettes
  
  
 5.
 Here we are with love pouring out of every orifice
 Here they are dancing
 Around the funeral pyre, the corpse in absentia
  
  
 6.
 One of the drivers ran over the neighbor's ducks
 The neighbor demanded compensation
 For the post-traumatic stress disorder he accurately anticipates
  
 Do you know what it's like
 To drive on roads occupied
 By animal farms: you cannot tell
 Who killed who or how
 Many ducks were there to begin with
  
  
 7.
 In the morning, elephant grass moves the way
 Mist is visible in the breeze but doesn't dampen the skin
  
  
 8.
 Today, I yelled at three old women
 Who wouldn't stop bargaining for pills they didn't need
 One wanted extra
 For her grandson who came along for the ride
  
  
 9.
 Like lip sores
 The asphalt blisters in the rain
  
 And the boys
 Fill the holes with dirt and gravel
 And broken green branches
 Then wait:
  
 No windex. No flowers or newspapers
 And gratuity is appreciated
  
  
 10.
 "I have ants in my leg
 And "My leg went to sleep
 Are not the same thing!
  
 The French argue
 There is no sleep in a tingling numbness
 The symptom of sluggish blood:
  
 I agree. Me too my leg has been anted
 And we are learning to reconcile
 The dark with the electric
  
  
 11.
 Four days the river runs to the border
 Nine days to learn it wasn't the shape
 Of your nose that gave you away
 And debts are paid off in a-shelter-for-a-day
  
 A pile of wood plus change in your pocket
 Is a sack of potatoes and change in another's
  
  
 12.
 No more running long or short distance
 The old women
 Snicker at me when I pass them by
  
  
 13.
 She was comatose post-partum
 And the beekeeper
 Bathed her in love everyday
  
 When she recovered I gave up
 What he'd promised me for the woman
 Who took up nursing their newborn
 Since as coincidence would have it
 Her name was Om Assel -- Mother of Honey
  
  
 14.
 The translation of a medical interview
 Is not a poem to be written
  
 Come recite a verse from childhood with me
 I see you're unable to weep, does love
 Have no command over you?
  
 The sea's like the desert
 Neither quenches the thirst
  
  
 15.
 Here, dry grass burns the moon
 Here, a clearing of grass is a clearing of snakes
  
  
 16.
 And the rain has already been cleansed from the sky
The clinic is empty, soon
The earth will unseal like a jar
Harvest is the season that fills the belly
  
  
 17.
 Here, I ride my bicycle invisible
 Except for a crescent shadow and the Milky Way
 Is already past
  
  
 18.
 And a mirror gives the moon back to the moon
 Home is an epilogue:
  
 Which came first
 Memory or words?





The Whip
 

I spent a night turning in bed,
 my love was a feather, a flat
  
 sleeping thing. She was
 very white
  
 and quiet, and above us on
 the roof, there was another woman I
  
 also loved, had
 addressed myself to in
  
 a fit she
 returned. That
  
 encompasses it. But now I was
 lonely, I yelled,
  
 but what is that? Ugh,
 she said, beside me, she put 
  
 her hand on 
 my back, for which act
  
 I think to say this
 wrongly.





The Tunnel
 

Tonight, nothing is long enough--
 time isn't.
 Were there a fire,
 it would burn now.
  
 Were there a heaven,
 I would have gone long ago.
 I think that light
 is the final image.
  
 But time reoccurs,
 love--and an echo.
 A time passes
 love in the dark.





The Rain
 

All night the sound had
 come back again,
 and again falls
 this quiet, persistent rain.
  
 What am I to myself
 that must be remembered,
 insisted upon
 so often? Is it
  
 that never the ease,
 even the hardness,
 of rain falling
 will have for me
  
 something other than this,
 something not so insistent--
 am I to be locked in this
 final uneasiness.
  
 Love, if you love me,
 lie next to me.
 Be for me, like rain,
 the getting out
  
 of the tiredness, the fatuousness, the semi-
 lust of intentional indifference.
 Be wet
 with a decent happiness.





Kora in Hell: Improvisations II
 

To Flossie

       Why go further? One might conceivably rectify the rhythm, study all out and arrive at the perfection of a tiger lily or a china doorknob. One might lift all out of the ruck, be a worthy successor to--the man in the moon. Instead of breaking the back of a willing phrase why not  try to follow the wheel through--approach death at a walk, take in all the scenery. There's as much reason one way as the other and then--one never knows--perhaps we'll bring back Eurydice--this time!  
  _______________
      Between two contending forces there may at all times arrive that moment when the stress is equal on both sides so that with a great pushing a great stability results giving a picture of perfect rest. And so it may be that once upon the way the end drives back upon the beginning and a stoppage will occur. At such a time the poet shrinks from the doom that is calling him forgetting the delicate rhythms of perfect beauty, preferring in his mind the gross buffetings of good and evil fortune.

       Ay dio! I would say so much were it not for the tunes changing, changing, darting so many ways. One step and the cart's left you sprawling. Here's the way! and--you're hip bogged. And there's blame of the light too: when eyes are humming birds who'll tie them with a lead string? But it's the tunes they want most,--send them skipping out at the tree tops. Whistle then! who'd stop the leaves swarming; curving down the east in their braided jackets? Well enough--but there's small comfort in naked branches when the heart's not set that way.
________________  
     A man's desire is to win his way to some hilltop. But against him seem to swarm a hundred jumping devils. These are his constant companions, these are the friendly images which he has invented out of his mind and which are inviting him to rest and to disport himself according to hidden reasons. The man being half a poet is cast down and longs to rid himself of his torment and his tormentors.

       When you hang your clothes on the line you do not expect to see the line broken and them trailing in the mud. Nor would you expect to keep your hands clean by putting them in a dirty pocket. However and of course if you are a market man, fish, cheeses and the like going under your fingers every minute in the hour you would not leave off the business and expect to handle a basket of fine laces without at least mopping yourself on a towel, soiled as it may be. Then how will you expect a fine trickle of words to follow you through the intimacies of this dance without--oh, come let us walk together into the air awhile first. One must be watchman to much secret arrogance before his ways are tuned to these measures. You see there is a dip of the ground between us. You think you can leap up from your gross caresses of these creatures and at a gesture fling it all off and step out in silver to my finger tips. Ah, it is not that I do not wait for you, always! But my sweet fellow--you have broken yourself without purpose, you are--Hark! it is the music! Whence does it come? What! Out of the ground? Is it this that you have been preparing for me? Ha, goodbye, I have a rendezvous in the tips of three birch sisters. Encouragez vos musiciens! Ask them to play faster. I will return--later. Ah you are kind.--and I? must dance with the wind, make my own snow flakes, whistle a contrapuntal melody to my own fugue! Huzza then, this is the dance of the blue moss bank! Huzza then, this is the mazurka of the hollow log! Huzza then, this is the dance of rain in the cold trees. 





I Walked in the House
 

I walked in the house
 on the flat aspect of the wood
 I took rectangular instruction of the wood
  
 when I walked I turned at the wall
 and on the flat I moved steadily
  
 unimpeded, not tumbling, climbing or short of breath.
 I walked in ease on the flat.
  
  
  
                                                               Something electric charged into our account
 and zinged out of it, pre-instructed
  
 and paid for the house. I felt
 house on my heel then instep and toe.
 I had a bad foot and I paid
 to get it fixed so I could walk here.
 I paid for the house and I paid for the
 foot that touches it. I paid to be
 directed rectangularly and down a hall.
 I curved my body to direct
 my waste through a hole. I am helped
 and paying for it.
  
 all of me exchanged,
 housing exchange. 
  
  
  
  
  
  
                                    I saw us standing
    up in the world.
 And we sank into
    exchange
   vibrating transparency
                  like a sea nettle
               afloat in the night sea
   
 the edges of the sea-veil
       tensed slapping above, visible
 when the wind crevassed and doilied
  
  
                                                            If there is a ceiling to exchange
                                                                         and above it sky
                                                           I don't can't see it and I don't know why
                                                                         I want it
                                                                above my house which is crystalline gel edges
  
                  because the whole world's disappeared
                                                                                               viewed as exchange
  
  
  
  
  
  
 I broke my arm and the window
 integrally to exchange.
  
 I paid someone to fix me and improve
 the window, triple-glazing it, and warmer
 I rebounded       knit in knit up.
 All parties to the event's aftermath
                      were paid.
  
  
  
  
  
  
 Suppose I did not go in pain
                    to hospital, did not visit and revisit
 for x-rays, left the window smashed
                   and sat here by it,
             stuck up
                 among the crystalline
                             and cold.
 I was painful and determined
 not to play, and with the other unemployed
 weighed --
  
                        the ghostship
 sagged with holes.
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
                                           --So you want to be a thing outside exchange?
  
                                               Drain out the dying bath 
                                               see what color you are?
  
  
  
  
  
 The coin changed hands
  
  
 identical      with a will
 to transact.

Rice Pudding
 

What is the matter with Mary Jane?
 She's crying with all her might and main,
 And she won't eat her dinner--rice pudding again--
 What is the matter with Mary Jane?
  
 What is the matter with Mary Jane?
 I've promised her dolls and a daisy-chain,
 And a book about animals--all in vain--
 What is the matter with Mary Jane?
  
 What is the matter with Mary Jane?
 She's perfectly well, and she hasn't a pain;
 But, look at her, now she's beginning again!
 What is the matter with Mary Jane?
   
 What is the matter with Mary Jane?
 I've promised her sweets and a ride in the train,
 And I've begged her to stop for a bit and explain--
 What is the matter with Mary Jane?
  
 What is the matter with Mary Jane?
 She's perfectly well, and she hasn't a pain,
 And it's lovely rice pudding for dinner again!--

The Kings Breakfast
 


     The King asked
      The Queen, and 
      The Queen asked
      The Dairymaid:
      "Could we have some butter for
      The Royal slice of bread?
      The Queen asked
      The Dairymaid,
      The Dairymaid
      Said, "Certainly,
      I'll go and tell
      The cow
      Now 
      Before she goes to bed.
  
      The Dairymaid
      She curtsied,
      And went and told
      The Alderney:
      "Don't forget the butter for
      The Royal slice of bread.
  
      The Alderney
      Said sleepily:
      "You'd better tell
      His Majesty
      That many people nowadays
      Like marmalade
      Instead.
  
      The Dairymaid
      Said, "Fancy!
      And went to
      Her Majesty.
      She curtsied to the Queen, and
      She turned a little red:
      "Excuse me,
      Your Majesty,
      For taking of
      The liberty,
      But marmalade is tasty, if
      It's very
      Thickly
      Spread.
  
      The Queen said
      "Oh!
      And went to
      His Majesty:
      "Talking of the butter for
      The Royal slice of bread,
      Many people
      Think that
      Marmalade
      Is nicer.
      Would you like to try a little
      Marmalade 
      Instead?

      The King said,
      "Bother!
      And then he said,
      "Oh, dear me!
      The King sobbed, "Oh, deary me!
      And went back to bed.
      "Nobody,
      He whimpered,
      "Could call me
      A fussy man;
      I only want
      A little bit
      Of butter for
      My bread!

     The Queen said,
      "There, there!
      And went to 
      The Dairymaid.
      The Dairymaid
      Said, "There, there!
      And went to the shed.
      The cow said,
      "There, there!
      I didn't really
      Mean it;
      Here's milk for his porringer
      And butter for his bread.
  
      The Queen took
      The butter
      And brought it to
      His Majesty;
      The King said,
      "Butter, eh?
      And bounced out of bed.
      "Nobody, he said,
      As he kissed her
     Tenderly,
     "Nobody, he said,
     As he slid down
      The banisters,
      "Nobody,
      My darling,
      Could call me
      A fussy man--
      BUT
 I do like a little bit of butter to my bread! 





Teddy Bear
 

A bear, however hard he tries,
 Grows tubby without exercise.
 Our Teddy Bear is short and fat
 Which is not to be wondered at;
 He gets what exercise he can
 By falling off the ottoman,
 But generally seems to lack
 The energy to clamber back.
  
 Now tubbiness is just the thing
 Which gets a fellow wondering;
 And Teddy worried lots about
 The fact that he was rather stout.
 He thought: "If only I were thin!
 But how does anyone begin?
 He thought: "It really isn't fair
 To grudge me exercise and air.
  
 For many weeks he pressed in vain
 His nose against the window-pane,
 And envied those who walked about
 Reducing their unwanted stout.
 None of the people he could see
 "Is quite (he said) "as fat as me!
 Then, with a still more moving sigh,
 "I mean (he said) "as fat as I!
  
 Now Teddy, as was only right,
 Slept in the ottoman at night,
 And with him crowded in as well
 More animals than I can tell;
 Not only these, but books and things,
 Such as a kind relation brings--
 Old tales of "Once upon a time,
 And history retold in rhyme.
  
 One night it happened that he took
 A peep at an old picture-book,
 Wherein he came across by chance
 The picture of a King of France
 (A stoutish man) and, down below,
 These words: "King Louis So and So,
 Nicknamed The Handsome'! There he sat,
 And (think of it!) the man was fat!
  
 Our bear rejoiced like anything
 To read about this famous King,
 Nicknamed "The Handsome. There he sat,
 And certainly the man was fat.
 Nicknamed "The Handsome. Not a doubt
 The man was definitely stout.
 Why then, a bear (for all his tub)
 Might yet be named "The Handsome Cub!
  
 "Might yet be named. Or did he mean
 That years ago he "might have been?
 For now he felt a slight misgiving:
"Is Louis So and So still living?
 Fashions in beauty have a way
 Of altering from day to day.
 Is Handsome Louis' with us yet?
 Unfortunately I forget.
  
 Next morning (nose to window-pane)
 The doubt occurred to him again.
 One question hammered in his head:
 "Is he alive or is he dead?
 Thus, nose to pane, he pondered; but
 The lattice window, loosely shut,
 Swung open. With one startled "Oh!
 Our Teddy disappeared below.
  
 There happened to be passing by 
 A plump man with a twinkling eye,
 Who, seeing Teddy in the street,
 Raised him politely to his feet,
 And murmured kindly in his ear
 Soft words of comfort and of cheer:
 "Well, well! "Allow me! "Not at all.
 "Tut tut! A very nasty fall.
  
 Our teddy answered not a word;
 It's doubtful if he even heard.
 Our bear could only look and look:
 The stout man in the picture-book!
 That "handsome King--could this be he,
 This man of adiposity?
 "Impossible, he thought. "But still,
 No harm in asking. Yes I will!

 "Are you, he said, "by any chance
 His Majesty the King of France?
 The other answered, "I am that,
 Bowed stiffly, and removed his hat;
 Then said, "Excuse me, with an air,
 "But is it Mr. Edward Bear?
 And Teddy, bending very low,
 Replied politely, "Even so!
  
 They stood beneath the window there,
 The King and Mr. Edward Bear,
 And, handsome, if a trifle fat,
 Talked carelessly of this and that. . . .
 Then said His Majesty, "Well, well,
 I must get on, and rang the bell.
 "Your bear, I think, he smiled. "Good-day!
 And turned, and went upon his way.
  
 A bear, however hard he tries,
 Grows tubby without exercise.
 Our Teddy Bear is short and fat,
 Which is not to be wondered at.
 But do you think it worries him
 To know that he is far from slim?
 No, just the other way about--
 He's proud of being short and stout.






Sneezles
 


     Christopher Robin
      Had wheezles
      And sneezles,
      They bundled him
      Into
      His bed.
      They gave him what goes
      With a cold in the nose,
      And some more for a cold
      In the head.
      They wondered
      If wheezles
      Could turn
      Into measles,
      If sneezles
      Would turn
      Into mumps;
      They examined his chest
      For a rash,
      and the rest 
      Of his body for swellings and lumps.
      They sent for some doctors
      In sneezles
      And wheezles
      To tell them what ought
      To be done.

      All sorts of conditions
      Of famous physicians
      Came hurrying round
      At a run.
      They all made a note
      Of the state of his throat,
      They asked if he suffered from thirst;
      They asked if the sneezles
      Came after the wheezles,
      Or if the first sneezle
      Came first.
      They said, "If you teazle
      A sneezle
      Or wheezle,
      A measle
      May easily grow.
      But humour or pleazle
      The wheezle
      Or sneezle,
      The measle
      Will certainly go.
      They expounded the reazles
      For sneezles
      And wheezles,
      The manner of measles
      When new.
      They said, "If he freezles
      In draughts and in breezles,
      Then PHTHEEZLES
      May even ensue.
  
Christopher Robin
Got up in the morning,
The sneezles had vanished away.
And the look in his eye
Seemed to say to the sky,
"Now, how to amuse them today?





Furry Bear
 

If I were a bear,
    And a big bear too,
 I shouldn't much care
    If it froze or snew;
 I shouldn't much mind
    If it snowed or friz--
 I'd be all fur-lined
    With a coat like his!
  
 For I'd have fur boots and a brown fur wrap,
 And brown fur knickers and a big fur cap.
 I'd have a fur muffle-ruff to cover my jaws,
 And brown fur mittens on my big brown paws.
 With a big brown furry-down up to my head,
 I'd sleep all the winter in a big fur bed.





Wind on the Hill
 

No one can tell me,
    Nobody knows,
 Where the wind comes from,
    Where the wind goes.
  
 It's flying from somewhere
    As fast as it can,
 I couldn't keep up with it,
    Not if I ran.
  
 But if I stopped holding
    The string of my kite,
 It would blow with the wind
    For a day and a night.
  
 And then when I found it,
    Wherever it blew,
 I should know that the wind
    Had been going there too.
  
 So then I could tell them
    Where the wind goes . . . 
 But where the wind comes from
    Nobody knows.





Forgotten
 

Lords of the Nursery
    Wait in a row,
 Five on the high wall,
    And four on the low;
 Big Kings and Little Kings,
    Brown Bears and Black,
 All of them waiting
    Till John comes back.
  
 Some think that John boy
    Is lost in the wood,
 Some say he couldn't be,
    Some say he could.
 Some think that John boy
    Hides on the hill;
 Some say he won't come back,
    Some say he will.
  
                           High was the sun, when
                              John went away . . .
                           Here they've been waiting
                              All through the day;
                           Big Bears and Little Bears,
                              White Kings and Black,
                           All of them waiting
                              Till John comes back.
  
 Lords of the Nursery
    Looked down the hill,
 Some saw the sheep-fold,
    Some say the mill;
 Some saw the roofs
    Of the little grey town . . .
 And their shadows grew long
    As the sun slipt down.
  
 Gold between the poplars
    An old moon shows;
 Silver up the star-way
    The full moon rose;
 Silver down the star-way
    The old moon crept . . .
 And, one by another,
    The grey fields slept.
  
 Lords of the Nursery
    Their still watch keep . . .
 They hear from the sheep-fold
    The rustle of sheep.
 A young bird twitters
    And hides its head;
 A little wind suddenly
    Breathes, and is dead.
  
 Slowly and slowly
    Dawns the new day . . .
 What's become of John boy?
    No one can say.
 Some think that John boy
    Is lost on the hill;
 Some say he won't come back,
    Some say he will.
  
 What's become of John boy?
    Nothing at all,
 He played with his skipping rope,
    He played with his ball.
 He ran after butterflies,
    Blue ones and red;
 He did a hundred happy things--
    And then went to bed.






Ovid in America
 

George Sandys (15781644), translator of Ovid's Metamorphosis Englished, Mythologized, and Represented in Figures, and resident treasurer of the Virginia Company for its settlement at Jamestown (16211624).

i. a long voyage, 1621

I left you where you are:
A humming late summer afternoon
& mottled by shade a man reading a letter
Becomes the image of a man reading
That I am forgetting.
This page is small yet stout enough 
To bear me whole upon it to you
All the way in London. I may expand 
Myself at leisure then fold it tight,
A sanctuary;
Like our vessel christened The George,
My letter is another ark to preserve me: George.

No midnight is so private as the sea's:
Timbers breathe, a loose rope snaps, & as the wind
Shoves you behind then slaps your face,
Seeing nothing, nothing to be seen, you feel
Unhoused, evicted from time.
But tonight, my love, my lamp is feathered, shy, 
Herald of the next ransack & assail. 
Behold the storm petrel! gray wick-threaded throat 
Burning the oil secreted, an amber musk
Of uncompassed seas & the solitary hunt, 
Of error & sign, &
That delirium--which turned
Our ship's boy to mowing fields of Atlantic salt.
Like windrows he dropped the waves. 

Until gaffed, pulled like a sleeve 
Through himself, 
He will live, tongue-bit, torn.
To return likely to a stool set on the shale
Where he can mend nets skirted by braggarts
Who have never traveled farther
Than the smoke dribbling from their chimneys.
I try never to imagine drowning.
Noisy urgent inefficiencies above, waves 
Pummeling, sky shredding, & the body
Anchored only in its just longing for air.
The tighter death's embrace, the more languorous
The moment. So this boy suffered
Some vast charity of sight. 
He was what he saw, an adam. 
Now he may be adamant & stain & distance; 
& also that small satin interruption
Of terror--the instant breath's 
Orphaned by self's perishing through poetry. 
Like Daphne his voice is forfeit for the song,
But we do not grieve for Daphne.

My bird-light gutters. 
Its call had sounded
Like dry wood giving up a nail.

What is this your wound that you must follow it?
For you I had no answer; consider only the reveries
Of the carpet navigator in his room. Listening
To collisions of wave & star outside his tower,
Rock-rapt, icebound, with a mind by dread 
& ceremony & the dozen arts of courtesy 
Girded, he invented those ideal earths in latitudes
Unstrung that I now trespass--

After I had translated two books 
To the pouring of seas & clamor of sailors
I began to brood long on landlessness, 
Coming to believe it my sovereign, my home, 
When on the flat horizon of weeks at noon the flaw:
A color merely, private, ethereal, collecting
Heft in the warp of time. Days 
Before we quailed at the barbed illegible pelt
Of forest, I wrecked, forlorn upon its savor,
Sweet damage of apples 
Fermenting in rain-soaked hay,
Giving way to something ranker--
I tasted it at dinner lying on my tongue.
I am His Majesty's servant as my god made me;
I am also my damps & exaltations; I am afraid.

Heaven & hell enlisted their geographers, 
A map has opened the soul's five hinges, & Persian
With expectance how often have I feasted 
On departure. London, Naples, 
Marriage, Damascus, now your dear person.
So much flowing through me
My sight has silted dark my mouth. I beg
All the many tongues your wonder cabinet holds
--Dolphin, mockingbird, Muscovy bear--to tell
This arrival, so unforeseen, disorderly 
As my hope you will not forget who I was, & am,
Unwildered, unwestered, constant, returning.

Bless you where you are, & where you would be
When you are there, & bring you thither.
                                          My love,
What may never not be strange? What,
This morning, will wake & make me new.



ii. winter 1621


It begins like a legend told to a fretful child:
It was, it was, and it was not. It begins
As if with symptoms of that sweat
I hear, so late (oh not
Thank God too late), you were spared:
A little blush along the throat. A restlessness.
Then the silkworm's casement, tapering 
& pale as the egg of a chimney-swift,
Which we will convert to cloth 
To cover the naked Indian. A bobbin,
Which dropped in my tisane would ravel the maelstrom
Of silk. Spindle of whirlwind, spoonful
Of follow. The thread's stained scalding mile 
Pours out my glass tempered in our kiln,
As each new settler is also seasoned
In this furnace, our new-found land.
(As the man drowning believes he digests
The mild water, as the damned marry flame
& yet blister, so do I know myself
Grasped by change at the stroke of change.)
Hold this glass up to your eye & through
Its pebbled horizon you may spy your room,
See its ire of surfaces sore with chairs. 
Green grass green grace...
Would that I could account this world one
Where nothing is lost only exchanged.

Without coppice, park, romancely glade, 
Or commanding vantage, 
Woods press on us; they fester, 
& they watch. To the northeast white spruce,
Phalanxes of fledging pinions, clamp 
Root to granite & hoard
What they glean off salt-fog, sea-spray, & stone. 
From ewers of willow-oaks darkness steams.
At breakfast I have pinched the plantlets 
Insinuated by a maple's winged seed overnight;
It unclasps twin leaves, pale hands 
Loosening the soil of my rest,
They never empty of their solicitations.

I find no empires here, no apostles or emeralds.
Instead, all things a-broil with an awful begetting
& my hours unsettled by some new show
Of riotous & mystical imagination.
Though we might wish to wedge us barnacle-tight
To shore's edge, our foundation raised
On marshland recalls this irritable fact--
The estuary, a nursery of strange devices, 
Throws off new forms so promiscuously
I wonder how the world holds any more shape
Than a dream?

From my hand at night (my light
A little oil in a dish or a rush taper smoking
Not so different from his), flower 
Ovid's fantastic shapes, shadows 
Of an old empire's former splendor
Now perjured by Virginia's clay & leaf & sand 
Turned to the king's profit as iron, silk, & glass.
Belief is possible at night, solitary, firelit.
Then, I can believe in Ovid's centaurs,
Or at death that he was met by a three-headed dog.
I can believe in your letters, which never come.

It is for you that I persist
In translating fresh birdsong, like this bunting's
Comecomecome wherewherewhere 
All together      down the hill. 
(Where did they go, who went before us?
Starved trove: scatter of blue beads & a name
Grafted to that bald acre. 
Roanoke.
There is my terror & my tale: to go west 
Under this eternity of nameless trees.)

And what will you make of this 
Humble hieroglyphic of nature I forward to you?
Nocturnal, double-wombed, variously called
Monkey Fox; Frosted,
Or Short-headed, or Indolent.
Let this Leafy-Eared Rat-Tailed Shuffler
The naturals call Possoun 
Join your zoo's other fantasies 
& with the Little Military Learnd Horse 
Enjoy its dish of ale. Its fur is durable;
Its flesh wholesome, white, & pleasant.

With one hand I can reach for
A medicine man's last breath caught in a vial
Or a hummingbird, stuffed 
With arsenic & leaves & looking 
Like a fine jeweled dagger aimed at my heart, 
With the other hand I brush away 
The web spun in a fox skull's whitened socket 
While a wild turkey glowers from its corner
Like a small dyspeptic dragon.
My cullings do not quite master my closet.
When I imagine myself returned to the smells
& noise of London, from my stiff knee
Sands grinding as I walk, no marvels
Except those which the mirror surprises in all of us,
The swan-white wing at my temple, 
I do not know what to hope for:
That you do not see me, or that you do,
But as though I were pinned under glass.

At my windowsill a quince widens
A jaundiced eye into the dark where are
Real nettles beneath the words & invincible red
Root of the madder. 
As long as any image of this world
Sticks in my soul, I remain--



iii. spring1622


300 were murdered. Twice that 
Refuse to garden, hunt, or gather food
But languish like sparrows sunk in a frozen pond
Staring up at shadows, awaiting
The sign that will call them back to life.
They cannot imagine their future. 
Haunts without words to tell their trial; like Io,
We would flee the noise of our new voices.

Last night's sun smeared across the sky
Its customary rose-gold gore. You, 
In London, you have applauded no tragedy 
Your approximate heart might use to figure this--
This violence. The trees
Do not desist their manufacture.
The perfumier's corky bitch 
Chewed out the tendon in her master's wrist 
Until it inelastic snapped & back she bowled,
Off to the woods & not sniffed since. 

With the smell of breakfast still in the air, 
The aftertaste of lead was the scandal
Of blood. Bodies stung into postures,
Penitence, Weariness, Surprise, & cardinal
In red caps, red garlands of red roses
Wrapped around white throats, white 
As bacon fat. No one need travel any longer
For all have found what they sought:
Henry walks his own fields, Lucy is not afraid,
Will has finally grasped the subjunctive.
The dead do not look asleep.
We cannot sleep through this life.
I watch the flies at their devotions, & I learn.

Time will not end by water or fire,
But by a congregation of frogs who yelp like hounds
& ride each other in shallow plashes.
I am inhabited by things that wake me,
But do not show themselves.

One frog my hand holds like a swollen glove.
As your maid might pare a callous,
I trim the brief cloudburst of its brain,
Which has the texture of cheese under my knife.
The frog, insensate, blind as an idol,
Would sit until it starved. 
If I put Ovid between it & the window, 
Tickle its hinderparts with acid, it leaps
Towards the light, avoiding the book.
Its movements finical as a rope-dancer. 
Though she have her heart & liver pulled out
Another frisks & fidgets up & down. 
              
Who am I so far from home? 

A year--& through branches light comes,
A pilgrim out of March from a farther world.
There is a flaw in the air. I breathed it 
From the swamp, a kiss of damp 
Translated to a plague that would remote me 
From care & corroding solicitudes, crown me 
With this headdress of red-painted deer-hair 
& weight my ears with wheels of copper.
My face painted blue & silver, my body
Washed in crimson dye, they would greet me
First with lamentations to mourn my old life,
Then by psalms I could enter
Purged & reborn & singing in a tongue 
Not mine I know not where to go. (I know.)






First Storm and Thereafter
 

What I notice first within 
          this rough scene fixed
in memory is the rare 
          quality of its lightning, as if
those bolts were clipped 
          from a comic book, pasted
on low cloud, or fashioned 
          with cardboard, daubed
with gilt then hung overhead 
          on wire and fine hooks.
What I hear most clearly 
          within that thunder now
is its grief--a moan, a long 
          lament echoing, an ache.
And the rain? Raucous enough, 
          pounding, but oddly 
musical, and, well, 
          eager to entertain, solicitous.

No storm since has been framed 
          with such matter-of-fact 
artifice, nor to such comic 
          effect. No, the thousand-plus 
storms since then have turned 
          increasingly artless, 
arbitrary, bearing--every 
          one of them--a numbing burst.

And today, from the west a gust 
          and a filling pressure
pulsing in the throat--offering 
          little or nothing to make light of.





Yeast
 

A word you can't quite say
without itching, flinching; it's not easy
to ignore its squirming appetite, stay
your primal juddering. And yes, at
night, each microbe gurns in the salty sea
of gut and gullet, born again, boldly eats
as you ate it, brews its own queasy tea
of proto-raunch which it will quickly sate,
birthing wanderlusting vigors, as yet
unknown to microscience. They sashay, set
out for the toes or gape through your eyes at
your drooping lids, your fat bunch of keys, at
this internal motel's boss, bellhop, lackey, sat
in the throne of his slumber, a mercy seat. 






1979
 

They arrived at the desk of the Hotel Duncan
and Smithed in, twitchy as flea-drummed squirrels.

Her coat was squared and cream, his patent shoes
were little boats you wouldn't put to sea in.

People, not meaning to, write themselves in
to the soap that your life is, rise or fall in the plot.

Seems that they were fleeing from the 1980s
much as a hummingbird flies from a flower's bell.

These were the times when wine was still a treat 
and not yet considered a common bodily fluid.

You will have heard that the mind works much
as an oval of soap turned between two hands.

She went round the room seeking lights
that could be off without desire becoming love.

He spread his arms behind his head, a gesture
of libido she misread as test of temperature.

Every carpet has its weave and underlay, seen 
only by the maker, the deliverer and the layer.

The year was a dog but the day was as good as 
a song that ends with a wedding, meat on the rib.

Evening was folding over the grid, slick walkers
with armfuls of books splendored in dusk's ask.

The song of the pipes was eerie as a face pressed
to glass, as a basketball with a mouth and teeth.

They lay in the glow of the times and talked of
how people form a queue to exact or escape love.

Each sigh has a sequel, she thought, then he did,
then the whole hotel pulsed through that thought.

Scandal has an inroad, but you must tunnel out;
she rose and stood up counting, all hair and beauty.

Though we do not hear them, beneath our own,
our shadows' footsteps clatter, they match our dread. 






Drycleaners
 

At the drycleaners I stand in line, my feet
shuffling weight from side to side,
impatience all over me while the woman,
light brown, with her Creole story drones on.
In New Orleans none would notice.
She's exotic in Baltimore, a dawn bird
everything hears. Even the clerk
leans into her tale, clucking softly. When
people behind me cough, she won't be
rushed. She's got her whole story to go.
Soon there's a man she never married,
her mother opposed, far away still, and he
went into a bar, wrong place, wrong color,
wrong words, maybe, a good man.
He'll never come away of there, not comin'
home, geraniums on the back porch,
and not replace the bad tire her Honda has,
who could always be telling her what time
does in the kitchen if she stand half
naked letting his dog go on out. So
let me pay you for him, give you money
because you is nice and I remember,
her nearly singing voice sighs. The sleeved
pants, two shirts hang on the brass ring, all
finished, unclaimed, the stiffened
stains gone away. The perfectly starched
cloth a redemption so beautiful
it might be the linen of royalty, but small
for a man two of us will think of as 
sleep scuffs house walls like tide under a boat.
How nice they are, these women doing
the little one person can for another
which is, in the end, a wash
of memorable words that leave you standing.






In this order
 

A tail, a torso, a tiny face.
A longing, a journey, a deep belief.
A spawning, a fissioning, a bit of tissue
anchored to a psyche, 
stitched to a wish. 
Watery. Irony. Memory. My 
mother, my face, and then

the last thing 
she'd ever see, and then
the last words 
I'd hear her say: You're 
killing me.








Mushrooms
 

Like silent naked monks huddled
around an old tree stump, having
spun themselves in the night
out of thought and nothingness--

And God so pleased with their silence
He grants them teeth and tongues.

Like us.

How long have you been gone?
A child's hot tears on my bare arms.








Rondeau
 

Small and panting mass
Of moonlight and dampness on a log
This glistening tumor, terrible frog
Of moonlight and dampness on a log
My small and panting mass










Butchers
 

1

Thank goodness we were able to wipe the Neanderthals out, beastly things,
from our mountains, our tundra--that way we had all the meat we might need.

Thus the butcher can display under our very eyes his hands on the block,
and never refer to the rooms hidden behind where dissections are effected,

where flesh is reduced to its shivering atoms and remade for our delectation
as cubes, cylinders, barely material puddles of admixtured horror and blood.

Rembrandt knew of all this--isn't his flayed beef carcass really a caveman?
It's Christ also, of course, but much more a troglodyte such as we no longer are.

Vanished those species--begone!--those tribes, those peoples, those nations--
Myrmidon, Ottoman, Olmec, Huron, and Kush: gone, gone, and goodbye.


2

But back to the chamber of torture, to Rembrandt, who was telling us surely
that hoisted with such cables and hung from such hooks we too would reveal

within us intricate layerings of color and pain: alive the brush is with pain,
aglow with the cruelties of crimson, the cooled, oblivious ivory of our innards.

Fling out the hooves of your hands! Open your breast, pluck out like an Aztec
your heart howling its Cro-Magnon cries that compel to battles of riddance!

Our own planet at last, where purged of wilderness, homesickness, prowling,
we're no longer compelled to devour our enemies' brains, thanks to our butcher,

who inhabits this palace, this senate, this sentried, barbed-wire enclosure
where dare enter none but subservient breeze; bent, broken blossom; dry rain.





Injun Joe as an Avatar
 

The poetry's arrested in his scene,
which can't be trusted, because I saw it 
through painkillers that softened my head,
after I'd asked him what Keats really meant:
"Was it a vision or a waking dream?
--You think that really mattered much to him?
In my waking vision dream, there's no glory,
no prize committee or dew-drip Paradise.
He's in an attic nook, or dim garage, 
or the cellar where he actually writes,
the space a sheeted granulated matter, 
his silenced countenance and de-boned body
scabby with caked ash about to crust and crack,  
poems piled at his feet like shoeshine rags.
A grave purpled fraughtness colors him.
What damaged him to this silence? 
He still writes and still isn't heard, as if
not being heard is the whole point of it,
and who are these children, these waving
Halloween windsocks who won't talk to him?
Beyond my busybody vision, he staggers
through divorce, stooped, bereft, still writing.
Spiky and singing, he out-writes them all,  
the cheered, spotless others--he howls 
at their after-dinner-speaker poetry,
the monsignors, the suburbans, the woo-woo
wisdom merchants weeping to the bank.
Poetry's a weather that doesn't need 
a specific place: it's a storm outside a cellar,
sunshine at a bedroom window.
Too much schoolroom poisons the idiom.
Too much reverence stinks up the joint.
The sorrow hanging in the dreamy air 
seems to confuse him, he can't understand 
how his heart came to hurt him like this, 
confuses it with leaves blurted out by storms,
leaves that keep falling fast in the cellar,
in poems he writes, the base desires and rage,
he says the gods designed the set,
stage-manage things, scripted them,
the hilarity that hurts us is 
that none of it really matters,  
that poetry's griefs are intimates
           we don't choose.  
                      They come to us, for us. 
                               They cling to body and soul.







Whats Left
 

How often now, raging weeping for the days
love gives then takes away, takes from you
the slightly chapped hand laid on the one
you're pointing at a tree, and the voice 
that breathes coffeeberry bush into your mouth.  
The finger that taps and feathers your ear
but the giggle's gone before you turn around.
The sandalwood scent hanging in the room,
the auburn strand like a flaw in the porcelain,
the off-course nail clipping in the carpet.
The days eat into your stomach, knife you
with longing for relief from love
that you cannot leave or leave alone,
from its rings of fire where you won't
burn down to ash or be transformed.
You become them, and they keep burning
and have a coffeeberry voice.
           Listen how
                     their rhymes sing
                               the little deaths you live.








So It Goes
 

That marsh hawk,
its blown-leaf flight 
across Tomales Bay fog, 
summer's abraded light,
the Pacific tide pressuring
and squeezing wave on wave 
into the bay's pinched inlet. . .
We feel somehow between us
still water crushed by that sea,
so constant it seems not to be.
The hawk, a circus, tumbles,
stops, stands upon the air,
beats its wings as if to shoo 
the sun's drenched veils, 
and its clapping wings stop
our unstoppable argument,
that love goes, who knows why,
and delivers us from pain 
to pain, air with teeth 
that seems to eat more air.  
Northern harrier, owl face, 
they sea-changed your name,
who listens with your face
and shows not love but want, 
speed, life in flight 
toward, forever toward,
pausing at every chance
to use what ocean-born
bayside air sustains you
by resisting you. We thank
your sunken head bones
and wild close-to-water seeking
that somehow speaks to us,
           delivers us 
                    to another amazed 
                              agonized place.






Its That Time
 

The silence of night hours
is never really silent.
You hear the air,
even when it doesn't stir.
It's a memory of the day.
Nothing stirs. Memory lags.
No traffic hushing up
and down tricky hills
among the camphor trees.

No foghorns, no streetcars'
shrilling phantoms before
they emerge from tunnels.
These absences keep us alert.
No rain or street voices,
nobody calling to someone else,
Hannah, you walk the dog 
tonight yet or what?

Only certain things to hear:
The sexy shifting of trees,
the refrigerator buzzing 
while Cherubino sings
the best of love is enthusiasm's
intense abandon, a voice
in song that preys on no one
and is unconscious of its joy.





Theories of the Soul
 

 A true friend is one soul in two bodies.  --Aristotle
Kant says, transcendental
    idealism. In Aquinas, 

we exist apart from bodies
    but only on Thursdays 

when his famous ox 
    flies by the window 

wiser at Cologne
    where Albertus Magnus,

his real name, appoints
    Aquinas to magister studentium,

master of students. Aquinas
    is petrified but says yes.

He feels his soul 
    sailing out of his head

floating near the roof
    where a blue ox wings by.

On Wednesday, two bodies 
    are one soul 

waking at sunrise
    thanks to the pineal gland

of Descartes, who thinks
    this node in the brain

is a tiny sugar cone
    or salted peanut,

the seat of the soul 
    while Aristotle points 

to the chopping 
    ax as a teleology 

as if the ax were a living,
    breathing person

which it isn't. 
    Heraclitus, air and fire 

while Aquinas objects, no
    not an ax but ox.

If you're a bird or soul
    I am only one mile

from the sea. If you
    are a soul in two bodies

life is more complex
    and we must labor

twice the field of sorrow
    after sleep, bath, and a glass

as Aquinas whispers, the things 
    we love tell us who we are.






Amidwives: Two Portraits
 

i. a wife will wean
 

by coming between

her husband 
and the woman who

whelped him. And 
should he bemoan

the sweet taste gone, 
she'll boast of how she

helped him--helped 
him get beyond

his milks at last, and cut 
from gums beneath

--the better to shake
her memory with--

permanent teeth.


ii. a mother will woo

 
a married man who 

was once her darling 
son. She can't conceive

of anyone loving him
through and through

as she has done. She'll 
do whatever it takes

to test his trust. She'll 
run a tempered blade

into the marriage 
bed and find the naked 

place where she was 
most betrayed

--and thrust.





Sunder
 

A last rock-skip hurlstorm (crazing river-glass)
the closest they ever were.
 
 


 
 


In right lockstitch
snared and split some fire-supper cooked on sticks.
 
 



 
 


By dawn the older brother took to chucking
what bottle-frags he could find and crud-oysters across.
The (high-pitched) younger blacked our waters
 
 
with a yowl.
 
 


 
 

Lord the sound such as rose from him
carried so--
Carved
into us. Clings.
 
 


 
 

Hadn't they clung tooth and claw to branch and bark.
--Came a man (and truck) to take them off.
 
 

 
 

Dieseled those boys off
away
some say somewheres upcountry,
inland.
 
 


 
 

Where it was they landed (why) nobody not them knows.
 
 


 
 

No body not them knows
just how they humped and grubbled home
what road they'd graved what woods criss-crossed
which creeks which trains they'd hopped who helped.
 
 


 
 

Came safe home sure        but blank as houses.
Came safe home       --as him  --and him.
 
 
--as (evermore) not them.





Craw
 

Split the boy       --his thorax, throat
Pierce-peel the craw:

A jag-crystalled crust      --his black scoria, slag
(not Bulb after Bulb, in Silver rolled)

What no gizzard ground (could hope to grind)
What would not mesh
What would not smelt

Embedded undigested there in meat





The Last Days of Summer Before the First Frost
 

Here at the wolf's throat, at the egress of the howl,
all along the avenue of deer-blink and salmon-kick
where the spider lets its microphone down
into the cave of the blackberry bush--earth echo,
absence of the human voice--wait here
with a bee on your wrist and a fly on your cheek,
the tiny sun and tiny eclipse.
It is time to be grateful for the breath
of what you could crush without thought,
a moth, a child's love, your own life.
There might never be another chance.
How did you find me, the astonished mother says
to her four-year-old boy who'd disappeared
in the crowds at the music festival.
I followed my heart, he shrugs,
so matter-of-fact you might not see
behind his words
(o hover and feed, but not too long)

the bee trails turning to ice as they're flown.






Royalty
 

          
          One fine morning, in the country of a very gentle people, a magnificent man and woman were shouting in the public square. "My friends, I want her to be queen! "I want to be queen! She was laughing and trembling. He spoke to their friends of revelation, of trials completed. They swooned against each other.      In fact they were regents for a whole morning as crimson hangings were raised against the houses, and for the whole afternoon, as they moved toward groves of palm trees. 





To a Reason
 

          
          A tap of your finger on the drum releases all sounds and initiates the new harmony.      A step of yours is the conscription of the new men and their marching orders.     You look away: the new love!     You look back,--the new love!     "Change our fates, shoot down the plagues, beginning with time, the children sing to you. "Build wherever you can the substance of our fortunes and our wishes, they beg you.     Arriving from always, you'll go away everywhere. 





Morning of Drunkenness
 

          
          O my good! O my beautiful! Atrocious fanfare where I won't stumble! enchanted rack whereon I am stretched! Hurrah for the amazing work and the marvelous body, for the first time! It began amid the laughter of children, it will end with it. This poison will remain in all our veins even when, as the trumpets turn back, we'll be restored to the old discord. O let us now, we who are so deserving of these torments! let us fervently gather up that superhuman promise made to our created body and soul: that promise, that madness! Elegance, knowledge, violence! They promised us to bury the tree of good and evil in the shade, to banish tyrannical honesties, so that we might bring forth our very pure love. It began with a certain disgust and ended--since we weren't able to grasp this eternity all at once--in a panicked rout of perfumes.      Laughter of children, discretion of slaves, austerity of virgins, horror in the faces and objects of today, may you be consecrated by the memory of that wake. It began in all loutishness, now it's ending among angels of flame and ice.     Little eve of drunkenness, holy! were it only for the mask with which you gratified us. We affirm you, method! We don't forget that yesterday you glorified each one of our ages. We have faith in the poison. We know how to give our whole lives every day.     Behold the time of the Assassins.





Genie
 

          
          He is affection and the present since he opened the house to foaming winter and the hum of summer, he who purified drink and food, he who is the charm of fleeting places and the superhuman deliciousness of staying still. He is affection and the future, strength and love that we, standing amid rage and troubles, see passing in the storm-rent sky and on banners of ecstasy.      He is love, perfect and reinvented measurement, wonderful and unforeseen reason, and eternity: machine beloved for its fatal qualities. We have all experienced the terror of his yielding and of our own: O enjoyment of our health, surge of our faculties, egoistic affection and passion for him, he who loves us for his infinite life     And we remember him and he travels. . . And if the Adoration goes away, resounds, its promise resounds: "Away with those superstitions, those old bodies, those couples and those ages. It's this age that has sunk!     He won't go away, nor descend from a heaven again, he won't accomplish the redemption of women's anger and the gaiety of men and of all that sin: for it is now accomplished, with him being, and being loved.     O his breaths, his heads, his racing; the terrible swiftness of the perfection of forms and of action.     O fecundity of the spirit and immensity of the universe!     His body! The dreamed-of release, the shattering of grace crossed with new violence!     The sight, the sight of him! all the ancient kneeling and suffering lifted in his wake.     His day! the abolition of all resonant and surging suffering in more intense music.     His footstep! migrations more vast than ancient invasions.     O him and us! pride more benevolent than wasted charities.     O world! and the clear song of new misfortunes!    He has known us all and loved us all. Let us, on this winter night, from cape to cape, from the tumultuous pole to the castle, from the crowd to the beach, from glance to glance, our strengths and feelings numb, learn to hail him and see him, and send him back, and under the tides and at the summit of snowy deserts, follow his seeing, his breathing, his body, his day. 





Aliens
 

The chatter of little people   
Breaks on my purpose 
Like the water-drops which slowly wear the rocks to powder. 
And while I laugh 
My spirit crumbles at their teasing touch. 






Your Voice
 

Amazing the mood it's put me in.
And the sky's tint at this hour--out 
on my own, occasional hum or zip

of a car, August the summer month
half the city splashes about
the Mediterranean, or north:

the beach at Donostia a jewel
--its Paseo the lip of a shell to walk. 
It's hearing you what really pulls

me in, soft this interior punch,
recalling the sheen of your brow--we'd talk
with our limbs, the Liffey below, have lunch...

Re-lived this evening on the phone;
the pitch of your Dublin tone. 

                              Madrid





Peach Fires
 

Out in the orchards the dogs stood

Almost frozen in the bleak spring night 
& Mister dragged out into the rows 
Between his peach trees the old dry limbs

Building at regular intervals careful pyres 
While the teeth of the dogs chattered & snapped 
& the ice began to hang long as whiskers

From the globes along the branches 
& at his signal we set the piles of branches ablaze 
Tending each carefully so as not to scorch

The trees as we steadily fed those flames 
Just enough to send a rippling glow along 
Those acres of orchard where that body--

Sister Winter--had been held so wisely to the fire






Mutability ["We are as clouds that veil the midnight moon"]
 


                                         I. 
We are as clouds that veil the midnight moon; 
    How restlessly they speed and gleam and quiver,
Streaking the darkness radiantly! yet soon
Night closes round, and they are lost for ever:--

                                         II.
Or like forgotten lyres whose dissonant strings
    Give various response to each varying blast,
To whose frail frame no second motion brings
    One mood or modulation like the last.

                                        III.
We rest--a dream  has power to poison sleep; 
    We rise--one wandering thought pollutes the day;
We feel, conceive or reason, laugh or weep,
Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away:--

                                       IV.
It is the same!--For, be it joy or sorrow,
    The path of its departure still is free;
Man's yesterday may ne'er be like his morrow;
    Nought may endure but Mutability.





Kora in Hell: Improvisations XXVII
 

XXVII   1
       This particular thing, whether it be four pinches of four divers white powders cleverly compounded to cure surely, safely, pleasantly a painful twitching of the eyelids or say a pencil sharpened at one end, dwarfs the imagination, makes logic a butterfly, offers a finality that sends us spinning through space, a fixity the mind could climb forever, a revolving mountain, a complexity with a surface of glass; the gist of poetry. D.C. al fin.  
2
       There is no thing that with a twist of the imagination cannot be something else. Porpoises risen in a green sea, the wind at nightfall bending the rose-red grasses and you--in your apron running to catch--say it seems to you to be your son. How ridiculous! You will pass up into a cloud and look back at me, not count the scribbling foolish that puts wings to your heels, at your knees.  
3
       Sooner or later as with the leaves forgotten the swinging branch long since and summer: they scurry before a wind on the frost-baked ground--have no place to rest--somehow invoke a burst of warm days not of the past nothing decayed: crisp summer!--neither a copse for resurrected frost eaters but a summer removed   undestroyed a summer of dried leaves scurrying with a screech, to and fro in the half dark--twittering, chattering, scraping.

       Seeing the leaves dropping from the high and low branches the thought rise: this day of all others is the one chosen, all other days fall away from it on either side and only itself remains in perfect fullness. It is its own summer, of its leaves as they scrape on the smooth ground it must build its perfection. The gross summer of the year is only a halting counterpart of those fiery days of secret triumph which in reality themselves paint the year as if upon a parchment, giving each season a mockery of the warmth or frozenness which is within ourselves. The true seasons blossom or wilt not in fixed order but so that many of them may pass in a few weeks or hours whereas sometimes a whole life passes and the season remains of a piece from one end to the other.

       This is a slight stiff dance to a waking baby whose arms have been lying curled back above his head upon the pillow, making a flower--the eyes closed. Dead to the world! Waking is a little hand brushing away dreams. Eyes open. Here's a new world.

     Security, solidity--we laugh at them in our clique. It is tobacco to us, this side of her leg. We put it in our samovar and make tea of it. You see the stuff has possibilities. You think you are opposing the rich but the truth is you're turning toward authority yourself, to say nothing of religion. No, I do not say it means nothing. Why everything is nicely adjusted to our moods. But I would rather describe to you what I saw in the kitchen last night--overlook the girl a moment: there over the sink (1) this saucepan holds all, (2) this colander holds most, (3) this wire sieve lets most go and (4) this funnel holds nothing. You appreciate the progression. What need then to be always laughing? Quit phrase making--that is, not of course--but you will understand me or if not--why--come to breakfast sometime around evening on the fourth of January any year you please; always be punctual where eating is concerned.

       My little son's improvisations exceed min: a round stone to him's a loaf of bread or "this hen could lay a dozen golden eggs. Birds fly about his bedstead; giants lean over him with hungry jaws; bears roam the farm by summer and are killed and quartered at a thought. There are interminable stories at eating time full of bizarre imagery, true grotesques, pigs that change to dogs in the telling, cows that sing, roosters that become mountains and oceans that fill a soup plate. There are groans and growls, dun clouds and sunshine mixed in a huge phantasmagoria that never rests, never ceased to unfold into--the day's poor little happenings. Not that alone. He has music which I have not. His tunes follow no scale, no rhythm--alone the mood in odd ramblings up and down, over and over with a rigor of invention that rises beyond the power to follow except in some more obvious flight. Never have I heard so crushing a critique as those desolate inventions, involved half-hymns, after his first visit to a Christian Sunday school.

       This song is to Phyllis! By this deep snow I know it's springtime, not ring time! Good God no! The screaming brat's a sheep bleating, the rattling crib-side sheep shaking a bush. We are young! We are happy! says Colin. What's an icy room and the sun not up? This song is to Phyllis. Reproduction lets death in, says Joyce. Rot, say I. to Phyllis this song is!

       The brutal Lord of All will rip us from each other--leave the one to suffer here alone. No need belief in god or hell to postulate that much. The dance: hands touching, leaves touching--eyes looking, clouds rising--lips touching, cheeks touching, arm about . . . Sleep. Heavy head, heavy arm, heavy dream--: Of Ymir's flesh the earth was made and of his thoughts were all the gloomy clouds created. Oya!

There's a dancing burgess by Tenier and Villon's maitresse--after he'd gone bald and was skin pocked and toothless: she that had him ducked in the sewage drain. Then there's that miller's daughter of "buttocks broad and breastes high. Something of Nietzsche, something of the good Samaritan, something of the devil himself,--can cut a caper of a fashion, my fashion! Hey you, the dance! Squat. leap. Hips to the left.

       Some fools once were listening to a poet reading his poem. It so happened that the words of the thing spoke of gross matters of the everyday world such as are never much hidden from a quick eye. Out of these semblances, and borrowing certain members from fitting masterpieces of antiquity, the poet began piping up his music, simple fellow, thinking to please his listeners. But they getting the whole matter sadly muddled in their minds made such a confused business of listening that not only were they not pleased at the poet's exertions but no sooner had he done than they burst out against him with violent imprecations.

       It's all one. Richard worked years to conquer the descending cadence, idiotic sentimentalist. Ha, for happiness! This tore the dress in ribbons from her maid's back and not spared the nails either; wild anger spit from her pinched eyes! This is the better part. Or a child under a table to be dragged out coughing and biting, eyes glittering evilly. I'll have it my way! Nothing is any pleasure but misery and brokenness. THIS is the only up-cadence. This is where the secret rolls over and opens its eyes. Bitter words spoken to a child ripple in morning light! Boredom from a bedroom doorway thrills with anticipation! The complaints of an old man dying piecemeal are starling chirrups. Coughs go singing on springtime paths across a field; corruption picks strawberries and slow warping of the mind, blacking the deadly walls--counted and recounted--rolls in the grass and shouts ecstatically. All is solved! The moaning and dull sobbing of infants sets blood tingling and eyes ablaze to listen. Speed sings in the heels at long nights tossing on coarse sheets with bruning sockets staring into the black. Dance! Sing! Coil and uncoil! Whip yourselves about! Shout the deliverance! An old woman has infected her blossomy grand-daughter with a blood illness that every two weeks drives the mother into hidden songs of agony, the pad-footed mirage of creeping death for music. The face muscles keep pace. Then a darting about the compass in a tarantelle that wears flesh from bones. Here is dancing! The mind in tatters. And so the music wistfully takes the lead. Ay de m, Juana la Loca, reina de Espaa, esa est tu canta, reina ma!

       When beldams dig clams their fat hams (it's always beldams) balanced near Tellus's hide, this rhinoceros pelt, these lumped stone--buffoonery of midges on a bull's thigh--invoke,--what you will: birth's glut, awe at God's craft, youth's poverty, evolution of a child's caper, man's poor inconsequence. Eclipse of all things; sun's self turned hen's rump.        Cross a knife and fork and listen to the church bells! It is the harvest moon's made wine of our blood. Up over the dark factory into the blue glare start the young poplars. They whisper: It is Sunday! It is Sunday! But the laws of the country have been stripped bare of leaves. Out over the marshes flickers our laughter. A lewd anecdote's the chase. On through the vapory heather! And there at banter's edge the city looks at us sidelong with great eyes--lifts to its lips heavenly milk! Lucina, O Lucina! beneficent cow, how have we offended thee?

What the Bones Know 
 

Remembering the past
 And gloating at it now,
 I know the frozen brow
 And shaking sides of lust
 Will dog me at my death
 To catch my ghostly breath.
  
           I think that Yeats was right,
           That lust and love are one.
           The body of this night 
           May beggar me to death,
           But we are not undone
           Who love with all our breath.
  
                      I know that Proust was wrong,
                      His wheeze: love, to survive,
                      Needs jealousy, and death
                      And lust, to make it strong
                      Or goose it back alive.
                      Proust took away my breath.
  
                                  The later Yeats was right
                                  To think of sex and death
                                  And nothing else. Why wait
                                  Till we are turning old?
                                  My thoughts are hot and cold.
                                  I do not waste my breath.
 






Where I've Been All My Life
 

I.
  
 Sirs, in our youth you love the sight of us.
 Older, you fall in love with what we've seen,
 Would lose yourselves by living in our lives.
 I'll spin you tales, play the Arabian girl;
 Working close, alone in the blond arena,
 Flourish my cape, the cloth on the camera.
 For women learn to be a holy show.
  
 I'll tell you where I've been, not what I am:
 In Rotterdam, womb where my people sprang,
 I find my face, my father, everywhere.
 New cousins I must stoop to greet, the get
 Of tall, whey-colored burghers, sturdy dams,
 As children fed on tulip bulbs and dirt,
 Tugged at dry dugs and sucked at winter's rind.
  
 My cousins, dwarfed by war! Your forms rebuke
 The butcher and the bystander alike.
 To ease you I can't shrink this big Dutch frame
 Got of more comfortable ancestors.
 But from my Southern side I pluck a phrase,
 "I'll carry you. And it means "rest in me,
 To hold you as I may, in my mind's womb.
  
 But snap the album, get the guidebook out!
 Rotterdam: her raw, gray waterfront,
 Zadkine's memorial burning on the quay;
 This bronze is mortal, gaping in defeat,
 The form that wombed it split to let it be.
 It mends; he lurches up, in blood reborn,
 The empty heavens his eternal frame.
  
  
           II.
  
 Move to my room beside the Golden Horn
 Where minarets strike fire against the sky.
 The architecture: breasts and phalluses.
 Where are the words to say that words are lies?
 Yeats lied. And here Byzantium lies dead.
 Constantinople? Syllables in a text.
 Istanbul. Real. Embalmed in dancing dust.
  
 Everywhere the dark-brown past gives way
 To the beige of progress, that wide vacant lot.
 Turkey without coffee! Endlessly we sip tea
 From bud vases, and I lust for the guide,
 A sultry, serious, pedantic boy
 In a tight brown suit, thirsting to get out
 Of the triple city weighing on his mind.
  
 Oh, he was doomed, doomed like the dogs
 On Dog Island, in the sea,
 Netted and dumped and exiled, left to die,
 Then skinned. We heard imaginary canine howls,
 Like the rustlings of a thousand gauzy girls,
 Film-eyed cattle, perishing of ennui
 In abandoned harems where he guided me.
  
 Meanwhile the Faithful, prostrate and intoning,
 Stare into the light as blind as death,
 Knowing for sure their end is instant Heaven.
 We Infidels concede them Paradise,
 Having seen heaven-as-harem, a eunuch God
 In charge: the virgin slowly fattening to blubber.
 Love, become feminized, tickles like a feather.
  
 The saints of Art? Sophia, that vast barn
 Holds no small Savior waiting to get born.
 The formal scribble on the assaulted walls--
 Five hundred years of crossing out His name!
 Some famous, glittering pebbles mark the place
 As God's most grandiose sarcophagus.
 Decay, decay. And the mind, a fetus, dies.
  
  
           III.
  
 Return me to the airfield near Shanghai
 Where I am very young: shy, apprehensive,
 Seated like Sheba on a baggage mountain
 Waiting for the first adventure to begin.
 The train will glide through fields of rice and men,
 Bodies like thongs, and glorious genitals,
 Not alien as Chinese, but Adam-strange.
  
 Rejoiced by her first look at naked men,
 Her soul swims out the window of the train!
 She goes where newborn daughters clog the creeks;
 Bank-porticoes are strewn with starving rags.
 Here the old dragon, China, thrashes, dying.
 But the ancient, virile music of the race
 Is rising, drenched in gongs and howls of dogs
  
 Islanded, the sighs of walled-up women
 Dreaming of peasants in their prisoning fields
 But we break out of the harem of history!
 No longer that young foreigner on the train,
 I listen like a bird, although I ruminate
 Like a cow, in my pale Holland body, riven
 By love and children. These eyes are what they see.
  
 Come die with me in the mosques of Rotterdam.







October 1973
 

Last night I dreamed I ran through the streets of New York
 Looking for help for you, Nicanor.
 But my few friends who are rich or influential
 were temporarily absent from their penthouses or hotel suites.
 They had gone to the opera, or flown for the weekend to Bermuda.
 At last I found one or two of them at home,
 preparing for social engagements,
 absently smiling, as they tried on gown after gown
 until heaps of rich, beautiful fabric were strewn
 over the chairs and sofas. They posed before mirrors,
 with their diamonds and trinkets and floor-length furs.
 Smiling at me from the mirror, they vaguely promised help.
 They became distracted--by constantly ringing phones,
 by obsequious secretaries, bustling in with packages,
 flowers, messages, all the paraphernalia,
 all part of the uninterruptible rounds of the rich,
 the nice rich, smiling soothingly, as they touched their hair
 or picked up their phone extensions.
 Absently patting my arm, they smiled, "It will be all right.
  
 Dusk fell on the city as I ran, naked, weeping, into the streets.
 I ran to the home of Barbara, my friend,
 Who, as a young girl, rescued four Loyalist soldiers
 from a Spanish prison;
 in her teenage sweater set and saddle shoes and knee socks,
 she drove an old car sagging with Loyalist pamphlets
 across the Pyrenees all the way to Paris without being caught.
 And not long ago, she helped save a group of men
 from Franco's sentence of death.
  
 In my dream, Barbara telephones Barcelona.
 I realize this isn't quite right, 
 but I just stand there paralyzed, as one does in dreams.
 Then, dimly, from the other end of the line,
 through the chatter of international operators,
 we hear artillery fire, the faint tones of lost men,
 cracked voices singing, "Los Quartros Generales through the pulsations
 of the great, twisted cable under the ocean.
 Agona, agona, sueo, fermente & sueo.
 Este es el mundo, amigo, agona, agona.
  
 "No, Barbara! I scream. "We are not back there.
 That's the old revolution. Call up the new one.
 Though I know that, every day,
 your friends, Nicanor, telephone Santiago,
 where the number rings and rings and rings
 with never an answer. And now the rings
 are turning into knells:
  
 The church bells of Santiago
 tolling the funeral of Neruda, his poems looted,
 his autobiography stolen, his books desecrated
 in his house on Isla Negra.
 And among the smashed glass, the broken furniture,
 his desk overturned, the ruined books strewn over the floor,
 lie the great floral wreaths from the Swedish academy,
 the wreaths from Paris, South Asia, the whole world over.
 And the bells toll on
 Then I tell Barbara to hang up the phone.
  
 She dials the number again, then turns to me, smiling,
 smiling like an angel:
 "He is there. Trembling, I take the phone from her,
 and hear your voice, Nicanor,
 sad, humorous, infinitely disillusioned,
 infinitely consoling:
 "Dear Carolyn It is Nicanor!
 And the connection is broken, because I wake up,
 in this white room, in this white silence,
                    in this backwater of silence
 on this Isla Blanca:
                    Nicanor, Nicanor,
 are you, too, silent under the earth,
                    Brother, Brother?






Ingathering
 

The poets are going home now,
 After the years of exile,
 After the northern climates
 Where they worked, lectured, remembered,
 Where they shivered at night
 In an indifferent world.
 Where God was the god of business,
 And men would violate the poets' moon,
 And even the heavens become zones of war.
  
 The poets are going home
 To the blood-haunted villages,
 To the crumbling walls, still pocked
 With a spray of bullets;
 To the ravine, marked with a new cross,
 Where their brother died.
 No one knows the precise spot where they shot him,
 But there is a place now to gather, to lay wreaths.
 The poets will bring flowers.
  
 The poets are coming home
 To the cafs, to the life of the streets at twilight,
 To slip among the crowds and greet their friends;
 Thee young poets, old now, limping, who lean on a cane:
 Or the arm of a grandchild, peer with opaque eyes
 At the frightening city, the steel and concrete towers
 Sprung up in their absence.
 Yet from open doorways comes the odor of grapes
 Fermented, of fish, of oil, of pimiento
  
 The poets have come home
 To the melodious language
 That settles in their heads like moths alighting,
 This language for which they starved
 In a world of gutturals,
 Crude monosyllables barked by strangers.
 Now their own language enfolds them
 With its warm vocables.
 The poets are home.
  
 Yes, they have come back
 To look up at the yellow moon,
 Cousin of that cold orb that only reflected
 Their isolation.
 They have returned to the olives, the light,
 The sage-scented meadows,
 The whitewashed steps, the tubs of geraniums,
 The sere plains, the riverbanks spread with laundry,
 The poppies, the vineyards, the bones of mountains.
  
 Yes, poets, welcome home
 To your small country
 Riven by its little war
 (As the world measures these events),
 A country that remembers heroes and tears;
 Where, in your absence, souls kept themselves alive
 By whispering your words.
 Now you smile at everything, even the priests, the militia,
 The patient earth that is waiting to receive you.







Symphony No.3, in D Minor
 

Thousands lavishing, thousands starving;        intrigues, war, flatteries, envyings,      hypocrisies, lying vanities, hollow amusements,         exhaustion, dissipation, death--and giddiness         and laughter, from the first scene to the last.        --Samuel Palmer, 1858

                II. What the Flowers in the Meadow Tell Me
  
  
                June 6, 1857, Thoreau in his Journal:
  
                A year is made up of a certain series
                and number of sensations and thoughts
                which have their language in nature
  
                Now I am ice, now
                I am sorrel.
  
                
                Or, Clare, 1840, Epping Forest:
  
                I found the poems in the fields
                And only wrote them down
  
                and
  
                The book I love is everywhere
                And not in idle words
  
                John, claritas tell us the words are not idle,
                the syllables are able 
                to turn plantains into quatrains,
               tune raceme to cyme, panicle and umbel to
               form corollas in light clusters of tones
  
                Sam Palmer hit it:
                "Milton, by one epithet
                draws an oak of the largest girth I ever saw,
                Pine and monumental oak':
                I have just been trying to draw a large one in 
                Lullingstone; but the poet's tree is huger than
                any in the park.
  
                Muse in a meadow, compose in
                a mind!

                Harris's Sparrow--
  
                103 species seen
                by the Georgia Ornithological Society
                in Rabun Gap,
  
                including Harris's Sparrow, with its
                black crown, face, and bib encircling
                a pink bill
  
  
                It was, I think, the third sighting
                in Georgia, and I should have been there
                instead of reading Clare, listening to
                catbirds and worrying about
                Turdus migratorious that flew
                directly into the Volkswagen and
                bounced into a ditch
  
  
                Friend Robin, I cannot figure it, if I'd
                been going 40 you might be
                whistling in some grass.
  
                10 tepid people got 10 stale letters
                one day earlier, 
                I cannot be happy
                about that.

                and the hop flowers
                open before the sun's
                beckoning
  
  
                the end
                is ripeness, the wind
                rises,
                and the dawn says
                yes

                VI. What Love Tells Me
  
  
  
                Anton Bruckner counts the 877th leaf
                on a linden tree in the countryside near Wien
                and prays:
  
                Dear God, Sweet Jesus,
                Save Us, Save Us
  
                the Light in the Grass,
                the Wind on the Hill,
  
                are in my head,
                the world cannot be heard
  
  
                Leaves obliterate
                my  heart,
  
                we touch each other
                far apart
  
  
                Let us count 
                into 
                the Darkness
  
  
  






The Midnite Show
 

Red-Wigglers, Night-Crawlers
 & Other Worms
 look out
 into the crapulous moonlight:
  
 figures of women cascading through the Sunday night;
  
 no beer in sight.
  
 I remember the Night-blooming
 Cereus by Dr. Thornton, Engraver, Blake's
 patron, it
 hangs in the hall outside the bedroom
 swaying hungrily like these
 giant white goddesses of the dark grotto
  
 there are touring cars
 and men with large guns
 singing through the woods
  
 behind us.
  







Two Pastorals for Samuel Palmer at Shoreham, Kent 
 

I. "If the Night Could Get Up & Walk
  
         I cannot put my hand into
         a cabbage to turn 
         on the light, but
  
         the moon moves over
         the field of dark cabbage and an
         exchange fills 
         all veins.
  
         The cabbage is also a globe
         of light, the two globes
  
         now two eyes in 
         my saturated 
  
         head!
  
  
         II. "One Must Try Behind the Hills
  
  
         Eight Great Dahlias stood
         beyond the Mountains.
  
         They set fire to the Sun
         in a black wood
         beyond the Mountains,
  
         in the Valley of Vision

        In the Valley of Vision
  
         the Fission of
         Flowers
  
         yields all Power
         in the Valley of Vision.
  
         Eight Suns
         on Eight Stems,
  
         aflame!

       





A Vulnerary 
 

for Robert Duncan 
one comes to language from afar, the ear
 fears for its sound-barriers--
  
 but one "comes; the language "comes for
 The Beckoning Fair One
  
 plant you now, dig you
 later, the plaint stirs winter
 earth
  
 air in a hornet's nest
 over the water makes a
 solid, six-sided music
  
 a few utterly quiet scenes, things
 are very far away--"form
 is emptiness
  
 comely, comely, love trembles
  
 and the sweet-shrub
 






On Cowee Ridge
 

 December 13, 1993 
John Gordon Boyd
 died on the birthday
 of three remarkable, and remarkably different, writers:
 Heinrich Heine, Kenneth Patchen, Ross McDonald
  
 John, too, was just as remarkable, blessed with an inherent "graciousness
 and with extraordinary eyes & ears
  
  
 I think of two texts
 on the grievous occasion of his death:
  
 "Religion does not help me.
 The faith that others give to what is unseen,
 I give to what I can touch, and look at.
 My Gods dwell in temples
 made with hands.
  -- Oscar Wilde, in De Profundis
  
  
 and two lines in Rainier Maria Rilke,
 John's favorite poet,
 that say it all
  
 Was tun Sie, Gott,
 Wenn ich bin strbe?
  
 "What will you do, 
 God, when I am dead?
 






The Wreck on the A-222 in Ravensbourne Valley
 

There are more things to love                               than we would dare to hope for.                              --Richard of St. Victor 
where the car hit him, fireweed sprang with
 blazons of fennel
  
 and umbels
 of dill fell
 through the spokes of a wheel
  
 on Whistun holiday to the sun, Denton
 Welch spun a web in his crushed cycle,
  
 sat in the seat, spine curled up like a spider--
  
 and spied: "saw
                  the very drops of sweat glittering frostily
                  between the shoulder blades
  
                  of a lad
  
 on and on he spied and bled from the blades of his cycle,
 small as a spider,
 hiding in the fireweed, getting
 wet from the skins of many human suns aground
 at the Kentish river near
 Tunbridge Wells,
  
 where the dill 
 lulls,
  
 and all boys
 spoil

poem in praise of menstruation
 

if there is a river
 more beautiful than this
 bright as the blood
 red edge of the moon          if
  
 there is a river
 more faithful than this
 returning each month
 to the same delta          if there
  
 is a river
 braver than this
 coming and coming in a surge
 of passion, of pain          if there is
  
 a river 
 more ancient than this
 daughter of eve
 mother of cain and of abel          if there is in
  
 the universe such a river          if
 there is some where water
 more powerful than this wild
 water
 pray that it flows also
 through animals
 beautiful and faithful and ancient
 and female and brave

 





my dream about time
 

a woman unlike myself is running
 down the long hall of a lifeless house
 with too many windows which open on
 a world she has no language for,
 running and running until she reaches
 at last the one and only door
 which she pulls open to find each wall
 is faced with clocks and as she watches
 all of the clocks strike
                                              NO
 
 






I Am Learning To Abandon the World
 

I am learning to abandon the world 
before it can abandon me. 
Already I have given up the moon 
and snow, closing my shades 
against the claims of white. 
And the world has taken 
my father, my friends. 
I have given up melodic lines of hills, 
moving to a flat, tuneless landscape. 
And every night I give my body up 
limb by limb, working upwards 
across bone, towards the heart. 
But morning comes with small 
reprieves of coffee and birdsong. 
A tree outside the window 
which was simply shadow moments ago 
takes back its branches twig 
by leafy twig. 
And as I take my body back 
the sun lays its warm muzzle on my lap 
as if to make amends.





john
 

somebody coming in blackness
 like a star
 and the world be a great bush
 on his head
 and his eyes be fire
 in the city
 and his mouth be true as time
  
 he be calling the people brother
 even in the prison
 even in the jail
  
 i'm just only a baptist preacher
 somebody bigger than me coming
 in blackness like a star
  






spring song
 

the green of Jesus
 is breaking the ground
 and the sweet
 smell of delicious Jesus
 is opening the house and
 the dance of Jesus music
 has hold of the air and
 the world is turning
 in the body of Jesus and
 the future is possible
 






sisters
 

for elaine philip on her birthday
me and you be sisters.
 we be the same.
 me and you
 coming from the same place.
 me and you
 be greasing our legs
 touching up our edges.
 me and you
 be scared of rats
 be stepping on roaches.
 me and you
 come running high down purdy street one time
 and mama laugh and shake her head at
 me and you.
 me and you
 got babies
 got thirty-five
 got black
 let our hair go back
 be loving ourselves
 be loving ourselves
 be sisters.
 only where you sing
 i poet.






my poem
 

a love person
 from love people
 out of the afrikan sun
 under the sign of cancer.
 whoever see my 
 midnight smile
 seeing star apple and
 mango from home.
 whoever take me for
 a negative thing,
 his death be on him
 like a skin
 and his skin
 be his heart's revenge.

 she got her mama's ways.

 she see the world sideways.
 word foolish
 she say what she don't want
 to say, she don't say
 what she want to.
  
 lucy one-eye
 she won't walk away
 from it.
 she'll keep on trying
 with her crooked look
 and her wrinkled ways,
 the darling girl.

 that reflect odd
 aspects of lucy.

 she would hear

 exotic webs of lucysighs
 long lucy spiders explaining

 if mama

 she would talk

 good girl
 good girl
 clean up your room.

i was born in a hotel,
 a maskmaker.
 my bones were knit by
 a perilous knife.
 my skin turned around
 at midnight and
i entered the earth in
 a woman jar.
 i learned the world all
 wormside up
 and this is my yes
 my strong fingers;
 i was born in a bed of
 good lessons
 and it has made me 
wise.

 light
 on my mother's tongue
 breaks through her soft
 extravagant hip
 into life.
 lucille
 she calls the light,
 which was the name
 of the grandmother
 who waited by the crossroads
 in virginia
 and shot the whiteman off his horse,
 killing the killer of sons.
 light breaks from her life
 to her lives
  
 mine already is 
 an afrikan name.

cutting greens
 

curling them around
i hold their bodies in obscene embrace
 thinking of everything but kinship.
 collards and kale
 strain against each strange other
 away from my kissmaking hand and
 the iron bedpot.
 the pot is black,
the cutting board is black,
 my hand,
 and just for a minute
 the greens roll black under the knife,
 and the kitchen twists dark on its spine
 and I taste in my natural appetite
 the bond of live things everywhere. 






The Book of Non-Writing 
 

There should be a writing of non-writing. Someday it will come.                                              A brief writing, without grammar, a writing of words alone.                                                      Words without supporting grammar. Lost. Written, there.                                                                                                                                           And immediately left behind.                                                                                                                                                                        --Marguerite Duras                                                                                                                                                    (translated by Mark Pollizzotti) 
          It came. Words smashed out of the sky and from the mouths and off the pages and from the flesh and blood of the bodies and the words hit the readers and were destroyed like more bodies and the fields of the nation were littered with bodies and dead. Carcass love, they called it. Carcass economy, they called it. And the readers found the carcasses strewn across the pages and the readers came and stripped their innards and twirled intestines above their heads like lassos. The carcasses fell onto the pages and were taken away in wagons and trucks and they were replaced with new carcasses that were sold for words before the flies laid eggs and the wounds had time to fester. FALSE CARCASS ECONOMY! Will the souls of the carcasses miss themselves when they die? Will the bodies whose lips slurp out the souls of the carcasses miss themselves when they die? Will the words from the bodies who slurp out the souls of the carcasses cease to exist when the bodies themselves die? The readers grovel in the pages and find themselves in ditches with the carcasses but they do not know the rules of the false carcass economy. In this book the readers can feel their feet being removed. In this book the readers can feel the splash of the abattoir blood that sprinkles the page with poems. How do you know if the poems have too many bubbles? That is, how do you know if the blood of the poems has too many bubbles? When we speak of our own lives, says the collective voice of the readers, we certainly don't mean human life. On the page the readers find themselves crawling around like quadrupeds with hands full of grass and earth uprooting plants and trees setting out for home and not getting far counting corpses on the fields to hell with animals there is God grinding his teeth with joy forging his way through the ruins of failing flesh there is the machine that has annihilated the bulk of humanity is it semen or is it a carburetor that makes us unrecognizable we know who we are through decay and in someone else's story this is a lot worse than knocking your own brains out with good results then drinking tea with sugar and milk and suddenly feeling revived then exploding with words and speaking with animals and sinking in mud and being found by peasants who clean turds and who are like silent gods with holes in their shoes it is horrible to eat horrible to bulge in the belly with food horrible to blink when so many can't blink oh to ruminate once more on the air polluted with liability on the hair singed from pollution the eyes burning fingers shrivelling the exact moment of ending will not come for many millennia we will not be able to document it it will document us it's okay to kill some bodies speak of nothing and you're lucky to make friends flank kidney liver swollen body on the sand who are you now that I am speaking with a mouth full of words that do not belong to me I crawl across the page and I don't know if I'm dying or dead.





The Book of Equality
 

          
          Here the readers gather to watch the books die. They die suddenly, as if thrown from an airplane, or from spontaneous cardiac arrest. They live, and then suddenly they die, and the reader who watches this is at the moment of the books' death bombarded with images documented through the smiling lipstick face of a journalist who has shown up to report on the death of the books. The milk was poisoned and forty-two babies died, she laughs, as she fondles the ashes of the dead books. And the death of forty-two babies is equal in value to the death of this book which is equal in value to the ninety-year old woman who shot herself while the sheriff waited at her door with an eviction notice which is equal in value to the collapsing of the global economy which is equal to the military in country XYZ seizing the land of the semi-nomadic hunters and cultivators of crops who have lived in the local rain forest for thousands of years. The reader opens a dead book and finds an infinite amount of burnt ash between the bindings, and when the ash blows in the wind the lipstick says that every death in the world is equal to every other death in the world which is equal to every birth in the world which is equal to every act of dismemberment which is equal to the death of a jungle which is equal to the collapse of the global economy; and hey look there's another lady falling out of a window; she looks about equal to the poet hurled out of his country for words he wrote but which did not belong to him and whose death is about equal to the girl who was shot on the bus on her way to school this morning which is just about the same as the bearded man whose head was shoved into a sac while water was dumped over it and he died for an instant and came back to life and talked and talked and that's about equal to the steroid illegally injected into the arm of a beautiful man who makes forty million dollars a year for injecting his arms with steroids so he can more skillfully wave a wooden stick at a ball, and in the ash we see the truest democracy there ever was: hey look it's a little baby found in a dumpster how equal you are says the smiling lipstick to the civilized nation whose citizens walk the flooded streets looking for their homes, and in the ashes of the dead book the dead streets are equal to the eating disorders of movie stars which are equal to the dead soldiers who are equal to the homeruns which are equal to the bomb dropped by country ABC over weddings in the village of country XYZ which is equal to the earth swallowing up and devouring all of its foreigners which is just about equal to the decline in literacy in the most educated nation in the planet. There is no end to this book. There are no paragraph breaks to interrupt the smiling lipstick that goes on and on in one string of ashy words about how the declaration of peace is equal to the resumption of war and how the bodies that fall are equal to the birds that ascend and how the bomb in the Eiffel Tower is equal to the rising cost of natural gas, and the murmurs of the voices in the mud are equal to the murmurs of the expensive suits falling out of buildings and these are equal to the silence that kills with one breath and coddles life with another.





Waterlily Fire
 

for Richard Griffith 
1  THE BURNING
  
 Girl grown woman     fire     mother of fire
 I go to the stone street turning to fire.     Voices
 Go screaming     Fire     to the green glass wall.
 And there where my youth flies blazing into fire
 The     dance     of sane and insane images, noon
 Of seasons and days.     Noontime of my one hour.
  
 Saw down the bright noon street the crooked faces
 Among the tall daylight in the city of change.
 The scene has walls     stone     glass     all my gone life
 One wall a web through which the moment walks
 And I am open, and the opened hour
 The world as water-garden     lying behind it.
 In a city of stone, necessity of fountains,
 Forces water fallen on glass, men with their axes.
  
 An arm of flame reaches from water-green glass,
 Behind the wall I know waterlilies
 Drinking their light, transforming light and our eyes
 Skythrown under water, clouds under those flowers,
 Walls standing on all things stand in a city noon
 Who will not believe a waterlily fire.
 Whatever can happen in a city of stone,
 Whatever can come to a wall can come to this wall.
  
 I walk in the river of crisis toward the real,
 I pass guards, finding the center of my fear
 And you, Dick, endlessly my friend during storm.
  
 The arm of flame striking through the wall of form.
  
  
 2  THE ISLAND
  
 Born of this river and this rock island, I relate
 The changes : I born when the whirling snow
 Rained past the general's grave and the amiable child
 White past the windows of the house of Gyp the Blood.
 General, gangster, child.     I know in myself the island.
  
 I was the island without bridges, the child down whose blazing
 Eye the men of plumes and bone raced their canoes and fire
 Among the building of my young childhood, houses;
 I was those changes, the live darknesses
 Of wood, the pale grain of a grove in the fields 
 Over the river fronting red cliffs across--
 And always surrounding her the river, birdcries, the wild
 Father building his sand, the mother in panic her parks--
 Bridges were thrown across, the girl arose
 From sleeping streams of change in the change city.
 The violent forgetting, the naked sides of darkness.
 Fountain of a city in growth, and island of light and water.
 Snow striking up past the graves, the yellow cry of spring.
  
 Whatever can come to a city can come to this city.
 Under the tall compulsion
                                                    of the past
 I see the city
                           change like a man changing
 I love this man 
                                with my lifelong body of love
 I know you
                         among your changes
                                                                   wherever I go
 Hearing the sounds of building
                                                           the syllables of wrecking
 A young girl watching
                                               the man throwing red hot rivets
 Coals in a bucket of change
 How can you love a city that will not stay?
 I love you
                        like a man of life in change.
  
 Leaves like yesterday shed, the yellow of green spring
 Like today accepted and become one's self
 I go, I am a city with bridges and tunnels,
 Rock, cloud, ships, voices.     To the man where the river met
 The tracks, now buried deep along the Drive
 Where blossoms like sex pink, dense pink, rose, pink, red.
  
 Towers falling.     A dream of towers.
 Necessity of fountains.     And my poor,
 Stirring among our dreams, 
 Poor of my own spirit, and tribes, hope of towers
 And lives, looking out through my eyes.
 The city the growing body of our hate and love.
 The root of the soul, and war in its black doorways.
 A male sustained cry interrupting nightmare.
 Male flower heading upstream.
  
 Among a city of light, the stone that grows.
 Stigma of dead stone, inert water, the tattered
 Monuments rivetted against flesh.
 Blue noon where the wall made big agonized men
 Stand like sailors pinned howling on their lines, and I
 See stopped in time a crime behind green glass,
 Lilies of all my life on fire.
 Flash faith in a city building its fantasies.
  
 I walk past the guards into my city of change.
  
  
 3  JOURNEY CHANGES
  
 Many of us     Each in his own life waiting
 Waiting to move     Beginning to move     Walking
 And early on the road of the hill of the world
 Come to my landscapes emerging on the grass
  
 The stages of the theatre of the journey
  
 I see the time of willingness between plays
 Waiting and walking and the play of the body
 Silver body with its bosses and places
 One by one touched awakened into into
  
 Touched and turned one by one into     flame
  
 The theatre of the advancing goddess     Blossoming
 Smiles as she stands intensely being in stillness
 Slowness in her blue dress advancing standing I go 
 And far across a field over the jewel grass
  
 The play of the family stroke by stroke acted out
  
 Gestures of deep acknowledging on the journey stages
 Of the playings the play of the goddess and the god
 A supple god of searching and reaching
 Who weaves his strength     Who dances her more alive
  
 The theatre of all animals, my snakes, my great horses
  
 Always the journey     long     patient     many haltings
 Many waitings for choice and again easy breathing
 When the decision to go on is made
 Along the long slopes of choice and again the world
  
 The play of poetry approaching in its solving
  
 Solvings of relations in poems and silences
 For we were born to express     born for a journey
 Caves, theatres, the companioned solitary way
 And then I came to the place of mournful labor
  
 A turn in the road and the long sight from the cliff
  
 Over the scene of the land dug away to nothing and many
 Seen to a stripped horizon carrying barrows of earth
 A hod of earth taken and emptied and thrown away
 Repeated farther than sight.     The voice saying slowly
  
 But it is hell.     I heard my own voice in the words
 Or it could be a foundation     And after the words
 My chance came.     To enter.     The theatres of the world.
  
  
 4  FRAGILE
  
 I think of the image brought into my room
 Of the sage and the thin young man who flickers and asks.
 He is asking about the moment when the Buddha
 Offers the lotus, a flower held out as declaration.
 "Isn't that fragile? he asks.     The sage answers:
 "I speak to you.     You speak to me.     Is that fragile?
  
  
 5  THE LONG BODY
  
 This journey is exploring us. Where the child stood
 An island in a river of crisis, now
 The bridges bind us in symbol, the sea
 Is a bond, the sky reaches into our bodies.
 We pray : we dive into each other's eyes.
  
 Whatever can come to a woman can come to me.
  
 This is the long body : into life from the beginning,
 Big-headed infant unfolding into child, who stretches and finds
 And then flowing the young one going tall, sunward,
 And now full-grown, held, tense, setting feet to the ground,
 Going as we go in the changes of the body,
 As it is changes, in the long strip of our many
 Shapes, as we range shifting through time.
 The long body : a procession of images.
  
 This moment in a city, in its dream of war.
                                               We chose to be, 
 Becoming the only ones under the trees
                                                                             when the harsh sound
 Of the machine sirens spoke. There were these two men,
 And the bearded one, the boys, the Negro mother feeding
 Her baby. And threats, the ambulance with open doors.
 Now silence. Everyone else within the walls. We sang.
                                We are the living island,
 We the flesh of this island, being lived,
 Whoever knows us is part of us today.
  
 Whatever can happen to anyone can happen to me.
  
 Fire striking its word among us, waterlilies
 Reaching from darkness upward to a sun
 Of rebirth, the implacable.     And in our myth
 The Changing Woman who is still and who offers.
  
 Eyes drinking light, transforming light, this day
 That struggles with itself, brings itself to birth.
 In ways of being, through silence, sources of light
 Arriving behind my eye, a dialogue of light.
  
 And everything a witness of the buried life.
 This moment flowing across the sun, this force
 Of flowers and voices body in body through space.
 The city of endless cycles of the sun.
  
 I speak to you     You speak to me
  
  






The Speaking Tree
 

     for Robert Payne 
Great Alexander sailing was from his true course turned
 By a young wind from a cloud in Asia moving
 Like a most recognizable most silvery woman;
 Tall Alexander to the island came.
 The small breeze blew behind his turning head.
 He walked the foam of ripples into this scene.
  
 The trunk of the speaking tree looks like a tree-trunk
 Until you look again.     Then people and animals
 Are ripening on the branches;     the broad leaves
 Are leaves;     pale horses, sharp fine foxes
 Blossom;     the red rabbit falls
 Ready and running.     The trunk coils, turns,
 Snakes, fishes.     Now the ripe people fall and run,
 Three of them in their shore-dance, flames that stand
 Where reeds are creatures and the foam is flame.
  
 Stiff Alexander stands.     He cannot turn.
 But he is free to turn : this is the speaking tree,
 It calls your name.     It tells us what we mean.
 





Akiba
 

THE WAY OUT
  
 The night is covered with signs. The body and face of man,
 with signs, and his journeys.     Where the rock is split
 and speaks to the water;     the flame speaks to the cloud;
 the red splatter, abstraction, on the door
 speaks to the angel and the constellations.
 The grains of sand on the sea-floor speak at last to the noon.
 And the loud hammering of the land behind
 speaks ringing up the bones of our thighs, the hoofs,
 we hear the hoofs over the seethe of the sea.
  
 All night down the centuries, have heard, music of passage.
  
 Music of one child carried into the desert;
 firstborn forbidden by law of the pyramid.
 Drawn through the water with the water-drawn people
 led by the water-drawn man to the smoke mountain.
 The voice of the world speaking, the world covered by signs,
 the burning, the loving, the speaking, the opening.
 Strong throat of sound from the smoking mountain.
 Still flame, the spoken singing of a young child.
 The meaning beginning to move, which is the song.
  
 Music of those who have walked out of slavery.
  
 Into that journey where all things speak to all things
 refusing to accept the curse, and taking
 for signs the signs of all things, the world, the body
 which is part of the soul, and speaks to the world,
 all creation being created in one image, creation.
 This is not the past walking into the future,
 the walk is painful, into the present, the dance
 not visible as dance until much later.
 These dancers are discoverers of God.
  
 We knew we had all crossed over when we heard the song.
  
 Out of a life of building lack on lack:
 the slaves refusing slavery, escaping into faith:
 an army who came to the ocean: the walkers
 who walked through the opposites, from I to opened Thou,
 city and cleave of the sea. Those at flaming Nauvoo,
 the ice on the great river: the escaping Negroes,
 swamp and wild city: the shivering children of Paris
 and the glass black hearses; those on the Long March:
 all those who together are the frontier, forehead of man.
  
 Where the wilderness enters, the world, the song of the world.
  
 Akiba rescued, secretly, in the clothes of death
 by his disciples carried from Jerusalem
 in blackness journeying to find his journey
 to whatever he was loving with his life.
 The wilderness journey through which we move
 under the whirlwind truth into the new,
 the only accurate. A cluster of lights at night:
 faces before the pillar of fire. A child watching
 while the sea breaks open. This night. The way in.
  
 Barbarian music, a new song.
  
 Acknowledging opened water, possibility:
 open like a woman to this meaning.
 In a time of building statues of the stars,
 valuing certain partial ferocious skills
 while past us the chill and immense wilderness
 spreads its one-color wings until we know
 rock, water, flame, cloud, or the floor of the sea,
 the world is a sign, a way of speaking. To find.
 What shall we find? Energies, rhythms, journey.
  
 Ways to discover. The song of the way in.
 






[Murmurs from the earth of this land]
 

Murmurs from the earth of this land, from the caves and craters,
        from the bowl of darkness. Down watercourses of our 
        dragon childhood, where we ran barefoot.
 We stand as growing women and men. Murmurs come down
         where water has not run for sixty years.
 Murmurs from the tulip tree and the catalpa, from the ax of
         the stars, from the house on fire, ringing of glass; from
         the abandoned iron-black mill.
 Stars with voices crying like mountain lions over forgotten
         colors.
 Blue directions and a horizon, milky around the cities where the 
         murmurs are deep enough to penetrate deep rock.
 Trapping the lightning-bird, trapping the red central roots.
 You know the murmurs. They come from your own throat.
 You are the bridges to the city and the blazing food-plant green;
 The sun of plants speaks in your voice, and the infinite shells of 
         accretions
 A beach of dream before the smoking mirror.
 You are close to that surf, and the leaves heated by noon, and
         the star-ax, the miner's glitter walls. The crests of the sea
 Are the same strength you wake with, the darkness is the eyes
         of children forming for a blaze of sight and soon, soon,
 Everywhere, you own silence, who drink from the crater, the 
         nebula, one another, the changes of the soul.
 





Night Feeding
 

Deeper than sleep but not so deep as death
 I lay there dreaming and my magic head
 remembered and forgot. On first cry I
 remembered and forgot and did believe.
 I knew love and I knew evil:
 woke to the burning song and the tree burning blind,
 despair of our days and the calm milk-giver who
 knows sleep, knows growth, the sex of fire and grass,
 renewal of all waters and the time of the stars
 and the black snake with gold bones.
  
 Black sleeps, gold burns; on second cry I woke
 fully and gave to feed and fed on feeding.
 Gold seed, green pain, my wizards in the earth
 walked through the house, black in the morning dark.
 Shadows grew in my veins, my bright belief,
my head of dreams deeper than night and sleep.
 Voices of all black animals crying to drink,
 cries of all birth arise, simple as we,
 found in the leaves, in clouds and dark, in dream,
 deep as this hour, ready again to sleep.
  






Song at Drumholm
 

My liveliest self, I give you fair leave
 in these windblown weathers,
 heather-hearted and human and strange,
 to turn every blackberry corner
 of yesterday's summer.
  
 The robin, singing her love-me-forever,
 kiss-catch-clutch-in the heather
 blues, sings tide flow
 and autumn's turning and white
 winds folding.
  
 Cattle along all hedges wind winter
 into their frosty
 breathing, their slow eyes dreaming
 barn, bullock, and fodder
 under all hedges.
  
 But sea cave and sycamore tell us the world
 is wider than weather.
 Blackberries darken the corners
 I turn, and gold seas turning
 darken, darken.
  
 My liveliest self, my other, Godspeed
 on our farings.
 The bronze path at evening.            Toward summer,
 then.                        My hand, your hand--
 as if first meeting.






Midwinter
 

At dusk, a great flare of winter lightning photographed the bay:
 Waves were broken scrolls.          Beyond Donegal, white mountains
 hung in a narrow bas-relief frozen on sky.
  
                                                                             Later, there was sleet: trees down
 on the Drumholm road; near Timoney's farm, a frantic goose
 pinned under branches.
  
                                         All night long, we spoke of loneliness,
 long winter, while winter sang in the chimneys.
  
 Then the sky cleared and a marvel began: The hills turned blue;
 in the valley a blue cottage sent up the day's first plume of smoke.
 It gathered like a dream drenched in frost.
  
 That should have been all.                           We had worn out night.
  
 But single-file,  deliberate,  five heifers,  a black bull,  three calves stepped  through the
                                                                                                                                     broken fence.
 They arranged themselves between the house and hedge: a kind of diagram:
 a shifting pattern grazing frozen weeds.
  
 Their image is with me still.               The backs of the cattle are patchy with frost blue as
                                                                                                                                      morning.






[The giant takes us]
 

The giant takes us
 down. A man with no arms.
 Unbreakable.
  
 What made today
 is concordant,
 transforms
 the brief decisive phase we call fear.
  
 I look to that whited-over part and see a face.
 Then I look to the black and
 see the same face.
  
 There were tunnelschambers
 beneath some of the sidewalkspage after page of places
  
 The last thing you think of.
 Won't be my fluffy blonde hair.
  
 We have his ear.
 He was the first boy I knew. The liberation.
 Which I remember
 from sand. The pail shape. The whole world's washed out.
  
 These words: take refuge.
 What I mean by dream in this case is
 his last dream.
 And you see no land, you're that far away.
  
 Someone coughs
 in my first life.
 Someone must have noticed
 how like you he is
  
 First you can't be heard
 Then you can't hear
 Then you can't dial
 Then you can't turn it off
  
 You pose a question, I repeat it.
 And as always with speech, one is blind. 
  
 As a reflector, as of cloth or
 thick flecked glass, as slats--
 You asked though
  
 about the self.
 There were fireflies,
 and the corn cut to the nubs. The windows
 shook, we saw a flash of light
  
 then the tiniest 
 feckles
 of rain
  
 after we waited
 all day.






7 December
 

          
          Men are trading their bullets for worms. "I spent a lifetime building.   We come down from the mountains. We brought eggs, a table, a windowshade. There were times when we couldn't bring anything. So many people.   As you were walking up the hill and I was walking down, we almost passed each other. But I grasped your arm and backed up. You said: "This is what I look like now.





13 December
 

          
          She considers a field. She considers a field and buys it. Let her have the fruit of her hands.   We come down from the mountains. Yellow trees, green trees. I was leaving Earth but, before I did, I had to get rid of all my animals. My main one, my main model for behavior, was my snake. He was attached to the bottom of my foot but had become dangerous seeming and I was afraid he would bite me if he got the chance. My sister was there and I said, "Before I leave, I have to get rid of all my animals, thinking maybe she'd help me. I said, "My horse, my frog, my snake but didn't mention I was worried about how to dislodge my snake safely. As I was waking up, I thought of going to a place where they could give the snake a shot to knock it out or even kill it before they tried to get it off my foot. Which seemed like a pretty good idea, though inconvenient.





You've Ruined My Evening/You've Ruined My Life
 

i would be eight people and then the difficulties vanish
 only as one i contain the complications 
 in a warm house roofed with the rib-cage of an elephant
 i pass my grey mornings re-running the reels
 and the images are the same but the emphasis shifts
 the actors bow gently to me and i envy them
 their repeated parts, their constant presence in that world

i would be eight people each inhabiting the others' dreams
 walking through corridors of glass framed pages
 telling each other the final lines of letters
 picking fruit in one dream and storing it in another
 only as one i contain the complications
 and the images are the same, their constant presence in that world
 the actors bow gently to me and envy my grey mornings
  
 i would be eight people with the rib-cage of an elephant
 picking fruit in a warm house above actors bowing
 re-running the reels of my presence in this world
 the difficulties vanish and the images are the same
 eight people, glass corridors, page lines repeated
 inhabiting grey mornings roofed with my complications
 only as one walking gently storing my dream






The University of Essex
 

(for John Barrell) 
1. gone to lunch back in five minutes
  
 night closed in on my letter of resignation
 out in the square one of my threads had broken loose
 the language i used was no and no
 while the yellow still came through, the hammer and the drills
  
 occasionally the metabolism alters
 and lines no longer come express
 waiting for you what muscles work me
 which hold me down below my head?
  
 it is a long coat and a van on the horizon
 a bird that vanishes    the arabic
 i learn from observation is how to break the line
  
 (genius creates surprises : the metropolitan
 police band singing bless this house'
  
 as the filmed extractor fans inflate the house with steam
  
  
 2. walking my back home
  
 the wind
 is the wind
 is a no-vo-cain band
  
 and the footstep
                           echoes
  
 i 
 have conjured people 
  
  
 3. ah, it all falls into place
  
 when it was time what he had left became a tile
 bodies held shaped by the pressure of air
 were clipped to his attention by their gestures
  
 my but we do have powerful muscles
 each of us equal to gravity

or sunlight that forces our shadows
 into the pieces of a fully interlocking puzzle
  
  
 4. good morning he whispered
  
 the horrors of the horses are the crows
 the bird flies past the outside the library
 many heels have trapped the same way
 he tolls, he lapsed with the light from so many trees
  
 check the pattern swerves with the back
 the tree that holds the metal spiral staircase swings
 aloft the hand removes a book and checked it
 for death by glasses or the angle food descends
  
  
 5. the broadcast
  
 she turns me on she turns on me
 that the view from the window is a lake
 and silent cars are given the noise of flies dying in the heat
 of the library    the grass outside goes brown
 in my head behind my glasses behind the glass in the precinct
 thus, too, they whisper in museums and banks






Gaslight
 

a line of faces borders the strangler's work
 heavy european women
 mist blows over dusty tropical plants
 lit from beneath the leaves by a spotlight
 mist in my mind a riffled deck
  
 of cards or eccentrics
 was i
 a waterton animal my head
 is not my own
  
 poetry is neither swan nor owl
 but worker, miner
 digging each generation deeper
 through the shit of its eaters
 to the root  then up to the giant tomato
  
 someone else's song is always behind us
 as we wake from a dream trying to remember
 step onto a thumbtack
  
 two worlds  we write the skin
 the surface tension that holds
                                        you
                                        in
 what we write is ever the past
  
 curtain pulled back
 a portrait behind it
 is a room suddenly lit
  
 looking out through the eyes
 at a t.v. programme
 of a monk sealed into a coffin
  
 we close their eyes and ours
 and still here the tune
  
 moves on

Gracious Living Tara 
 

lonely as four cherries on a tree
 at night, new moon, wet roads
 a moth or a snowflake
 whipping past glass
  
 lonely as the red noses of four clowns
 thrust up through snow
 their shine four whitened panes
 drawn from imagined memory
  
 lonely as no other lives
 touching to recorded water
 all objects stare
 their memories aware
  
 lonely as pain
 recoiling from itself
 imagining the cherries
 and roses reaching out







The Vein
 

But I have been familiar with ruins too long to dislike desolation.       (Lord Byron, November 1816) 
what happens in any
  
 sovereign body is created
  
 on the evidence of the last
  
 head on its last lap
  
 those of us watching
  
 then, during the programme
  
 see the die seem to be cast
  
 to draw the teeth
  
 of our first question
  
 affecting essential interests
  
 they and only they had
  
 she was dealing with
  
 an unworthy family
  
 gathered for death
  
 inconvenient location
  
 gruesome tired mannerisms
  
 a bit thick coming from her
  
 losing the thread of argument
  
 in a sinuous cartwheel
  
 drained of what life
  
 hurried out with a pushchair
  
 unsparing he takes us
  
 to the cabaret
  
 into patterns and groups
  
 contrived for distraction
  
 more likely
  
 to deepen withdrawal
  
 such a decrease
  
 in which women
  
 had views diametrically opposed
  
 soon changes his tune
  
 howling
  
 face to face
  
 cruel for people
  
 recoiling in horror

 in a cloud of dust
  
 tattered lace about her
  
 she watched him calmly
  
 bits of it he tore off
  
 at the end of each meeting
  
 seemed colour-coded
  
 sparkling violently
  
 tingling on his skin
  
 holes turned round slowly

 flashbulbs go off
  
 her hand flicked back and forth
  
 over a section of floor
  
 he had heard more
  
 than every single word
  
 from the once proud
  
 ruins of arches
  
 in one outstretched hand
  
 an odd sensation
  
 included balance
  
 working to repair the damage
  
 of triumph on his face
  
 folded against the edge
  
 of exhaust fumes
  
 closing his lids
  
 properly needed great care
  
 she heard a rustle
  
 little numbers
  
 flew around trees
  
 tumbled across a moonlit field
  
 trying to reassemble
  
 his head again
  
 she blinked
  
 some sort of code
  
 subtle variations

 an idealised culture

 spanned the world
  
 thought was the only thing
  
 to come back to acting
  
 beyond acoustics
  
 even when dramatic
  
 she always wore fancy dress
  
 simply cut and held low
  
 objects grouped together
  
 confidently into fine jewellery
  
 after the storm new scents
  
 touched by salt spray
  
 hardly dimmed the harsh light
  
 he sometimes pulled at his hair
  
 obsessed with finding the beautiful
  
 curtain allowing him entry
  
 never able to follow
  
 the middle of night
  
 downwards to find a runway
  
 with deep sides
  
 writhing under his fingers
  
 personalities full of energy
  
 order a series
  
 of the same programme
  
 cool for film
  
 using this knowledge
  
 machines talk to themselves
  
 maintain a very persistent
  
 buzzing as the signal
  
 ends in a dramatic freeze
  
 close to the border

The Mystery of the Hunt
 

It's the mystery of the hunt that intrigues me,
                    That drives us like lemmings, but cautiously--
 The search for a bright square cloud--the scent of lemon verbena--
                     Or to learn rules for the game the sea otters
                                       Play in the surf.
  
                   It is these small things--and the secret behind them
                                     That fill the heart.
                         The pattern, the spirit, the fiery demon
                                 That link them together
                       And pull their freedom into our senses, 
  
              The smell of a shrub, a cloud, the action of animals
  
          --The rising, the exuberance, when the mystery is unveiled.
                                  It is these small things
  
                    That when brought into vision become an inferno.
 





The Chamber
 

for Jack Kerouac 
IN LIGHT ROOM IN DARK HELL IN UMBER IN CHROME,
      I sit feeling the swell of the cloud made about by movement
  
                  of arm leg and tongue. In reflections of gold
            light. Tints and flashes of gold and amber spearing
                      and glinting. Blur glassblue Glass,
  
              black telephone. Matchflame of violet and flesh
                  seen in the clear bright light. It is not night
  
                 and night too. In Hell, there are stars outside.
             And long sounds of cars. Brown shadows on walls
                                        in the light
                            of the room. I sit or stand
  
                  wanting the huge reality of touch and love.
             In the turned room. Remember the long-ago dream
  
           of stuffed animals (owl, fox) in a dark shop. Wanting
              only the purity of clean colors and new shapes
                                      and feelings.
                  I WOULD CRY FOR THEM USELESSLY
  
                    I have ten years left to worship my youth
                       Billy the Kid, Rimbaud, Jean Harlow
   IN DARK HELL IN LIGHT ROOM IN UMBER AND CHROME I
                                                                                             feel the swell of
 smoke the drain and flow of motion of exhaustion, the long sounds of cars
                                                                                                      the brown shadows
 on the wall. I sit or stand. Caught in the net of glints from corner table to 
                                                                                                                        dull plane
 from knob to floor, angles of flat light, daggers of beams. Staring at love's face.
       The telephone in cataleptic light. Marchflames of blue and red seen in the 
                                                                                                                             clear grain.
 I see myself--ourselves--in Hell without radiance. Reflections that we are.
  
               The long cars make sounds and brown shadows over the wall.
  
                                I am real as you are real whom I speak to.
                    I raise my head, see over the edge of my nose. Look up
  
                     and see that nothing is changed. There is no flash
                             to my eyes. No change to the room.
  
                        Vita Nuova--No! The dead, dead world.
                      The strain of desire is only a heroic gesture.
                        An agony to be so in pain without release
  
                              when love is a word or kiss.






Dream: The Night of December 23rd 
 

for Jane 
--ALL  HUGE LIKE GIANT FLIGHTLESS KIWIS TWICE THE
                                                                          SIZE OF OSTRICHES,
                           they turned and walked away from us
                  and you were there Jane and you were twenty-two
                         but this was the nineteen-forties,
                    in Wichita, near the edge of town, in a field
                   surrounded by a copse of cottonwoods. It was 
                     getting dark and the trees around the bridge
                        almost glowed like a scene by Palmer.
            The two Giant Birds--Aepyorni--from Madagascar,
                extincted A.D. one thousand, turned and walked
            from us across the bridge. Even in the semi-darkness
                    the softness of their brown feathers made
                  curls pliant as a young mother's hair. There
          was a sweet submission in the power of their enormous
                   legs (giant drumsticks). Their tiny heads
                   (in proportion to their bodies) were bent
           utterly submerged in their business and sweeping
          side to side as a salmon does--or as a wolf does--
              but with a Pleistocene, self-involved gentleness
                 beyond our ken. My heart rose in my chest
                     (as the metaphysical poets say "with
                    purple wings of joy.) to see them back
               in life again. We both looked, holding hands,
                      and I felt your wide-eyed drinking-in 
  
 of things.
                 Then I turned and viewed across the darkening
              field and there was a huge flightless hunting fowl
                   (the kind that ate mammals in the Pliocene).
           He stood on one leg in the setting sun by the sparkling
                stream that cut across the meadow to the bridge.
  
             He had a hammer head and curled beak, and after my
                  initial surge of fear to see the field was dotted,
             populated, by his brethren, each standing in the setting
  
                         sun, I saw their stately nobility
  
                                                                               and again
  
 the self-involvement.
  
                                    We followed the Aepyorni
  
                       across the old wooden bridge made of huge
                timbers. The bridge was dark from the shadows
                      of the poplars and the evergreens there.
               The stream was dimpled with flashing moonlight
  
                         --and I think it had a little song.
  
                                                                                   Then
  
               I found that on the bridge we were among
               a herd of black Wildebeests--Black Gnus.
            One was two feet away--turned toward me--
                 looking me eye-into-eye. There was primal
                     wildness in the upstanding coarse (not
                         sleek as it really is in Africa) fur on
                 the knobby, powerful-like-buffalo shoulders.
                  (Remember this is a dream.) I passed by him
            both afraid and unafraid of wildness as I had passed
     through the herd of zebras at the top of Ngorongoro Crater
         in front of the lodge, where from the cliff we could see
             a herd of elephants like ants, and the soda lake
                     looked pink because of flamingos there.
                         There is an essence in fear overcome
                 and I overcame fright in passing those zebras
  
                      and this black Wildebeest.
  
                                                             Then we passed
  
                   over the heavy bridge and down a little trail
                   on the far side of the meadow, walking back
  
                   in the direction we had been.
  
                                                                    Soon we came
  
                        to a cottage of white clapboards
           behind a big white clapboard house and knocked
              on the door; it was answered by a young man
   with long hair who was from the Incredible String Band.
           He took us inside and he played an instrument
               like a guitar and he danced as he played it.
           The lyre-guitar was covered with square plastic
                 buttons in rows of given sizes and shapes.
               The instrument would make any sound, play
                  any blues, make any creature sound, play
                              any melodyI wanted it
                      badly--it was a joy. My chest rose.
                I figured I'd have to, and would be glad to,
                   give twenty or thirty thousand for it
                               Then the dream broke
               and I was standing somewhere with Joanna
                 to the side of a crowd of people by a wall
                 of masonry and I reached into my mouth
                   and took from my jaw (all the other
         persons vanished and I was the center of everything)
                         a piece which was eight teeth
                       fused together. I stared at them
                wondering how they could all be one piece.
                 They were whiteIt was some new fossil.
         Down on the bone there were indentations like rivulets
                     like the flowing patterns of little rivers.






Mexico Seen from the Moving Car 
 


 THERE ARE HILLS LIKE SHARKFINS
                                   and clods of mud.
 The mind drifts through
 in the shape of a museum,
 in the guise of a museum
 dreaming dead friends:
 Jim, Tom, Emmet, Bill.
 --Like billboards their huge faces droop
 and stretch on the walls,
 on the walls of the cliffs out there,
 where trees with white trunks
           makes plumes on rock ridges.
  
 My mind is fingers holding a pen.
  
 Trees with white trunks
              make plumes on rock ridges.
 Rivers of sand are memories.
 Memories make movies
              on the dust of the desert.
 Hawks with pale bellies
              perch on the cactus,
 their bodies are portholes
              to other dimensions.
  
 This might go on forever.
  
 I am a snake and a tiptoe feather
 at opposite ends of the scales
 as they balance themselves
 against each other.
 This might go on forever.
  
  






Chronic
 

were lifted over the valley, its steepling dustdevils
 the redwinged blackbirds convened
 vibrant arc their swift, their dive against the filmy, the finite air
  
 the profession of absence, of being absented, a lifting skyward
 then gone
 the moment of flight: another resignation from the sweep of earth
  
 jackrabbit, swallowtail, harlequin duck: believe in this refuge
 vivid tips of oleander
 white and red perimeters where no perimeter should be
  
  
  
                here is another in my long list of asides:
 why have I never had a clock that actually gained time?
 that apparatus, which measures out the minutes, is our own image
                          forever losing
  
 and so the delicate, unfixed condition of love, the treacherous body
 the unsettling state of creation and how we have damaged--
 isn't one a suitable lens through which to see another:
                filter the body, filter the mind, filter the resilient land
  
  
  
 and by resilient I mean which holds
               which tolerates the inconstant lover, the pitiful treatment
 the experiment, the untried & untrue, the last stab at wellness
  
 choose your own adventure: drug failure or organ failure
 cataclysmic climate change
 or something akin to what's killing bees--colony collapse
  
 more like us than we'd allow, this wondrous swatch of rough
  
  
  
 why do I need to say the toads and moor and clouds--
 in a spring of misunderstanding, I took the cricket's sound
  
 and delight I took in the sex of every season, the tumble on moss
 the loud company of musicians, the shy young bookseller
 anonymous voices that beckoned to ramble
              to be picked from the crepuscule at the forest's edge
  
 until the nocturnal animals crept forth
              their eyes like the lamps in store windows
                           forgotten, vaguely firing a desire for home
  
 hence, the body's burden, its resolute campaign:  trudge on
  
 and if the war does not shake us from our quietude, nothing will
  
 I carry the same baffled heart I have always carried
              a bit more battered than before, a bit less joy
 for I see the difficult charge of living in this declining sphere
  
  
  
 by the open air, I swore out my list of pleasures:
 sprig of lilac, scent of pine
 the sparrows bathing in the drainage ditch, their song
  
 the lusty thoughts in spring as the yellow violets bloom
               and the cherry forms its first full buds
 the tonic cords along the legs and arms of youth
               and youth passing into maturity, ripening its flesh
 growing softer, less unattainable, ruddy and spotted plum
  
  
  
 daily, I mistake--there was a medication I forgot to take
 there was a man who gave himself, decently, to me & I refused him
  
 in a protracted stillness, I saw that heron I didn't wish to disturb
 was clearly a white sack caught in the redbud's limbs
  
 I did not comprehend desire as a deadly force until--
               daylight, don't leave me now, I haven't done with you--
                             nor that, in this late hour, we still cannot make peace
  
  
  
 if I, inconsequential being that I am, forsake all others
 how many others correspondingly forsake this world
  
  
  
                light, light: do not go
 I sing you this song and I will sing another as well
  
 

 






Lemon Tree
 

A tree that grew in the Garden of Eden
 a tree of innocence called
 the Tree of Good and Evil. It was harmless
  
 as opposites are in balance. It was also
 tasteless,
 the taste of innocence before it is betrayed.
 When God removed the wall
  
 he gave the lemon thorns and bitterness because it had
 no hostility.
 It is a taste we want most to subdue. It asks
 to be left alone.
 We use it with fish and tea. We sugar it.
  
 Look out the window. It stands with a donkey's
 stance, hoping the day will pass.
 Its scent through the curtains
 cuts through
 mustiness, sharp
 with sweet blossoms. It hides the smell
 of new babies.
 





Unravelling / Shock
 

A hole torn in the fabric of the world,
the web, the whole infernal weave
through which live-giving rain is falling
but mixing with the tears and with the blood.
Dead body-snatchers enter, the mega-corpses, 
much in the news these days, enter and grind
bones, flesh and sinews down to dry tree bark,
mixing with tree bark, crawling with the demonic 
beetles. They'll tell it later: "No one expected this:
not one--patient, doctors, practitioners
of every stripe, no one except the one whose daily
work is close to prophecy, who feels it in his nerves
or in her muscles--where news travels up fast
and lodges in the eyes, all-seeing, all-pervading vision
of disaster. And comes in like a mouse, wee small,
[wee modest, so wee, wee practical,] mouse with big ears
and popping eyes, looking this way and that and not
one tittle-tattle fazed by your huge presence. Later
drowns in a bucket with a lizard: everything drowns 
round here getting to water. Not able to get out again. 
Thus coming quietly, thus probing, [thus stealing in,]
squatting thus quietly back of the house:
how do the tears well up, well down again,
what makes them well, the seeing eyes know not,
what routes the change parent-to-orphan? Stop.
Orphan-to-parent? Stop. Then back again to tears?
Look out beyond the healthy trees preserved
in a close circle round the house for privacy,
look out the window over hills and dales
of this milagro country, see living green, see dying
brown--on each and every morning mourn the trees.
Criminal imbeciles who run the shows we live in 
from top to bottom of their slimy theater, have now
decreed they will not solve the water. Matter of fact,
they will not solve what we are made of--the high
percentage water in all of us compounded. They will not
solve a single problem by the name of life we give
to human business. They will prefer
to dip their steel in blood, to let the semen drip
from off of their steel into the blood and thus contaminate,
infuse with every cancer both body politic and body
not so politic, just private, single, individual--but
gives to other individuals their mien and color. Ghosts
walk the hills and dales between the dying trees.
"Remember now, they say, with stab at tragic countenance,
[for when can privacy enter into collective?] "those days,
those days you took no notice of, counting them poor, 
dispersing them among the memories you could not value
at their true worth, you could not recognize enough to feel:
who knows if these few days, [these very days], were not
those ones we lived together here, the only paradise?





The Honey Bear
 

Billie Holiday was on the radio
I was standing in the kitchen
smoking my cigarette of this
pack I plan to finish tonight
last night of smoking youth.
I made a cup of this funny
kind of tea I've had hanging
around. A little too sweet
an odd mix. My only impulse
was to make it sweeter.
Ivy Anderson was singing
pretty late tonight
in my very bright kitchen.
I'm standing by the tub
feeling a little older
nearly thirty in my very
bright kitchen tonight.
I'm not a bad looking woman
I suppose     O it's very quiet
in my kitchen tonight        I'm squeezing
this plastic honey bear      a noodle
of honey dripping into the odd sweet
tea. It's pretty late
Honey bear's cover was loose
and somehow honey      dripping down
the bear's face   catching
in the crevices beneath
the bear's eyes    O very sad and sweet
I'm standing in my kitchen     O honey
I'm staring at the honey bear's face.





Peanut Butter
 

I am always hungry
& wanting to have
sex. This is a fact.
If you get right
down to it the new
unprocessed peanut
butter is no damn
good & you should
buy it in a jar as
always in the
largest supermarket
you know. And
I am an enemy
of change, as
you know. All
the things I
embrace as new
are in
fact old things,
re-released: swimming,
the sensation of
being dirty in
body and mind
summer as a
time to do
nothing and make
no money. Prayer
as a last re-
sort. Pleasure
as a means,
and then a
means again
with no ends
in sight. I am
absolutely in opposition
to all kinds of
goals. I have
no desire to know           
where this, anything
is getting me.
When the water
boils I get
a cup of tea.
Accidentally I
read all the
works of Proust.
It was summer
I was there
so was he. I
write because
I would like
to be used for
years after
my death. Not
only my body
will be compost
but the thoughts
I left during
my life. During
my life I was
a woman with
hazel eyes. Out
the window
is a crooked
silo. Parts
of your
body I think
of as stripes
which I have
learned to
love along. We
swim naked
in ponds &
I write be-
hind your
back. My thoughts
about you are
not exactly
forbidden, but
exalted because
they are useless,
not intended
to get you
because I have
you & you love
me. It's more
like a playground
where I play
with my reflection
of you until
you come back
and into the
real you I
get to sink
my teeth. With
you I know how
to relax. &
so I work
behind your
back. Which
is lovely.
Nature
is out of control
you tell me &
that's what's so
good about
it. I'm immoderately
in love with you,
knocked out by
all your new
white hair
 
why shouldn't
something
I have always
known be the
very best there
is. I love
you from my
childhood,
starting back
there when
one day was
just like the
rest, random
growth and
breezes, constant
love, a sand-
wich in the
middle of
day,
a tiny step
in the vastly
conventional
path of
the Sun. I
squint. I
wink. I
take the
ride.





Snakes
 

         for Kathe Izzo
I was 6 and
I lost my snake.
 
The table shook
I can do better
than this
and shambled
to the kitchen
to the scene
of the crime
 
I was green
I put my sneaker
down, little shoe
 
I felt the cold
metal tap
my calf
 
moo and everything
began to change.
I am 6
turned into lightning
wrote on the night
 
At 6, I was feathers
scales, I fell into
the slime of it, lit
 
You think you are six,
it yelled. I am face
to face with a frog
a woman alone
in bed. The square
of the window
persists. I am 6.
 
The phone rings
It's my sister
blamm I dropped
a plate. Sorry.
 
Now the clouds slide           
by afraid, awake
my feet are cold
but I'm fearless
 
I am 6.
 
Under here
with bottle caps
and stars
adults and low
moans, busses
 
slamming on brakes
I am 6
 
the cake is lit
it's round
the children
sing. I will never
return. We are
so small.
 
My husband turns
his fevered
face. I put
the medicine
down. Click.
I am 6.
 
The movie rolls on.
Tramping feet,
music blaring
at the end of
the war. I
am frightened
hold my hand
 
The round face
of the woman
upstairs, moving
the faucets, strips
of vegetable
 
slithering down,
her reptile child
will never
return. The telephone
 rings. It's me.
I'm six.





Doors
 

An open door says, "Come in.
A shut door says, "Who are you?
Shadows and ghosts go through shut doors.
If a door is shut and you want it shut,
     why open it?
If a door is open and you want it open,
     why shut it?
Doors forget but only doors know what it is
     doors forget.





Eating Fried Chicken
 

I hate to admit this, brother, but there are times
When I'm eating fried chicken
When I think about nothing else but eating fried chicken,
When I utterly forget about my family, honor and country,
The various blood debts you owe me,
My past humiliations and my future crimes--
Everything, in short, but the crispy skin on my fried chicken.
 
But I'm not altogether evil, there are also times
When I will refuse to lick or swallow anything
That's not generally available to mankind.
 
(Which is, when you think about it, absolutely nothing at all.)
 
And no doubt that's why apples can cause riots,
And meat brings humiliation,
And each gasp of air
Will fill one's lungs with gun powder and smoke.





Race, to go
 

What's yr race

                         Well how you wanna handle this?

                         Use the father for the fodder?
 
What side of John A. Macdonald's tracks you on anyway?
 
                         How fast you think this train is going
                                                                                                                  to go?       





Cornflowers
 

She says my hair smells
like corn tortillas.
I raise an eyebrow.
After all those honeysuckle
and papaya shampoos,
I can't believe my scalp
hasn't soaked up
the scent of blossom
or the perfume of rainfall.
No, she's my mother,
and she insists
that even as a little girl,
my whole bedroom breathed
corn tortillas.
 
Pressing nose to pillowcase,
I search for masa,
reach back before
molcajete and plow
to a dusky meadow,
its bed of soil flecked
with teosinte,
ancestor grasses.
 
Up through the dark
follicles of my skull
covered in sun-cracked husks,
push the black-brown silk strands,
cocooning thirsty kernels.
Maz sprouts into fields of thought
bearing hybrid rows of words
that fall like teeth
from the mouths of the dead.





At the Base of the Blues Tree: Una Ofrenda for Jimmy Davis, Chicago Blues Man 
 

(after the painting rbol de Blues by Roberto Valadez)
The hands of this telling tree pull
            him from the cobalt bowl sky,
bring Jimmy back to the ruins
            of Maxwell Street hunched in dusk.
He stood where strings intersected
            frets like tracks meeting ties
on the Illinois Central's passage
            from the Mississippi Delta,
then followed the bread crumbs
            of troubadours to this steel city.
Twelve-hour shifts beckoned
            mexicanos north on the Union Pacific
from Piedras Negras
            to Pilsen, Back of the Yards.
 
How many grandparents, mothers and fathers,
            pounded stake into soil,
snuck or were shoved into boxcars,
            leapt onto the train's iron rungs
as it shuddered along the rails
            to foundries where they poured
molten metal, faced hot licks
            of the blast furnace's growl and hiss?
How many lugged themselves north
            to slaughterhouses that drooled
rank puddles at their feet? This,
            so sons and daughters might step off
into another era, choose instruments of wood and metal,
            axes of their own timbre.
 
This so Jimmy might mix his own palette--
            tune each turquoise pitch and purple tone
into an electric blues old as corridos,
            but new to the mexicanos who came each
Sunday to the market at Maxwell.
 
New to the ears of Roberto, a boy, who would keep
            his ranchera rhythms close
as a pair of old jeans but grow
            into the blues as he listened
to the heirs of Papa Jackson--
            Johnny Young, Howlin' Wolf, Nighthawk
and Maxwell Jimmy. Now Roberto sits in overalls
            at an easel, splits
the hairs of his brush over how to compose
            this ofrenda, this homage. How
to take Jimmy back in time to the market
            whose merchants once hustled
with tricks for trade ancient as Africa, as Toltec Mexico,
            Maxwell, whose live blues bands
and car radios belting norteo mixes made
            every Sunday a session.
 
How to take Jimmy back
            to Maxwell's gathering spot where he guzzles
from an aluminum garden blooming atop his amp,
            swings his ax--
fingers climbing its trunk, plucking twigs--
            while our feet tap the roots
of this wailing tree. Notes skip through alleys
            of his voice like gravel
pinging off windshields, lift a pitch
            high enough to singe the autumn sky--
cousin to the red and green gritos of the barrio
            only blocks away. Twelve bars spin
like metal rims, stack like hubcaps,
            chords crackling in the tin barrels of his laughter.
When the people gather, he sputters,
            What did the one-eyed woman say?
and waits for them to peer into the devil's draw
of his eyes before he roars,
            Where is my one-eyed man?
 
But we barely get to the punch line, to the end
            of a set, before the mayor swings his ax,
a claw that rips this rbol de blues up by its roots;
            before Chicago swings its wrecking ball
to level homes, stores, restaurants, bars;
            before troops graffiti-blast, scrub and cinch-sack it
all, but one empty wall
            where someone has scrawled Jimmy's name
among the others in this hall of fame:
            Willie, Hound Dog, Honey Boy, Sal,
the many legends who've shared the marrow
            of their music, of Santana's hearty
soup with the bones still in it steaming with sabor
            and sometimes weeping.





Lecciones de lengua
 

She is proud of her pap
because he comes
to their little grey school,
converted from army barracks,
to teach espaol
to Mrs. Brenda's fifth grade.
And that means they don't
have to listen to that awful
Seora Beister on TV
with her screech owl version
of "Las maanitas and her annoying
forefinger to the ear,
               Escuchen
and then to the lips,
               y repitan.
 
He teaches them to order
Coca-Cola en el restaurn
               Seor, quisiera una Coca, por favor
and the names of all the utensils
               cuchara, cuchillo, tenedor.
The children look at him funny
when he picks up the knife.
Next week he will demonstrate
the bullfights he watched
in Mexico when he was muy chiquitito.
He will choose a boy to snort, stomp,
charge the red cloth
that Pap will snap
at his side as he dodges
the sharp-horned strike,
stabs invisible swords
into the boy's hide
 
               and makes the children laugh.





Zacuanpapalotls 
 

(in memory of Jos Antonio Burciaga, 1947-1996)                                                We are chameleons. We become chameleon.                              --Jos Antonio Burciaga  
We are space between--
the black-orange blur
of a million Monarchs
on their two-generation migration
south to fir-crowned Michoacn
where tree trunks will sprout feathers,
a forest of paper-thin wings.
 
Our Mexica cocooned
in the membranes de la Madre Tierra
say we are reborn zacuanpapalotls,
mariposas negras y anaranjadas
in whose sweep the dead whisper.
 
We are between--
the flicker of a chameleon's tail
that turns his desert-blue backbone
to jade or pink sand,
the snake-skinned fraternal twins
of solstice and equinox.
 
The ashen dawn, silvering dusk,
la oracin as it leaves the lips,
the tug from sleep,
the glide into dreams
that husk out mestizo memory.
 
We are--
one life passing through the prism
of all others, gathering color and song,
cempazuchil and drum
to leave a rhythm scattered on the wind,
dust tinting the tips of fingers
as we slip into our new light.





City Moon
 

Perfect disc of moon, huge
and simmering
low on the capital's filthy horizon-- Ay,
qu luna ms hermosa! she says
pushing the stroller slowly down Atocha.
And gorgeous too the firm-thighed
 
boys from Lisbon
a block away, who work
Kilometer Zero's sidewalk, the neon
shoestore they lean against
cupping the flames
of passing strangers.
 
The sky above Puerta del Sol turns
a darker shade of blue. Who says
it doesn't become night's
one eye
as it scales the heavens, paling
and shrinking before it moves
 
across a late June sky? And below,
men persist and circle
the plaza, twin fountains brimming
over their brilliant waters. Hours
from now with the heat
waning, the same moon will spot
 
the figure of him
making past Neptune, the Ritz
the orange jumpsuits
hopping off trucks to sweep
and spray, hosing
down those electric streets.
 





Klein on Mourning
 

                not straight, but in waves 
It seems every advance in the process
deepens the subject's relations to
inner objects, happiness in regaining them
 
after feeling adrift and lost, an increased
trust because they appear good
and helpful after all, as in the child
 
step by step, building his relations to
external objects, gaining not only from things
pleasant, but from ways in which the child
 
overcomes frustrations . . . Mrs. A, for instance:
finally walking down familiar streets with a friend:
an attempt at old bonds. Yet moments into the stroll
 
the number of bustling people is too much,
the buildings strange, the sunlight artificial, bleak . . .
so that she has to retreat indoors into
 
a restaurant for a chair, but even there the walls
are buckling, the diners and waiters blurred--
indifferent to what she carries inside, her home
 
suddenly the only tolerable place--
pictures of her boy, his drawings,
in each and every room. 
 





In the Faraway Suburbs
 

                                   Listen to the creepy proclamation,                                                           Blown through the lairs of the forest-nation                                                          --Vachel Lindsay 
1
 
Who knows why my baby left me?
Who knows where she could have gone?
Is she hiding in the center
Of some little-known downtown?
Has she been seduced by villains?
Have they got her gagged and bound?
Vanished from the lost and found
With no trace and no reminder . . . ?
Yeah, she's lost, but I will find her
Down in the faraway suburbs.
 
2                        Puerto Rico
 
In Guaynabo and Tao Baja
The theorists and professors
Are playing rhetorical poker
With their identity cards,
They are shooting wads of wisdom
To impress the senile deans;
Meanwhile, the good citizens
Are all working for the government,
Cheating on taxes and spouses
Down in the faraway suburbs.
 
3                        New York
 
The Greyhound wheezes its way
From New York up to Poughkeepsie;
I pass the time singing "Gypsy
By Fleetwood Mac, a cappella;
And the watercolor landscape
Falls apart on the gray planes;
The diners and the dead-ends,
The deserted factories,
And the doors creak noisily
Down in the faraway suburbs.
 
4
 
The are prehistoric skeletons
At the beach on Staten Island
And the jellyfish are dancing
Slow, hydrochloric waltzes:
There are Doric-style chalets
With South American servants
Where the little brothers play;
Sniffing underarms and solvents
While the dog shows off its teeth
Down in the faraway suburbs.
 
5 
 
Here the end of the expressway
Gives way to medieval forests
And correctional facilities
And McDonald's without tourists;
I'm overwhelmed by the view
Of the mansions on the plains,
The housing projects, the flames
Creeping through the dead of winter
As the landfill burns tonight
Down in the faraway suburbs.
 
6                        California
 
In the righteous neighborhoods,
Atherton, West Palo Alto,
They're paving over the asphalt
With the gravel of privilege--
All ones hears are the arpeggios
Of the pre-recorded pianos,
And the trembling of the hands
That are serving themselves gin
And the shot glass shattering
Down in the faraway suburbs.
 
7
 
Far from all the shantytowns,
In Millbrae and Redwood City,
One more neighborhood committee
Is creating civic centers
And more monumental malls
Catering to healthy pleasures:
Peewee softball in the summers,
Window-shopping, Cineplex,
And those fruity Tex-Mex shakes
Down in the faraway suburbs.
 
8
 
A distant, majestic Sun
Licks the cliffs and the embankments,
I search for your embalmed eye
On the coast of the Pacific.
Marin County  in particular
Has its share of urban ghosts,
Like those midget saxophonists
Who long for their days of glory
And are now telling their story
Down in the faraway suburbs.
 
9
 
I've searched for you in each corner of
This innocuous continent--
Could it be you're facing me?
Could it be that you're my neighbor?
That the downtown and the eye balm
And the grime that coats your hands
Are all arcane holograms?
That your epileptic smile
Died that antiseptic night
Down in the faraway suburbs.





Vacant Blues
 

I swallow a pill but there is no cure
A city map won't get me where I want to go
 
Scaling the scaffold,
mindless of the mall,
unaware of driveways
where housewives dodge the wrecking ball,
I crawl outside these vacant blues
 
and into the contours of your eyes





Death and Taxes
 

The housewives laugh at what they can't avoid:
In single file, buckling one by one
Under the weight of the late summer sun,
They drop their bags, they twitch, and are destroyed.
He hears a voice (there is a bust of Freud
Carved on the mountainside). He tucks the gun
Under his rented beard and starts to run.
("The housewives laugh at what they can't avoid.)
Like She-bears fettered to a rusted moon
They crawl across the parking lot and shed
Tearblood. The office park is closing soon.
Night falls. The neighborhood buries its dead
And changes channels--Zap! Ah, the purity
Of death and taxes and Social Security.





Lagos
 

Lagos you are dirty
Your sand is soiled
Your fruits pithy.
 
I am tied to you
in a strange land
by lines that queue up
for foodstuffs you
should be eating but
ship off to me here
where I stand on check
out lines and marvel
at the cost of one
paw paw, just one mango
singular, along and apart
from you my dirty city.
 
O Lagos, your streets
are packed and pollute
the air while here in
a smug smogged city
I choke.
 
Your cord cuts my throat.
I am hurt and I cry like
my Mami market mothers
who go home night after
night with the same tin pots.
Their food is rotting and
ought to be thrown out to
the birds and beasts of
the forest/ but the lines!
O God, these lines are so long
and between the houses and
the foodstuffs so many palms
must be oiled.
 
Nairas are dripping with black gold
and yet a beggar man's lot is the
same/ He covers his shame as best
he can and little boys skip school.
A policeman holds his right hand out
a green car passes him dash. And we go
dash you dis and we go dash you dat
and mek we do business.
 
O Lagos, Lagos, ah say, you don tyah
fo dis? Yousef wey you de com fom?
Me, I long for the cleanliness of
sand roads that breathe long in carefully
spaced intervals between cars running
wild like mustangs roaming the plains.
There are no drivers to speak of.
They have vanished over the hills and
into gulleys.
 
The seeds have been planted. It is a
bitter harvest we reap. The deeds have
been done. What has been sown is the
flower of our calabashes on the eve of
harvest. If only the waters in the Marina
               If only the waves would whisper
louder the secrets of her beaches I would
know all/
 
My harbour is named after a queen whose
son's footprints are planted like a bad

Lagos, lay your plans carefully. There
is no way to stop the rise of bicycles
and lorries, hopeful bodies and empty
pots. You divert dash for food, care
for business. We are not an oasis in a
dying desert/ Have we not learnt, o
Lagos, the sound of seductive songs
and sights that blind us
between need and life there must be hope/





Lonely Eagles
 

for Daniel "Chappie James, General USAF             and for the 332d Fighter Group
Being black in America
was the Original Catch,
so no one was surprised
by 22:
The segregated airstrips,
separate camps.
They did the jobs
they'd been trained to do.
 
Black ground crews kept them in the air;
black flight surgeons kept them alive;
the whole Group removed their headgear
when another pilot died.
 
They were known by their names:
"Ace and "Lucky,
"Sky-hawk Johnny, "Mr. Death.
And by their positions and planes.
Red Leader to Yellow Wing-man,
do you copy?
 
If you could find a fresh egg
you bought it and hid it
in your dopp-kit or your boot
until you could eat it alone.
On the night before a mission
you gave a buddy
your hiding-places
as solemnly
as a man dictating
his will.
There's a chocolate bar
in my Bible;
my whiskey bottle
is inside my bedroll.
 
In beat-up Flying Tigers
that had seen action in Burma,
they shot down three German jets.
They were the only outfit
in the American Air Corps
to sink a destroyer
with fighter planes.
Fighter planes with names
like "By Request.
Sometimes the radios
didn't even work.
 
They called themselves
"Hell from Heaven.
This Spookwaffe.
My father's old friends.
 
It was always
maximum effort:
A whole squadron
of brother-men
raced across the tarmac
and mounted their planes.
 
            My tent-mate was a guy named Starks.
            The funny thing about me and Starks
            was that my air mattress leaked,
            and Starks' didn't.
            Every time we went up,
            I gave my mattress to Starks
            and put his on my cot.
 
            One day we were strafing a train.
            Strafing's bad news:
            you have to fly so low and slow
            you're a pretty clear target.
            My other wing-man and I
            exhausted our ammunition and got out.
            I recognized Starks
            by his red tail
            and his rudder's trim-tabs.
            He couldn't pull up his nose.
            He dived into the train
            and bought the farm.
 
            I found his chocolate,
            three eggs, and a full fifth
            of his hoarded-up whiskey.
            I used his mattress
            for the rest of my tour.
 
            It still bothers me, sometimes:
            I was sleeping
            on his breath.





Place and Time
 

History is your own heartbeat.                                    --Michael Harper 
Last night a man on the radio,
a still young man, said the business district
of his hometown had been plowed under.
The town was in North Dakota.
Grass, where the red-and-gold           
Woolworth sign used to be,
where the revolving doors
took him inside Sears;
gone the sweaty seats
of the Roxy--or was it the Princess--
of countless Friday nights
that whipped his heart to a gallop
when a girl touched him, as the gun
on the screen flashed in the moonlight.
Grass, that egalitarian green,
pulling its sheet over rubble,
over his barely cold childhood,
on which he walks as others walk
over a buried Mayan temple
or a Roman aqueduct beneath
 a remote sheep pasture
in the British Isles. Yet his voice,
the modest voice on the radio,
was almost apologetic,
as if to say, what's one small town,
even if it is one's own,
in an age of mass destruction,
and never mind the streets and stones
of a grown man's childhood--
as if to say, the lives we live
before the present moment
are graves we walk away from.
 
Except we don't. We're all
pillars of salt. My life began
with Beethoven and Schubert
on my mother's grand piano,
the shiny Bechstein on which she played
the famous symphonies
in piano reductions. But they were no
reductions for me, the child
who now remembers nothing
earlier than that music,
a weather I was born into,
a jubilant light or dusky sadness
struck up by my mother's hands.
Where does music come from
and where does it go when it's over--
the child's unanswered question
about more than music.
 
My mother is dead, and the piano
she could not take with her into exile
burned with our city in World War II.
That is the half-truth. The other half
is that it's still her black Bechstein
each concert pianist plays for me
and that her self-taught fingers
are behind each virtuoso performance
on the stereo, giving me back
my prewar childhood city
intact and real. I don't know
if the man from North Dakota has
some music that brings back
his town to him, but something does,
and whatever he remembers
is durable and instantly
retrievable and lit
by a sky or streetlight
which does not change. That must be why
he sounded casual about
the mindless wreckage, clumsy
as an empty threat.





The Lonesome Dream
 

In the America of the dream
the first rise of the moon
swings free of the ocean,
and she reigns in her shining flesh
over a good, great valley
of plumped, untrampled grasses
and beasts with solemn eyes,
of lovers infallibly pitched
in their ascendant phase.
 
In this America, death
is virginal also, roaming
the good, great valley
in his huge boots, his shadow
steady and lean, his pistol
silver, his greeting clear
and courteous as a stranger's
who looks for another, a mind
to share his peaceable evenings.
 
Dreaming, we are another
race than the one which wakes
in the cold sweat of fear,
fires wild shots at death.,
builds slippery towers of glass
to head him off, waylays him
with alcohol traps, rides him down
in canyons of sex, and hides
in teetering ghost towns.
 
Dreaming, we are the mad
who swear by the blood of trees
and speak with the tongues of streams
through props of steel and sawdust,
a colony of souls
ravaged by visions, bound
to some wild, secret cove
not yet possessed, a place
still innocent of us.





Palindrome
 

There is less difficulty--indeed, no logical difficulty at all--inimagining two portions of the universe, say two galaxies, in which time goes one way in one galaxy and the opposite way in the other. . . . Intelligent beings in each galaxy would regard their own time as "forward and time in the other galaxy as "backward.                                                                         --Martin Gardner, in Scientific American 
Somewhere now she takes off the dress I am
putting on. It is evening in the antiworld
where she lives. She is forty-five years away
from her death, the hole which spit her out
into pain, impossible at first, later easing,
going, gone. She has unlearned much by now.
Her skin is firming, her memory sharpens,
her hair has grown glossy. She sees without glasses,
she falls in love easily. Her husband has lost his
shuffle, they laugh together. Their money shrinks,
but their ardor increases. Soon her second child
will be young enough to fight its way into her
body and change its life to monkey to frog to
tadpole to cluster of cells to tiny island to
nothing. She is making a list:
            Things I will need in the past
                        lipstick
                        shampoo
                        transistor radio
                        Sergeant Pepper
                        acne cream
                        five-year diary with a lock
She is eager, having heard about adolescent love
and the freedom of children. She wants to read
Crime and Punishment and ride on a roller coaster
without getting sick. I think of her as she will
be at fifteen, awkward, too serious. In the
mirror I see she uses her left hand to write,
her other to open a jar. By now our lives should
have crossed. Somewhere sometime we must have
passed one another like going and coming trains,
with both of us looking the other way.





Beginning with 1914
 

Since it always begins
in the unlikeliest place
we start in an obsolete country
on no current map. The camera
glides over flower beds,
for this is a southern climate.
We focus on medals, a horse,
on a white uniform,
for this is June. The young man
waves to the people lining the road,
he lifts a child, he catches
a rose from a wrinkled woman
in a blue kerchief. Then we hear shots
and close in on a casket
draped in the Austrian flag.
Thirty-one days torn off a calendar.
Bombs on Belgrade; then Europe explodes.
We watch the trenches fill with men,
the air with live ammunition.
A close-up of a five-year-old
living on turnips. Her older sister,
my not-yet-mother, already
wearing my daughter's eyes,
is reading a letter as we cut
to a young man with thick glasses
who lies in a trench and writes
a study of Ibsen. I recognize him,
he is going to be my father,
and this is his way of keeping alive.
Snow. Blood. Lice. Frostbite.
Grenades. Stretchers. Coffins. Snow.
Telegrams with black borders.
On the wide screen my father returns
bringing his brother's body;
my mother's father brings back his son's
from the opposite edge. They come together
under the oaks of the cemetery.
All who will be my family
are here, except my sister,
who is not yet imagined.
Neither am I, who imagine
this picture, who now jump
to my snowy birthday in the year
of the million-mark loaf of bread.
My early years are played
by a blue-eyed child who grows up
quickly, for this is a film
of highlights, like all documentaries
false to the life--the work
 of selective memory, all I can bear
of a painful childhood. The swastika
appears and remains as the huge
backdrop against which we're seen.
The sound track of a hysterical voice
is threatening us. We're heard as whispers.
Shortly before my city
bursts into flames, my stand-in
disappears from the film, which continues
with scenes of terror and death
I can't bear to watch. I pick up
a new reel, a strange sequel
set in a different location
and made in another language,
in which I am back. The colors are bright,
the sound track is filled with music,
the focus gentle. A man is beside me.
Time-lapse photography picks up
the inchmeal growth of daughters
toward the sky, the slow subversion
of dark by gray hair. Little happens.
The camera sums up the even flow
of many years in a shot of a river.
The principals from part one
are missing, except for me
who am the connection. The time is now,
and I am playing myself.





The End of Science Fiction
 

This is not fantasy, this is our life.
We are the characters
who have invaded the moon,
who cannot stop their computers.
We are the gods who can unmake
the world in seven days.
 
Both hands are stopped at noon.
We are beginning to live forever,
in lightweight, aluminum bodies
with numbers stamped on our backs.
We dial our words like Muzak.
We hear each other through water.
 
The genre is dead. Invent something new.
Invent a man and a woman
naked in a garden,
invent a child that will save the world,
a man who carries his father
out of a burning city.
Invent a spool of thread
that leads a hero to safety,
invent an island on which he abandons
the woman who saved his life
with no loss of sleep over his betrayal.
 
Invent us as we were
before our bodies glittered
and we stopped bleeding:
invent a shepherd who kills a giant,
a girl who grows into a tree,
a woman who refuses to turn
her back on the past and is changed to salt,
a boy who steals his brother's birthright
and becomes the head of a nation.
Invent real tears, hard love,
slow-spoken, ancient words,
difficult as a child's
first steps across a room.
 





Virtuosi
 

     In memory of my parents 
People whose lives have been shaped
by history--and it is always tragic--
do not want to talk about it,
would rather dance, give parties
on thrift-shop china. You feel
wonderful in their homes,
two leaky rooms, nests
they stowed inside their hearts
on the road into exile.
They know how to fix potato peelings
and apple cores so you smack your lips.
 
The words start over again
hold no terror for them.
Obediently they rise
and go with only a rucksack
or tote bag. If they weep,
it's when you're not looking.
 
To tame their nightmares, they choose
the most dazzling occupations,
swallow the flames in the sunset sky,
jump through burning hoops
in their elegant tiger suits.
Cover your eyes: there's one
walking on a thread
thirty feet above us--
shivering points of light
leap across her body,
and she works without a net.





Romantics
 

Johannes Brahms and                                          Clara Schumann 
The modern biographers worry
"how far it went, their tender friendship.
They wonder just what it means
when he writes he thinks of her constantly,
his guardian angel, beloved friend.
The modern biographers ask
the rude, irrelevant question
of our age, as if the event
of two bodies meshing together
establishes the degree of love,
forgetting how softly Eros walked
in the nineteenth-century, how a hand
held overlong or a gaze anchored
in someone's eyes could unseat a heart,
and nuances of address not known
in our egalitarian language
could make the redolent air
tremble and shimmer with the heat
of possibility. Each time I hear
the Intermezzi, sad
and lavish in their tenderness,
I imagine the two of them
sitting in a garden
among late-blooming roses
and dark cascades of leaves,
letting the landscape speak for them,
leaving us nothing to overhear.





All You Did
 

There doesn't seem
to be a crack. A
higher pin cannot
be set. Nor can 
you go back. You
hadn't even known
the face was vertical.
All you did was 
walk into a room.
The tipping up
from flat was
gradual, you
must assume.






Linens
 

There are charms
that forestall harm.
The house bristles
with opportunities
for stasis: refolding
the linens along 
their creases, keeping
the spoons and chairs
in their right places.
Nobody needs to
witness one's exquisite
care with the napkins
for the napkins 
to have been the act
that made the fact
unhappen.






The Obsoletion of a Language
 

We knew it 
would happen, 
one of the laws.
And that it
would be this
sudden. Words
become a chewing
action of the jaws 
and mouth, unheard
by the only other
citizen there was
on earth.






Pity the Beautiful
 

Pity the beautiful,
the dolls, and the dishes, 
the babes with big daddies 
granting their wishes.

Pity the pretty boys, 
the hunks, and Apollos, 
the golden lads whom 
success always follows.

The hotties, the knock-outs,
the tens out of ten, 
the drop-dead gorgeous, 
the great leading men.

Pity the faded, 
the bloated, the blowsy, 
the paunchy Adonis 
whose luck's gone lousy.

Pity the gods, 
no longer divine.
Pity the night 
the stars lose their shine.





Special Treatments Ward
 

                                        I

So this is where the children come to die,
hidden on the hospital's highest floor.
They wear their bandages like uniforms
and pull their iv rigs along the hall 
with slow and careful steps. Or bald and pale,
they lie in bright pajamas on their beds,
watching another world on a screen.

The mothers spend their nights inside the ward,
sleeping on chairs that fold out into beds,
too small to lie in comfort. Soon they slip
beside their children, as if they might mesh
those small bruised bodies back into their flesh.
Instinctively they feel that love so strong
protects a child. Each morning proves them wrong.

No one chooses to be here. We play the parts
that we are given--horrible as they are.
We try to play them well, whatever that means.
We need to talk, though talking breaks our hearts.
The doctors come and go like oracles,
their manner cool, omniscient, and oblique.
There is a word that no one ever speaks.


                                        II

 
I put this poem aside twelve years ago
because I could not bear remembering 
the faces it evoked, and every line
seemed--still seems--so inadequate and grim.

What right had I, whose son had walked away, 
to speak for those who died? And I'll admit
I wanted to forget. I'd lost one child
and couldn't bear to watch another die.

Not just the silent boy who shared our room,
but even the bird-thin figures dimly glimpsed
shuffling deliberately, disjointedly
like ancient soldiers after a parade.

Whatever strength the task required I lacked. 
No well-stitched words could suture shut these wounds. 
And so I stopped...
But there are poems we do not choose to write.


                                        III

 
The children visit me, not just in dream,
appearing suddenly, silently--
insistent, unprovoked, unwelcome.

They've taken off their milky bandages
to show the raw, red lesions they still bear.
Risen they are healed but not made whole.

A few I recognize, untouched by years.
I cannot name them--their faces pale and gray
like ashes fallen from a distant fire.

What use am I to them, almost a stranger?
I cannot wake them from their satin beds.
Why do they seek me? They never speak.

And vagrant sorrow cannot bless the dead.






Asylum
 

For Marina
You say the old masters never got it wrong,
But when Goya painted the death of the imagination
It was a lost dog against a usurious yellow sky
And the dog, a hapless creature who had drawn itself
Ten miles on two legs, stared in amazement
To see the man who once fed him from his plate
Reduced to this. 

So I felt this week, the vile soil and everything upon it--
The beggar guest kicked from the table
Before his own dog, and even the honest unpicking
Of art performed nightly and in seclusion.
Like any Penelope my armor is resignation
Although I thought I would lift the bow myself
And draw.

By the morning he is gone
And what to make of this?
The prostitutes hang from a beam like mice
The suitors are piled unburied in the yard.
And some say that it is now much better
And others, that it is worse.
So order was restored
I stared in amazement

                                               

Perhaps Akhmatova was right
When she wrote who knows what shit
What tip, what pile of waste
Brings forth the tender verse
Like hogweed, like the fat hen under the fence
Like the unbearable present tense
Who knows what ill, what strife
What crude shack of a life
And how it twists sweetly about the broken sill:
Pressingness, another word for honeysuckle
But housewives? Has poetry
Ever deepened in the pail
Was it ever found in the sink, under the table
Did it rise in the oven, quietly able
To outhowl the hoover?
Does it press more than the children's supper
The sudden sleepless wail?
Did it ever?
It lives. It takes seed
Like the most unforgiving weed
Grows wilder as the child grows older
And spits on dreams, did I say
How it thrives in the ashen family nest 
Or how iambs are measured best
Where it hurts:
With the heel of an iron 
On the reluctant breast 
Of a shirt?

                                               

                              MICHAEL BLANN

There was a hush, then Michael Blann
Stepped out onto the stage. Michael
Blann, with his pipe and his jukebox head
Oh, he's your man.

He has a song for all weathers, a pipe
And a voice, and he sings and he roams
He sings to the wind and a dog of how
The trees are all bare and Jack's come home.

He's a thin voice, like a spider thread 
On days when the sun is late and fine
Live and let live, sings Michael Blann
The wind yields not, but the hills is mine.

He's no call for fate passing over
His sheep are all angels, the stars are his Lords
He'll play any part the clouds should fancy
To humble tunes and hand-me-down words

The acts are written in briar strands
And the Pharisees are leaves in the air
I likes a drop pipes Michael Blann
Sing follow hark forward the innocent hare. 

He wore to his end a clutch of sheep's wool 
To show the gods that Michael Blann
Went alone, alone for most of his years
But crossed the hills a singing man.






Dawn Chorus
 

March 29, 2010
Every morning since the time changed
I have woken to the dawn chorus
And even before it sounded, I dreamed of it
Loud, unbelievably loud, shameless, raucous

And once I rose and twitched the curtains apart
Expecting the birds to be pressing in fright
Against the pane like passengers
But the garden was empty and it was night

Not a slither of light at the horizon
Still the birds were bawling through the mists
Terrible, invisible
A million small evangelists

How they sing: as if each had pecked up a smoldering coal
Their throats singed and swollen with song 
In dissonance as befits the dark world
Where only travelers and the sleepless belong





Our Conversation
 

Pure gaze, you are lightning beyond the last trees
and you are the last trees'
past, branching 
green lightning 
of terminal brain branches 
numened densely with summer's
hunter color, as night comes on, 
the ocean they conceal
gone berserk, wind still rising.
Pure seeing, dual vortex doors 
to the blue fire where
sex is burned away, and all 
is as it was and I am being offered
in your eyes, as in cupped hands,
the water of to never thirst again.
Again I turn away, 
and the future comes, all at once 
towering around me 
on every side, and I am lost.
Pure looking, past pain 
(this is promised):
we must have wed on poverty's most hair-raising day 
delighting, flashing risk, risk
unfailingly lighting the way, 
anything possible 
in that dissolving of seam 
between minds, 
no more golden time--
each step I took
the right step, words 
came to me finally and finding the place 
you had set for them,
once again 
wrote themselves down.
Till true word's anvil ring, and 
solid tap of winged blind cane come,
I wish you 
all the aloneness you hunger for.
That big kitchen table where you sit laughing 
with friends, I see it happening.
And I wish that I could not be 
so much with you
when I'm suddenly not; that
inwardly you might switch 
time, to sleep
and winter while you went about 
your life, until you woke up 
well,
our conversation resumed.
Ceaseless blue lightning, this 
love passing through me: 
I know somehow it will go on
reaching you, reaching you
instantly
when I'm not in the way; 
when it is no longer deflected 
by all the dark bents, all
I tried to overcome but I could not--
so much light pulled off course 
as it passed within reach, so much
lost, lost in me, 
but no more.


                                                 October 2, 1999October 2, 2010






What Did You See?
 

For Peter S.
I saw the shrouds of prisoners
like baptismal gowns
buried outside the cemetery.

On the canvas frills exhaled
singed wool and cardboard.

The angels arrived as lace.

Took notes, then stuck. Awful residue
from a small cut.

                                 

The veil has been ripped from the skin
where it was burned in.

The skin is the veil, the baby-material,
imprinted on, as if
one dropped the handkerchief
and it was one's wrist.

The cuff is frightening.  
Stuffed onto oil.
Water-stains might fence its ghost in.

                                 

"The barbed wire complex
I understand.  
Winged and flattened
at the same time, poor things!

Some leftover specters of blood.

Remember Blake's figures like columns
with heads

looking around for God?
When events are not as random
as they seem.

                                 

The article of clothing
is only half there, it's not full,
but when it falls forward, it is.

Terrible emptiness of the spread
neckline and little sleeve.
Half-cooked squares.

Was this religious fire
and is this where it passed?

Maybe they are floating on water
of paint, pool-sized, 
blue and ridged like foam.

You would have to fly
to see them flat as a map.

The rib and hem. Rained on
for eons. Noah's children's
floating forms.

                                 

Angels die?
It's a frightening-miracle 
because here they are.
The Upper God

has let them drop
like centuries into space.

And I recognize them!






The Land of Nod
 

Growing up, I barely knew the Bible, but read
and reread the part when Cain drifted east
or was drawn that way, into a place of desolation, 
the land of Nod, there to begin, with a wife 

of unknown origin, another race of men,
under the mark of God. As a boy, I thought Nod 
would be a place where the blue scillas 
would bloom gray, a country of the rack and screw, 

the serrated sword, where the very serving cups 
were bone. As a grown man, I've heard that Nod 
never was a nation--of Cain's offspring, or anyone--
but a mistranslation of "wander, so Cain 

could go wherever, and be in Nod. Far more 
than in God, I believe in Cain, who destroyed 
his own brother, and therefore in any city
could have his wish, and be alone.





Preserves
 

Nervy, sparrow-like,
Eyes Cherokee, 
Blackberry black,
Arrow-quick,
Picky eater,
Lean in spirit,
Converted Quaker,
She taught her grandson
Arithmetic
And checkers tactics
And let him touch
Through her cotton nightie
Small, tense nipples.
Her hands, arthritic,
Knitted doilies, 
Breaded tomatoes,
And put up apples,
While the hoarded guilts
Made for bright quilts,
The torrid migraines'
Counterpanes.






Psalm on Sifnos
 

One does not want,
O Lord, to heap
Up by still waters
Of words a cairn
But hopes to attend
A small covert
Of tamarisk
Whose leaves salty
Yet feathery
Will shed light over
A thickened plot.

One wants at last
To cede the field
To tamarisk
And mastic tree,
To olive and stone,
Stones in the fruit,
Seed in the stones.






Wichita Triptych
 

Sometimes the rain shines
Just when the sun reigns,
And that was the way it is
Beyond those French doors
That late afternoon here
In this mind's early evening
Where they still fade in
That cool color Polaroid,
Pastel shades of her prom dress,
A bowl of double peonies,
Promising, precocious,
Trying, trying to open.

                           

Their friend and he were tight
Tight-rope walkers, self-taught
Taut-trope-talkers, stalking
Jamb-up, arm-in-arm
And caroling to lucky stars
Their bars and rebars,
The night a carousel
Of tryst and troth, 
Of casual carousals,
Cocky arousals,
Pitching the dark to the dark.
(Streetlight and moth,
Reader, she married both.)

                           

But then there he was,
In the morning's mourning,
Soi-disant
Proustian mignon,
Aesthetic ascetic
And Kansas rube
Reducing his thought
To a bouillon cube
That no one hot 
Ought ever pore over.   






The One Turn That Makes the New World
 

Maybe the light from a small window 
Tucked at the utmost eave of the barn
Could be misunderst00d; if only I had pulled  

In by the other way or not looked up
Against such darkness. The animal I brought 
Into this no longer mine, the task

Each day was to confine enough, from harm
Or from each other as night loosens
Over the assemblage. But in the pasture

One wrong step was taken. And those who remain
Are weary, heads low, torment nowhere   
To be seen, not even in the illumination

Of men who have come to help,
Who behind the double doors keep watch
By the body so it does not become

Anything for those who scavenge, to follow back
The acts of blood right up to the locked stall 
And light where each shaft lands precisely again 

Through the again. The horse was in the snow,
The rock was underfoot; all the unknowables
Made whole and apparent by one who stumbled.






Dominion Over the Larger Animal
 

How many times I have provided
For your death; the apple turned one way
Then the other, an arrangement made, 

The softer ground. To hold your head 
As if this mattered, to say what I think
Essential into your ear,

To watch the eye look everywhere to find
What it does not know it looks for.
To fasten you down in the one place

Where no one can say anything more,
Being nothing else but breath leaving,
While the man with the needle stands by

Until the signal of how it is time. To believe
I know what will happen next; to leave the hill 
As the body stiffens; to pass each blossom

Of blood in the snow as if I understood 
All I was capable of.





Bird Left Behind
 

As for her, the circumstances must be ordinary
And so the return. Door unlocked. The path mowed 
Right to the oiled gate; the pasture 

Cleared of stone and alder. All untouched
Enough to enter. The man or woman 
Off down the valley or working above

Treeline. No other sound but a few strays 
Hurrying through the dusk as if the end
Will begin, certain and with nothing

More to say. She does not know she does not know. 
Having come back to find her kind
And none being left she took herself up 

Into a tree unclear what to do next save only
Sing the song she wanted sung back to her.






Self-Portrait after Paul Morphys Stroke
 

Paul lost his footing, turned out a spectacular corkscrew.
It looked like he was acting out a series of renga 

in the air. The general theme was prevenient grace.
But the white rim broke his form, and he hit 

the bathtub water like a big charred bough of a tree.
A semicircle of his shoes--Oxfords, monk straps,

bluchers, a lone boot--crowded in to get a look.
After that, Morphy was only surface. You can look

into anything and see what you want. For example,
Pierre swore he could read stock returns

in the little channels of Morphy's pruned thumbs.
He even called in Schiaparelli's niece. She entered

with a shoe on her head, I swear. There are pictures,
look it up. My uncle, my unfortunate uncle,

says the whole event--Morphy in the tub--looked
floral, with shoe petals. Just to be difficult, I said

"saucer of milk: a teacup on a dish, alone in the
quiet, waiting for a cougar to come by. I

always bank on something parched and ambling
to make my point. Or else something with a

broken heel, covered in wet newspaper and
huddled up next to the highway. All thumbs.






Elk at Tomales Bay
 

Nimble, preserved together, 
milkweed-white rears upturned,

female tule elk 
bowed into rustling foxtails.

Males muscled over the slopes,
jostling mantles, marking terrain. 

Their antlers clambered wide,
steep as the gorges.  

As they fed, those branches twitched,
sensory, delicate,

yet when one buck reared
squaring to look at us

his antlers and his gaze 
held suddenly motionless.

               Further out, the skeleton.

The tar paper it seemed to lie on
was hide. 

               Vertebrae like redwood stumps--
an uneven heart-shaped cavern    

               where a coccyx curled to its tip. 
Ribs fanned open

hollow, emptied of organs.
In the bushes its skull. 

Sockets and sinuses, mandible,
its few small teeth.  

All bare now except  
that fur the red-brown color 

of a young boy's head and also 
of wild iris stalks in winter

still clung to the drying scalp. 
Below the eye's rim sagged

               flat as a bicycle tire.

The form was sinking away.

The skin loosened, becoming other,
shedding the mask that hides

but must also reveal a creature.
Off amid cliffs and hills

some unfleshed force roamed free. 
In the wind, I felt 

the half-life I watched watch me. 
Elk, I said, I see 

               you abandon this life, this earth--

I stood for a time with the bones. 






from Quarantine
 


                          LAUDS

Somehow I am sturdier, more shore
than sea-spray as I thicken through
the bedroom door. I gleam of sickness.
You give me morning, Lord, as you
give earthquake to all architecture.
I can forget.
                           You put that sugar
in the melon's breath, and it is wet
with what you are. (I, too, ferment.)
You rub the hum and simple warmth
of summer from afar into the hips
of insects and of everything.
I can forget.
                           And like the sea,
one more machine without a memory,
I don't believe that you made me.


                          PRIME

I don't believe that you made me
into this tremolo of hands,
this fever, this flat-footed dance
of tendons and the drapery

of skin along a skeleton.
I am that I am: a brittle
rib cage and the hummingbird
of breath that flickers in it.

Incrementally, I stand:
in me are eons and the cramp
of endless ancestry.

Sun is in the leaves again.
I think I see you in the wind
but then I think I see the wind.





The woman with a tumor in her neck
 


has a moth in her palm,
a river on her tongue,
a scalpel in her boat,
a lump in her throat,
a gamble in her shoe,
a fire in her den,
a shadow in her flesh,
a flutter in her breast,
like everybody else.






Hollow Boom Soft Chime: The Thai Elephant Orchestra
 

A sound of far-off thunder from instruments 
ten feet away: drums, a log, 
a gong of salvage metal. Chimes 
of little Issan bells, pipes in a row, sometimes 
a querulous harmonica. 
Inside the elephant orchestra's audience, 
bubbles form, of shame and joy, and burst. 
Did elephants look so sad and wise, 
a tourist thinks, her camera cold in her pocket, 
before we came to say they look sad and wise? 
Did mastodons have merry, unwrinkled faces? 
Hollow boom soft chime, stamp of a padded foot, 
tingle of renaat, rattle of angklung. 
This music pauses sometimes, but does not end. 

Prathida gently strokes the bells with a mallet. 
Poong and his mahout regard the gong. 
Paitoon sways before two drums, 
bumping them, keeping time with her switching tail. 
Sales of recordings help pay for their thin enclosure 
of trampled grass. They have never lived free. 
Beside a dry African river 
their wild brother lies, a punctured balloon, 
torn nerves trailing from the stumps of his tusks. 
Hollow boom soft chime, scuff of a broad foot, 
sometimes, rarely, a blatting elephant voice. 
They seldom attend the instruments 
without being led to them, but, once they've begun, 
often refuse to stop playing.





Without Warning
 

Elizabeth Bishop leaned on a table, it cracked, 
both fell to the floor. A gesture 
gone sadly awry. This was close to fact 
and quickly became symbolic, bound to occur 
in Florida, where she was surrounded 
by rotting abundance and greedy insects. 
One moment a laughing smile, a graceful hand 
alighting on solid furniture, 
a casual shift of weight, 
the next, undignified splayed legs. 
The shell of the table 
proved to be stuffed with termite eggs. 
True, it was a fall from no great height--
merely the height of herself, 
and although the hollowed-out table failed, 
at least the floor held, 
though probably infested by termites as well, 
and possibly built on a latent sinkhole, 
how can you tell? 
And how could she, smiling and easy, 
arm moving without forethought and permission, 
have forgotten fear, apparently 
let go of a hard-learned lesson? 
Enter a room as though it is strange. 
What you recognize may have changed, 
or may change without warning. 
Trees fall in hurricanes 
and on windless mornings, 
breaching houses where people you knew 
have vanished or died or stopped loving you. 
She regained her feet, already composed, 
brushing dust from an elbow. There would be a bruise, 
but it would remind her that words are full of holes; 
flung hard, like paper they fly sideways. 
And a call to joy--a landscape, a face--
may, though scarcely moving, perhaps by not moving, go 
in one breath from heartening to ominous, 
proving to children who need more proof 
that we don't know what we know. 





Poem Beginning with a Line by Milosz
 

"The most beautiful bodies are like transparent glass.
They are bodies of the selfless or of those newly
dead. What appears transparent is really flame
burning so brightly it appears like glass. What
you're looking through is the act of giving: One
thing in life needed desperately, given to another,
or perhaps life itself. The most beautiful bodies
are not transparent, but sometimes the color
of lead, like the elephant whom a child with some
peanuts lifts by the trunk in his hand in the swirling
dust, so that it appears he has lifted a monument
or a city with all its pain. The bodies that seem
transparent are made of an ice so pure it appears
to be glass sweating, where you, desiring another,
glimpse your own face that weighs nothing and is burning.






February Snow
 

The tint of the sky between sunset and night.
  
 And wandering with you and your nephew
 in that maze, half-lost--Madrid
 of the Austrias--looking for Plaza of the Green
  
 Cross where, days before you arrived,
 an Opel with false plates was parked, its wheels
 straddling the curb, and so the van
  
 heading for the barracks that morning
 had to slow to squeeze
 past . . . Back at the hotel your mom
  
 is holding up her gift--Amethyst, she says
 admiring how light
 when passing through a prism
  
 bends. At his window that morning before we began
 my student said, Qu bonito!, watching it drift
 and descend, settling on roofs and cars.
  
 And I think of you and your wife
 and daughter: getting to see Madrid
 in white, your visit winding down, and how
  
 I had wanted that lesson to end
 to get to the park--Retiro, they say, is the city's
 one lung, and the way the feel and sound of steps
  
 cease
 when grass is completely covered
 as if walking on a cloud. The year before
  
 on a visit from the coast, a friend
 sitting at a window
 watched the flakes flutter
  
 and fall, dissolving before reaching
 the ground--aguanieve, he said
 while from a town near Seville
  
 B-52s were lifting off . . .
 I was in a trance that week
 though like most things the war
  
 in the Gulf was soon another
 backdrop, like the string of car bombs
 the following year. And yet that morning
  
 as soon as I heard, something led me
 not to the park but down
 to City Hall, workers in the street
  
 evacuated, sipping coffee, though I never reached
 the site--of course it was cordoned
 off, the spray of glass, the heap
  
 of twisted metal, and so later learned their names
 their lives. Of the five
 there was one: a postal clerk who
  
 as a boy, would plunge his hands
 into the white, the cold
 a sweet jolt
  
 whenever he got to touch
 the stuff, scooping
 it tightly into a ball
  
 like the ones he would dodge and throw
 years later
 at his wife-to-be: those weekends,
  
 those places--away from city air--
 a release . . . Miraflores, Siete
 Picos, Rascafra . . . It's in
  
 his blood, she would come to say
 chatting with a neighbor
 about his thing for snow--the way it falls
  
 softly, blanketing roofs
 and groves, villages
 nestled in the Sierra's
  
 hills: it is February
 and she is picturing him
 and the boy, up there now
  
 playing, horsing around






October
 

October is
 when night guzzles up
 the orange sherbet sunset
 and sends the day
 to bed
 before supper
             and
 October is when jack-o'-lanterns
 grin in the darkness
             and
             strange company crunches
 across the rumple of dry leaves
 to ring a doorbell.
 October is
 when you can be ghost,
             a witch,
                         a creature from outer space
 almost anything!
 And the neighbors, fearing tricks,
             give you treats.
 





Birthday Lights
 

Light bulbs on a birthday cake.
 What a difference that would make!
      Plug it in and make a wish,
      then relax and flip a switch!
 No more smoke
       or waxy mess
       to bother any birthday guests.
 But Grampa says, "it's not the same!
       Where's the magic?
        Where's the flame?
 To get your wish without a doubt,
 You need to blow some candles out!
 





The Boa
 

Just when you think you know the boa,
 There's moa and moa and moa and moa.
 





Earth Day
 

I am the Earth
 And the Earth is me.
 Each blade of grass,
 Each honey tree,
 Each bit of mud, 
 And stick and stone
 Is blood and muscle, 
 Skin and bone.

 And just as I 
 Need every bit
 Of me to make
 My body fit,
 So Earth needs
 Grass and stone and tree
 And things that grow here
 Naturally.

 That's why we 
 Celebrate this day.
 That's why across
 The world we say:
 As long as life,
 As dear, as free,
 I am the Earth
 And the Earth is me. 





You Also, Nightingale
 

Petrarch dreams of pebbles
on the tongue, he loves me
at a distance, black polished stone
skipping the lake that swallows

worn-down words, a kind of drown
and drench and quench and very kind
to what I would've said. Light marries
water and what else (unfit

for drinking purposes), light lavishes
my skin on intermittent sun. (I am weather
and unreasonable, out of all
season.  Petrarch loves my lies

of laurel leaves, ripped sprigs of
deciduous evergreen.) A creek is lying
in my cement-walled bed, slurring
through the center of small

town; the current's brown and 
turbid (muddy, turbulent
with recent torrents), silt rushing 
toward the reservoir. A Sonata

passes by too close (I have to jump)
and yes I do hear music here. It's blue, or
turquoise, aquamarine, some synonym
on wheels, note down that note. It's Petrarch

singing with his back to me (delivering
himself to voice), his fingers
filled with jonquil, daffodils, mistaken
narcissus. (I surprised him

between the pages of a book,
looked up the flowers I misnamed.)
Forsythia and magnolia bring me
spring, when he walks into the house

he has wings. Song is a temporary thing
(attempt), he wants to own his music.





Jerusalem ["And did those feet in ancient time"]
 

And did those feet in ancient time
 Walk upon Englands mountains green:
 And was the holy Lamb of God,
 On Englands pleasant pastures seen!
  
 And did the Countenance Divine,
 Shine forth upon our clouded hills?
 And was Jerusalem builded here,
 Among these dark Satanic Mills?
  
 Bring me my Bow of burning gold:
 Bring me my arrows of desire:
 Bring me my Spear: O clouds unfold!
 Bring me my Chariot of fire!
  
 I will not cease from Mental Fight,
 Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand:
 Till we have built Jerusalem,
 In Englands green & pleasant Land.





Value Added
 

No one knew what the stones like squatting frogs
 signified. There they were, fuming in rows, out
 of the ground; every critic had his explanation
 or hers. But--we had to remember--they 
  
 came to nothing, every one; those large stones
 out of the earth served the systems
 of those who considered them, as explaining
 something about the past it was important
  
 for the explainer to explain. And yet
 no one had any idea truly; there was no
 basis in fact for any view of them, and
 they remained like their origins--or like
  
 smiling Olmec babies, sweet but ominous figures
 come from the earth to reproach us, almost
 cheerfully, for our ignorance--a mystery, just
 as the probe of our feelings came up with nothing.






Beech Forest
 

Light from the ugliest lamp I ever saw, here
 on the table that triples for reading, eating (can't say
 dining), business on the phone; ugliest except
 a few around the corner in that guest house at windows
  
 --plaster driftwood; cylinders like rockets or sanitary
 napkins propping shades; thin torso of a youth;
 red globe on orange globe, the works, somebody's
 collection. Wouldn't she love this one, lump of lamp base
  
 intending landscape, two donkeys in mustard glaze,
 heads ruefully down, one carrying two rush panniers
 large enough to hold your pens or salts and peppers; on
 the other a shifty man with droopy moustache rides,
  
 **
  
 grumping under his sombrero; right leg broken
 off at the knee, left leg clipped at ankle. They make
 no progress, this mold-made work--the joins, arthritic
 ridges where dabs of grayish green suggest
  
 a wizened bush from which a brass post rises
 to hold a shade that doesn't fit and twice
 has tried to burn, as crusty sores at the rim show.
 Still, it lights my work. Why hate it? Do I care?
  
 These indecorous furnishings stand for failure, are
 a clutter that weighs down, defeats the purpose,
 like dumbbells taken along on vacations; the pen jar;
 lamp base, sextant, portable folding triptych.
  
 **
  
 The writing table fills with clutter. Specials
 coax me to nudge buying into play. A checkout
 coupon lets me get some brand of lunch meats
 fifty-five cents off if I spend two dollars
  
 but I just can't find it when I'm shopping, the ticket--
 with its rubric of good news and inscrutable forest
 of bar code, black on red--to lead me on; back home
 there it is, on the table, laying waste my power to spend.
  
 What I have wanted (with Larkin) to do must be
 "essentially undoable, it belongs to the imagination.
 Rather, the demolition has begun, piss and shit
 and blood mix in the snow-white bowl; and yet
  
 **
  
 I find the Beech Forest (behind the beach
 dunes) that Allen recommended "without
 reservation. The man was right--it more
 than satisfies, these beech ponds and their dune
  
 forest. I sat on a pitch pine that had blown
 over and then turned round and risen again,
 and bowed part making a seat something like
 a saddle; the tree was growing while I sat on it
  
 as were the other pitch pines round the pond ruddy
 in afternoon, late light of day, rough trunks
 with tufts of twisted branches green with needles,
 it was idyllic, wind speaking through the pines,
  
 **
  
 solitude:--O, yes, two high-breasted girls
 came striding by, I heard them coming, I
 heard them going, yammering at full volume
 not looking left or right, they passed me, were
  
 out of sight and soon of earshot, Doppler effect 
 caused by exuberant youth in oblivious chitchat.
 And people are smoking in these dry woods too,
 not policing their butts is how I know,
  
 the butts will surface from the heavier, sifting sand,
 sand spilling, surfing down hills, crashing in waves
 over the path here. But call it solitude,
 when a thought--but wait! I thought--I should not be
  
 **
  
 having a thought here, this moment: yet a vision
 of a Chinese poet in his study overlooking
 such a pond as this arrives out of the silence
 like the yellow water lilies on the water, pads
  
 spreading out in files like a design on the broadloom
 of a lobby. The sage is working on a poem, brushing it
 on silk, inspired by a blend of Tao and 
 Confucius. Doubtless he would not forget 
  
 allusions to Sung poets, if he were not
 a Sung poet himself, in which case he would have to
 echo Han or T'ang; and he would be writing
 of solitude; time passing; absent friends
  
 **
  
 (enlightenment would have to be inferred).
 No matter, I didn't bring a pen today.
 However, over there are inkberry bushes, so
 with a reed I just might make a start. . . . Farther
  
 on the path I listen to a bird, a warbler perhaps,
 I do not know the song or see the bird.
 There with the pines and sand and birdsong, and no
 prayer- or guide- or selfhelp-book, no
  
 serious commune, the mind must yearn to be 
 led on; it wants a deity, an altar to approach;
 an altar at least to take steps toward; occasion
 to rise to--with nothing planned for the mind,
  
 **
  
 it's like a person suddenly blind, not blind
 for a long time and knowing the ropes, but just
 now, rope-stung, blind--and groping, feeling around
 for the way, any way, or, closer to home,
  
 when the power goes at night just getting from
 here to there even though you know the drill, 
 --you never find the batteries when you need them,
 groping down cellar for the circuit breaker then
  
 you flip it; nothing, it's a bigger failure you are part of--
 know the layout in general yet without ceremony
 the mind leans forward, over an edge, hoping for,
 needing a little ritual, like a guide rail to keep it
  
 **
  
 from falling, going down. Even then the mind
 finds need of other news, keeps on desiring
 alterity somewhere at hand. For example,
 walking the streets of Provincetown, nothing to see
  
 but lots to look at, all that fluff and buff,
 the Michelin-man day-trippers aching along;
 suddenly I want a prayer book, maybe not
 Bottles and Stools or The Little Red Book but still . . .
  
 even a pocket copy of A Shropshire Lad,
 such as I find soon after all the buff and fluff
 at Tim's, the only bookstore on the street,
 handy for quick reads. Thin as a shortbread biscuit,
  
 **
  
 THE RICHARDS PRESS LONDON 1915, no doubt
 with its khaki cover, intended for some Tommy's
 backpack, a backward solace for off-duty hours
 in the trenches: admittedly not very much
  
 on the other hand just the thing I'm talking after;
 a talisman perhaps is all, an amulet
 with words that say, buck up, come on, you'll make it,
 there's something on after all this, no matter
  
 what the words say. Housman's "vision, his drear
 anguish of love for someone, something, lad
 and landscape that never were, that might shoot threads
 of gold among the bloody muslins and the mud;
  
 ** 
  
 mind wants other news than what the ruffled senses
 bring data of--smoke or flesh or birdsong.
 It saw there was a space within, reserved
 for turning toward another; other; that
  
 no bullet, arrowwood or beach plum might 
 fill, though these could occupy that space
 a moment.
                     Again I heard the casual chirping
 of that bird, off in that tupelo, the song
  
 I did not know, below the cries of gull
 and jay I did. The unknown I saw was not
 enough to satisfy; or--satisfied when it
 was framed, complement of what is known for sure.
  
 **
  
 It's--like--when you go someplace strange, new,
 the seashore, any boundary, you want to learn the names
 of plants. Start looking at the edges of leaves. It gives 
 a grip on where you are, and who, or seems to,
  
 to know bullbrier, bearberry, blueberry. You get a GUIDE
 or a local to tell. On the dune path I found one, a gnarled
 bush alone, hollylike but succulent leaf; nothing
 like it in the book. But why feel helped in nature
  
 by a name? When a horde of flower children wanted
 to know what they should do to be saved (back when)
 Snyder told them, "learn the names of plants;
 of animals; learn to do something with your hands.
  
 **
  
 Well I went out to that dune again: to cop a copy
 of the leaf I took and lost: so it's only bayberry
 after all; dioecious, two-sexed: some leaves different
 from others, that's OK only one got pictured
  
 in my book; but the waxiness, bayberry for sure, set
 to be rendered into candles for a gifte shoppe,
 nauseating noose of "scents. Its nutlets twinkle
 near the oily leaves aglow above the sand,
  
 bone white. Doesn't make me feel better to know now
 about that scrawny straggler. Sanctimonious 
 pilgrim know-alls, Bradford & Co.! Forest
 into desert, just like that. No time flat, considering.






At the Altar
 

That bag you packed me
 when you sent me
 to the universe--
 camp after camp I've opened it
 debating whether to unpack--
         Not yet, not yet--
 Why did I feel so much in it
 was dangerous on the playground,
 too good for everyday,
 feel those splendid fireworks
 hazardous to institutions,
 unmannerly to etiquette,
 so that, time after time,
 I found myself saying
        Not yet?
  
 At each new place I faced it,
 it suggested,
 Here spread out your things,
 put on this coat,
 open this bottle--
        No, not yet . . .
 sometimes throwing something out,
 giving things away,
 lightening my load. . . .
  
 The more I pull out,
 the more it seems, some days,
 is left inside,
 the heavier it is.
  
 Sometimes I think this package
 is almost a door
 the opening of which
 careening across heaven
 could be fatal.
  
 Some days now I wonder if I'll ever
 dare face my given garments--
 permanently wrinkled,
 surely out of date--
 your travel-thought
 wasting in its tissue, flesh-corrupt--
 till I've absorbed it,
 like those stitches that dissolve
 in an incision
 where something's been removed.






Birthday Poem
 

First light of day in Mississippi
 son of laborer & of house wife
 it says so on the official photostat
 not son of fisherman & child fugitive
 from cottonfields & potato patches
 from sugarcane chickens & well-water
 from kerosene lamps & watermelons
 mules named jack or jenny & wagonwheels,
  
 years of meaningless farm work
 work Work WORK WORK WORK--
 "Papa pull you outta school bout March
 to stay on the place & work the crop
 --her own earliest knowledge
 of human hopelessness & waste
  
 She carried me around nine months
 inside her fifteen year old self
 before here I sit numbering it all
  
 How I got from then to now
 is the mystery that could fill a whole library
 much less an arbitrary stanza
  
 But of course you already know about that
 from your own random suffering
 & sudden inexplicable bliss






One West Coast
 

for Gordon Lapides
Green is the color of everything
 that isn't brown, the tones ranging
 like mountains, the colors changing.
  
 You look up toward the hills & fog--
 the familiarity of it after so many years
           a resident tourist.
  
                                                    A young man walks
 toward you in vague streetcrossing denims
 & pronounced boots. From the pallor of
           his gait, the orange splotch twin gobs of sunset
           in his shades, from the way he vibrates
           his surrounding air, you can tell, you can tell
                     he's friendly, circulating,
  
                                     he's a Californian: comes to visit,
                               stays for years, marries, moves a wife in,
                          kids, wears out TV sets, get stranded on
                                                 loneliness,
                                         afternoon pharmaceutica,
                                so that the sky's got moon in it by
                                     3 o'clock, is blooo, is blown--
                           
                                                                 The girls: theyre all
                                         winners reared by grandmothers & CBS.
  
                                    Luckier ones get in a few dances with 
                                 mom, a few hours, before dad goes back
                             in the slam, before "G'bye I'm off
                                      to be a singer! & another runaway
                                          Miss American future drifts
                                               over the mountain &
                                                    into the clouds.
  
                                                    Still
             there's a beautifulness about California.
 It's based on the way each eyeblink toward
 the palms & into the orange grove leads backstage
                      into the onionfields.
  
 Unreachable, winter happens inside you.
  
 Your unshaded eyes dilate at the spectacle.
  
 You take trips to contain the mystery.






Aunt
 

She talks too loud, her face
 a blur of wrinkles & sunshine
 where her hard hair shivers
 from laughter like a pine tree
 stiff with oil & hotcombing
  
 O & her anger realer than gasoline
 slung into fire or lighted mohair
 She's a clothes lover from way back
 but her body's too big to be chic
 or on cue so she wear what she want
 People just gotta stand back &
 take it like they do Easter Sunday when
 the rainbow she travels is dry-cleaned
  
 She laughs more than ever in spring
 stomping the downtowns, Saturday past
 work, looking into JC Penney's checking
 out Sears & bragging about how when she
 feel like it she gon lose weight &
 give up smoking one of these sorry days
  
 Her eyes are diamonds of pure dark space
 & the air flying out of them as you look
 close is only the essence of living
 to tell, a full-length woman, an aunt
 brown & red with stalking the years






The Blues Dont Change
 

"Now I'll tell you about theBlues. All Negroes like Blues. Why? Because they was born withthe Blues. And now everybodyhave the Blues. Sometimes they don't know what it is.                 --Leadbelly
And I was born with you, wasn't I, Blues?
 Wombed with you, wounded, reared and forwarded
 from address to address, stamped, stomped
 and returned to sender by nobody else but you,
 Blue Rider, writing me off every chance you
 got, you mean old grudgeful-hearted, table-
 turning demon, you, you sexy soul-sucking gem.
  
 Blue diamond in the rough, you are forever.
 You can't be outfoxed don't care how they cut
 and smuggle and shine you on,  you're like a
 shadow, too dumb and stubborn and necessary
 to let them turn you into what you ain't
 with color or theory or powder or paint.
  
 That's how you can stay in style without sticking
 and not getting stuck. You know how to sting
 where I can't scratch, and you move from frying
 pan to skillet the same way you move people
 to go to wiggling their bodies, juggling their
 limbs, loosening that goose, upping their voices,
 opening their pores, rolling their hips and lips.
  
 They can shake their boodies but they can't shake you.






My Heart
 

"Do it, yells the man across the street to his motorcycle.
 We each meet the day in our own way.
 The aquarium with three unspent goldfish buzzes.
 Three flies are flying.
 Coffee, traceable to dark, wet trees in Central America, cools.
 The black cat on my lap hates poetry, even the sound of it being typed.
 My skull and the falling stars sing back and forth the songs of magnets
               in heat.
 A car with a broken muffler hums along, mumbling answers to questions
               I haven't shaped yet.
 What is a life?
 Stacks of typing paper wait to be darkened, dented.
 On my white wall a photograph of the poet James Galvin
 (cut out from the American Poetry Review).
 Sometimes I want to be:
  
               1.  an American 
               2.  a poet
               3.  reviewed
  
 James looks like a farmboy (Iowa, Iowa, you have more poets than
               scarecrows these fuse-lit days).
 How carelessly James sits back on his hips, staring into the camera's eye.
 (Imprisoned inside there is the last surviving Cyclops),
 and I think of W. C. W.'s lines:
  
                the beauty of / terrible faces.
  
 When my face opens like James's, it is a year later, years later.
 Some life is gone.
 Only poems remain.
 Perhaps a poem that a magazine wanted to publish before it folded
                ("folded, the flight of such a word).
 And so the poem is stuck on a roll without a player piano.
 Imagination insists on saving its works as a poem, a tattoo, a quilt, an
               essay, or an aside, like this one:
  
                                        LOVE'S CHILLY NIGHT
  
                         an angel's cold hand
                         irons leaves into
                         this flat romance
  
                         colors distract us
                         from stems rotting
                         under our own feet
  
                         an angel burdens
                         our night with
                         its little laughs
  
                         as a derisive white
                         moon freezes
                         far from a fire
  
 Even as I type this my coffee is cold; the peasants who picked the beans are
                sleeping; bottles of erasing fluids await their inevitable moments.
 I lose this moment.
 I'm dancing in the rain with a witch from San Carlos: Botta--is it you?
 Her red skirt turns like one solid year of sunsets.
 I almost catch her, but I'm back to this moment.
 Just in time to send you, my friends, another telegram.
 Here, Wordsworth's worthy words.
  
                (I know I will have to bear their cost.)
  
                CLING (STOP) TOGETHER (STOP) IN (STOP)
                             ONE (STOP) SOCIETY (STOP)
                                             RANE (STOP)
  
 BUT THE WORDS WON'T STOP and what do I owe?
  
 On my desk: a dictionary.
 All mine, my mine.
  
 Words like "lacrimator wait for me,
              lak re mat ar
 which means:
  
              1.  the lake really matters
              2.  the lilac reddens into matters of the air
              3.  the lack of the red mats in the attic
  
 YES! 
 All of the above and below.
  
 One of the flies has landed on a photograph of me hiding behind
              Japanese fans.
 I stare at the fly staring at the me who no longer exists.
 I will not exist soon.
 I'm here, behind the typewriter.
 Men don't split into new personae at the command of flashes.
  
 We can become fleshless though, like the skeletons in Mexican
              cathedrals, guardians of empty confessionals.
 In my room, I stare into a smaller box:
  
              "a brooding young man embraces
              a golden girl whose blue dress
  
              has the words forget Xanadu'
              stitched into it while dice without
  
              numbers float in the air suspended
              between a far Heaven and a near Earth
  
              as a black spider crawls toward
              the blind moon. A gray feather's
  
              sleep on a blackening hill is
              a hint of uncompleted journeys
  
 My neighbor comes home on his slow, red motorcycle and enters this
              poem again.
 The miles hum between his legs.
  
 One of the flies has bitten me.
 The black cat darkens all the windows by jumping sill to sill.
 The goldfish haven't lost their glitter.
 At last, this is my land.
 I've learned to speak its language:
 America, I give you the power to break my heart.






Orchid & Eurydice
 

In one version you must convince every living thing one by one
 to weep until he climbs back into the marriage-house,
 that earth about which it is said that bread is the glue of the earth.
 Certainly glue is money, the phrase "the tears of things is money,
 the revelation of the Woman Clothed in the Sun is money.
 The lake is a disc of bright money buying a few plain birds down,
 they climb back nervously as you hurry through, plain birds like a
                                                                                                    plain song,
 that moment when four or five are around your knees
 like Zeno's arrow, rising by halves, like Eurydice's bread,
 & still the possibility they might intersect,
 you would be the one who was struck by a flying bird,
 somewhere between a blessd fool & village idiot,
 the only one to persist outside the local economy,
 drooling at travelers, holding yourself, slinging incomprehensible
                                                                                                    advice,
 you would learn the trick with museum wire
 where you snap the heads off quiet animals in front of the store,
 tempted equally by science & dirty work. . . .
  
 I am trying to invent a way for you to buy me back--






Royal
 

They moved across the screen like a computer simulation.
 They moved across the screen like complex models & we learned
                                       to call this a nature show.
 Animals but set in gray shades for video capture with a lighter area for
      the face.
 Almost white they moved across the screen like a compressed
      meditation.
 But the song was never familiar.
 Because this was the only room this was the only room where we
      undressed--:
                                       that was the plot.
 They moved across the screen across the room but it was not happening
      to us.
 The image burning in.
 Coated with hair & then a lighter area for the face meaning exposed
      skin.
 We have learned to wear the architecture despite the sky's numerous
      advances.
 All these things--the speed & the music & the room--happened but 
      not enough.
 We undressed in the room we could not take off where I handcuffed
      you to the story.
 This is the work of the brain--itself a bloody spring or electric wire
                                       wrapped in ripe gray gauze--
                                       you like it.
 (2 lobes resembling the holy tablets delivered into the veldt's dry
      speed--the Laws
                                       prefigured in the neutral network's burning thicket.)
 They moved across the screen howling but the sound turned down.
 This happened over & over again--the blue light leaking into the
      room like sand.
 Burning into the brain in a finery of filamental fire.
 The Laws which do not unravel into noise & make a kind of story of
      kinked plot
                                       which can't be straightened like a motel wire
                                       hanger looped around your wrists.
 The loop like a computer simulation--the thought of the thought--
                                       the image burning in now.
 We began to understand what they were--:
                                       the Thou & the shalt & the not






Field Effect
 

For 8 months he lay in bed over the
  
 difference between "the bell rings & "he rings
  
 the bell. Did those 2 "rings SOUND
  
 DIFFERENT? The invisible disturbance which
  
 is the bell's vibration beating at the air--a
  
 FIELD EFFECT--does it shift with the
  
 ringer's will? This, he thought, was the 
  
 smallest difference between things which the
  
 human mind could hold (or almost hold, the
  
 thought-of-it falling away from the thinking,
  
 a penny rolling to the horizon & so to
  
 sleep . . .). He couldn't get up. It became clear
  
 that he was the murderer. Everyone knows. A
  
 man standing at a podium reads from notes.
  
 In the audience people nod in immaculate
  
 suits, women & men. When I am done
  
 someone will transcribe what I say into speech.
  
 It will not resemble my notes. He is just THE
  
 THING between his notes & his speech. This is
  
 only fair, that he be the air. Some of the
  
 women wear hats with feathers in them, wild,
  
 candescent. In the audience is a boy named B,
  
 not the letter, not the note. Another sound,
  
 neither letter nor note--






New England Graveyard
 

Back of the church the busy forsythias bow
 and scrape to May and all these blessed stones
 stiff in their careful finery of words;
 the mess of markers makes me go and browse.
  
 Somehow the blocks of slate and marble hate
 to be cut and carved to the dimensions
 of Mary Monday's age and her virtues.
 At heart they hurt to be made literate
 and they are rebelling, fast as they can,
 shedding an edge, a letter, as they go
 --a year, a part of a skull, a bone--
 it hurts them to stand so long for this
 kind of death not theirs. Fast as they can
 they are leaning away from their duty
 and look down longing for the warm sod.
 The prides and fears they stand witness to,
 the ladies and gents, are only whimsy now.
 They cease to reflect that wary pride
 the flesh beneath them took in lying down.
 To the last date line and death's-head-stare,
 the legend reads, "There! I've done it!
 But these are only beginning,
 the blocks of shale forget their lines
 letting the sunlight and rain divide
 and subdivide their veins and bone.
 They do not care, they only feel 
 an unnatural heaviness, tottering so
 in the hot light. They long to be off and away,
 they toss and jibe in the sun;
 a whole regatta of black sails, they are sailing away
 over the lumpy green yard of time, and never
 coming about for home until they capsize
 turned turtle by boys from Central Square.
  
 Tired of holding--they are tired of holding up;
 their always-leaning makes me hold my tongue
 and sit with them awhile. We heave
 our shoulders, or our shadows, on the mounds,
 while under the hills, memorials more fine
 lie lip to paper lip
                                  and keep their impossible word.






Roofs
 

Sewn straw, exact pattern. Fields of rice-sprigs
 evenly set, a mile of herringbone tweed.
 The town, a sea of gunmetal, fish-scale tiles.
  
 By morning each floor a casserole of pillows,
 coverlets, comforters, towels:    flown nests. Imprint
 of bodies, fading. They fold the beds away,
 the room waits empty all day.
                                                        All day the bodies
 circle, leaving no impression on each
 other. Tooled in the foundry of the streets.
 School-caps, factory-packed subway, miracle train:
 one territorial imperative,
 an emperor's.
                           On his platform one yard square
 perched on a roof that slopes in waves of tiles
 up toward other tiled cascades, the karate student
 for  hours does running in place, deep knee bends
 on his surfboard perch. All his free time to make
 his body efficient, tight, exact, rising
 and falling, mint piston pumping in its shaft.






Student Letter
 

After the declaration by emperor
 to stop the war
 many people in Tokyo killed themselves,
 for instance, in front of the imperial palace.
 But few people knows those facts.
  
 Hence you must teach me
 where you got the news or what sort of book
 gave you the fact that quite few people knows.
 To know the fact of our nation's subjection
 is not so comfortable
 but the fact of many people's spontaneous death
 gives me more complicated feelings.
  
 In the matter of what William Gass said
 I must describe my feelings. I went
 to Nagasaki
 on an educational trip four years ago.
 I can recollect those serious moment
 which was given by the beamed materials
 in the memorial hall.
  
 But most youth after the war
 are indifferent to those
 nightmares
 because of our no experience. Surely,
 I think, those barbarious conducts
 shouldn't be forgiven or forgotten at all
 and we must not close our eyes
 to the rebombing
 at any place
 in this world.
  
 In conclusion I may say that most people
 except sufferers
 or the like
 will not have ill feelings toward your country
 but they will reproach
 the suffocative fact
 in history.
  
 Where were you when the World War II was over.
 Please share your experience of the war with me.
 I'm now interested in the wars concerned with Japan
 for the past 100 years. If you tell me your reflections
 I can suspect more seriously.
 You have abandoned such cursed things as useless?
 In that war 3 million people were killed
 on the side of our nation, especially
 three hundred thousand people by the A-bomb.
 Over the war between the imperialism
 and militarism America won a victory.
 What does this word mean?





Charley
 

                                 Minnesota, May 1945                                                                                DMZ, September 1967 

                  1
  
 In Tokyo our gallant boys
 dance rock-and-roll, squint eyes
 wary at standing easy. They leer and reel
 on a springboard tip and then
 jackknife toward the electronic noise . . .
  
 And Charley, when Time Inc. said he said
 the President had his head
 wedged about Vietnam
                    burning for honor or--who knows?
 the Action he had said--
                    married the Marines.
 He showered for vows on those
  
 who took his word who taught him
 shoot it out and shout "Yes Sir Yes Sir!
                    and sent him out like napalm
 obedient to any itchy finger.
  
 I hope the fields of Minnesota gave perspective
 when he moved out
                                      as to the starting line
 on the command, survive, survive.
  
. . . our juiced doughboys feel their girls.
  
                  2
  
               What
 did I tell you 

when we met
 last and it
  
 "after the leeches and the food
 on a break
                    in the rain
 was already up with you, Charley?
  
 Mouthing the big cigar
 like a gangster at the wheel . . .
  
                    cigarette between thumb and finger
                    the way we all even in junior high
                    learned not to
                    your men watching in wonder
  
                    him tasting the strange
                             (turned officer so young)
                    foreign taste
                    that smoke:     and all was dark
                           except what sparks
                    he scattered there, stubbing it out
  
 What could we do for you
  
 you hugging your knees
  
                    who taught you
                    to raise your voice?
  
                  3
  
 No more the wide Mankato pearled with ice
                   under blue January sky
 your arm around the shoulder of the friend who ran faster
 no more the long hours pad in hand composing
                   reasons for your belief
 a belief in fathers has no reason
  
 no more the simple passion of going first
 your hatless straightness, the struggle, the deep worry,
                   the dark Africa of being alive in a country
                   run by chiefs without tribes
 no more of all that, only your 
                   brief beauty in many hearts
 in a time when fathers bury their sons, and you
                   surrounded, cut down
 in a war you were fated never to see,
                   blinded by love for all men.






Earth Day Story
 

I remember the dusty floorboards of wood in the streetcar
 Of the Minneapolis Street Railway Company
 And the varnished yellow banquettes of tight-knit rattan
 Worn smooth by decades of passengers
 The worn gleaming brass grips at the corners of the seats
 And the motorman's little bell
 Windows trembling in their casings as we crossed the avenue
 Liberty dimes falling softly into the steel-rimmed hour glass
 The gnarled hand of the motorman near.
 My grandmother arranged herself against the seat
 Her back as straight as a soldier's beside me
 Her navy hat with velvet band
 And net veil down making her head seem distant,
 Her dreaming smile and the patient Roman nose,
 A repose so deep; from my place
 I watched her when we rode like princes
 Rattling past traffic stopped on the granite cobbles
 Riding downtown together, my hands in hers;
 All that so much
 That I love yet but feel no sadness for, that
 Time crossed out like the trolley tracks taken up
 Or entombed under the pliant blacktop of the modernized. 





Gulf Memo
 

Tell me the way to the wedding
 Tell me the way to the war,
 Tell me the needle you're threading
 I won't raise my voice anymore.
  
 And tell me what axe you are grinding
 Where the boy on the bivouac believes,
 What reel you are unwinding
 For the girl in her bed who grieves.
  
 While behind a derrick's girder
 He watches the sinking sun,
 He asks what he'll do for murder
 And what he will do for fun.
  
 Will you read him the ways of war
 His Miranda rights in sin,
 Will you tell him what to ignore
 When he studies your discipline?
  
 He dozes off--but he shakes
 In a dream that he is the one
 Death finds abed and wakes
 Just as the night is done.
  
 Tell me what boats go ashore
 Riding the oil-dimmed tide,
 Red streamers and black in store
 For the boy with a pain in his side.
  
 And tell me where they are heading
 Tonight; now tell me the score.
 Tell me the way to their wedding
 I won't raise my own voice anymore.






Photo of Melville; Back Room, Old Bookstore
 

I passed him by at first. From the photograph
 Peered sepia eyes, blindered, unappeased
 From a lair of brows and beard: one not amazed
 At anything, as if to have looked enough
 Then turned aside worked best for him--as if
 Night vision was the discipline that eased
 The weight of what he saw. A man's gaze posed
 Too long in the sun goes blank; comes to grief.
 That face could be a focus for this back room,
 For pack-rat papers strewn as if in rage,
 Fond notes unread: each wary eye a phial
 Unstopped to let huge Melville out, to calm
 The sea of pages; Melville in older age:
 The grown man's sleepy defiance of denial.






Semele Recycled
 

After you left me forever,
 I was broken into pieces,
 and all the pieces flung into the river.
 Then the legs crawled ashore
 and aimlessly wandered the dusty cow-track.
 They became, for a while, a simple roadside shrine:
 A tiny table set up between the thighs
 held a dusty candle, weed-and-fieldflower chains
 placed reverently there by children and old women.
 My knees were hung with tin triangular medals
 to cure all forms of hysterical disease.
  
 After I died forever in the river,
 my torso floated, bloated in the stream,
 catching on logs or stones among the eddies.
 White water foamed around it, then dislodged it;
 after a whirlwind trip, it bumped ashore.
 A grizzled old man who scavenged along the banks
 had already rescued my arms and put them by,
 knowing everything has its uses, sooner or later.
  
 When he found my torso, he called it his canoe,
 and, using my arms as paddles,
 he rowed me up and down the scummy river.
 When catfish nibbled my fingers he scooped them up
 and blessed his reusable bait.
 Clumsy but serviceable, that canoe!
 The trail of blood that was its wake
 attracted the carp and eels, and the river turtle,
 easily landed, dazed by my tasty red.
  
 A young lad found my head among the rushes
 and placed it on a dry stone.
 He carefully combed my hair with a bit of shell
 and set small offerings before it
 which the birds and rats obligingly stole at night,
 so it seemed I ate.
 And the breeze wound through my mouth and empty sockets
 so my lungs would sigh, and my dead tongue mutter.
 Attached to my throat like a sacred necklace
 was a circlet of small snails.
 Soon the villagers came to consult my oracular head
 with its waterweed crown.
 Seers found occupation, interpreting sighs,
 and their papyrus rolls accumulated.
  
 Meanwhile, young boys retrieved my eyes
 they used for marbles in a simple game
 till somebody's pretty sister snatched at them
 and set them, for luck, in her bridal diadem.
 Poor girl! When her future groom caught sight of her,
 all eyes, he crossed himself in horror,
 and stumbled away in haste
 through her dowered meadows.
  
 What then of my heart and organs,
 my sacred slit
 which loved you best of all?
 They were caught in a fisherman's net
 and tossed at night into a pen for swine.
 But they shone so by moonlight that the sows stampeded,
 trampled one another in fear, to get away.
 And the fisherman's wife, who had thirteen living children
 and was contemptuous of holy love,
 raked the rest of me onto the compost heap.
  
 Then in their various places and helpful functions,
 the altar, oracle, offal, canoe and oars
 learned the wild rumor of your return.
 The altar leapt up, and ran to the canoe,
 scattering candle grease and wilted grasses.
 Arms sprang to their sockets, blind hands with nibbled nails
 groped their way, aided by loud lamentation,
 to the bed of the bride, snatched up those unlucky eyes
 from her discarded veil and diadem, 
 and rammed them home. Oh, what a bright day it was!
 This empty body danced on the riverbank.
 Hollow, it called and searched among the fields
 for those parts that steamed and simmered in the sun,
 and never would have found them.
  
 But then your great voice rang out under the skies
 my name!--and all those private names
 for the parts and places that had loved you best.
 And they stirred in their nest of hay and dung.
 The distraught old ladies chasing their lost altar,
 and the seers pursuing my skull, their lost employment,
 and the tumbling boys, who wanted the magic marbles,
 and the runaway groom, and the fisherman's thirteen children
 set up such a clamor, with their cries of "Miracle!
 that our two bodies met like a thunderclap
 in midday--right at the corner of that wretched field
 with its broken fenceposts and startled, skinny cattle.
 We fell in a heap on the compost heap
 and all our loving parts made love at once,
 while the bystanders cheered and prayed and hid their eyes
 and then went decently about their business.
  
 And here it is, moonlight again; we've bathed in the river
 and are sweet and wholesome once more.
 We kneel side by side in the sand;
 we worship each other in whispers.
 But the inner parts remember fermenting hay,
 the comfortable odor of dung, the animal incense,
 and passion, its bloody labor,
 its birth and rebirth and decay.






Food of Love
 

Eating is touch carried to the bitter end.                                                                                           Samuel Butler II 
I'm going to murder you with love;
 I'm going to suffocate you with embraces;
 I'm going to hug you, bone by bone,
 Till you're dead all over.
 Then I will dine on your delectable marrow.
  
 You will become my personal Sahara;
 I'll sun myself in you, then with one swallow
 Drain your remaining brackish well.
 With my female blade I'll carve my name
 In your most aspiring palm
 Before I chop it down.
 Then I'll inhale your last oasis whole.
  
 But in the total desert you become
 You'll see me stretch, horizon to horizon,
 Opulent mirage!
 Wisteria balconies dripping cyclamen.
 Vistas ablaze with crystal, laced in gold.
  
 So you will summon each dry grain of sand
 And move toward me in undulating dunes
 Till you arrive at sudden ultramarine:
 A Mediterranean to stroke your dusty shores;
 Obstinate verdure, creeping inland, fast renudes
 Your barrens; succulents spring up everywhere,
 Surprising life! And I will be that green.
  
 When you are fed and watered, flourishing
 With shoots entwining trellis, dome, and spire,
 Till you are resurrected field in bloom,
 I will devour you, my natural food,
 My host, my final supper on the earth,
 And you'll begin to die again.





Afternoon Happiness
 

for John
At a party I spy a handsome psychiatrist,
 And wish, as we all do, to get her advice for free.
 Doctor, I'll say, I'm supposed to be a poet.
 All life's awfulness has been grist to me.
 We learn that happiness is a Chinese meal,
 While sorrow is a nourishment forever.
 My new environment is California Dreamer.
 I'm fearful I'm forgetting how to brood.
 And, Doctor, another thing has got me worried:
 I'm not drinking as much as I should . . .
  
 At home, I want to write a happy poem
 On love, or a love poem of happiness.
 But they won't do, the tensions of every day,
 The rub, the minor abrasions of any two
 Who share one space. Ah, there's no substitute for tragedy!
 But in this chapter, tragedy belongs
 To that other life, the old life before us.
 Here is my aphorism of the day:
 Happy people are monogamous.
 Even in California. So how does the poem play
  
 Without the paraphernalia of betrayal and loss?
 I don't have a jealous eye or fear
 And neither do you. In truth, I'm fond
 Of your ex-mate, whom I name "my wife-in-law.
 My former husband, that old disaster, is now just funny,
 So laugh we do, in what Cyril Connolly
 Has called the endless, nocturnal conversation
 Of marriage. Which may be the best part.
 Darling, must I love you in light verse
 Without the tribute of profoundest art?
  
 Of course it won't last. You will break my heart
 Or I yours, by dying. I could weep over that.
 But now it seems forced, here in these heaven hills,
The mourning doves mourning, the squirrels mating,
 My old cat warm in my lap, here on our terrace
 As from below comes a musical cursing
 As you mend my favorite plate. Later of course
 I could pick a fight; there is always material in that.
 But we don't come from fighting people, those
 Who scream out red-hot iambs in their hate.
  
 No, love, the heavy poem will have to come
 From temps perdu, fertile with pain, or perhaps
 Detonated by terrors far beyond this place
 Where the world rends itself, and its tainted waters
 Rise in the east to erode our safety here.
 Much as I want to gather a lifetime thrift
 And craft, my cunning skills tied in a knot for you,
 There is only this useless happiness as gift.





Into These Knots
 

Tell us how the soul is bound and bentinto these knots, and whether any ever frees itself from such imprisonment. --Canto XII, Inferno 

I say, Without a God there is no hell.
 There's only this--. She rustles for her keys.
 The apple tree sheds petal after petal.
  
 She says, Let's take you to the hospital.
 The petals spin like sparks. I close my eyes 
 and say, Without a God there is no hell,
  
 and there is only this. It's just as well.
 The lawn is red and white. She asks, Who says?
 How do you know? The wind fells every petal.
  
 She says, Let's take you to the hospital.
 I cannot breathe. I cannot tell her, Yes--.
 Because without a God there is no hell,
  
 as she whispers, Talk to me, I know I will
 clamber--but not toward heaven, toward the sky,
 eyes winking behind petal after petal.
  
 The rope-burnt bark will flake away and fall.
 Knot on my neck, the rest would be so easy:
 I'll pray, Without a God there is no hell,
 then slip through petals--through petal after petal.






The Unquarried Blue of Those Depths Is All But Blinding
 

for John Fogleman

There are some things we just don't talk about--
 Not even in the morning, when we're waking,
 When your calloused fingers tentatively walk
 The slope of my waist:
                                          How love's a rust-worn boat,
 Abandoned at the dock--and who could doubt
 Waves lick their teeth, eyeing its hull? We're taking
 Our wreckage as a promise, so we don't talk.
 We wet the tired oars, tide drawing us out.
  
 We understand there's nothing to be said.
 Both of us know the dangers of this sea,
 Warned by the tide-worn driftwood of our pasts--.
 But we've already strayed from the harbor. We thread
 A slow wake though the water--then silently,
 We start to row, and will for as long as this lasts.






Brad Pitt, Kevin Bacon, and the Brown Boys Mother
 

          
          When he wakes up out of sleep, the brown boy remembers two things: his white man calls and breaks the groans of Kevin Bacon, naked and writhing in pain on a hard and wet black street. Bacon has been beaten with broken bottles and has had his chest smashed in with a large flaming couch section. A mob of whites poured gasoline all over his chiseled stomach and then lit him afire. Brad Pitt lay next to him, his stomach breathless and glistening in the flame's light.     The brown boy knows this is somewhere between movie and dream, staring at each stomach; but more importantly, he knows that despite the fire, the bodies did not burn. They did not char or turn black. They simply shined in sweat.     The brown boy will commit to his memory, most, Brad Pitt's dying, and how he eventually turned over on his stomach, his penis turned down and scrape fucking the street--Brad Pitt ejaculating and on fire, the liquid shooting out of him as he looked up, staggered to his feet to let out something between groaning and laughter out to the black sky. Though Pitt had been beaten with bottles and wood, it was not clear where he was hurt, only that he was a screaming surface, dripping with lit gasoline and semen.     As the brown boy ponders this surface, the white man has chosen to phone his brown boy. Their first conversation of the day is bound by this scene--and dutifully, for the white man, he wants to start from the beginning:   Brad Pitt and Kevin Bacon are in a boxing ring in the middle of a football field. They are both wearing white boxer shorts, no gloves, and about to perform a dance routine. I am standing next to them, looking at Brad Pitt's hair flop down over his face. He smiles at me before the music starts. From everywhere, broken glass bottles hurl at their bodies, and they are splashed with gasoline. We are also in a dark alley lit by fire. The two are still standing, looking over at me, though I can't tell who is smiling. I only know Brad Pitt winks at me while Kevin Bacon is on the street, writhing as a large white flaming couch section is smashed onto his chest.   My mother was dead in the dream. I was looking through a dense stash of clothes in a cabinet. All of them were soiled, and none of the clothes were hers. I remember holding a pair of purple and green Speedos that were woven to a pair of matching polyester tennis shorts. These shorts were my father's. I remember my mother making all of his tennis shorts. I also remember pulling out a pair of long sweatpants that were much too large for my mother and holding them up as crumbs fell from the legs. I tried to smell them, wanting to think of her alive.        What the brown boy doesn't say is that he wondered, in the dream, how his father was getting through this--living alone with only her smell left behind. Or how he pulled the sweatpants up to his nose and mouth, absorbing the whole of her scent through his body. Without revealing his father's grief or his own, the brown boy breathes in the smell of Giorgio mixed with eleven years of shifts at the convalescent home, and gives the white man what he thought he wanted. He quickly shot to the end, where Brad Pitt grinds his fat cock in the pavement, the curve of it pushing down bent and spewing semen into the street.   Kevin Bacon stands up and groans, laughing as his bowels leak from his stomach. I was thinking about that before you called.        The brown boy knows the white man wants to hear the brown boy rise from sleep, hear the spill from his head in the morning without saying a word. Though this morning, to this dream, the white man has two responses: He calls the dream bizarre and says nothing about the brown boy's mother, only I feel sorry for Brad Pitt.





The Unnatural Apologie of Shadows
 

We say lightning has no wings
 when it slides down our houses
  
 We say loss is just a condition
 we acquire to bury our pity further
  
 We say the bleeding hands
 on the table filled with red wine
 imported products and passports
 are just reminders of 
 who we have become
  
 We have no titles no birthright
 no groves or Shakespeare
 to return to
  
 We apologize for the fear
 growing out of our ribs
  
 Apologize for the numbers
 still etched on our tongues






Love and Strange HorsesIntima
 

--
  
 One hundred breaths split the air
 as I lean
 on the only pine tree I find.
 It's early or late, it's breezy or hot.
 The fields are dry. Summer is near.
 The horses are everywhere, 
 strangely galloping a dream,
 but I can't remember
 how to call them,
 so I stand back, watch them pass.
  
  
 --
  
 The first time I rode a horse
 my body found the music of fire,
 crackling the wind. An unbearable pleasure
 that also left me with a burn on the side of my leg.
 A sign, the horsekeeper told me, of longing.
 A need to return--to belong.
 After all, departure is like
 pushing the weight of our heart
 against the village
 whose name has kept us awake.
  
  
 --
  
 Rafael came from somewhere in Eurasia.
 I passed my hands through his mane--
 saw a history of conquests and battles,
 a field of hay, a mount of truth,
 heard a silent ring,
 his eyes asking me to go with him,
 to confess something sacred,
 to name something lustful.
 Nothing of where he came from, 
 or who I was, disturbed us.
  
  
 --
  
 I knew he was different by the way he ran--
 without pause,
 without grace,
 without distraction,
 without ease.
 He was told how to move in the world
 and resented it.
 He knew he would never own anything.
  
  
 --
  
 He came toward me.
 It was a quiet afternoon.
 I stood unmoving.
 And we listened to the untitled music
 circling the earth like an anthem
 free of its nation.
  
  
 --
  
 He was unfamiliar to me, 
 approaching as if he possessed the land.
 Every morning he stopped five feet
 from the river.






Les ventails, Portraits of Passion
 

The shadows of birds fading on a fighter's back
  
 The undressing of words on an unstamped postcard
  
 The wet swings in the distant park
  
 The jealousy of raindrops on the umbrella of lovers
  
 The laughter of a boy before a bird
  
 The song of two flutes, two swords, two bracelets, two fingers
  
 The stare of a wave before a pearl
  
 The yearning between the legs of a farmer's wife
  
 The opening of doors             closing midday
  
 The sudden howling of our muse--and 
  
 les ventails--disturbing the guest inside of us






Interesting Times
 

Everything's happening on the cusp of tragedy, the tip of comedy, the pivot of event.
 You want a placid life, find another planet. This one is occupied with the story's arc:
 About to happen, on the verge, horizontal. You want another planet, try the moon.
 Try any of the eight, try Planet X. It's out there somewhere, black with serenity.
 How interesting will our times become? How much more interesting can they become?
  
 A crow with something dangling from its beak flaps onto a telephone pole top, daintily,
 And croaks its victory to other crows and tries to keep its morsel to itself.
 A limp shape, leggy, stunned, drops from the black beak's scissors like a rag.
 We drive past, commenting, and looking upward. A sunny morning, too cold to be nesting,
 Unless that is a nest the crow has seized, against the coming spring.
  
 We've been at this historical site before, but not in any history we remember.
 The present has been cloaked in cloud before, and not on any holy mountaintop.
 To know the stars will one day fly apart so far they can't be seen
 Is almost a relief. For the future flies in one direction--toward us.
 And the only way to sidestep it--the only way--is headed this way, too.
  
 So, look. That woman's got a child by the hand. She's dragging him across the street.
 He's crying and she's shouting, but we see only dumbshow. Their breath is smoke.
 Will she give in and comfort him? Will he concede at last? We do not know.
 Their words are smoke. In a minute they'll be somewhere else entirely.
 Everyone in a minute will be somewhere else entirely. As the crow flies.






Five Psalms
 

1. 
 Let us think of God as a lover
        Who never calls,
 Whose pleasure in us is aroused
        In unrepeatable ways,
 God as a body we cannot
        Separate from desire,
 Saying to us, "Your love
        Is only physical.
 Let us think of God as a bronze
        With green skin
 Or a plane that draws the eye close
        To the texture of paint.
 Let us think of God as life,
        A bacillus or virus,
 As death, an igneous rock
        In a quartz garden.
 Then, let us think of kissing
        God with the kisses
 Of our mouths, of lying with God,
        As sea worms lie,
 Snugly petrifying
        In their coral shirts.
 Let us think of ourselves
        As part of God,
 Neither alive nor dead,
        But like Alpha, Omega,
 Glyphs and hieroglyphs,
        Numbers, data.
  
  
 2.
 First forgive the silence
        That answers prayer,
 Then forgive the prayer
        That stains the silence.
  
 Excuse the absence
        That feels like presence,
 Then excuse the feeling
        That insists on presence.
  
 Pardon the delay
        Of revelation,
 Then ask pardon for revealing
        Your impatience.
  
 Forgive God
        For being only a word,
 Then ask God to forgive
        The betrayal of language.

 The new day cancels dread
        And dawn forgives all sins,
 All the judgments of insomnia,
        As if they were only dreams.
  
 The ugly confrontation
        After midnight, with the mirror,
 Turns white around the edges
        And burns away like frost.
  
 Daylight undoes gravity
        And lightness responds to the light.
 The new day lifts all weight,
        Like stepping off into space.
  
 Where is that room you woke to,
        By clock-light, at 3 a.m.?
 Nightmare's many mansions,
        Falling, have taken it with them.
  
 The new day, the day's newness,
        And the wretchedness that, you thought,
 Would never, never depart,
        Meet--and there is goodbye.
  
 A bad night lies ahead
        And a new day beyond that--
 A simple sequence, but hard
        To remember in the right order.
  
 5. 
 Lord of dimensions and the dimensionless,
 Wave and particle, all and none,
  
 Who lets us measure the wounded atom,
 Who lets us doubt all measurement,
  
 When in this world we betray you
 Let us be faithful in another.






The Truly Great
 

I think continually of those who were truly great.
 Who, from the womb, remembered the soul's history
 Through corridors of light, where the hours are suns,
 Endless and singing. Whose lovely ambition
 Was that their lips, still touched with fire,
 Should tell of the Spirit, clothed from head to foot in song.
 And who hoarded from the Spring branches
 The desires falling across their bodies like blossoms.
  
 What is precious, is never to forget
 The essential delight of the blood drawn from ageless springs
 Breaking through rocks in worlds before our earth.
 Never to deny its pleasure in the morning simple light
 Nor its grave evening demand for love.
 Never to allow gradually the traffic to smother
 With noise and fog, the flowering of the spirit.
  
 Near the snow, near the sun, in the highest fields,
 See how these names are fted by the waving grass
 And by the streamers of white cloud
 And whispers of wind in the listening sky.
 The names of those who in their lives fought for life,
 Who wore at their hearts the fire's centre.
 Born of the sun, they travelled a short while toward the sun
 And left the vivid air signed with their honour.






Dust
 

Someone spoke to me last night,
told me the truth. Just a few words,
but I recognized it.
I knew I should make myself get up,
write it down, but it was late,
and I was exhausted from working
all day in the garden, moving rocks.
Now, I remember only the flavor --
not like food, sweet or sharp.
More like a fine powder, like dust.
And I wasn't elated or frightened,
but simply rapt, aware.
That's how it is sometimes --
God comes to your window,
all bright light and black wings,
and you're just too tired to open it.






In the Event of Change
 

I am saying primroses lined the pathway of toothless hedges.

I am saying the ocean shimmered like corrugated steel in the 
morning sun.

The context of my story changes when you enter. Then I am dung
on the wall of the nomad's field. Then the everyday waking person.

I am nodding in your direction like fissures between dandelion fur.
Seeing in your manner.

I am speaking your pace. Slippage of silk slippers.

I say you are losing sight. I say your breasts are dry shells.

I am afraid of what I am capable of doing.

This is all a manner of stating how I prepare myself to be loved.





She Is
 

          
          Her voice is a roundness. On full moon days, she talks about renouncing meat but the butcher has his routine. And blood.M's wisdom. Still reliable.There are sounds we cannot hear but understand in motion. Slicing of air with hips. Crushing grass, saying these are my feet. I want my feet in my shadow. Suffice to meet desires halfway.Quiet. We say her chakras are in place.When the thermos shatters, she knows the direction of its spill. She knows how to lead and follow. Know her from this.Sounds we cannot hear. The wind blows and we say it is cool.Night slips under the door. We are tucked into bed and kissed a fleeting one. Through the curtains, her voice loosens like thread from an old blanket, row upon row. We watch her teeth in the dark and read her words. She speaks in perfect order, facing where the breeze can tug it towards canals stretching for sound.Her faith abides by the cycle of the moon. See how perfect she is.





In between
 

          
          Late for the feast. Let me guess, she said, everything workedagainst you.Some pulverize experiences at the pool. When the air slaps, theyflip into the water and speak of the excitations of distress. Thestratagems of delivering an annulled emotion. And how is one to read a nod? Is a nod an exclamation?Does one kiss after a nod?A woman mutters something about the tea being too weak.The walls threaten to expose us, shadows pinch as we mutterjouissance, jouissance, while the university teacher said the use ofthe word was a considerable error. A most lamentable error, givenhalf of us are illiterate and unattached. Think of words in theirsystem of birth. Now do you see, the teacher said. Ah, see.Dogs were barking for no reason.Some of us went to the ghats and watched the dead burn. Womanin white wailed, her hair a dumb struck line against her rockingspine. We look for other distractions in a place of death.In the afternoon meanings are extolled.We are asked to name our loves. I will not, he said, use commonlanguage to talk of love. I will not jump into the substancewithout reinforcement. He took his body to the breeze andswayed till we begged him to stop. The rain subsided but we werestill wet.Thousands have died in a nod.
        




Bardo
 

A hundred and one butter lamps are offered to my uncle who
is no more.

Distraction proves fatal in death. A curtain of butter imprints
in air.

After the burning of bones, ashes are sent on pilgrimage. You are
dead, go into life, we pray. My uncle was a man given to giggles
in solemn moments.

Memory springs like crocuses in bloom. Self conscious and
precise.

Without blurring the cornea, details are resuscitated. Dried yak
meat between teeth. Semblance of what is.

Do not be distracted, Uncle who is no more.

He does not see his reflection in the river. The arching of speech
over "s as he is becoming.

Curvature of spine as it cracked on a misty morning. A shadow
evades the wall.

You are no more, Uncle who is no more.

Every seven days he must relive his moment of expiration.
The living pray frequently amid burning juniper.

Communication efforts require the right initiative.

Somewhere along the line matters of motion and rest are resolved.

Crows pick the last offerings. You are someone else, uncle no 
more.






Two Paintings by Gustav Klimt
 

Although what glitters
         on the trees,
row after perfect row,
        is merely
the injustice 
        of the world,

the chips on the bark of each
        beech tree
catching the light, the sum
        of these delays
is the beautiful, the human
        beautiful,

body of flaws.
        The dead
would give anything
        I'm sure,
to step again onto
        the leafrot,

into the avenue of mottled shadows,
        the speckled
broken skins. The dead
        in their sheer
open parenthesis, what they 
        wouldn't give

for something to lean on
        that won't 
give way. I think I
        would weep
for the moral nature
        of this world,

for right and wrong like pools
        of shadow
and light you can step in
        and out of 
crossing this yellow beech forest,
        this buchen-wald,

one autumn afternoon, late
        in the twentieth
century, in hollow light,
        in gaseous light. . . .
To receive the light
        and return it

and stand in rows, anonymous,
        is a sweet secret
even the air wishes
        it could unlock.
See how it pokes at them
        in little hooks,

the blue air, the yellow trees.
        Why be afraid?
They say when Klimt
        died suddenly
a painting, still
        incomplete,

was found in his studio,
        a woman's body 
open at its point of 
        entry,
rendered in graphic,
        pornographic,

detail--something like
        a scream
between her legs. Slowly,
        feathery,
he had begun to paint
        a delicate

garment (his trademark)
        over this mouth
of her body. The mouth
        of her face 
is genteel, bored, feigning a need
        for sleep. The fabric

defines the surface,
        the story,
so we are drawn to it,
        its blues
and yellows glittering
        like a stand

of beech trees late
        one afternoon
in Germany, in fall.
        It is called
Buchenwald, it is
        1890. In

the finished painting
        the argument 
has something to do
        with pleasure.

First Men on the Moon
 

"The Eagle has landed!" --Apollo II Commander Neil A. Armstrong"A magnificent desolation!" -- Air Force Colonel Edwin E. "Buzz" Aldrin, Jr.July 20, 1969
That afternoon in mid-July,
Two pilgrims watched from distant space
The moon ballooning in the sky.
They rose to meet it face-to-face. 

Their spidery spaceship, Eagle, dropped
Down gently on the lunar sand. 
And when the module's engines stopped, 
Rapt silence fell across the land. 

The first man down the ladder, Neil, 
Spoke words that we remember now--
"One small step... It made us feel
As if we were there too, somehow. 

When Neil planted the flag and Buzz
Collected lunar rocks and dust,
They hopped like kangaroos because 
Of gravity. Or wanderlust?

A quarter million miles away, 
One small blue planet watched in awe. 
And no one who was there that day
Will soon forget the sight they saw.





Tom Tigercat
 

Tom Tigercat is noted
for his manners and his wit. 
He wouldn't think of lion,
No, he doesn't cheetah bit. 
Tom never pretended 
to be something that he's not. 
I guess that's why we like him
and why he likes ocelot.





Said the Toad
 

I was really in a muddle
looking over a mud puddle
'cause I didn't have a paddle
or a twig to ride the reef. 
But I said, Oh, fiddle-faddle,
this is just a little piddle
of a second fiddle puddle
so I saddled up a leaf. 
I set sail on the puddle,
but I reached the muddy middle
and I rocked the leaf a little, 
then I gave it all I had. 
And I solved the mighty riddle
of the whole caboodle puddle
when I hopped up on the middle
of a beetle launching pad.





The Beak of the Pelican
 

She looks for wiggly fishes,
At least so it appears,
To stuff inside the suitcase
That's swinging from her ears. 

And though she's very graceful
When flying round and round,
How does she get that faceful
Of luggage off the ground? 






Chernobyl Year
 

We dreamed of glowing children, 
their throats alive and cancerous, 
their eyes like lightning in the dark.

We were uneasy in our skins, 
sixth grade, a year for blowing up, 
for learning that nothing contains

that heat which comes from growing, 
the way our parents seemed at once 
both tall as cooling towers and crushed

beneath the pressure of small things-- 
family dinners, the evening news, 
the dead voice of the dial tone.

Even the ground was ticking. 
The parts that grew grew poison. 
Whatever we ate became a stone.

Whatever we said was love became 
plutonium, became a spark 
of panic in the buried world.





In the Reading Room
 

Alone in the library room, even when others
Are there in the room, alone, except for themselves:
There is the illusion of peace; the air in the room

Is stilled; there are reading lights on the tables,
Looking as if they're reading, looking as if 
They're studying the text, and understanding,

Shedding light on what the words are saying;
But under their steady imbecile gaze the page
Is blank, patiently waiting not to be blank.

The page is blank until the mind that reads
Crosses the black river, seeking the Queen
Of the Underworld, Persephone, where she sits

By the side of the one who brought her there from Enna,
Hades the mute, the deaf, king of the dead letter;
She is clothed in the beautiful garment of our thousand

Misunderstandings of the sacred text.





How You Know
 

How do you know if it's love? she asks, 
and I think if you have to ask, it's not, 
but I know this won't help. I want to say 
you're too young to worry about it,
as if she has questions about Medicare 
or social security, but this won't help either. 
"You'll just know is a lie, and one truth, 
"when you still want to be with them 
the next morning, would involve too 
many follow-up questions. The difficulty 
with love, I want to say, is sometimes 
you only know afterwards that it's arrived 
or left. Love is the elephant and we 
are the blind mice unable to understand 
the whole. I want to say love is this 
desire to help even when I know I can't, 
just as I couldn't explain electricity, stars, 
the color of the sky, baldness, tornadoes, 
fingernails, coconuts, or the other things 
she has asked about over the years, all 
those phenomena whose daily existence 
seems miraculous. Instead I shake my head. 
I don't even know how to match my socks. 
Go ask your mother. She laughs and says, 
I did. Mom told me to come and ask you.





Me
 

Lots of contemporaries--
but "me is not my contemporary.

My birth without "me
was a blemished offering on the collection plate.
A moment of flesh, imprisoned in flesh.

And when to the tip of this tongue of flesh
some word comes, it kills itself.
If saved from killing itself,
it descends to the paper, where a murder happens.

Gunshot--
if it strikes me in Hanoi
it strikes again in Prague.

A little smoke floats up,
and my "me dies like an eighth-month child.
Will my "me one day be my contemporary?






A Letter
 

Me--a book in the attic.
Maybe some covenant or hymnal.
Or a chapter from the Kama Sutra,
or a spell for intimate afflictions.
But then it seems I am none of these.
(If I were, someone would have read me.)

Apparently at an assembly of revolutionaries
they passed a resolution,
and I am a longhand copy of it.
It has the police's stamp on it
and was never successfully enforced.
It is preserved only for the sake of procedure.

And now only some sparrows come,
straw in their beaks,
and sit on my body
and worry about the next generation.
(How wonderful to worry about the next generation!)
Sparrows have wings on them,
but resolutions have no wings
(or resolutions have no second generation).

Sometimes I think to catch the scent--
what lies in my future?
Worry makes my binding come off.
Whenever I try to smell,
just some fumes of bird shit.
O my earth, your future!
Me--your current state.






Empty Space
 

There were two kingdoms only:
the first of them threw out both him and me.
The second we abandoned.

Under a bare sky
I for a long time soaked in the rain of my body,
he for a long time rotted in the rain of his.

Then like a poison he drank the fondness of the years.
He held my hand with a trembling hand.
"Come, let's have a roof over our heads awhile.
Look, further on ahead, there
between truth and falsehood, a little empty space.






Music
 


It must be somewhere, the original harmony,
somewhere in great nature, hidden.
Is it in the furious infinite,
in distant stars' orbits,
is it in the sun's scorn,
in a tiny flower, in treegossip,
in heartmusic's mothersong
or in tears?
It must be somewhere, immortality,
somewhere the original harmony must be found:
how else could it infuse 
the human soul,
that music?





Leaves Fell
 

A gust roused the waves,
leaves blew into the water,
the waves were ash-gray,
the sky tin-gray,
ash-gray the autumn.

It was good for my heart:
there my feelings were ash-gray,
the sky tin-gray,
ash-gray the autumn. 

The breath of wind brought cooler air,
the waves of mourning brought separation:
autumn and autumn
befriend each other.
 






Doric
 

With her hair closely cropped up to the nape
Like Dorian Apollo's, the girl lay on the narrow
Pallet, keeping her limbs stiffly frozen
Within a heavy cloud she could not escape...

Artemis emptied her quiver--every arrow
Shot through her body. And though very soon
She'd be no virgin, like cold honeycomb,
Her virgin thighs still kept her pleasure sealed...

As if to the arena, the youth came
Oiled with myrrh, and like a wrestler kneeled
To pin her down; and although he broke past

Her arms that she had thrust against his chest, 
Only much later, with one cry, face to face,
Did they join lips, and out of their sweat, embrace...






Yannis Keats
 

A branch, the hand of Apollo,The plane tree's polished, broad bough,Spread above you, may it bring youThe universe's immortal peace.
You'd meet me on the broad and shining shore
            Of Pylos, so I'd planned,
With Mentor's tall ship pulled up on the beach
            Snug in the sand.

We would be bound, as those who sailed with the gods,
            In the winged friendship of youth,
And would take our seats in the stone thrones that Time 
            And custom had made smooth

And meet that man who still in the third generation
            Reigned serene, a sage
Whose tales of travels and holy decrees had ripened
            In his mind with age--

At dawn, we'd attend the sacrifice to the gods,
            The ritual slaughters
Of the three-year-old heifers, and hear the single cry
            That rose from his three daughters

When the axe thwacked, and the black-fringed, slow-rolling eye
            Drowned in a swoon
Of darkness, and the gilt horns were rendered idle,
            A hazy half moon.

My love imagined you, as a sister her brother,
            In your virginal bath,
How Polycaste rinsed your naked body and dressed you
            In a robe of fine cloth.

I thought to prod you a little with my foot 
            As dawn was about to break:
The gleaming chariot's yoked for us and ready.
            No time to lose! Awake!

And to spend all day in the talk that comes and goes,
            Or silence, when no one spoke,
While we drove the horses who were always leaning one way
            Or another against the yoke,

But most of all I wanted to see your eyes,
            Your deer-like eyes, behold
The palace of Menelaus, and forget themselves
            In bronze and the gleam of gold,

Unwavering gaze, sinking the sight so deep,
            You'd never remember
The figured silver, the ivory, gilded or white,
            The heavy amber, 

And I thought that I would say in a hushed voice
            Leaning close to your ear,
Watch out, my friend, because in a moment, soon,
            Helen will appear

Before our very eyes, the one and only
            Daughter of the Swan,
And then we will sink our eyelids in the river
            Of Oblivion.



                                             


So brightly I saw you; but what grassy roads
            Have led me to your tomb!
And the blazing roses with which I strew your grave
            And make all Rome abloom,

Light the way unto your golden songs
            As though they were the brave,
Armed bodies that turn to dust before one's eyes
            In an ancient, new-breached grave,

And all the worthy treasure of Mycenae,
            The golden plunder
I thought to lay before you--goblet, sword,
            And diadem--past wonder,

A mask on your dead beauty like the mask
            That covered the face
Of the king of the Achaeans--all gold, all artifice,
            Hammered upon Death's trace.






Sarabande
 

Look straight, and don't tremble, wreckage of my hanged race:
a sarabande dancer, Japanese muslin tight on her live-wire hips
arrives with the moonlight, fast as the tam-tam drums.
She'll take you to the grand esplanade where the gallows
tell your story, tell of your dim bronze halos
licked away by a pale man's greed.

Leave your gallows tears behind,
the long-drawn vowels of the lost names of flowers,
the long-drawn cries of your burden of grain,
the long-drawn cries of your burden of seed-pods,
and the long-drawn cries of the seed-pods cut and hung.
Shipwreck of my race, twisted in the wind-rush,
fall from your broken gallows, wrack, wreck, and driftwood, 
my bloodied race. 
My bloodied race fearful, scab-dried, sterile, paralyzed, 
the low-caste wallflowers trembling at a ball for mice--
no. Leave your gallows, there, those: the gallows of time-gone-by.
Lift your chestnut-dark and heavy limbs, up from out the shipwreck's carnage,
and up through those long blue-green rolling waves.
Sing the wind's songs, and collect what's needed, drop by shivering drop,
in this, your Lenten fasting, in this, your sorcerer's midnight, under this, the whip.
Leave the gallows, the sap of its cut-wood spits on your skin.
You'd hang there, yourself in effigy? No. Live sap runs in the driftwood branch.
You'll play, gentle, a light wind in the shimmering green of a dancer's beaded muslin skirt,
and your broken music will move in the foolish grass that still believes in death--
leave your gallows-bones there, in the fool's green shroud . . .
Scratch with the rusted nail of melody, because you live, wreckage of my race,
the sky will not forget you, nor the graveyard's earth, fertile and walled.
Your blood still dances, a wreckage of joy, joy soured,
obstinate joy, wild and unbroken,
shipwreck of my race, sarabande.






Poem
 

Handsome, like those foam-topped tidal waves breaking high, in little crystal globes.
Handsome, like the breeze that lifts a little tuft of tulle. If tulle were life.
Handsome, like a frozen face, tear-tracked, when the sun hammers down.
Handsome. Like fire.
Handsome, like the bottomless sky, with that one proud penetrating star.

But handsome, too, like a sky that's an arching ocean, and an earth prone as an ocean's floor.
Handsome ocean-sky, and earth-sea floor.
            The big question is: where's the man in a scene like this?

Handsome: the man asleep. And the night sky swarms, tropic and wide.
Handsome, in some ornamental, muggy midnight caught between cat's paws. Sharp-nailed: 
            they prick.
Handsome: the firefly swarms around you.
Handsome, like a soap bubble grazing a little black dress. Like a soap-bubble pricked with a pin.
Handsomeness a rainbow, a rainbow an arrow, an arrow in my chest.
Handsome, like shadows slow-rolling on a Japanese screen. 
Handsome motion.
Handsome as life and poison.
Sun-blood handsome. Bleeding sun.

Translated from the French by Robert Archambeau






The Bend
 

Around the bend of a phrase 
you return, it's dawn in a book, it's
a garden, one can
see everything, the dew, a moth
on a leaf and it's you
who rises suddenly amid the pages
and the book grows more lovely
because it's you
and you've not grown old, you walk
slowly to the door.






Someone, and no matter
 

          
          Someone, and no matter who, inhabits my head like it's an empty house, he enters, he leaves, he bangs each door behind him, powerless I put up with this ruckus. Someone, and maybe it's me, palms my most private thoughts, he crumples them, returns them to dust. Someone, and it's much later now, slowly walks across the room and, not seeing me, stops to contemplate the havoc. Someone, and no matter where, collects the pieces of my shadow. 





from "Octonaires on the Worlds Vanity and Inconstancy
 

Ice glitters like it's good.
The whole world glitters,
sped towards ends,
we all fall in.

Under the ice is water.
But under the world, between you
and the everything
of your vanishing . . .


                               


Fire, air, water, and earth
still turning, spilling into each other.
He tuned the world tense,
made the elements restless

so any happiness we might contrive
of fire, or air, or water, or earth
cannot rest, has to reach higher
than earth, water, air, or fire.


                               


It's all echo--whatever world
keeps calling to you 
in the woods, in a rock, a deep wave--
Just a lie that vanishes

as soon as it tricks you inside. 
Shut up, go away, say to the world. 
And it does--into the woods, a rock, 
deep waves that keep calling you.


                               


When the sky's dark face
catches your eye again,
let memory write
of a darkness beyond this:

days self-blinded, nights 
of searching untaught,
thinking your own thought,
light.


                               


Wanting what you fear,
fearing your own desire:
icicles at the heart
form to burn apart.

When, in this cycle
of suffering he sings,
does the martyr begin
to suspect himself?






Last Simile
 


It's as if she were an earn,
                                                                   gebidende prey for her eyrie.

Perched alertly,
                                                                   a hgtesse on their innards.

In bitter morgenceald,
                                                                   her hoar-glittered feathers.

Suddenly she sees
                                                                   a fox on the westene.

At that she rouses,
                                                                   heaved up on high,

and heads straight at him,
                                                                   in harrowing hste.

Hearing her, he freezes
                                                                   his tail. He's terrified.

Sees, bestel,
                                                                   with agan flashing,

talons overtake him,
                                                                   dash him down in torment,

overtake him again,
                                                                   swenge him on the eoran.

One yelp as she pincers his liver.
                                                                   Wyrd--pierces aorta.






Lament
 


We wither, unlike stars;    die, unlike hills and cisterns.

Ana shadowed my protector,    esteemed Arbad, who's left us.

But ana do not grieve;    all sparrows exit the feast hall.

Novelties don't excite me,    nor wyrdstaef affright me.

Men are like encampments    that soon become ruins.

They come with their kin,    leave only land behind when
        they go--

the last herdsman    rounding up the stragglers.

Man's a shooting star:    light turned to ash.

Wealth and kin a stain    that soon wears away.

The work we do    inevitably gehrorene.

The wise grasp this;    the foolish fight it and lose.

If my wyrd holds off a while,    my fingers reach out for its stick.

Ana can tell you stories,    bent over the more ana try to straighten.

Ana am like a battered sword    that hasn't gotten any less sharp.

Don't leave me!    (The sparrow finds the exit suddenly--.)

O you reproachful wifcynn:    when the men go off

Can your witchcraft tell us    who'll return?

Do you faint    because they flet ofgefon?

You make everyone weep!    for the burston bodies

of the irreplaceable friends    of your own youth.

But neither the witches    nor the necromancers know 

what the aelmihtig intends.    Just ask them:

Hwr cm the men?    Hwr cm our protectors?

They don't even know    when the rain storm will come!






A blind man was riding an unheated train
 

A blind man was riding an unheated train,
From Bryansk he was traveling home with his fate.

Fate whispered to him so the whole car could hear:
And why should you care about blindness and war?

It's good, she was saying, you're sightless and poor.
If you were not blind, you'd never survive. 

The Germans won't kill you, you're nothing to them.
Allow me to lift that bag on your shoulder--

The one with the holes, the empty torn one.
Let me just raise your eyelids wide open.

The blind man was traveling home with his fate,
Now thankful for blindness. Happy about it.







To Poems
 


My poems: fledglings, heirs, 
Plaintiffs and executors,
The silent ones, the loud,
The humble and the proud.

As soon as the shovel of time
Threw me onto the potter's wheel--
Myself without kith or kin--
I grew beneath the hand, a miracle.

Something stretched out my long neck
And hollowed round my soul
And marked on my back 
Legends of flowers and leaves.

I stoked the birch in the fire
As Daniel commanded
And blessed my red temper
Until I spoke as a prophet.

I had long been the earth--
Arid, ochre, forlorn since birth--
But you fell on my chest by chance
From beaks of birds, from eyes of grass.






The Children
 

          
          Children grow in secret. They hide themselves in the depths and darker reaches of the house to become wild cats, white birches. One day when you're only half-watching the herd as it straggles back in with the afternoon dust, one child, the prettiest of them all, comes close and rises up on tiptoe to whisper I love you, I'll be waiting for you in the hay.Shaking some, you go to find your shotgun; you spend what's left of the day firing at rooks and jackdaws, uncountable at this hour, and crows.





Goats
 

          
          Wherever the earth is crag and scrub, the goats are there--the black ones, girlishly skipping, leaping their little leaps from rock to rock. I've loved their nerve and frisk since I was small. Once my grandfather gave me one of my own. He showed me how I could serve myself when I got hungry, from the full-feeling bags there like warmish wineskins, where I'd let my hands linger some before bringing my mouth close, so the milk wouldn't go to waste on my face, my neck, even my naked chest, which did happen sometimes, who knows if on purpose, my mind dwelling all the while on the savory-smelling vulvazinha. I called her Maltesa; she was my horse; I could almost say she was my first woman.





Runic Signature for Cynewulfs "Fates of the Apostles
 

You who please      your keenness with poems,
read closely here:      can you discover 
this verse's framer?       finishes.
Nobles enjoy it on earth,      but not without end, 
worldly ones.       must fail  
 in our strongholds      once our bodies scatter
their loaned treasure,      like  trickling through fingers.
Then  and ear      require  skill 
in night's narrow cell;       drives your craft, 
a kingly servitude.      Now can you see
who shrewd words have      shown to men?
             Remember my name,      O you who admire
the sound of this song;      help succor me
and pray for my comfort.      Soon I must pass 
alone, away      to look for a dwelling,
must travel so far      (no telling where!)
beyond this world      to a yet-unknown
place in the earth.      So must each person,
unless he is granted      God-sent grace.
            Let us call to God      again, more eager,
begging his blessing      in this bright creation:
may we be welcomed      to his warm halls,
his home on high.      There is holiest happiness, 
there the king of angels      crowns the pure 
with a perishless prize.      Now his praise endures 
masterful and marvelous,      and his might extends
endless and ageless      over all creation.      finit.









The Portrait
 

For my little ballads,
those strange, sunset-red laments,
spring paid me a gull's egg.

I bade my lover paint my portrait
                                            on its thick shell.
He painted a new bulb in brown soil--
on the other side, a powdery mound of sand.






Animalistic Hymn
 

The red sun rises
without intent
and shines the same on all of us.
We play like children under the sun.
One day, our ashes will scatter--
                                           it doesn't matter when.
Now the sun finds our innermost hearts,
                                           fills us with oblivion
intense as the forest, winter and sea.






A Gray Day
 

I spoke in a hurry, in a nervous hush,
Because the time was short--
The lightning was shuddering,
Slowing down, running.

Or was that my blood,
The quiet diminishing of daily life?
It's time for me to go forth
Into Your tiny mustard seed.

In the house of my Father, everything is fading,
In the house of the Father, all the angels are crying,
Because the anguish of a jaded, exhausted horse
Sometimes finds its way even unto them.

One gray day, I was alive on this earth,
And amid the mist of day--in triumph--
The Spirit may approach and look
So that you will see Him, without seeing.

And, so, celebrate the meager light,
Curse not the twilight.
If Christ is to visit us
It will be on such pitiful days as these.

I was thinking: God has abandoned me,
So, what of it--he is a priceless ray of light,
Or a thin needle in the haystack of man. And cruel.
I have turned away from him--torment me no more.
But which of us is more cruel? More to be feared?
The one who has no body, of course.
He has made us endless, vast--
So that our grief will know no bounds.


Providence, 2001







memory of water
 

          
          september is a month like any other and unlike any other. it seems in september everything awaited will arrive: in the calm air, in a particular scent, in the stillness of the quay. when september comes, i know i'm going to lose myself. the ants climbing my legs and a certain change of light tell me so. the air comes and goes beneath my dress, pressing the warm cloth against me, pressing me with the desire to find myself in the sea, that sea beaten deep gray and magnetized by neutrinos, thanks to which i can perform my observations and telekinetic communications. the salty, sticky wall of the Malecn is covered with fish and forgotten hooks. i like to lick its sheen of salt and make my tongue salty and sticky. in that moment the rest of the city can vanish, it's just that sea and me, before all thought, all desire. then i undress and enter, knowing i'll find something, and that the boats--which seem suspended on the horizon, seem to have slipped their limits, motionless and painted there--are also mine...when i met you and you met me it was still september and we were strange and different and would be for a long time after--though i sometimes snagged you with certain secret hooks, shaping a sort of formless impression: something strange and indefinable divided the outline of your body from the space around you, but without making a human form, and in your eyes the sunlight revolved like a bicycle's spoked wheel...the bicycle moves on and i'm carried along, filled with dry branches and coral. in my hair i wear the butterflies we collected together. the little house, one point amid the infinite, comes into view: already we can see the windows, like little black voids, and their curtains beating in the wind. i squeeze your waist, the bicycle moves on; even though the street is narrow the bicycle rolls on, rolls on against the spray. when you turn your head and see my hand, my hook snagged in a struggle of desire, the sun has turned immense in your eyes again. you make for the little house already in view, already at the edge of the curve...a naked man in lamplight is a magnificent animal: his pointy shoulders jut out and cut off the light. a line of fuzz descends from his navel to where the darkness begins, where the skin tightens like the skin of a fig. his body--your body--is an arc i want to tighten, to overcome, to conquer. hidden behind a tree, i can see your eyes again. the Mississippi is a big river with many tributaries. the arc tightens and closes. i throw an arm over you, a leg, a hand, a lip, hallucinations, an ear--as usual. my body moves on. the Mississippi is a big river with many tributaries. its water burns in my thighs, in the course of my dreams: the Mississippi is a deep and torrential river situated in the United States, it is born in Lake Itasca, passes through St. Paul, St. Louis, Memphis, New Orleans, traverses 3,780 kilometers and slides and slides through a wide delta to the Gulf of Mexico. i'm in geography class. i like this class. the world just barely fits in my head. the map hangs before me with its spokes and points. someone made that all up, just to make me think i belong to one of those zones out there. all those castles and fortifications to toy with, the beginnings of everything that seems to be reality, but isn't, because we're not outside but inside the globe, that huge globe so stubborn in its sufficiency, and even far from the classroom nothing's different: there's just the idea of that transparent globe that is my image of the world, always turning, imperfect and constant inside me. i like the maps and the instability of the geography that situates places in my head. i like using graph paper to plot the latitudes and longitudes i can't measure. i also like the geography professor, whose eyes i must constantly avoid in order not to drown myself. he doesn't know, he can't imagine, that while he lectures, while he looks at me, i draw fish in my notebook to throw in his river. the boy behind me won't stop looking at me, and whatever one does the others all follow, watching from the corners of their eyes. that's why i'm going to fold the page away from his gaze and make a true map where he won't find me, alone at my desk in the middle of the world...in the middle of the lake there's a boat and we're three--although the third may have already vanished for us--and i want to paddle and sit in the center. you've taken off your shirt: the landscape appears and disappears. when i take the oars you want to teach me how to row over the edge. you try to teach me: you take my hands--you're behind and above me. my fingers are lost in the middle of the boat. i'm wearing faded jeans and carrying a purple parasol. the oar descends toward the deep and tangles with seaweed. my hair hangs surly and limp on my wet shoulders. we try to steer but go nowhere. you explain the roundness of the earth; the sharpened tip of the compass needle, always precise, marking contours, lines, limits. the shadow and truth of your body in the landscape: appearances and disappearances when you try to comprehend the possible across great distances, the symmetry, forgetfulness, incarnation in other beings: animals, plants, and later, men once again. you taught me all this, but i'm not a map and i hold still. i abandon my shoes and my dread of nearing the end: the oar descends toward the deep, it is september. we don't move. i keep still to be different, that's why...





first time
 

          
          we went into a market--they call it a grocery--and you can't imagine. fruit brilliant as magazine photos. all kinds of different oranges, grapefruits, mandarins, some tiny clementines with a blue sticker--Morocco--they've come so far...the eggs are painted with colors corresponding to the days of the week you're supposed to eat them: a different color for each opportunity. i felt dizzy, the gulf between myself and this place seemed insuperable. tears welled up in my eyes, i wanted desperately to flee, to get outside so i could breathe. i wanted to explain to Phillis, the North American who had invited me, what was happening to me. i tried, but she couldn't understand: you have to have felt it yourself: the first time. for the first time my mind had crossed over five hundred years of development at jet speed and arrived in the future, a cold future, its display cases filled with artificial snow and artificial heat. there were a thousand things i never knew existed, a panoply of brand names and gadgets for every purpose. i felt like someone from the stone age, and realized most people on the planet never know the era they're living in, any more than they could know the quantity of living matter in this galaxy that surrounds us, or the milky complexity of the molecules in their own brains, and what's more they don't know that they'll die without ever knowing. i felt terror of that gloss, of the waxed fruit, of propaganda so refined it could dilute the existence of the strange things before my eyes, other sensations: everything wanting to be used up, immediately, licked, tasted, eaten, packaged, mastered. i knew i couldn't stand this avalanche, this brilliant swarm, for long, these rows on rows of distant faces staring out at me from cardboard boxes. i'd seen nothing singular in the place, no unique thing i could separate out from the amorphous mass of texture and sensation. i began to move closer, imagining i walked with those who have never eaten meat or tasted cow's milk, who have never nursed except from the teat of a goat. those who have had only wildflowers to chew when the winter hunger comes. i approached closer still, imagining i walked with the salty ones, who collect their water from the public pipe. my nose began to bleed and Phillis said it was the cold; i knew that wasn't the problem. we were near the seafood display, i moved closer. fish have always aroused in me both horror and desire. i moved closer, like a lost child feeling her way through space toward something of hers that's hidden. i brushed the shells with my fingertips, they were smooth and delicate, but obviously artificial, made to be used once and thrown away. at first touch they might seem real, pearly, perfect, but they're actually plastic, and they've never even seen any sea.





Hollywood Elegies
 


                                     1

Under the long green hair of pepper trees,
The writers and composers work the street.
Bach's new score is crumpled in his pocket,
Dante sways his ass-cheeks to the beat.

                                     2

The city is named for the angels,
And its angels are easy to find.
They give off a lubricant odor,
Their eyes are mascara-lined;
At night you can see them inserting
Gold-plated diaphragms;
For breakfast they gather at poolside
Where screenwriters feed and swim.

                                     3

Every day, I go to earn my bread
In the exchange where lies are marketed,
Hoping my own lies will attract a bid.

                                     4

It's Hell, it's Heaven: the amount you earn
Determines if you play the harp or burn.

                                     5

Gold in their mountains,
Oil on their coast;
Dreaming in celluloid
Profits them most.






On the Term of Exile
 

No need to drive a nail into the wall
To hang your hat on;
When you come in, just drop it on the chair
No guest has sat on.

Don't worry about watering the flowers--
In fact, don't plant them.
You will have gone back home before they bloom, 
And who will want them?

If mastering the language is too hard,
Only be patient;
The telegram imploring your return
Won't need translation.

Remember, when the ceiling sheds itself
In flakes of plaster,
The wall that keeps you out is crumbling too, 
As fast or faster.


Translated from the German by Adam Kirsch





Song of the Dwarf
 

Maybe my soul is straight and good,
but she's got to lug my heart, my blood,
which all hurts because it's crooked;
its weight sends her staggering.
She has no bed, she has no home,
she merely hangs on my sharp bones,
flapping her terrible wings.

And my hands are completely shot, 
shriveled, worn: here, take a look
at how they clammily, clumsily hop
like rain-crazed toads.
As for all the other stuff,
it's all used up and sad and old--
why doesn't God haul me out to the muck
and let me drop.

Is it because of my mug
with its frowning mouth?
So often I would itch
to be luminous and free of fog 
but nothing would approach
except big dogs.
And the dogs got zilch.






The Unfaithful Housewife
 

For Mary Peace
Then I led her to the river
certain she was still a virgin
though she had a husband.
The fourth Friday in July,
as good as on a promise.
The street lights were vanishing
and the crickets flaring up.
Last bend out of town
I brushed her sleepy breasts.
They blossomed of a sudden
like the tips of hyacinths
and the starch of her petticoat
bustled in my ear like silk
slit by a dozen blades.
The pines, minus their halo 
of silver, grew huger
and the horizon of dogs
howled a long way from the river.

Past the blackberry bushes,
the rushes and whitethorn,
beneath her thatch of hair,
I made a dip in the sand.
I took off my neckerchief.
She unstrapped her dress.
Me my gun and holster,
she her layers of slips...
Not tuberose, not shell, 
has skin as half as smooth
nor does mirror glass
have half the shimmer.
Her hips flitted from me
like a pair of startled tench:
the one full of fire,
the other full of cold.
That night I might
as well have ridden
the pick of the roads
on a mother-of-pearl mare
without bridle or stirrups.
Gentleman that I am,
I won't say back the scraps
she whispered to me.
It dawned out there 
to leave my lip bitten.
Filthy with soil and kisses,
I led her from the river
and the spears of lilies
battled in the air.

I behaved only the way
a blackguard like me behaves.
I offered her a big creel
of hay-colored satins.
I had no wish to fall for her.
She has a husband after all,
though she was still a virgin
when I led her to the river.






The Burning Kite
 

What a thing it would be, if we all could fly.
But to rise on air does not make you a bird.

I'm sick of the hiss of champagne bubbles.
It's spring, and everyone's got something to puke.

The things we puke: flights of stairs,
a skyscraper soaring from the gut,

the bills blow by on the April breeze
followed by flurries of razor blades in May.

It's true, a free life is made of words.
You can crumple it, toss it in the trash,

or fold it between the bodies of angels, attaining
a permanent address in the sky.

The postman hands you your flight of birds
persisting in the original shape of wind.

Whether they're winging toward the scissors' V
or printed and plastered on every wall

or bound and trussed, bamboo frames wound with wire
or sentenced to death by fire

you are, first
and always, ash.

Broken wire, a hurricane at each end.
Fire trucks scream across the earth.

But this blaze is a thing of the air.
Raise your glass higher, toss it up and away.

Few know this kind of dizzy glee:
an empty sky, a pair of burning wings.






Mother, Kitchen
 

Where the immemorial and the instant meet, opening and distance appear.
Through the opening: a door, crack of light.
Behind the door, a kitchen.

Where the knife rises and falls, clouds gather, disperse.
A lightspeed joining of life and death, cut 
in two: halves of a sun, of slowness.

Halves of a turnip.
A mother in the kitchen, a lifetime of cuts.
A cabbage cut into mountains and rivers,
a fish, cut along its leaping curves,
laid on the table
still yearning for the pond.

Summer's tofu
cut into premonitions of snow. 
A potato listens to the onion-counterpoint 
of the knife, dropping petals at its strokes:
self and thing, halves of nothing
at the center of time.
Where gone and here meet, the knife rises, falls.

But this mother is not holding a knife.

What she has been given is not a knife
but a few fallen leaves. 
The fish leaps over the blade from the sea
to the stars. The table is in the sky now, 
the market has been crammed into the refrigerator,
and she cannot open cold time.
 






Mozart in E-flat Major
 

I turn around.
          I feel Monday's well-shaven face lightly
          caress my left shoulder

          most cherished part 
          most crucial here and now 






To Be Elsewhere
 

We met in a coastal village
spent a lovely night without leaving an address 
going separate ways. Three years later
we meet again by coincidence.
The whole
three years spun a novel
we abandoned:
They fail to recognize themselves
as though meeting in another story 
for an encounter.
One asks: Who are you, so cold and weary
The other says: I only know a thread is loose on my sweater
            The more you pull it, the more it lengthens
            until I completely vanish.






Fruit Dont Fall Far
 

From Daddy sprung my inborn ribaldry.
His crudeness destined me to be the same.
A seedlet, flowered from a shitty heap, 
I came, the crowning glory of his aim.

From Mother I inherited ennui, 
The leg irons of the queendom I once rattled.
But I won't let such chains imprison me. 
And there is just no telling what this brat'll...!

This marriage thing? We snub our nose at it.
What's pearl turns piss, what's classy breeds what's smutty.
But like it? Lump it? Neither's exigent.
And I'm the end result of all that fucking.

Do what you will! This world's your oyster, Pet.
But be forewarned. The sea might drown you yet. 






Dusting
 

Every day a wilderness--no   
shade in sight. Beulah 
patient among knicknacks,   
the solarium a rage 
of light, a grainstorm 
as her gray cloth brings 
dark wood to life. 

Under her hand scrolls 
and crests gleam 
darker still. What 
was his name, that 
silly boy at the fair with 
the rifle booth? And his kiss and   
the clear bowl with one bright   
fish, rippling 
wound! 

Not Michael-- 
something finer. Each dust   
stroke a deep breath and   
the canary in bloom. 
Wavery memory: home   
from a dance, the front door   
blown open and the parlor   
in snow, she rushed 
the bowl to the stove, watched   
as the locket of ice 
dissolved and he 
swam free. 

That was years before 
Father gave her up 
with her name, years before   
her name grew to mean   
Promise, then   
Desert-in-Peace. 
Long before the shadow and   
sun's accomplice, the tree. 

Maurice.





First Encounter Beach
 

Eastham, Massachusetts 
One of the spectators is disappointed
 there isn't a guide to explain
 the beaching, the scientists busy
 cutting into ninety-four pilot whales
 stranded on the salt grass.
 No one knows why and, try as the rescue team
 might, not one whale will go back to water.
 So they're injected to speed up the dying,
  
 lined up like lumber and sawed into,
 except when the black skin splits
 we can't stop staring, their meat is so read.
 I don't want to know why this happens--
 what parasite or geomagnetic anomaly
 finished their love of motion. Why should
 anything have to leave this world
 when water can cycle from atmosphere
 down to land, the ocean and back
 to forgiving sky.
  
                                       I'm on my way to Connecticut
 where my father has a little vegetation
 on his heart valve--that's how the intern
 describes it, trying to minimize
 the danger of him slipping
 into a haze so cold, some nights,
 bone-cold, his hand can't get from
 his plate to his mouth.
  
                                                   Rain slicks the highway
 slowing me down. The same water
 fattened into snow in the woods
 of my childhood, the whiteness
 unbroken except where my father
 cut trails and taught me to ski,
 laying down the herringbone behind him
 as he broke up hills that left me
 with legs made of slush. He wanted me strong,
 no patience for pain. No choice
 but to find the muscle to follow. Even now
 when he boasts how I zigzagged
 the breakneck hills in an icestorm,
 there's no hint of my knee-chattering fear,
 slats skittering out of control,
 each run a victory of luck more than will,
 each ride up the lift a prayer for my bones.
 I wonder how it is for him now
 there in the ward where whiteness can't hide
 the cold blank that's ahead. When the whales
 beached, spectators came like pilgrims,
 each new arrival scanning the faces
 of those heading back to their cars
 to see how it changed them
 to survey so much death. Nothing showed.
 Their eyes followed the asphalt,
 heads bent in private devotion.
  
                                                     There in a room
 where others have died, my father
 keeps a record of each test and drug.
 He watches medicine drip into his arm
 and circle in the dark of his blood.
 I believe it will heal him, as I believe
 in the strength of my blood
 to protect me from failures of will. Once
 when my grandmother at ninety-six
 lay delirious with pneumonia,
 pitching on her high horsehair bed,
 she saw three crows perched on the dresser.
  
               They smell so awful, she said.
 Please, open the window. Let them out.
 It was my father who did what she asked.
 And the crows flew out, carrying her fever
 over the treeline, dissolving into sky,
 and she lived. Whatever she saw,
 by love, luck or dumb Yankee will,
 it was true. That's what I mean by medicine. 





Eve Revisited
 

Pomegranates fell from the trees
 in our sleep. If we stayed
 in the sun too long
 there were aloes
 to cool the burn.
 Henbane for predators
 and succulents when the rain was scarce.
  
 There was no glorified past
 to point the way
 true and natural
 for the sexes to meet.
 He kept looking to the heavens
 as if the answer were anywhere
 but here. I was so bored
 with our goodness
 I couldn't suck the juice
 from one more pear.
  
 It's here, I kept telling him,
 here, rooted in the soil
 like every other tree
 you know. And I wove us
 a bed of its uppermost branches.





Still Burning
 

Me trying to understand say whence
 say whither, say what, say me with a pencil walking,
 say reading the dictionary, say learning medieval
 Latin, reading Spengler, reading Whitehead,
 William James I loved him, swimming breaststroke
 and thinking for an hour, how did I get here?
 Or thinking in line, say the 69 streetcar
 or 68 or 67 Swissvale,
 that would take me elsewhere, me with a textbook
 reading the pre-Socratics, so badly written,
 whoever the author was, me on the floor of
 the lighted stacks sitting cross-legged,
 walking afterwards through the park or sometimes
 running across the bridges and up the hills,
 sitting down in our tiny diningroom,
 burning in a certain way, still burning.






Himself
 

He'll have been the last of his kind here then.
 The flagstones, dry-stone walls, the slumping thatch,
 out-offices and cow cabins, the patch
 of haggard he sowed spuds and onions in--
 all of it a century out of fashion--
 all giving way to the quiet rising damp
 of hush and vacancy once he is gone.
 Those long contemplations at the fire, cats
 curling at the door, the dog's lame waltzing,
 the kettle, the candle and the lamp--
 all still, all quenched, all darkened--
 the votives and rosaries and novenas,
 the pope and Kennedy and Sacred Heart,
 the bucket, the basket, the latch and lock,
 the tractor that took him into town and back
 for the pension cheque and messages and pub,
 the chair, the bedstead and the chamber pot,
 everything will amount to nothing much.
 Everything will slowly disappear.
 And some grandniece, a sister's daughter's daughter,
 one blue August in ten or fifteen years
 will marry well and will inherit it:
 the cottage ruins, the brown abandoned land.
 They'll come to see it in a hired car.
 The kindly Liverpudlian she's wed,
 in concert with a local auctioneer,
 will post a sign to offer Site for Sale.
 The acres that he labored in will merge
 with a neighbor's growing pasturage
 and all the decades of him will begin to blur,
 easing, as the far fields of his holding did,
 up the hill, over the cliff, into the sea.





After Love
 

Afterward, the compromise.
 Bodies resume their boundaries.
  
 These legs, for instance, mine.
 Your arms take you back in.
  
 Spoons of our fingers, lips
 admit their ownership.
  
 The bedding yawns, a door
 blows aimlessly ajar
  
 and overhead, a plane
 singsongs coming down.
  
 Nothing is changed, except
 there was a moment when
  
 the wolf, the mongering wolf
 who stands outside the self
  
 lay lightly down, and slept.





American Smooth
 

We were dancing--it must have 
 been a foxtrot or a waltz,
 something romantic but
 requiring restraint,
 rise and fall, precise
 execution as we moved 
 into the next song without
 stopping, two chests heaving
 above a seven-league
 stride--such perfect agony,
 one learns to smile through,
 ecstatic mimicry
 being the sine qua non
 of American Smooth.
 And because I was distracted
 by the effort of 
 keeping my frame
 (the leftward lean, head turned
 just enough to gaze out
 past your ear and always
 smiling, smiling),
 I didn't notice
 how still you'd become until
 we had done it
 (for two measures?
 four?)--achieved flight,
 that swift and serene
 magnificence,
 before the earth
 remembered who we were
 and brought us down. 





Mechanism
 

Honor a going thing, goldfinch, corporation, tree,
           morality: any working order,
        animate or inanimate: it
  
 has managed directed balance,
           the incoming and outgoing energies are working right,
        some energy left to the mechanism,
  
 some ash, enough energy held
           to maintain the order in repair,
        assure further consumption of entropy,
  
 expending energy to strengthen order:
           honor the persisting reactor,
        the container of change, the moderator: the yellow
  
 bird flashes black wing-bars
           in the new-leaving wild cherry bushes by the bay,
        startles the hawk with beauty,
  
 flitting to a branch where
           flash vanishes into stillness,
        hawk addled by the sudden loss of sight:
  
 honor the chemistries, platelets, hemoglobin kinetics,
           the light-sensitive iris, the enzymic intricacies
        of control,
  
 the gastric transformations, seed
           dissolved to acrid liquors, synthesized into
        chirp, vitreous humor, knowledge,
  
 blood compulsion, instinct: honor the
           unique genes,
        molecules that reproduce themselves, divide into
  
 sets, the nucleic grain transmitted
           in slow change through ages of rising and falling form,
        some cells set aside for the special work, mind
  
 or perception rising into orders of courtship,
           territorial rights, mind rising
        from the physical chemistries
  
 to guarantee that genes will be exchanged, male
           and female met, the satisfactions cloaking a deeper
        racial satisfaction:
  
 heat kept by a feathered skin:
           the living alembic, body heat maintained (bunsen
        burner under the flask)
  
 so the chemistries can proceed, reaction rates
           interdependent, self-adjusting, with optimum
        efficiency--the vessel firm, the flame
  
 staying: isolated, contained reactions! the precise and
           necessary worked out of random, reproducible,
        the handiwork redeemed from chance, while the
  
 goldfinch, unconscious of the billion operations
           that stay its form, flashes, chirping (not a
        great songster) in the bay cherry bushes wild of leaf. 





Glass
 

The song 
 sparrow puts all his
 saying
 into one
 repeated song:
 what
  
 variations, subtleties
 he manages,
 to encompass denser
 meanings, I'm 
 too coarse
 to catch: it's
  
 one song, an over-reach
 from which
 all possibilities,
 like filaments,
 depend:
 killing,
  
 nesting, dying,
 sun or cloud,
 figure up
 and become
 song--simple, hard:
 removed.






Millennium, Six Songs
 

I.
  
 Black swollen fruit dangling on a limb
 Red forgotten flesh sprayed across the prairie
 Parched brown vines creeping over the wall
 Yellow winged pollen, invisible enemies
  
 Boluses without homesteads, grubs without a voice
 Burrowed deeply into this land's dark, dark heart
 Someday, our pods and pupae shall turn in the earth
 And burgeon into our motherlode's bold beauty
  
  
 II.
  
 We're a seed on the manure, on the sole of your shoe
 We're the louse trapped in your hank of golden hair
 We're the sliver that haunts beneath your thumbnail
 We the church mouse you scorched with a match but lived
  
 We're the package wrapped, return address unknown
 We're the arm lowered again, again, a bloodied reverie
 We've arrived shoeless, crutchless, tousle-haired, swollen-bellied
 We shall inherit this earth's meek glory, as foretold
  
  
 II. (For Leah, my niece)
  
 They gave you a title, but you were too proud to wear it
 They gave you the paterland, but you were too lazy to farm it
  
 Your condo is leaking, but you're too angry to repair it
 Your dress has moth holes, but you're too sentimental to toss it
  
 You're too bored to play the lute, it hangs on the wall like an ornament
 The piano bites you, it's an eight-legged unfaithful dog
  
 Love grows in the garden, but you're too impudent to tend it
 A nice Hakka boy from Ogden, so hardworking, so kind
  
 The prayer mat is for prayer, not for catamite nipple-piercing
 The Goddess wags her finger at your beautiful wasteland
  
 A dream deferred, well, is a dream deferred
  
  
 IV. (Janie's retort, on her fortieth birthday)
  
 The same stars come around and around and around
 The same sun pecks her heat at the horizon
 The same housing tract, the same shopping center
 The same blunt haircut: Chinese, Parisian, Babylonion
 The same lipstick: red and it comes off on your coffeecup
 The same stars come around and around and around
 The same sun tarries in the late noon sky
 The same word for mom: Ah ma, madre, mere, majka
 The same birthbabe: bald, purplish, you slap to make cry
 The same stench: mother's milk, shit and vomit
 The same argument between a man and a woman
 The same dog, hit by a car, the same escaped canary
 The same turkey for Thanksgiving, Christmas and the New Year
 The same three-tiered freeway: Istanbul, Tokyo, San Diego
 The same hill, the same shanty town, the same lean-to
 The same skyscraper: Hong Kong, Singapore, Toledo
 The same soup: chicken, though the veggies may vary
 The same rice for supper: white, brown or wild
 The same stars come around and around and around
 The same sun dips her head into the ocean
 The same tree in the same poem by the same poet
 The same old husband: saggy breasts, baggy thighs
 The same blackness whether we sleep or die
  
  
 V.
 Whoever abandoned her grandmother at the bus stop
 Whoever ran in and out the door like a blind wind
    spinning the upside-down prosperity sign right side up again
 Whoever lost her virtue    in darkly paneled rooms    with white boys
 Whoever prayed for round eyes
    and taped her eyelids in waiting
 Whoever wore platform shoes
    blustering taller than her own kind
 Whoever sold her yellow gold for Jehovah
 Whoever discarded her jade Buddha for Christ
  
  
 VI.
 Why are you proud, father, entombed with the other woman?
 Why are you proud, mother, knitting my shroud in heaven?
 Why are you proud, fish, you feed the greedy mourners?
 Why are you proud, peonies, your heads are bowed and weighty?
 Why are you proud, millennium, the dialect will die with you?
 Why are you proud, psalm, hammering yourself into light?





Horse Horse Hyphen Hyphen
 

Border Ghazals
I.
  
 I hate, I love, I don't know how
 I'm biracial, I'm torn in two
  
 Tonight, he will lock me in fear
 In the metal detector of love
  
 Rapeflowers, rapeseeds, rapiers
 A soldier's wry offerings
  
 He will press his tongue
 Into my neighing throat
  
 I can speak three dialects badly
 I want you now behind the blue door
  
 In a slow hovercraft of dreams
 I saw Nanking from a bilge
  
 Some ashes fell on his lap
 I'm afraid it's my mother
  
 The protocol is never to mention her
 While we are fucking
  
  
 II.
  
 The bad conceit, the bad conceit police will arrest you
 Twin compasses, twin compasses cannot come
  
 Your father is not a car, not a compass and not God
 Though he vanished in his sky-blue convertible Galaxy with a blonde
  
 He kept crawling back to us, back to us
 Each time with a fresh foot mangled
  
 One emperor was named Lickety, the other named Split
 Suddenly, the soup of chaos makes sense
  
 Refugees roaming from tent to tent to tent, looking for love
 The banknote is a half note, an octave above God
  
 O the great conjugator of curses: shit, shat, have shut!
 I have loved you both bowl-cut and shagged
  
 There are days when the sun is a great gash
 Nights, the moon smokes hashish and falls asleep on your lap
  
 Sorry, but your morphing was not satisfactory
 Shapeshifter, you choked on your magic scarf
  
  
 III.
  
 I heard this joke at the bar
 An agnostic dyslexic insomniac stayed up all night searching for doG
  
 The prosperity sign flips right side up again
 The Almanac says this Ox Year we'll toil like good immigrants
  
 Horse is frigid. Mule can't love
 Salmon dead at the redd
  
 One leg is stationary, the other must tread, must tread, must tread
 The Triads riddled him, then us
  
 What is the heart's past participle?
 She would have loved not to have loved
  
 I bought you at the corner of Agave and Revolucon
 You wrapped yourself thrice around my green arm and shat!
  
 A childless woman can feel the end of all existence
 Look, on that bloody spot, Chrysanthemum!
  
 Shamanka, fetch your grandmother at the bus stop
 Changeling, you are the one I love





Practicing
 

I want to write a love poem for the girls I kissed in seventh grade,
 a song for what we did on the floor in the basement
  
 of somebody's parents' house, a hymn for what we didn't say but thought:
 That feels good or I like that, when we learned how to open each other's mouths
  
 how to move our tongues to make somebody moan. We called it practicing, and
 one was the boy, and we paired off--maybe six or eight girls--and turned out
  
 the lights and kissed and kissed until we were stoned on kisses, and lifted our
 nightgowns or let the straps drop, and, Now you be the boy:
  
 concrete floor, sleeping bag or couch, playroom, game room, train room, laundry.
 Linda's basement was like a boat with booths and portholes
  
 instead of windows. Gloria's father had a bar downstairs with stools that spun,
 plush carpeting. We kissed each other's throats.
  
 We sucked each other's breasts, and we left marks, and never spoke of it upstairs
 outdoors, in daylight, not once. We did it, and it was
  
 practicing, and slept, sprawled so our legs still locked or crossed, a hand still lost
 in someone's hair . . . and we grew up and hardly mentioned who
  
 the first kiss really was--a girl like us, still sticky with moisturizer we'd 
 shared in the bathroom. I want to write a song
  
 for that thick silence in the dark, and the first pure thrill of unreluctant desire,
 just before we'd made ourselves stop.






The Morning Hour
 

And these hands my mother's
  
                              Washed.
  
 When washing was--when clean could not be.
 To wrap the body in cotton.              What imprisons.
  
                              When carrying humped--
  
 and these bald knuckles from her.
 The lips tight. Damp.              This Desire.
  
 Beyond that.              A tiny voice.
  
 The foreign woman
 who bends over--is spotted.
 Her wind is taken.
  
  
                                                          [            ]
  
 A closed back.           Turned in.           Centered.            A world shut out.
 The infinite lines welt.          Her voice is open.          Transparent.
 Dissolved.            A tunnel protector.           A subtle skin.          Olivia.
  
 Hold these shoes to the sun. They are just shoes.
 What the girl has not. How secret the burden. Carrying nothing.
 And common.            Breathe.
  
 This moment open.            She wrenches.             Falls into--
 this small casing inflamed.             She scrubs.             And is common.
  
  
                                                           [            ]
  
 What did Negro replace?
                       Claiming what could have been
                       Their strange feet making a way.
  
 And what metaphor?
 What could call the horrors?
  
 Pressing hands we cannot decipher.
 An arched woman hunches in.
 Presence.           Birth.              Our bracelet.
  
 Who navigated wooden ships?
                         This hardened ankle sucks black earth.
                         Her slight life.
  
 Help us poison position.
 And Olivia, the mouth of his children
 from the mouth of my vagina.
 And Olivia, what no memory can recall
 lost eternally inside covered wagons.
  
  
                                                            [            ]
  
 Walk eternities. Feet thick as throats.
 What will become a life.
  
 When do voices gain earth?
 The finest grain solved between the thumb and forefinger.
 Reads like the slightest movement of a hip.
  
 And nothing is left but time.             And God.              And the dense night.
 Against skins.
  
 What is simple
 is nothing.
  
 Imagine history.
 An entire race
 looks into 
 the slit camera eye.
  
  
                                                          [            ]
  
 Speak of going back,
 of gathering the horses,
 the prized memoirs
 that have nothing to do with place.
 and pack like a boy
 who leaves his slivered home.
  
 About land.
  
 What is familiar
 is the warm spice
 of a girl oiled
 in lavender.
  
 Into oceans.
  
 Lie and almost remember--
 almost breathe soiled air and ire.
  
 Count foreign.
 Make sense
 of the sounded boots
 that exhaled fate.
  
  
                                                             [            ]
  
 The footsteps are wet. Desire is wet.
 Is going step by step--
 the ash trail is wicked. The thicket wept.
  
 Must be quieted--the vast space between the--there.
 These tittied deities--Our Orishas--
 how they seized what they did not know.
  
 Every element is bare. Like ruptured mouths--
 who could not say--who uttered--who died not pronouncing.
 From Benin to this fractured exile.
  
                                             I am in this fist.
                                             I am a witness in exile.
  
 Our old. Two settlers. Claiming Land. The collective hum.
 A distant Lord Missy. And this huge hand reaches beneath the skin.
 Want is______________. I am hot inside the bone.
  
  
 Believe this exit.                                    Take. Take. Take

Act III, Sc. 2
 

Look she said this is not the distance
 we wanted to stay at--We wanted to get
 close, very close. But what
 is the way in again? And is it
  
 too late? She could hear the actions
 rushing past--but they are on
 another track. And in the silence,
 or whatever it is that follows,
  
 there was still the buzzing: motes, spores,
 aftereffects and whatnot recalled the morning after.
 Then the thickness you can't get past called waiting.
  
 Then the you, whoever you are, peering down to see if it's
                                                                       done yet.
 Then just the look on things being looked-at.
 Then just the look of things being seen.





The Visible World
 

I dig my hands into the absolute. The surface
                                                                  breaks
 into shingled, grassed clusters; lifts.
 If I press, pick-in with fingers, pluck,
 I can unfold the loam. It is tender. It is a tender
 maneuver, hands making and unmaking promises.
 Diggers, forgetters. . . . A series of successive single instances . . .
 Frames of reference moving . . .
 The speed of light, down here, upthrown, in my hands:
 bacteria, milky roots, pilgrimages of spores, deranged 
                                                                  and rippling
 mosses. What heat is this in me
 that would thaw time, making bits of instance
                                                                    overlap
 shovel by shovelful--my present a wind blowing through
                                                                          this culture
 slogged and clutched-firm with decisions, overridings,
                                                                      opportunities
 taken? . . . If I look carefully, there in my hand, if I
                                                      break it apart without
 crumbling: husks, mossy beginnings and endings, ruffled
                                                                            airy loambits,
 and the greasy silks of clay crushing the pinerot
                                                                             in . . .
 Erasure. Tell me something and then take it back.
 Bring this pellucid moment--here on this page now
                                                        as on this patch
 of soil, my property--bring it up to the top and out
                                                                                of
 sequence. Make it dumb again--won't you?--what 
                                                                      would it
 take? Leach the humidities out, the things that will
                                                                          insist on
 making meaning. Parch it. It isn't hard: just take this
                                                                           shovelful
 and spread it out, deranged, a vertigo of single
                                                                      clots
 in full sun and you can, easy, decivilize it, un-
                                                                 hinge it
 from its plot. Upthrown like this, I think you can
                                                              eventually
 abstract it. Do you wish to?
 Disentangled, it grows very very clear.
 Even the mud, the sticky lemon-colored clay
 hardens and then yields, crumbs.
 I can't say what it is then, but the golden-headed
                                                    hallucination,
 mating, forgetting, speckling, inter-
                                            locking,
 will begin to be gone from it and then its glamorous
                                                                             veil of
 echoes and muddy nostalgias will
 be gone. If I touch the slender new rootings they show me
                                                                             how large I
 am, look at these fingers--what a pilot--I touch, I press
                                                                          their slowest
 electricity. . . . What speed is it at?
 What speed am I at here, on my knees, as the sun traverses now
                                                                                  and just begins
 to touch my back. What speed where my fingers, under the
                                                                               dark oaks,
 are suddenly touched, lit up--so white as they move, the ray for
                                                                                          a moment
 on them alone in the small wood.
 White hands in the black-green glade,
 opening the muddy cartoon of the present, taking the tiny roots
                                                                                         of the moss
 apart, hired hands, curiosity's small army, so white
                                                         in these greens--
 make your revolution in the invisible temple,
 make your temple in the invisible
 revolution--I can't see the errands you run, hands gleaming
                                                             for this instant longer
 like tinfoil at the bottom here of the tall
                                       whispering oaks . . .
 Listen, Boccioni the futurist says a galloping horse
                                                                has not four
 legs (it has twenty)--and "at C there is no sequence
 because there is no time--and since
 at lightspeed, etc. (everything is simultaneous): my hands
 serrated with desires, shoved into these excavated
                                                                            fates
 --mauve, maroons, gutters of flecking golds--
 my hands are living in myriad manifestations
                                                        of light. . . .
 "All forms of imitation are to be despised.
 "All subjects previously used must be discarded.
 "At last we shall rush rapidly past objectiveness . . .
 Oh enslavement, will you take these hands
                                        and hold them in
 for a time longer? Tops of the oaks, do you see my tiny
                                                                       golden hands
 pushed, up to the wrists,
 into the present? Star I can't see in daylight, young, light
                                                                      and airy star--
 I put the seed in. The beam moves on.





Mosquito
 

I was climbing up the sliding board
When suddenly I felt
A mosquito bite my bottom
And it raised a big red welt. 

So I said to that mosquito,
"I'm sure you wouldn't mind
If I took a pair of tweezers
And I tweezered your behind!

He shriveled up his body
And he shuffled to his feet,
And he said, "I'm awfully sorry
But a skeeter's got to eat!
Still, there are mosquito manners,
And I must have just forgot 'em.
And I swear I'll never never never
Bite another bottom.

But a minute later Archie Hill
And Buck and Theo Brown
Were horsing on the monkey bars,
Hanging upside down. 
They must have looked delicious
From a skeeter's point of view
'Cause he bit 'em on the bottoms,
Archie, Buck and Theo too!

You could hear 'em goin' HOLY!
You could hear 'em goin' WHACK!
You could hear 'em cuss and holler,
Goin' smack, smack, smack.

A mosquito's awful sneaky,
A mosquito's mighty sly,
But I never never never
Thought a skeeter'd tell a lie.





Benny Said, Ruby Said
 

Benny said
To Ruby Lee,
"M-A-R-R-Y M-E!
Ruby said,
To Benny,
"Ben, wouldn't
That be F-U-N?

Benny said,
"My Ruby Lee,
We will W-E-D
Only if you let me K-
I-S-S you 
Every day!





Vinegar
 

It was such a lovely day
Till I stumbled in the way
Of a van that carries vinegar to stores. 
When I glared up at the man--
Operator of the van--
He said, "Vinegar, it never rains but pours!

Now a skunk was standing by. 
And I thought that I would cry
From the vinegar that sprayed and soaked my clothes,
When the driver kindly yells,
"Watch that animal. It smells!--
And the skunk ran off, a hankie to her nose.





Snake Song
 

Toad gots measles
Frog gots mumps
Both gots such
Disgusting bumps. 

They so ugly
It's a sin.
They be jumpin'
Out that skin. 

Pay no mind
These creepy items
Close my eyes
I bite 'ems, bite 'ems.





One Cow, Two Moos
 

We used to have a single cow,
We called her Mrs. Rupple. 
But she got struck by a lightning bolt,
And now we have a couple. 

She's walking sort of funny now,
Oh pity her poor calf. 
Old Mrs. Rupple gives no milk,
She gives us half-and-half.





What to Wear Where
 

When I was a boy
 In Looziana,
 We wore blue jeans
 And a red bandanna.
  
 My folks moved up
 To the state of Maine,
 We wore duck shoes
 In slicker-suit rain.
  
 My folks moved down
 To the state of Texas,
 We wore brand names
 Like Lazy X's.
  
 Now that we're living
 It up in Vermont,
 We wear pretty much
 Whatever we want.
 





First Girls in Little League Baseball
 

December 26, 1974Title IX of the 1972 Education Act is signed, providing for equal opportunity in athletics for girls as well as boys.
The year was 1974
When Little Leaguers learned the score.
President Ford took out his pen,
And signed a law that said from then
On women too would have the chance
To wear the stripes and wear the pants.
Now what you hear, as flags unfurl,
Is "Atta boy!" and "Atta girl!"





The Atrophy of Private LIfe
 

          
          In the heavy fashion magazines strewn here and there around the house the photos of objects and people mouth the word "money, but you, assuming no one wants you anymore, mishear the message as "meaning. Arousal follows. The lives of the rich are so fabulous! The destruction of the poetical lies heavily on their hands, as on their swollen notion that we are always watching. There is nothing behind the mask. Nothing suffocating under its pressure, no human essence trying to get out.     Awareness, always awareness. Don't you see how these elaborate masks are turning you into a zombie? The private life is not for the eye but for the endless interior. It is trying to push all this crap aside and find the missing line. Nobody, least of all the future, cares about the outcome of this quest.      It is easy to lose, through meddling or neglect, an entire aspect of existence. And sometimes, to cultivate a single new thought, you need not only silence but an entirely new life.
        




Calling Him Back from Layoff
 

I called a man today. After he said
 hello and I said hello came a pause
 during which it would have been
  
 confusing to say hello again so I said
 how are you doing and guess what, he said
 fine and wondered aloud how I was
  
 and it turns out I'm OK. He
 was on the couch watching cars
 painted with ads for Budweiser follow cars
  
 painted with ads for Tide around an oval
 that's a metaphor for life because
 most of us run out of gas and settle
  
 for getting drunk in the stands
 and shouting at someone in a t-shirt
 we want kraut on our dog. I said
  
 he could have his job back and during
 the pause that followed his whiskers
 scrubbed the mouthpiece clean
  
 and his breath passed in and out
 in the tidal fashion popular
 with mammals until he broke through
  
 with the words how soon thank you
 ohmyGod which crossed his lips and drove
 through the wires on the backs of ions
  
 as one long word as one hard prayer
 of relief meant to be heard
 by the sky. When he began to cry I tried
  
 with the shape of my silence to say
 I understood but each confession
 of fear and poverty was more awkward
  
 than what you learn in the shower.
 After he hung up I went outside and sat
 with one hand in the bower of the other
  
 and thought if I turn my head to the left
 it changes the song of the oriole
 and if I give a job to one stomach other
  
 forks are naked and if tonight a steak
 sizzles in his kitchen do the seven
 other people staring at their phones
  
 hear?






The Bridge
 

That there are things that can never be the same about
 my face, the houses, or the sand, that I was born under the
 sign of the sheep, that like Abraham Lincoln I am serious
 but also lacking in courage,
  
 That from this yard I have been composing a great speech,
 that I write about myself, that it's good to be a poet, that I look
 like the drawing of a house that was pencilled by a child,
 that curiously, I miss him and my mind is not upon the Pleaides,
 that I love the ocean and its foam against the sky,
  
 That I am sneezing like a lion in this garden that he knows
 the lilies of his Nile, distant image, breakfast, a flock of birds
 and sparrows from the sky,
  
 That I am not the husband of Cassiopeia, that I am not
 the southern fish, that I am not the last poet of civilization,
 that if I want to go out for a walk and then to find myself
 beneath a bank of trees, weary, that this is the life that I had,
  
 That curiously I miss the sound of the rain pounding
 on the roof and also all of Oakland, that I miss the sounds of
 sparrows dropping from the sky, that there are sparks behind
 my eyes, on the radio, and the distant sound of sand blasters,
 and breakfast, and every second of it, geometric, smoke
 from the chimney of the trees where I was small,
  
 That in January, I met him in a bar, we went
 home together, there was a lemon tree in the back yard,
 and a coffee house where we stood outside and kissed,
  
 That I have never been there, curiously, and that it never was
 the same, the whole of the island, or the paintings of the stars,
 fatherly, tied to sparrows as they drop down from the sky,
  
 O rattling frame where I am, I am where there are still
 these assignments in the night, to remember the texture
 of the leaves on the locust trees in August, under the
 moonlight, rounded, through a window in the hills,
  
 That if I stay beneath the pole star in this harmony of
 crickets that will sing, the bird sound on the screen,
 the wide eyes of the owl form of him still in the dark,
 blue, green, with shards of the Pacific,
  
 That I do not know the dreams from which I have come,
 sent into the world without the blessing of a kiss, behind the
 willow trees, beside the darkened pansies on the deck beside
 the ships, rocking, I have written this, across the back of the 
 sky, wearing a small and yellow shirt, near the reptile house,
 mammalian, no bigger than the herd,
  
 That I wrote the history of the war waged between the
 Peloponnesians and the south, that I like to run through
 shopping malls, that I've also learned to draw, having been
 driven here, like the rain is driven into things, into the
 ground, beside the broken barns, by the railroad tracks,
 beside the sea, I, Thucydides, having written this, having
 grown up near the ocean.
 





Aubade
 

Lathe of the ocean. Perpetual
 Motion machine of the waves. Everything still
 Being turned and shaped to a shape nobody
 Foresees: Ten years ago, was it, when we
  
 Walked that shore, too earnest and sheepish
 To hold hands? The wind cutting through our clothes
 Cleansed and burned, the chill off the Atlantic
 An ache we courted in our dumbstruck talk:
  
 Callow, expectant, what wouldn't love give?
 Cavalcanti's ray from Mars, Dante's wheel that moves
 The planets and the stars, how nervous
 We were, awkward and shivering: "Like this,
  
 Do you like it like this? Up all night,
 Then waking to the smell of flannel and sweat,
 We lay grateful, winded, goosefleshed in the chill,
 Our own atmosphere rich and breathable:
  
 We drank round the clock, embracing extremes,
 Too hurried and heartsore to think of time
 Out fishing after midnight, we watched schools of squid
 Slide and shimmer, tentacles tight-wrapped
  
 Around our gig's hooks: Yanked from the water,
 They spouted jets of ink, then pulsed and quivered
 And faded to dead-white, their eyes, resigned and sober,
 Opening wider and widerTen years more,
  
 And will either of us remember
 That ink sticky on our hands, the moon-glare
 Rippling as we knelt underneath the pier
 And scrubbed and scrubbed our hands in the dark water?
 





Intelligence
 

Wiretaps and tapes, concealed
 bugs and mikes,
                            intercepted letters
 full of passionate declarations, contradictory
 intelligence--
                            how attached he'd grown
 to the subject's documents, revising and rearranging
 the influx of intelligence
 with a sentiment, he acknowledged, almost
                            like love: he felt
 the cool gray eyes of his superiors
 trained on him, rebuking him
                            for swerving, for letting
 himself go--such tender obsession
 occasioned by the file!
                            Not quite the professional style
 he or the Agency expected
  
 But such official loyalties
                            seemed mere protocol to this!--
 what was wrong with him,
                            he wondered, that he construed
 the documents to make the subject
 seem a hero,
                            a bastard whose sole patrimony
 was a pair of shoes and a rusted sword
 left by an unknown father beneath a stone?
  
 And yet his exploits in the tabloids,
 the headlines screaming,
  
 SCOURGE OF MONSTERS STRIKES AGAIN!
 HERO FOUNDS REPUBLIC
  
                            were these heroic
 different in kind from the rumors,
 unverified,
                            of a rape, a murder?
  
 --But to have met undisguised the devouring monster!
 To have escaped the twisting tunnels of the maze
  
 On balance, for such a life,
                            the hero's reputation wasn't bad:
 think of the opportunities for evil
                            a man of such qualities must have had!
 How well he knew him--an essential innocence
 that followed impulse, blind
 to protocol, not noticeably more kind
                            than he was cruel.
 But to stamp Case Closed and cease
                            gathering intelligence,
 to give the hero up, almost, he admitted,
 like a lover:
                            such limits the hero
 unknowingly transgressed!
 And the Agency, cold-blooded where
                            limits were concerned ("mere protocol?--
 more like a second backbone!), committed
                            to keeping order, could not afford
 such sentiments--the Chief of Security
 felt an awful pang: that the work of intelligence
                            should lead to this
  
 He leaned back in his chair and sighed:
                            a forged genealogy certifying
 that the hero's father was a king; a mutual
 assistance pact
                            to aid in taking back the usurped crown:
 he could see them now, the wind
 blowing lightly, the two of them sweating
 as they climbed the cliff, discussing
                            the terms, exchanging information,
 intelligence--
                            how would his own face look
 staring down across the sea
                            as he gestured earnestly toward
 some island, saying,
                            "According to our sources,
 the tax revenues
                            And then, edging
 the hero closer to the cliff, pointing
                            out the harbor, he'd push.
 





The Wound
 

When I woke the darkness was so thick,
 So palpable and black that my eyes
 Seemed blind as stone staring into stone.
  
 The blade that I had dreamed, efficient and quick
 As it cut into my thigh, cleaning a gangrened
 Wound infected to the bone, seemed poised
  
 Above my throat: Close-grained, impenetrable,
 The blackness rose before me like a wall.
 And then off in the next room, nervous, light,
  
 A soft padding as of an animal
 Raced like my heartbeat in my temples
 Round and round, trapped, stealthily desperate
  
 As if hunting its own track, terrified
 And captivated by its own odor.
 Skin cool in the night air, eyes drilling
  
 Through the dark, who I was before I
 Slept had burned off like a vapor
 So that amnesiac and pure, witnessing
  
 My terror that I no longer recognized
 As my own, my mind floated beyond me
 To confront that frantic, closing footfall
  
 As Jacob dreaming met his dark angel--
 Though in my wrestling nothing blessed me
 Or promised any blessing; but was a mask whose eyes
  
 Were all black pupil, blind as molten tar.
 I strained to see what paced there, my eyes burning
 Through the dark until a pair of eyes blazed
  
 Back across the blackness, an insistent, glazed
 Staring that shimmered and disappeared.
 The shining blade plunged at my throat, my mind
  
 Stretched and twisted, its wires tightening
 And turning as the creature lunged back and forth
 And with a deep-throated yowling, thrashing
  
 And thrashing to fight clear of its own circling,
 Cleanly leapt away. I reached for the knife
 But gripped only air, my eyes pressing
  
 Deeper and deeper into the night's black stone,
 Cutting the way the knife had cut into my wound,
 Probing for the white shining of the bone:
  
 What had I become? What darkness had my dream
 Led me down into? Too frightened even 
 To move, I lay bound and sweating in
  
 The sheets, the moon a warning-bell beating
 On the glass, its light carving out the curtains
 Like the shadow of a wing across the windowpane.
 





The Last Word
 

for Lem 
As if your half-witted tongue
 Spoke with an eloquence
 Death bestows, I heard your voice
 Muffled through the dark
 Layers of cemetery loam:
  
 "They found me black-suited
 In the shuttered half-dark, my eyes
 Dug like claws into the clouds'
 Soft feather-turnings. What kept me
 Separate the broiling sun
  
 Of intellect now shone on fiercely:
 In the sheep-pens stinking
 Of dung and lanolin,
 I buried my face in the ewe's
 Swollen side and listened
  
 For the lamb the way
 The night sky listens
 To the synapse-fire
 Of meteors, the fibrillating
 Heartbeat of the stars.
  
 I heard the cells crackle
 Into being, the embryonic
 Brain begin to burn:
 Hunger. Thirst. Beneath my ear
 My own disastrous birthing,
  
 The umbilicus strangling
 Like a whip around my neck,
 Shoved through the momentary
 Breach memory tore open--
 Dying revealed to me my birth,
  
 How half my brain went dark,
 One side of a universe
 Pinched out like a candle:
 Just smart enough to sense
 My difference, yet not know why--
  
 Even my death was the thrust
 Of a bewildering punchline: On Thanksgiving
 Morning mouthwatering
 Pain shoved like a spit
 From my bowels to my brain.
 





The Acts of Youth
 

And with great fear I inhabit the middle of the night
What wrecks of the mind await me, what drugs
to dull the senses, what little I have left,
what more can be taken away?

The fear of travelling, of the future without hope
or buoy. I must get away from this place and see
that there is no fear without me: that it is within
unless it be some sudden act or calamity

to land me in the hospital, a total wreck, without
memory again; or worse still, behind bars. If
I could just get out of the country. Some place
where one can eat the lotus in peace.

For in this country it is terror, poverty awaits; or
am I a marked man, my life to be a lesson
or experience to those young who would trod
the same path, without God

unless he be one of justice, to wreak vengeance
on the acts committed while young under un-
due influence or circumstance. Oh I have
always seen my life as drama, patterned

after those who met with disaster or doom.
Is my mind being taken away me.
I have been over the abyss before. What
is that ringing in my ears that tells me

all is nigh, is naught but the roaring of the winter wind.
Woe to those homeless who are out on this night.
Woe to those crimes committed from which we
can walk away unharmed.

So I turn on the light
And smoke rings rise in the air.
Do not think of the future; there is none.
But the formula all great art is made of.

Pain and suffering. Give me the strength
to bear it, to enter those places where the
great animals are caged. And we can live
at peace by their side. A bride to the burden

that no god imposes but knows we have the means
to sustain its force unto the end of our days.
For that is what we are made for; for that 
we are created. Until the dark hours are done.

And we rise again in the dawn.
Infinite particles of the divine sun, now
worshipped in the pitches of the night.





May You Always be the Darling of Fortune
 

March 10th and the snow flees like eloping brides
into rain. The imperceptible change begins
out of an old rage and glistens, chaste, with its new
craving, spring. May your desire always overcome
 
your need; your story that you have to tell,
enchanting, mutable, may it fill the world
you believe: a sunny view, flowers lunging
from the sill, the quilt, the chair, all things
 
fill with you and empty and fill. And hurry, because
now as I tire of my studied abandon, counting
the days, I'm sad. Yet I trust your absence, in everything
wholly evident: the rain in the white basin, and I
 
vigilant. 
 





All at Once
 

Trees have whole streets
                                           of when they were planted
plaqued with when the city is
                                              to inherit them dead
of age almost all at once as if
                                            a natural bombing.
 
 
People see a bill not figured in,
                                                      a blood red
collection come
                   like fall's leaf    due without fail
an unseen cost of the design:
                               pale bud and yellow blossom--
 
 
though seeming little to do this time
                                       with tense spring
in the window
                                of dead and dying trees' terms up,
with expecting a life by life replacement--
                     not this plague of life's time
 
 
as a season across the city.
                                             By trial we do, but don't
know how death counts the rings
                                                   from trees to clocks,
species to singled soul
                                          at its hour. or on history's days we all die at once.






A Low Bank of Cloud
 

But for a low bank of cloud,
         clear morning,    empty sky.
 
The bright band of light beneath  the cloud's gray
       I thought at first was open distance,    but it's ice
 
that by extension raised the lake above the lip of blue lake
       and spilled it farther out than that horizon
 
along the sky
       and floods the clouds.
 
 
      Seeing the distant level further
unfurl into the sky says not to trust
 
      blue line as terminus
when a meniscus of ice
 
       can ride up that wall of the skyline,
a measure of illusion how close
 
       the eye can be to filled
with seeing,        to widen instead the tube of that measure
 
 
of sight we are given.        There is the larger
        lake the wider look we open
 
eyes to see. That glance of the lip
        put in a bigger cylinder falls away,
 
but how much deeper the spring
       to fill the cup.
 
As if the surface we are seeing
        drops          the more seeing is added,
 
 
       while we feel the stories well as our height
from which to see.         And watch the dawns coming.
 
I seem to be emptying
of time        the more time I put in,
 
       and see like a man with weathered eyes enough
to face to face up   to the sight's field expanded
 
       to insight.    To the dark the lake can turn
and curl up like a map for poems to have
 
 
these likenesses to graph,
        then come un-scrolled from semblance back
 
to just this lake.        Water
       cities are led to        layout
 
beside.      But never in stillness;
       always the restoration to change,
 
from ice, from cloud, turning to clear
        liquid--as is most of our body
 
 
        water--       thinned sheet, layer
that if written        on or with,         a bearing
 
a name chiseled on water
       disappears.    






As at the Far Edge of Circling
 

       As at the far edge of circling the country,
facing suddenly the other ocean,
the boundless edge of what I had wanted
to know, I stepped
      into my answers' shadow ocean,
 
the tightening curl of the corners
of outdated old paperbacks,    breakers,
a crumble surf of tiny dry triangles around
       my ankles sinking in my stand
 
taken      that the horizon written
by the spin of my compass is          that this is
is not enough         a point to turn around on,
 
       is like a skin      that falls short of edge
as a rug,     that covers a no longer
natural spot, no longer existent
to live on from,    the map of my person
        come to the end of,       but not done.
 
        That country crossed was what I could imagine,
and that little spit of answer is the shadow--
not the ocean which casts it--      that I step next
into       to be cleansed of question.
 
      But not of seeking      it as
if simplified for the seeking,
       come to its end at this body.






A Slim Volume Taken Into the Provinces
 

I have to leave early in the dark
and hungry to avoid
crossing the snow as the noon
 
burns the crust
into an un-servable lake
slush instead of the crisp bridge
 
that would be in order
to get me over the ridge
 
My journal is already laundered clean
of my words      and my instructions
have dissolved
 
into a white mash       a washed bone
ball         rolled into itself
of all I have in the world       in my pocket
 
 
The ink is thin the paper is poor
my eyes balance on the pale
words around which a stream
 
flows     almost erasing
the way across
the idea
 
Shadows         the black flowers
of the light self
-sowing through the trees
 
dark gardens        of midnight
for the gray-white morning
hour        of blindness
 
in print miles before I am
to arrive        here
 
To approach the waiting milestone
dims whatever else of its lantern
til only the placed light there is on me.
 
In this light       barely      but used to it
I can make out the staggered columns of my account
as if back through weren't the real distance:
 
the thin chest flag pinned on by each ridge
the titled introduction taking your coat each storm.
 
 
My letters and ribbons have been the natural--
strengths on their way to the more--
natural weaknesses--         and loss.        yet--
 
I wonder where I thought I was going--
to 've done what you must pass
examinations for before I took any.






truth
 

And if sun comes
How shall we greet him?
Shall we not dread him,
Shall we not fear him
After so lengthy a
Session with shade?
 
Though we have wept for him,
Though we have prayed
All through the night-years--
What if we wake one shimmering morning to
Hear the fierce hammering
Of his firm knuckles
Hard on the door?
 
Shall we not shudder?--
Shall we not flee
Into the shelter, the dear thick shelter
Of the familiar
Propitious haze?
 
Sweet is it, sweet is it
To sleep in the coolness
Of snug unawareness.
 
The dark hangs heavily
Over the eyes.
 






Samuel Beckett's Dublin
 

When it is cold it stinks, and not till then.
The seasonable or more rabid heats
Of love and summer in some other cities
Unseal the all too human: not in his.
When it is cold it stinks, but not before;
 
Smells to high heaven then most creaturely
When it is cold. It stinks, but not before
His freezing eye has done its best to maim,
To amputate limbs, livelihood and name,
Abstracting life beyond all likelihood.
 
When it is cold it stinks, and not till then
Can it be fragrant. On canal and street,
Colder and colder, Murphy to Molloy,
The weather hardens round the Idiot Boy,
The gleeful hero of the long retreat.
 
When he is cold he stinks, but not before,
This living corpse. The existential weather
Smells out in these abortive minims, men
Who barely living therefore altogether
Live till they die; and sweetly smell till then.






The Nonconformist
 

X, whom society's most mild command,
For instance evening dress, infuriates,
In art is seen confusingly to stand
For disciplined conformity, with Yeats.
 
Taxed to explain what this resentment is
He feels for small proprieties, it comes,
He likes to think, from old enormities
And keeps the faith with famous martyrdoms.
 
Yet it is likely, if indeed the crimes
His fathers suffered rankle in his blood,
That he find least excusable the times
When they acceded, not when they withstood.
 
How else explain this bloody-minded bent
To kick against the prickings of the norm;
When to conform is easy, to dissent;
And when it is most difficult, conform?






Across the Bay
 

A queer thing about those waters: there are no
Birds there, or hardly any.
I did not miss them, I do not remember
Missing them, or thinking it uncanny.
 
The beach so-called was a blinding splinter of limestone,
A quarry outraged by hulls.
We took pleasure in that: the emptiness, the hardness
Of the light, the silence, and the water's stillness.
 
But this was the setting for one of our murderous scenes.
This hurt, and goes on hurting:
The venomous soft jelly, the undersides.
We could stand the world if it were hard all over.






In California
 

Chemicals ripen the citrus;
There are rattlesnakes in the mountains,
And on the shoreline
Hygiene, inhuman caution.
 
Beef in cellophane
Tall as giraffes,
The orange-rancher's daughters
Crop their own groves, mistrustful.
 
Perpetual summer seems
Precarious on the littoral. We drive
Inland to prove
The risk we sense. At once
 
Winter claps-to like a shutter
High over the Ojai valley, and discloses
A double crisis,
Winter and Drought.
 
Ranges on mountain-ranges,
Empty, unwatered, crumbling,
Hot colours come at the eye.
It is too cold
 
For picnics at the trestle-tables. Claypit
Yellow burns on the distance.
The phantom walks
Everywhere, of intolerable heat.
 
At Ventucopa, elevation
Two-eight-nine-six, the water hydrant frozen,
Deserted or broken settlements,
Gasoline stations closed and boarded.
 
By nightfall, to the snows;
And over the mile on tilted
Mile of the mountain park
The bright cars hazarded.






Rodez
 

Northward I came, and knocked in the coated wall
At the door of a low inn scaled like a urinal
With greenish tiles. The door gave, and I came
 
Home to the stone north, every wynd and snicket
Known to me wherever the flattened cat
Squirmed home to a hole between housewall and paving.
 
Known! And in the turns of it, no welcome,
No flattery of the beckoned lighted eye
From a Rose of the rose-brick alleys of Toulouse.
 
Those more than tinsel garlands, more than masks,
Unfading wreaths of ancient summers, I
Sternly cast off. A stern eye is the graceless
 
Bulk and bruise that at the steep uphill
Confronts me with its drained-of-colour sandstone
Implacably. The Church. It is Good Friday.
 
Goodbye to the Middle Ages! Although some
Think that I enter them, those centuries
Of monkish superstition, here I leave them
 
With their true garlands, and their honest masks,
Every fresh flower cast on the porch and trodden,
Raked by the wind at the Church door on this Friday.
 
Goodbye to all the centuries. There is
No home in them, much as the dip and turn
Of an honest alley charmingly deceive us.
 
And not yet quite goodbye. Instead almost
Welcome, I said. Bleak equal centuries
Crowded the porch to be deflowered, crowned.






A Spring Song
 

"stooped to truth and moralized his song
Spring pricks a little. I get out the maps.
Time to demoralize my song, high time.
Vernal a little. Primavera. First
Green, first truth and last.
High time, high time.
 
A high old time we had of it last summer?
I overstate. But getting out the maps
Look! Up the valley of the Brenne,
Louise de la Vallire Syntax collapses.
High time for that, high time.
 
To Chteau-Renault, the tannery town whose marquis
Rooke and James Butler whipped in Vigo Bay
Or so the song says, an amoral song
Like Ronsard's where we go today
Perhaps, perhaps tomorrow.
 
Tomorrow and tomorrow and Get well!
Philip's black-sailed familiar, avaunt
Or some word as ridiculous, the whole
Diction kit begins to fall apart.
High time it did, high time.
 
High time and a long time yet, my love!
Get out that blessed map.
Ageing, you take your glasses off to read it.
Stooping to truth, we potter to Montoire.
High time, my love. High time and a long time yet.






No Epitaph
 

No moss nor mottle stains
My parents' unmarked grave;
My word on them remains
Stouter than stone, you told me.
 
"Martyred to words, you have thought,
Should be your epitaph;
At other times you fought
My self-reproaches down.
 
Though bitterly once or twice
You have reproached me with how
Everything ended in words,
We both know better now:
 
You understand, I shall not
If I survive you care
To raise a headstone for
You I have carved on air.






The Craftsman
 

I ply with all the cunning of my art
This little thing, and with consummate care
I fashion it--so that when I depart,
Those who come after me shall find it fair
And beautiful. It must be free of flaws--
Pointing no laborings of weary hands;
And there must be no flouting of the laws
Of beauty--as the artist understands.
 
Through passion, yearnings infinite--yet dumb--
I lift you from the depths of my own mind
And gild you with my soul's white heat to plumb
The souls of future men. I leave behind
This thing that in return this solace gives:
"He who creates true beauty ever lives.
 





Sylt II
 

The wind that makes your hair grow faster
opens a child's mouth full of strawberry and sand.
Slow and sure 
on the scales of the ocean
the child's head outweighs the sun.

Inside of the wind-- 
                                       a blister of a church,
its walls thicker than the space from wall to wall
where the wind shifts shade and light
like two rival chess pieces
or two unmatched pieces of furniture. 
Inside of the church--such a stillness
that when a feather floats down in a fist of dust
it becomes a rock by the time it hits the ground.

Organ pipes glint like a cold radiator,
contained in a case of a carved tree, its branches
tied up with a snake.
Organ pedals, golden and plump, are the tree's only fruit.

It is all about the release of weight: 
the player crushes the pedals like grapes underneath his feet.
My body, like an inaccurate cashier, adds your weight to itself.
Your name, called into the wind,
slows the wind down.

When a body is ripe, it falls and rots from the softest spot. 

Only when a child slips and drops off a tree,
the tree suddenly learns that it is barren. 






Mocking Bird Hotel
 

A woman's hallelujah! washes the foot of Mocking Bird 
Hill, her face eclipsed by her black mouth, 
her eyes rolled up like workman's sleeves. 
Stirred up, a fly speaks in the tongue of the hotel 
doorbell, where, on the sun-ridden straw terrace 
my salvation means less than praise
to a dumb child. Damned, blinded by ice cubes, 
the fly surrenders its life into the waiter's clean hands. 

Behind the kitchen of the Mocking Bird Hotel
a rooster repeats hallelujah! until it loses its head.
A man harvests the Family Tree before his forefathers'
features have a chance to ripen on their faces. Parakeets 
watch him from the bare nerves of the garden. He harvests 
before the worms that eat his father turn into demons.

Do not eat the fruit from your Family Tree. You have
eyes not to see them, hands not to pick them, teeth
not to bite them, tongue not to taste them even in speech. 
The waiter slashes the table with our bill. We descend 
Mocking Bird Hill without raising dust. Dogs, 
their fur hanging like wet feathers off their backs, 
piss yellow smoke without lifting a leg. Gulls 
smash their heads between their wings. 
Light lays the eggs of shadows under the shrubs. 
Produce shacks stand empty like football gates. 
What appeared blue from afar, turns green. 
                 I hold it all in, even my own urine. 
But the mother of vowels slumps from my throat 
like the queen of a havocked beehive. 

Higher than hallelujah! rising like smoke over the hill,
I scream at the top of that green lung, 
                                                                    why, in the Mocking Bird 
Hell, do you value your blood over your sweat,
that bitterness over this salt, that wound over this 
crystal? But often, to shed light on the darkness, light 
isn't enough. Often what I need is even a darker
darkness. Like in those hours before the sun incriminates this
hotel, his two nostrils that illuminate our benighted bodies. 






Impasse
 

Sei allem Abschied voran: half

a line from Rilke's Die Sonettean Orpheus as my motto,

I rehearsed my elegiac art("be in advance of all parting)

and won, I thought, with each song deeper,until I stood before the keeper

in whom I've come to recognize myself.






The Manhattan Project
 

          
          First, J. Robert Oppenheimer wrote his paper on dwarf stars--"What happens to a massive star that burns out? he asked. His calculations suggested that instead of collapsing it would contract indefinitely, under the force of its own gravity. The bright star would disappear but it would still be there, where there had been brilliance there would be a blank. Soon after, workers built Oak Ridge, the accumulation of Cemesto hutments not placed on any map. They built a church, a school, a bowling alley. From all over, families drove through the muddy ruts. The ground swelled about the ruts like flesh stitched by sutures. My father, a child, watched the loads on the tops of their cars tip. Gates let everyone in and out with a pass. Forbidden to tell anyone they were there, my father's family moved in, quietly, behind the chain-link fence. Niels Bohr said, "This bomb might be our great hope. My father watched his parents eat breakfast: his father opened his newspaper across the plate of bacon and eggs, his mother smoked Camel straights, the ash from her cigarette cometing across the back of the obituaries. They spoke little. Increasingly the mother drank Wild Turkey with her women friends from the bowling league. Generators from the y-12 plant droned their ambition. There were no birds. General Leslie Groves marched the boardwalks, yelled, his boots pressed the slates and the mud bubbled up like viscera. My father watched his father enter the plant. My shy father went to the library, which was a trailer with a circus tent painted on the side. There he read the definition of "uranium which was worn to a blur. My father read one Hardy Boys mystery after another. It was August 1945. The librarian smiled sympathetically at the 12-year-old boy. "Time to go home, the librarian said. They named the bomb Little Boy. It weighed 9,700 pounds. It was the size of a go-kart. On the battle cruiser Augusta, President Truman said, "This is the greatest thing in history. That evening, my father's parents mentioned Japanese cities. Everyone was quiet. It was the quiet of the exhausted and the innocent. The quietness inside my father was building and would come to define him. I was wrong to judge it. Speak, Father, and I will listen. And if you do not wish to speak, then I will listen to that.
        




A Language
 

I had heard the story before 
about the two prisoners, alone 
in the same cell, and one 
gives the other lessons in a language. 
Day after day, the pupil studies hard--
what else does he have to do?--and year 
after year they practice, 
waiting for the hour of release. 
They tackle the nouns, the cases, and genders, 
the rules for imperatives and conjugations, 
but near the end of his sentence, the teacher 
suddenly dies and only the pupil 
goes back through the gate and into the open 
world. He travels to the country of his new 
language, fluent, and full of hope. 
Yet when he arrives he finds 
that the language he speaks is not 
the language that is spoken. He has learned 
a language one other person knew--its inventor, 
his cell-mate and teacher.
                          And then the other 
evening, I heard the story again. 
This time the teacher was Gombrowicz, the pupil 
was his wife. She had dreamed of learning 
Polish and, hour after hour, for years 
on end, Gombrowicz had been willing to teach 
her a Polish that does not and never 
did exist. The man who told 
the story would like to marry his girlfriend. 
They love to read in bed and between
them speak three languages. 
They laughed--at the wife, at Gombrowicz, it wasn't
clear, and I wasn't sure that they 
themselves knew what was funny. 
I wondered why the man had told 
the story, and thought of the tricks 
enclosure can play. A nod, or silence, 
another nod, consent--or not, as a cloud 
drifts beyond the scene and the two 
stand pointing in different directions 
at the very same empty sky.
                           Even so, there was something 
else about the story, like teaching 
a stunt to an animal--a four-legged 
creature might prance on two legs 
or a two-legged creature might 
fall onto four.
                           I remembered, 
then, the miscarriage, and before that 
the months of waiting: like baskets filled 
with bright shapes, the imagination 
run wild. And then what arrived:
the event that was nothing, a mistaken idea, 
a scrap of charred cloth, the enormous 
present folding over the future, 
like a wave overtaking 
a grain of sand. 
                           There was a myth 
I once knew about twins who spoke 
a private language, though one 
spoke only the truth and the other 
only lies. The savior gets mixed 
up with the traitor, but the traitor 
stays as true to himself as a god. 

All night the rain falls here, falls there,
and the creatures dream, or drown, in the lair.






In the High Country
 

Some days I am happy to be no one
The shifting grasses 

In the May winds are miraculous enough
As they ripple through the meadow of lupine

The field as iridescent as a Renaissance heaven
& do you see that boy with his arms raised 

Like one of Raphael's angels held within
This hush & this pause & the sky's lapis expanse?

That boy is my son & I am his only father
Even when I am no one





From a Bridge
 

I saw my mother standing there below me
On the narrow bank just looking out over the river

Looking at something just beyond the taut middle rope 
Of the braided swirling currents

Then she looked up quite suddenly to the far bank
Where the densely twined limbs of the cypress

Twisted violently toward the storm-struck sky
There are some things we know before we know

Also some things we wish we would not ever know
Even if as children we already knew      & so

Standing above her on that bridge that shuddered 
Each time the river ripped at its wooden pilings 

I knew I could never even fate willing ever 
Get to her in time







Talking Blues
 

Raccoon you better be cool

Thought I saw you on Broadway
Eating King Fish's barbecue

Some people claim raccoon you pretty
Swear raccoon tame like a kitty 

But raccoon bites you if you get too close

I saw raccoon on Lenox Avenue
Stealing milk from a baby 

Thought I saw a black cat on the corner
But it was nothing but old raccoon

Raccoon let me school you 

Raccoon you know you too country
You better leave the city

Raccoon they got rats in New York City
Big as you and just as ornery 

Nobody in Harlem studying you raccoon
So you better go about your business

Raccoon you better get wise
Look what playing possum got the possum 






Momma Said
 

The slice I ate I want it back
Those crumbs I swept up
I'd like my share again
I can still taste it like it was 

The memory by itself is delicious
Each bite was a small miracle 
Both nourishing and sweet 
I wish I had saved just a little bit 

I know it wasn't a literal cake
It's the thought that counts
Like a gift that's not store-bought
Making it even more special  

Like a dream that makes you
Want to go back to sleep
You can't have your cake
And eat it too Momma said 

I was defiant and hardheaded
And answered yes I can too
The look she gave me said boy 
I hope you aren't a fool all your life






Sacramento O No
 

An asparagus eating contest--
I thought I'd misheard.

Downstairs the rude old man
lays tile, makes demasiado noise.
I fell asleep at last around 5:30 am
and he woke me an hour later or so:
it is better I don't look
at the clock. By this means
I clock my progress: I know now
it is sometimes better not to 
know. I have midnight equilibrium 
but it is gone by 3 am.

Thank you for Cloud of Sparrows,
man who wrote it. I read all night.
Thank you for the pen from Iran, Kamyar.
Its myriad stars have just run out of ink 
eleven years on.

Thank you, sun, for leaf shadows
on horrible carpet in horrible box
I live in and for tree by which I mean
what's living. I think of the gardens
I planted and left. I think of beets,
of beans and asparagus. Then
on the radio, hear the contest.

The noise of ten lanes of traffic
does not cancel the consolation
of seeing the wind 
in the sweetgum leaves. 
The experience of this 
is my food and my sleep.

As at some strange customs,
I declare.  






When I Was In Love and Out of All Else
 

"It must be awful, she said to the dog locked in it
as she left the kitchen that wasn't hers, closing its door,
to head up the stairs with every good thing she could find
to eat in her arms

                            (to eat in her arms--O Katherine!)

                                          "not to have any arms.






Prayer
 

If I were in a book it would be the book
in which some lesser angel bemoans
the state of my soul

and is comforted for it
and is corrected for it

by some greater angel who knows
as the reader knows that it is not one's soul
that suffers the indignities of ignobility: 
the inability to curb the petty smallness
of spirit, ungladness in the company
of bureaucrats, anger's decay,

in the sense that my soul itself cannot be
harmed nor tarnished though it can witness
my sorrow on finding that illness alters me
from the self I thought I'd more or less known. 

What can one do about one's nature?
I look at the spider that's finally 
restrung its great wheel away from the door.

I'd like to close the door, go away,
leaving the spider be.
I'd like to preclude the possibility
of angel, as of prey.






Pajama Quotient
 

Coinage of the not-yet-wholly-
             hardened custodians of public 
health, as health is roughly measured 
             in the rougher parts of Dearborn.

Meaning, how many parents,
             when things get bad, are wearing
what they've slept in when they come 
             to pick up the kids at school. 

The best of talk, said someone
             once, is shop talk: we can go 
to it as to a well. But manifolds
             and steering racks are going

the way of the wells--offshore--
             so the-nifty-thing-you-do-
with-the-wrench-when-the-foreman-
             has-sped-the-line-up

has become a ghastly shorthand for
             despair among the people
you are paid to help. Despair, 
             sometimes, of helping. In

the winter dawn a decade and a half
             ago, we'd gather around
the school bus stop--the unshaved
             fathers, mothers, dogs,

the siblings in their snowsuits--so
             the children bound for
Johnson Elementary might have
             a proper sending-off.
    
The privileged of the earth, in our
             case: words and stars
and molecules were all our care,
             a makeshift village blessed

with time and purpose. And
             a school bus stop,
to make it seem like life. By far my 
             favorites were the Russian

mathematicians: bathrobes hanging
             below their parkas, cigarettes
scattering ash, their little ones for the
             moment quite forgotten, they 

would cover the walls of the shelter 
             with what 
to most of us was Greek but was 
             no doubt of urgent consequence 

for quantum fields. So filled with joy: 
             their permanent markers on the  
brick. And then 
             the bus, and then the children off 

without us and our little human pretext 
             gone. Fragile the minutes.
Fragile the line between wonder
             and woe. The poet when he

wrote about our parents in the garden
             gave them love and rest
and mindfulness. But first 
             he gave them honest work.






Little Vietnam Futurist Poem
 

She came into my view as vivid as
Somebody on a screen in a movie seen,
Elegant in the focus of my eye.

Birdboned. Quick and light. Not wearing pajamas.
The little run resembling playfulness.
Calling out something, screaming something or other

As if her little mouth was fervently singing,
As if you couldn't hear what the words could be,
Because of the singing. I had her in my sight.

Other people were there, wearing pajamas, 
Streaming out of some hideyhole or other
Into the way that that was how I saw them.

The trees of the kind that grew there establish the place.
We know that way the story of what it was.






Movie Star Peter at the Supper for Street People
 

The style a form of concealment the way style is.
His manners seemed a parody, almost, 
Of manners, a movie star of bygone days;

Strangely elaborate, highly stylized manners,
Complicit with his fame and with your praise;
Looking toward you and then away from you,

Star-like, movie-star-like, a dance routine,
The walk almost a glide, or elegant shuffle,
Always on the verge of veering away,

Circling away and over to the other side
Of the frozen skating arena that he was on;
A dancer's courtesy, the courtesy,

I mean, of the dancer to the audience,
Flirtatious and familiar, only for you,
And entirely impersonal and withheld.

All of the above, though, maybe, misses the point,
Because it seems to say he knew about
What he was doing or what the style was for,

And nothing let one be sure that this was so;
A look on his face of amusement, as if he knew
A secret that he shared with you and yet

Kept to himself, as if it only showed 
The cryptogram but wouldn't provide the key
To read it with. But could he read the code?

One night, late at night, as we were driving
Home from having had dinner out, in Boston,
We saw him figure skating through Charles Street Circle,

Right through and among the circling lights of cars
As if with champion skill on thin ice whirling
Oblivious to the astonished blaring horns,

As a dancer or skater seems, while dancing to
The music that we hear, oblivious to
The music that we hear and listening to

Some other music heard from somewhere else.
So Peter moved like a dancer or skater through 
And among the dangerous outraged cars as if

Untouchable and untouched and moving to
The sounds of something else from somewhere else--
The music maybe of his madness was it?

It was as if he skated in solitude
And glided whirling on a lonely tarn
Far out away from everything there is.






Learning from History
 

They said, my saints, my slogan-sayers sang,   
Be good, my child, in spite of all alarm. 

They stood, my fathers, tall in a row and said,   
Be good, be brave, you shall not come to harm. 

I heard them in my sleep and muttering dream,   
And murmuring cried, How shall I wake to this? 

They said, my poets, singers of my song,   
We cannot tell, since all we tell you is 

But history, we speak but of the dead.   
And of the dead they said such history 

(Their beards were blazing with the truth of it)   
As made of much of me a mystery. 






That Evening At Dinner
 

By the last few times we saw her it was clear 
That things were different. When you tried to help her   
Get out of the car or get from the car to the door 
Or across the apartment house hall to the elevator   
There was a new sense of heaviness   
Or of inertia in the body. It wasn't   
That she was less willing to be helped to walk 
But that the walking itself had become less willing.   
Maybe the stupid demogorgon blind   
Recalcitrance of body, resentful of the laws   
Of mind and spirit, was getting its own back now, 
Or maybe a new and subtle, alien,   
Intelligence of body was obedient now   
To other laws: "Weight is the measure of 
The force with which a body is drawn downward 
To the center of the earth; "Inertia is   
The tendency of a body to resist   
Proceeding to its fate in any way   
Other than that determined for itself. 

That evening, at the Bromells' apartment, after 
She had been carried up through the rational structure   
By articulate stages, floor after flashing floor, 
And after we helped her get across the hall, 
And get across the room to a chair, somehow   
We got her seated in a chair that was placed   
A little too far away from the nearest table,   
At the edge of the abyss, and there she sat, 
Exposed, her body the object of our attention-- 
The heaviness of it, the helpless graceless leg, 
The thick stocking, the leg brace, the medical shoe. 

At work between herself and us there was   
A new principle of social awkwardness   
And skillfulness required of each of us.   
Our tones of voice in this easy conversation   
Were instruments of marvelous finesse,   
Measuring and maintaining with exactitude   
"The fact or condition of the difference 
There was between us, both in space and time. 

Her smiling made her look as if she had 
Just then tasted something delicious, the charm   
Her courtesy attributed to her friends. 

This decent elegant fellow human being 
Was seated in virtue, character, disability,   
Behind her the order of the ranged bookshelves,   
The windows monitored by Venetian blinds-- 
"These can be raised or lowered; numerous slats,   
Horizontally arranged, and parallel, 
Which can be tilted so as to admit 
Precisely the desired light or air. 

We were all her friends, Maggie, and Bill, and Anne,   
And I, and the nice Boston Brahmin elderly man   
Named Duncan, utterly friendly and benign. 
And of course it wasn't whether or not the world   
Was benign but whether it looked at her too much.   
She wasn't "painfully shy but just the same   
I wouldn't be surprised if there had been   
Painfulness in her shyness earlier on, 
Say at dancing school. Like others, though, she had   
Survived her childhood somehow. Nor do I mean   
She was unhappy. Maybe more or less so   
Before her marriage. One had the sense of trips   
Arranged, committees, concerts, baffled courage   
Living it through, giving it order and style.   
And one had the sense of the late marriage as of   
Two bafflements inventing the sense they made   
Together. The marriage seemed, to the outside world,   
And probably was, radiant and triumphant,   
And I think that one could almost certainly say   
That during the last, heroic, phase of things,   
After his death, and after the stroke, she had   
By force of character and careful management,   
Maintained a certain degree of happiness. 

The books there on the bookshelves told their stories, 
Line after line, all of them evenly spaced, 
And spaces between the words. You could fall through the spaces.
In one of the books Dr. Johnson told the story:   
"In the scale of being, wherever it begins,   
Or ends, there are chasms infinitely deep;   
Infinite vacuities...For surely, 
Nothing can so disturb the passions, or   
Perplex the intellects of man so much,   
As the disruption of this union with   
Visible nature, separation from all 
That has delighted or engaged him, a change 
Not only of the place but of the manner   
Of his being, an entrance into a state 
Not simply which he knows not, but perhaps   
A state he has not faculties to know. 

The dinner was delicious, fresh greens, and reds,   
And yellows, produce of the season due, 
And fish from the nearby sea; and there were also   
Ashes to be eaten, and dirt to drink. 






The Crippled Girl, The Rose
 

It was as if a flower bloomed as if
Its muttering root and stem had suddenly spoken,

Uttering on the air a poem of summer,
The rose the utterance of its root and stem.

Thus her beautiful face, the crippled girl's,
Was like the poem spoken by her body--

The richness of that face!--most generous
In what it keeps, giving in its having.

The rose reserves the sweetness that it yields,
Petal on petal, telling its own silence,

Her beauty saying from its thorny stalk
That what it is is kept as it is given.






What It Does
 

The sea bit,
As they said it would,
And the hill slid,
As they said it would,
And the poor dead
Nodded agog
The poor head.

O topmost lofty
Tower of Troy,
The poem apparently
Speaks with joy
Of terrible things.
Where is the pleasure
The poetry brings?

Tell if you can,
What does it make?
A city of man
That will not shake,
Or if it shake,
Shake with the splendor
Of the poem's pleasure.






In Eden
 

You lie in our bed as if an orchard were over us.

You are what's fallen from those fatal boughs.

Where will we go when they send us away from here?






Seen Through a Window
 

A man and a woman are sitting at a table.
It is supper time. The air is green. The walls
Are white in the green air, as rocks under water
Retain their own true color, though washed in green.
I do not know either the man or the woman,
Nor do I know whatever they know of each other.
Though washed in my eye they keep their own true color.

The man is all his own hunched strength, the body's
Self and strength, that bears, like weariness,
Itself upon itself, as a stone's weight
Bears heavily on itself to be itself.
Heavy the strength that bears the body down.
And the way he feeds is like a dreamless sleep.
The dreaming of a stone is how he feeds.

The woman's arms are plump, mottled a little
The flesh, like standing milk, and on one arm
A blue bruise, got in some household labor or other,
Flowering in the white. Her staring eye,
Like some bird's cry called from some deepest wood,
Says nothing of what it is but what it is.
Such silence is the bird's cry of the stone.






The Guest Ellen at the Supper for Street People
 

The unclean spirits cry out in the body 
Or mind of the guest Ellen in a loud voice 
Torment me not, and in the fury of her unclean 
Hands beating the air in some kind of unending torment-- 
Nobody witnessing could possibly know the event   
That cast upon her the spell of this enchantment. 

Almost all the guests are under some kind of enchantment:   
Of being poor day after day in the same body; 
Of being witness still to some obscene event; 
Of listening all the time to somebody's voice 
Whispering in the ear things divine or unclean, 
In the quotidian of unending torment. 

One has to keep thinking there was some source of torment,   
Something that happened someplace else, unclean.   
One has to keep talking in a reasonable voice 
About things done, say, by a father's body 
To or upon the body of Ellen, in enchantment 
Helpless, still by the unforgotten event 

Enchanted, still in the old forgotten event 
A prisoner of love, filthy Ellen in her torment,   
Guest Ellen in the dining hall in her body, 
Hands beating the air in her enchantment,   
Sitting alone, gabbling in her garbled voice   
The narrative of the spirits of the unclean. 

She is wholly the possessed one of the unclean. 
Maybe the spirits came from the river. The enchantment   
Entered her, maybe, in the Northeast Kingdom. The torment,   
A thing of the waters, gratuitous event, 
Came up out of the waters and entered her body 
And lived in her in torment and cried out in her voice. 

It speaks itself over and over again in her voice,   
Cursing maybe or not a familiar obscene event   
Or only the pure event of original enchantment   
From the birth of the river waters, the pure unclean   
Rising from the source of things, in a figure of torment   
Seeking out Ellen, finding its home in her poor body. 

Her body witness is, so also is her voice,   
Of torment coming from unknown event; 
Unclean is the nature and name of the enchantment. 






Out at Lanesville
 

In memoriam Mary Ann, 19321980
The five or six of them, sitting on the rocks 
Out at Lanesville, near Gloucester; it is like
Listening to music. Several of them are teachers,
One is a psychologist, one is reading a book,
The page glares white in the summer sunlight;
Others are just sunning themselves, or just
Sitting there looking out over the water;
A couple of them seem to be talking together;
From this far off you can't hear what they are saying.

The day is hot, the absolute middle of summer.
Someone has written an obscenity 
In huge letters on the rocks above and behind
This group of people, and someone else, one of them,
Maybe, or maybe a neighbor, the owner of one
Of the cottages up behind and back in the woods,
Has tried to erase it and only partly done so,
So that for years it will say hoarsely fuck
To the random winds and to the senseless waves.

One of them is sitting with her back turned
To me and to the others on the rocks. The purple
Loosestrife and the tigerlilies are like the flags
Of some celebration; they bloom along the edge
Of a small stream that makes its way unseen
Down to the rocks and sand. Her shoulders are round,
And rather luxuriously heavy, and the whole figure
Has a youthful and graceful amplitude of being
Whose beauty will last her her whole life long.

The voices of some people out in a boat somewhere
Are carried in over the water with surprising
Force and clarity, though saying I don't know what:
Happiness; unhappiness; something about the conditions
Of all such things; work done, not done; the saving
Of the self in the intense work of its singleness,
Learning to live with it. Their lives have separate ends.
Suddenly she turned her head and seems to look
Toward me and toward the others on the rocks,

So that her body, turned away, is more expressive
Than her blank face, a pure reflector of light.






After School, Street Football, Eighth Grade
 

Their jeans sparkled, cut off
way above the knee, and my
friends and I would watch them
from my porch, books of poems
lost in our laps, eyes wide as
tropical fish behind our glasses.

Their football flashed from hand
to hand, tennis shoes gripped
the asphalt, sweat's spotlight on
their strong backs. We would
dream of hugging them, and crouch
later in weird rooms, and come.

Once their ball fell our way
so two of them came over, hands
on their hips, asking us to
throw it to them, which Arthur did,
badly, and they chased it back.
One turned to yell, "Thanks

and we dreamed of his long
teeth in our necks. We 
wanted them to wander over,
place deep wet underarms to
our lips, and then their white
asses, then those loud mouths.

One day one guy was very tired,
didn't move fast enough,
so a car hit him and he sprawled
fifty feet away, sexy, but he was
dead, blood like lipstick, then
those great boys stood together

on the sidewalk and we joined them,
mixing in like one big friendship
to the cops, who asked if we were,
and those boys were too sad to counter.
We'd known his name, Tim, and how
he'd turned to thank us nicely

but now he was under a sheet
anonymous as God, the big boys crying,
spitting words, and we stunned
like intellectuals get, our high
voices soft as the tinkling of a 
chandelier on a ceiling too high to see.





What You Have to Get Over
 

Stumps. Railroad tracks. Early sicknesses,
the blue one, especially.
Your first love rounding a corner,
that snowy minefield.
 
Whether you step lightly or heavily,
you have to get over to that tree line a hundred yards in the distance
before evening falls,
letting no one see you wend your way,
 
that wonderful, old-fashioned word, wend,
meaning "to proceed, to journey,
to travel from one place to another,
as from bed to breakfast, breakfast to imbecile work.
 
You have to get over your resentments,
the sun in the morning and the moon at night,
all those shadows of yourself you left behind
on odd little tables.
 
Tote that barge! Lift that bale! You have to
cross that river, jump that hedge, surmount that slogan,
crawl over this ego or that eros,
then hoist yourself up onto that yonder mountain.
 
Another old-fashioned word, yonder, meaning
"that indicated place, somewhere generally seen
or just beyond sight. If you would recover,
you have to get over the shattered autos in the backwoods lot
 
to that bridge in the darkness
where the sentinels stand
guarding the border with their half-slung rifles,
 warned of the likes of you. 





After a Rainstorm
 

Because I have come to the fence at night, 
the horses arrive also from their ancient stable. 
They let me stroke their long faces, and I note 
in the light of the now-merging moon

how they, a Morgan and a Quarter, have been 
by shake-guttered raindrops 
spotted around their rumps and thus made 
Appaloosas, the ancestral horses of this place.

Maybe because it is night, they are nervous, 
or maybe because they too sense 
what they have become, they seem 
to be waiting for me to say something

to whatever ancient spirits might still abide here, 
that they might awaken from this strange dream, 
in which there are fences and stables and a man 
who doesn't know a single word they understand.





H
 

Yet the after is still a storm
as witness bent shadbush
and cord grass in stillness
 
sand littered with the smallest of fragments
whether shell or bone
That city we are far from
 
is still frozen, still in ruins
(except its symmetries be renewed
by sleep, its slant colors redeemed)
 
Nothing has changed but its name
and the air that it breathes
There's still no truth in making sense
 
while the ash settles, so fine that
planes keep falling from the sky
And the name once again to be the old one
 
Saint Something, Saint Gesture, Saint Entirely the Same
as if nothing or no one had been nameless in the interim
or as if still could be placed beside storm
 
that simply, as in a poem
Have you heard the angels with sexed tongues,
met the blind boy who could see with his skin,
 
his body curled inward like a phrase,
like an after in stillness or a letter erased
Have you seen what's written on him
 
as question to an answer or calendar out of phase
Add up the number of such days
Add illness and lilt as formed on the tongue
 
Add that scene identical with its negative,
that sentence which refuses to speak,
present which cannot be found






Twenty-four Logics in Memory of Lee Hickman
 

The bend in the river followed us for days
and above us the sun
doubled and redoubled its claims
 
Now we are in a house
with forty-four walls
and nothing but doors
 
Outside the trees, chokecherries, mulberries and oaks
are cracking like limbs
We can do nothing but listen
 
or so someone claims,
the Ice Man perhaps, all enclosed in ice
though the light has been shortening our days
 
and coloring nights the yellow of hay,
scarlet of trillium, blue of block ice
Words appear, the texture of ice,
 
with messages etched on their shells:
Minna 1892, Big Max and Little Sarah,
This hour ago
 
everyone watched as the statues fell
Enough of such phrases and we'll have a book
Enough of such books
 
and we'll have mountains of ice
enough to balance our days with nights
enough at last to close our eyes
 






Eighth Sky
 

It is scribbled along the body
Impossible even to say a word
 
An alphabet has been stored beneath the ground
It is a practice alphabet, work of the hand
 
Yet not, not marks inside a box
For example, this is a mirror box
 
Spinoza designed such a box
and called it the Eighth Sky
 
called it the Nevercadabra House
as a joke
 
Yet not, not so much a joke
not Notes for Electronic Harp
 
on a day free of sounds
(but I meant to write "clouds)
 
At night these same boulevards fill with snow
Lancers and dancers pass a poisoned syringe,
 
as you wrote, writing of death in the snow,
Patroclus and a Pharoah on Rue Ravignan
 
It is scribbled across each body
Impossible even to name a word
 
Look, you would say, how the sky falls
at first gently, then not at all
 
Two chemicals within the firefly are the cause,
twin ships, twin nemeses
 
preparing to metamorphose
into an alphabet in stone
 
 
                                                         St.-Benoit-sur-Loire

Autobiography 2 (hellogoodby)
 

The Book of Company which
I put down and can't pick up
 
The Trans-Siberian disappearing,
the Blue Train and the Shadow Train
 
Her body with ridges like my skull
Two children are running through the Lion Cemetery
 
Five travelers are crossing the Lion Bridge
A philosopher in a doorway insists
 
that there are no images
He whispers instead: Possible Worlds
 
The Mind-Body Problem
The Tale of the Color Harpsichord
 
Skeleton of the World's Oldest Horse
The ring of O dwindles
 
sizzling around the hole until gone
False spring is laughing at the snow
 
and just beyond each window
immense pines weighted with snow
 
A philosopher spreadeagled in the snow
holds out his Third Meditation
 
like a necrotic star. He whispers:
archery is everywhere in decline,
 
photography the first perversion of our time
Reach to the milky bottom of this pond
 
to know the feel of bone,
a knuckle from your grandfather's thumb,
 
the maternal clavicle, the familiar
arch of a brother's brow
 
He was your twin, no doubt,
forger of the unicursal maze
 
My dearest Tania, When I get a good position in the courtyard
I study their faces through the haze
 
Dear Tania, Don't be annoyed,
please, at these digressions
 
They are soldering the generals
back onto their pedestals
 
 
                                                                                                          for A. C.






Autobiography 3
 

Yes, I was born on the street known as Glass--as Paper, Scissors or Rock.
 
Several of my ancestors had no hands.
 
Several of my ancestors used their pens
 
in odd ways.
 
A child of seven I prayed for breath.
 
Each day I passed through the mirrored X
 
 
 
into droplets of rain congealed around dust.
 
I never regretted this situation.
 
Though patient as an alchemist I failed to learn English.
 
Twenty years later I burned all my furniture.
 
Likewise the beams of my house
 
to fuel the furnace.
 
 
 
Once I bought an old boat.
 
I abandoned the tyrannical book of my dreams
 
and wrote about dresses, jewels, furniture and menus
 
eight or ten times in a book of dreams.
 
It sets me to dreaming when I dust it off.
 
Our time is a between time; best to stay out of it.
 
 
 
Send an occasional visiting card to eternity or a few stanzas to the living
 
so they won't suspect we know they don't exist.
 
Sign them Sincerely Yours, Warmest Regards, Thinking of You or
Deepest Regrets.
 
Brown river outside my window, an old boat riding the current.
 
What I like most is to stay in my apartment.
 
So that is my life, pared of anecdotes.
 
 
 
I go out occasionally to look at a dance.
 
Otherwise the usual joys, worries and inner mourning.
 
Occasionally in an old boat I navigate the river
 
when I find the time.
 
Water swallows the days.
 
I think maybe that's all
 
 
 
I have to say
 
except that an irregular heart sometimes speaks to me.
 
It says, A candle is consuming a children's alphabet.
 
It says, Attend to each detail of the future-past.
 
Last night the moon was divided precisely in half.
 
Today a terrifying wind.
 






Counting Backwards
 

How did I get so old, 
I wonder, 
contemplating 
my 67th birthday. 
Dyslexia smiles:
I'm 76 in fact.

There are places 
where at 60 they start 
counting backwards; 
in Japan 
they start again 
from one.

But the numbers 
hardly matter. 
It's the physics 
of acceleration I mind, 
the way time speeds up 
as if it hasn't guessed

the destination-- 
where look! 
I see my mother 
and father bearing a cake, 
waiting for me
at the starting line.





The Difference Between Pepsi and Coke
 

Can't swim; uses credit cards and pills to combat intolerable feelings of inadequacy;
Won't admit his dread of boredom, chief impulse behind numerous marital infidelities;
Looks fat in jeans, mouths clichs with confidence, breaks mother's plates in fights;
Buys when the market is too high, and panics during the inevitable descent;
Still, Pop can always tell the subtle difference between Pepsi and Coke,
Has defined the darkness of red at dawn, memorized the splash of poppies along
Deserted railway tracks, and opposed the war in Vietnam months before the students,
Years before the politicians and press; give him a minute with a road map
And he will solve the mystery of bloodshot eyes; transport him to mountaintop
And watch him calculate the heaviness and height of the local heavens;
Needs no prompting to give money to his kids; speaks French fluently, and tourist German;
Sings Schubert in the shower; plays pinball in Paris; knows the new maid steals, and forgives her.
 





Twenty Questions
 

Why did the moth fly into the flame? Was it for the same reason
That Achilles died young? Who gets more fun out of sex,
The man or the woman? (Be sure to explain how you can tell.)
Which is more real to you, heaven or hell?
 
Why do sinners' ways prosper? What causes the death of love--
The love of death? Did Adam and Eve have a choice?
Did the Virgin Mary? What are we afraid of, anyway?
Even agnostics have the right to say "thank god, don't they?
 
Looking at these dancing atoms, shall I say I saw a ring
Of pure and endless light? Or did I dream the whole thing?
Whom shall I say is calling? Are you in if it's your wife?
Are you willing to relocate? Do you like your life?
 
What makes this night different from all other nights?
Would you say it's your fate to be always,
Without exception, five minutes late? If you arrived
At 9:10, would the ceremony have started at 9:05
 
Though it had been scheduled for 9:15? As you walk down
The aisle, and the others rivet their attention to you,
Do you ask yourself what you're going to do,
As though it mattered, as if you knew?
 





For I Will Consider Your Dog Molly
 

For it was the first day of Rosh Ha'shanah, New Year's Day, day of remembrance, of ancient sacrifices and averted calamities.
For I started the day by eating an apple dipped in honey, as ritual required.
For I went to the local synagogue to listen to the ram's horn blown.
For I asked Our Father, Our King, to save us for his sake if not for ours, for the sake of his abundant mercies, for the sake of his right hand, for the sake of those who went through fire and water for the sanctification of his name.
For despite the use of a microphone and other gross violations of ceremony, I gave myself up gladly to the synagogue's sensual insatiable vast womb.
For what right have I to feel offended?
For I communed with my dead father, and a conspicuous tear rolled down my right cheek, and there was loud crying inside me.
For I understood how that tear could become an orb.
For the Hebrew melodies comforted me.
For I lost my voice.
For I met a friend who asked "is this a day of high seriousness" and when I said yes he said "it has taken your voice away."
For he was right, for I felt the strong lashes of the wind lashing me by the throat.
For I thought there shall come a day that the watchmen upon the hills of Ephraim shall cry, Arise and let us go up to Zion unto the Lord our God.
For the virgin shall rejoice in the dance, and the young and old in each other's arms, and their soul shall be as a watered garden, and neither shall they learn war any more.
For God shall lower the price of bread and corn and wine and oil, he shall let our cry come up to him.
For it is customary on the first day of Rosh Ha'shanah to cast a stone into the depths of the sea, to weep and pray to weep no more.
For the stone represents all the sins of the people.
For I asked you and Molly to accompany me to Cascadilla Creek, there being no ocean nearby.
For we talked about the Psalms of David along the way, and the story of Hannah, mother of Samuel, who sought the most robust bard to remedy her barrenness.
For Isaac said "I see the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for the offering?"
For as soon as I saw the stone, white flat oblong and heavy, I knew that it had summoned me.
For I heard the voice locked inside that stone, for I pictured a dry wilderness in which, with a wave of my staff, I could command sweet waters to flow forth from that stone.
For I cast the stone into the stream and watched it sink to the bottom where dozens of smaller stones, all of them black, gathered around it.
For the waterfall performed the function of the chorus.
For after the moment of solemnity dissolved, you playfully tossed Molly into the stream.
For you tossed her three times, and three times she swam back for her life.
For she shook the water off her body, refreshed.
For you removed the leash from her neck and let her roam freely.
For she darted off into the brush and speared a small gray moving thing in the neck.
For this was the work of an instant.
For we looked and behold! the small gray thing was a rat.
For Molly had killed the rat with a single efficient bite, in conformance with Jewish law.
For I took the rat and cast him into the stream, and both of us congratulated Molly.
For now she resumed her noble gait.
For she does not lie awake in the dark and weep for her sins, and whine about her condition, and discuss her duty to God.
For I'd as lief pray with your dog Molly as with any man.
For she knows that God is her savior.
 





Sleeping with the Dictionary
 

          
          I beg to dicker with my silver-tongued companion, whose lips are ready to read my shining gloss. A versatile partner, conversant and well-versed in the verbal art, the dictionary is not averse to the solitary habits of the curiously wide-awake reader. In the dark night's insomnia, the book is a stimulating sedative, awakening my tired imagination to the hypnagogic trance of language. Retiring to the canopy of the bedroom, turning on the bedside light, taking the big dictionary to bed, clutching the unabridged bulk, heavy with the weight of all the meanings between these covers, smoothing the thin sheets, thick with accented syllables--all are exercises in the conscious regimen of dreamers, who toss words on their tongues while turning illuminated pages. To go through all these motions and procedures, groping in the dark for an alluring word, is the poet's nocturnal mission. Aroused by myriad possibilities, we try out the most perverse positions in the practice of our nightly act, the penetration of the denotative body of the work. Any exit from the logic of language might be an entry in a symptomatic dictionary. The alphabetical order of this ample block of knowledge might render a dense lexicon of lucid hallucinations. Beside the bed, a pad lies open to record the meandering of migratory words. In the rapid eye movement of the poet's night vision, this dictum can be decoded, like the secret acrostic of a lover's name.





Lastness
 

A black bear sits alone
in the twilight, nodding from side
to side, turning slowly around and around
on himself, scuffing the four-footed
circle into the earth. He sniffs the sweat
in the breeze, he understands
a creature, a death-creature,
watches from the fringe of the trees,
finally he understands
I am no longer here, he himself
from the fringe of the trees watches
a black bear
get up, eat a few flowers, trudge away,
all his fur glistening
in the rain.
 
And what glistening! Sancho Fergus,
my boychild, had such great shoulders,
when he was born his head
came out, the rest of him stuck. And he opened
his eyes: his head out there all alone
in the room, he squinted with pained,
barely unglued eyes at the ninth-month's
blood splashing beneath him
on the floor. And almost
smiled, I thought, almost forgave it all in advance.
 
When he came wholly forth
I took him up in my hands and bent
over and smelled
the black, glistening fur
of his head, as empty space
must have bent
over the newborn planet
and smelled the grasslands and the ferns.
 





Christmas Prelude
 

O little fleas
 of speckled light
 all dancing
 like a satellite
  
 O belly green trees
 shaded vale
 O shiny bobcat
 winter trail
  
 Amoebic rampage
 squamous cock
 a Chinese hairpiece
 burly sock
  
 A grilled banana
 smashes gates
 and mingeless badgers
 venerate
  
 The asses of the 
 winter trees
 rock on fat asses
 as you please
  
 Be jumpy
 or unhinged
 with joy
 enlightened
 fry cakes

Marcus Aurelius Rose
 

for Thomas
From the five good emperors
 I have learned that there were five good emperors,
  
 From the lemon tree I've planted
 now I know that leaves unpummeled yet will drop,
  
 From the clock, the time, it's five p.m.,
 from the sun the length of day,
  
 From Quercus borealis, the queer names of the leaves
 of all the trees,
  
 From burning I've learned burning,
 from the aster family chickory abounds,
  
 From hawkweed of the colors bright,
 from sleeping, of my dreams,
  
 From mosquitoes, scratching, from fishes, fishing,
 from turkeys how to run and how to hop,
  
 From erect perennials I've learned to reach the shelf,
 from my cats to lick the dark part of the tin,
  
 From the sparrows I've learned this and that,
 from Germanic tribes, to gather thoughts in herds,
  
 From the window blinds, from the sun decayed,
 from the heart, a brimming record braised and turned.






This Most Perfect Hill
 

On this most perfect hill
 with these most perfect dogs
 are these most perfect people
 and this most perfect fog
  
 In this most perfect fog
 that is the middle of the sea
 inside the perfect middle of
 the things inside that swing
  
 In this most perfect rhyme
 that takes up what it sees,
 with perfect shelter from the 
 rain as perfect as can be,
  
 In this most perfect day
 at the apex of the sun
 runs this most perfect
 frog song that is roiling
 from the mud
  
 In these most perfect habits
 of the waving of the trees,
 through this imperfect language
 rides a perfect brilliancy.






ABBA
 

for Brad Gooch
We snort all our coke
 on the way to the party.
 We bring the new album.
 We dance while we listen.
  
 The band is two women
 whose husbands control them.
 They do not speak our language.
 Each syllable's an obstacle.
  
 They are in love with a man.
 He is in love with another.
 But they're in no hurry.
 They could wait forever.
  
 And when they are out
 on the make for a lover,
 they'll always find him.
 They are the tigers.
  
 We are stoned too stoned to.
 We dance till we're tired
 and listen to lyrics
 we mouth like a language.
  
 What we feel, when we
 hear them, is inexpressible.
 We can't put into words.
 Maybe our dances show it.
  
 ABBA lives for their music.
 We long for each other.
 They see what we're doing.
 They put it on record.
  
 They play it, we listen.
 We are absolutely stunned.
 We feel, and they know
 more than anyone can say.






A Poem for Record Players
 

The scene changes
  
 Five hours later and
 I come into a room
 where a clock ticks.
 I find a pillow to 
 muffle the sounds I make.
 I am engaged in taking away
 from God his sound.
 The pigeons somewhere
 above me, the cough
 a man makes down the hall,
 the flap of wings
 below me, the squeak
 of sparrows in the alley.
 The scratches I itch
 on my scalp, the landing
 of birds under the bay
 window out my window.
 All dull details 
 I can only describe to you,
 but which are here and 
 I hear and shall never
 give up again, shall carry
 with me over the streets
 of this seacoast city,
 forever; oh clack your
 metal wings, god, you are
 mine now in the morning.
 I have you by the ears
 in the exhaust pipes of
 a thousand cars gunning
 their motors turning over
 all over town.

A poem for vipers
 

I sit in Lees. At 11:40 PM with
 Jimmy the pusher. He teaches me 
 Ju Ju. Hot on the table before us
 shrimp foo yong, rice and mushroom
 chow yuke. Up the street under the wheels
 of a strange car is his stash--The ritual.
 We make it. And have made it.
 For months now together after midnight.
 Soon I know the fuzz will
 interrupt, will arrest Jimmy and 
 I shall be placed on probation. The poem
 does not lie to us. We lie under
 its law, alive in the glamour of this hour
 able to enter into the sacred places
 of his dark people, who carry secrets
 glassed in their eyes and hide words
 under the coats of their tongue.

A Poem for Painters
 

Our age bereft of nobility
         How can our faces show it?
 I look for love.
         My lips stand out
 dry and cracked with want
                                      of it.
                                     Oh it is well.
 My poem shall show the need for it.
  
                         Again we go driven by forces
        we have no control over. Only
                                                     in the poem
       comes an image that we rule
                       the line by the pen
 in the painter's hand one foot 
                               away from me.
  
                               Drawing the face
                               and its torture.
 That is why no one dares tackle it.
                     Held as they are in the hands
                                 of forces they
                     cannot understand.
                                                        That despair
         is on my face and shall show
         in the fine lines of any man.
  
 I had love once in the palm of my hand.
 See the lines there.
                                       How we played
 its game, are playing now
 in the bounds of white and heartless fields.
  
 Fall down on my head, love,
 drench my flesh in the streams 
                                 of fine sprays. Like
                                        French perfume
 so that I light up as
                                      mountain glorys
 and I am showered by the scent
                           of the finished line.
  
                                              No circles
                        but that two parallels do cross
 And carry our souls and bodies
        together as the planets,
                      Showing light on the surface
                             of our skin, knowing
                      that so much of it flows through
                            the veins underneath.
                      Our cheeks puffed with it.
                            The pockets full.
  
  
                                2.
  
 Pushed on by the incompletion
               of what goes before me
 I hesitate before this paper
               scratching for the right words.
  
 Paul Klee scratched for seven years
               on smoked glass, to develop
               his line, LaVigne says, look
 at his face! he who has spent 
              all night drawing mine.
  
        The sun also
 rises on the rooftops, beginning
 w/ violet. I begin in blue
 knowing why we are cool.
  
  
                                 3.
  
 My middle name is Joseph and I
 walk beside an ass on the way to what
 Bethlehem, where a new babe is born.
  
        Not the second hand of Yeats but 
        first prints on a cloudy windowpane.
  
 America, you boil over
  
  
                                  4.
  
        The cauldron scalds.
        Flesh is scarred. 
        Eyes shot.
  
        The street aswarm with 
        vipers and heavy armed bandits.
        There are bandages on the wounds
        but blood flows unabated. The bath-
        rooms are full. Oh stop up
                                                       the drains.
                               We are run over.
  
  
                                   5.
  
 Let me ramble here.
 yet stay within my own yardlines.
 I go out of bounds
             without defense,
 oh attack.
  
  
                                    6. 
  
    At last the game is over
                                              and the line lengthens.
    Let us stay with what we know.
  
 That love is my strength, that
 I am overpowered by it:
                                         desire
                                                   that too
 is on the face: gone stale.
 When green was the bed my love
 and I laid down upon.
 Such it is, heart's complaint,
 You hear upon a day in June.
 And I see no end in view
 when summer goes, as it will,
 upon the roads, like singing
 companions across the land.
  
 Go with it man, if you must, 
 but leave us markers on your way.
  
 South of Mission, Seattle,
 over the Sierra Mountains,
 the Middle West and Michigan,
 moving east again, easy
 coming into Chicago and
 the cattle country, calling
 to each other over canyons,
 careful not to be caught
 at night, they are still out,
 the destroyers, and down
 into the South, familiar land,
 lush places, blue mountains
 of Carolina, into Black Mountain
 and you can sleep out, or
 straight across into States
  
 I cannot think of their names.
  
 This nation is so large, like
 our hands, our love it lives
 with no lover, looking only
 for the beloved, back home
 into the heart, New York,
 New England, Vermont green
 mountains, and Massachusetts
 my city, Boston and the sea.
 Again to smell what this calm
 ocean cannot tell us. The seasons.
 Only the heart remembers
 and records in words
 of works
 we lay down for those men
 who can come to them.
  
  
                                     7.
  
 At last. I come to the last defense.
  
 My poems contain no 
                      wilde beestes, no
 lady of the lake music
 of the spheres, or organ chants,
  
 yet by these lines
 I betray what little given me.
  
 One needs no defense.
  
              Only the score of a man's
              struggle to stay  with
              what is his own, what
              lies within him to do.
  
              Without which is nothing,
              for him or those who hear him
              And I come to this,
              knowing the waste, leaving 
  
              the rest up to love
              and its twisted faces
              my hands claw out at
              only to draw back from the
              blood already running there.
  
              Oh come back, whatever heart
              you have left. It is my life
              you save. The poem is done.

A Poem for the Old Man
 

God love you
    Dana my lover
 lost in the horde
 on this Friday night,
 500 men are moving up
 & down from the bath
 room to the bar.
 Remove this desire
 from the man I love.
 Who has opened
    the savagery 
 of the sea to me.
  
 See to it that 
 his wants are filled
 on California street
 Bestow on him lar-
 gesse that allows him
 peace in his loins.
  
 Leave him not
 to the moths.
 Make him out a lion
 so that all who see him
 hero worship his
 thick chest as I did
 moving my mouth
 over his back bringing
 our hearts to heights
 I never hike over
    anymore.
 Let blond hair burn
 on the back of his
 neck, let no ache
 screw his face
 up in pain, his soul
    is so hooked.
 Not heroin.
 Rather fix these
 hundred men as his
 lovers & lift him
 with the enormous bale
 of their desire.
  
 6.20.58






Cocaine
 

For I have seen love
 and his face is choice Heart of Hearts,
 a flesh of pure fire, fusing from the center
 where all Motion is one.
  
 And I have known
 despair that the Face has ceased to stare 
 at me with the Rose of the world
 but lies furled
  
 in an artificial paradise it is Hell to get into.
 If I knew you were there
 I would fall upon my knees and plead to God
 to deliver you in my arms once again.
  
 But it is senseless to try.
 One can only take means to reduce misery,
 confuse the sensations so that this Face,
 what aches in the heart and makes each new
  
 start less close to the source of desire,
 fade from the flesh that fires the night,
 with dreams and infinite longing.






The Suicide
 

Yes I put her away.
       But now life flares up
    As safe as China in a cup
    You hear the droppings
              of her heart.
  
    Leaves rustle on the windowpane.
 Three o'clock turns round again.
 The man in the moon grows full
 Of her death while earth awaits
    beneath
 To receive her ashes on the wind.
  
        Yes, earth owns the wind
        As I her life
        Whom I have never seen
        Nor been with
 Still within our hearts there lies
           this communion
              of all that dies
    we held in common
    because without it
  
 we become more common than the dust.
  
  
                             2.
  
 Clay cannot create her features
 nor mirror reveal her mouth
  
 Photograph not show her form
 full with self, so put away
  
 her picture from the shelf
 And turn instead to living
  
 woman on the couch, decked with flowers
 as if it were she laid out,
  
 and not Sylvia, in the woods.
  
  
                              3.
  

Address to the Woman
 
 Tell her that may not rise again
 she sings still in our breath.
  
 Tell her that may not breathe again
 she moves yet beneath the moon.
  
 Tell her that may not weave again
 her hands are dawns within our eyes.
  
 Tell her that may not speak again
 Her words are warnings in the wood.






Supplication
 

O poetry, visit this house often,
 imbue my life with success,
 leave me not alone,
 give me a wife and home.
  
 Take this curse off
 of early death and drugs,
 make me a friend among peers,
 lend me love, and timeliness.
  
 Return me to the men who teach
 and above all, cure the 
 hurts of wanting the impossible
 through this suspended vacuum.

Children of the Working Class
 

to Somes
  
 from incarceration, Taunton State Hospital, 1972
  
 gaunt, ugly deformed
  
 broken from the womb, and horribly shriven
 at the labor of their forefathers, if you check back
  
 scout around grey before actual time
 their sordid brains don't work right,
 pinched men emaciated, piling up railroad ties and highway
 ditches
 blanched women, swollen and crudely numb
 ered before the dark of dawn
  
 scuttling by candlelight, one not to touch, that is, a signal panic
 thick peasants after the attitude
  
 at that time of their century, bleak and centrifugal
 they carry about them, tough disciplines of copper Indianheads.
  
 there are worse, whom you may never see, non-crucial around the
 spoke, these you do, seldom
 locked in Taunton State Hospital and other peon work farms
 drudge from morning until night, abandoned within destitute
 crevices odd clothes
 intent on performing some particular task long has been far
 removed
 there is no hope, they locked-in key's; housed of course
  
 and there fed, poorly
 off sooted, plastic dishes, soiled grimy silver knives and forks,

Four Glimpses of Night
 

I


Eagerly
Like a woman hurrying to her lover
Night comes to the room of the world
And lies, yielding and content
Against the cool round face
Of the moon.
 
II
 
Night is a curious child, wandering
Between earth and sky, creeping
In windows and doors, daubing
The entire neighborhood
With purple paint.
Day
Is an apologetic mother
Cloth in hand
Following after.
 
III
 
Peddling
From door to door
Night sells
Black bags of peppermint stars
Heaping cones of vanilla moon
Until
His wares are gone
Then shuffles homeward
Jingling the gray coins
Of daybreak.
 
IV
 
Night's brittle song, sliver-thin
Shatters into a billion fragments
Of quiet shadows
At the blaring jazz
Of a morning sun. 
 





Inventing a Horse
 

Inventing a horse is not easy.
One must not only think of the horse.
One must dig fence posts around him.
One must include a place where horses like to live;
 
or do when they live with humans like you.
Slowly, you must walk him in the cold;
feed him bran mash, apples;
accustom him to the harness;
 
holding in mind even when you are tired
harnesses and tack cloths and saddle oil
to keep the saddle clean as a face in the sun;
one must imagine teaching him to run
 
among the knuckles of tree roots,
not to be skittish at first sight of timber wolves,
and not to grow thin in the city,
where at some point you will have to live;
 
and one must imagine the absence of money.
Most of all, though: the living weight,
the sound of his feet on the needles,
and, since he is heavy, and real,
 
and sometimes tired after a run
down the river with a light whip at his side,
one must imagine love
in the mind that does not know love,
 
an animal mind, a love that does not depend
on your image of it,
your understanding of it;
indifferent to all that it lacks:
 
a muzzle and two black eyes
looking the day away, a field empty
of everything but witchgrass, fluent trees,
and some piles of hay.





The Layers
 

I have walked through many lives,
some of them my own,
and I am not who I was,
though some principle of being
abides, from which I struggle
not to stray.
When I look behind,
as I am compelled to look
before I can gather strength
to proceed on my journey,
I see the milestones dwindling
toward the horizon
and the slow fires trailing
from the abandoned camp-sites,
over which scavenger angels
wheel on heavy wings.
Oh, I have made myself a tribe
out of my true affections,
and my tribe is scattered!
How shall the heart be reconciled
to its feast of losses?
In a rising wind
the manic dust of my friends,
those who fell along the way,
bitterly stings my face.
Yet I turn, I turn,
exulting somewhat,
with my will intact to go
wherever I need to go,
and every stone on the road
precious to me.
In my darkest night,
when the moon was covered
and I roamed through wreckage,
a nimbus-clouded voice
directed me:
"Live in the layers,
not on the litter.
Though I lack the art
to decipher it,
no doubt the next chapter
in my book of transformations
is already written.
I am not done with my changes.





End of Summer
 

An agitation of the air,
A perturbation of the light
Admonished me the unloved year
Would turn on its hinge that night.
 
I stood in the disenchanted field
Amid the stubble and the stones,
Amazed, while a small worm lisped to me
The song of my marrow-bones.
 
Blue poured into summer blue,
A hawk broke from his cloudless tower,
The roof of the silo blazed, and I knew
That part of my life was over.
 
Already the iron door of the north
Clangs open: birds, leaves, snows
Order their populations forth,
And a cruel wind blows.
 





Hunger Moon
 

The last full moon of February
stalks the fields; barbed wire casts a shadow.
Rising slowly, a beam moved toward the west
stealthily changing position
 
until now, in the small hours, across the snow
it advances on my pillow
to wake me, not rudely like the sun
but with the cocked gun of silence.
 
I am alone in a vast room
where a vain woman once slept.
The moon, in pale buckskins, crouches
on guard beside her bed.
 
Slowly the light wanes, the snow will melt
and all the fences thrum in the spring breeze
but not until that sleeper, trapped
in my body, turns and turns. 
 





Tonight
 

Tonight is a drunk man, 
his dirty shirt.

There is no couple chatting by the recycling bins, 
offering to help me unload my plastics.

There is not even the black and white cat 
that balances elegantly on the lip of the dumpster.

There is only the smell of sour breath. Sweat on the collar of my shirt. 
A water bottle rolling under a car. 
Me in my too-small pajama pants stacking juice jugs on neighbors' juice jugs.

I look to see if there is someone drinking on their balcony. 

I tell myself I will wave.





Falling Water
 

I drove to Oak Park, took two tours,
 And looked at some of the houses.
 I took the long way back along the lake.
 The place that I came home to--a cavernous
 Apartment on the East Side of Milwaukee--
 Seems basically a part of that tradition,
 With the same admixture of expansion and restraint:
 The space takes off, yet leaves behind a nagging
 Feeling of confinement, with the disconcerting sense
 That while the superficial conflicts got resolved,
 The underlying tensions brought to equilibrium,
 It isn't yet a place in which I feel that I can live.
 Imagine someone reading. Contemplate a man
 Oblivious to his settings, and then a distant person
 Standing in an ordinary room, hemmed in by limitations,
 Yet possessed by the illusion of an individual life
 That blooms within its own mysterious enclosure,
 In a solitary space in which the soul can breathe
 And where the heart can stay--not by discovering it,
 But by creating it, by giving it a self-sustaining
 Atmosphere of depth, both in the architecture,
 And in the unconstructed life that it contains.
 In a late and very brief remark, Freud speculates
 That space is the projection of a "psychic apparatus
 Which remains almost entirely oblivious to itself;
 And Wright extols "that primitive sense of shelter
 Which can turn a house into a refuge from despair.
 I wish that time could bring the future back again
 And let me see things as they used to seem to me
 Before I found myself alone, in an emancipated state--
 Alone and free and filled with cares about tomorrow.
 There used to be a logic in the way time passed
 That made it flow directly towards an underlying space
 Where all the minor, individual lives converged.
 The moments borrowed their perceptions from the past
 And bathed the future in a soft, familiar light
 I remembered from home, and which has faded.
 And the voices get supplanted by the rain,
 The nights seem colder, and the angel in the mind
 That used to sing to me beneath the wide suburban sky
 Turns into dreamwork and dissolves into the air,
 While in its place a kind of monument appears,
 Magnificent in isolation, compromised by proximity
 And standing in a small and singular expanse--
 As though the years had been a pretext for reflection,
 And my life had been a phase of disenchantment--
 As the faces that I cherished gradually withdraw,
 The reassuring settings slowly melt away,
 And what remains is just a sense of getting older.
 In a variation of the parable, the pure of heart
 Descend into a kingdom that they never wanted
 And refused to see. The homely notions of the good,
 The quaint ideas of perfection swept away like
 Adolescent fictions as the real forms of life
 Deteriorate with manically increasing speed,
 The kind man wakes into a quiet dream of shelter,
 And the serenity it brings--not in reflection,
 But in the paralyzing fear of being mistaken,
 Of losing everything, of acquiescing in the
 Obvious approach (the house shaped like a box;
 The life that can't accommodate another's)--
 As the heart shrinks down to tiny, local things.
  
 Why can't the more expansive ecstasies come true?
 I met you more than thirty years ago, in 1958,
 In Mrs. Wolford's eighth grade history class.
 All moments weigh the same, and matter equally;
 Yet those that time brings back create the fables
 Of a happy or unsatisfying life, of minutes
 Passing on the way to either peace or disappointment--
 Like a paper calendar on which  it's always autumn
 And we're back in school again; or a hazy afternoon
 Near the beginning of October, with the World Series
 Playing quietly on the radio, and the windows open,
 And the California sunlight filling up the room.
 When I survey the mural stretched across the years
 --Across my heart--I notice mostly small, neglected
 Parts of no importance to the whole design, but which,
 In their obscurity, seem more permanent and real.
 I see the desks and auditorium, suffused with
 Yellow light connoting earnestness and hope that
 Still remains there, in a space pervaded by a 
 Soft and supple ache too deep to contemplate--
 As though the future weren't real, and the present
 Were amorphous, with nothing to hold on to,
 And the past were there forever. And the art
 That time inflicts upon its subjects can't 
 Eradicate the lines sketched out in childhood, 
 Which harden into shapes as it recedes.
 I wish I knew a way of looking at the world
 That didn't find it wanting, or of looking at my
 Life that didn't always see a half-completed
 Structure made of years and filled with images
 And gestures emblematic of the past, like Gatsby's
 Light, or Proust's imbalance on the stones.
 I wish there were a place where I could stay
 And leave the world alone--an enormous stadium
 Where I could wander back and forth across a field
 Replete with all the incidents and small details
 That gave the days their textures, that bound the
 Minutes into something solid, and that linked them
 All together in a way that used to seem eternal.
 We used to go to dances in my family's ancient
 Cadillac, which blew up late one summer evening
 Climbing up the hill outside Del Mar. And later
 I can see us steaming off the cover of the Beatles'
 Baby-butcher album at your house in Mission Bay;
 And three years later listening to the Velvet
 Underground performing in a roller skating rink.
 Years aren't texts, or anything like texts;
 And yet I often think of 1968 that way, as though
 That single year contained the rhythms of the rest,
 As what began in hope and eagerness concluded in
 Intractable confusion, as the wedding turned into a
 Puzzling fiasco over poor John Godfrey's hair.
 The parts were real, and yet the dense and living
 Whole they once composed seems broken now, its
 Voice reduced to disembodied terms that speak to me
 More distantly each day, until the tangled years
 Are finally drained of feeling, and collapse into a 
 Sequence of the places where we lived: your parents'
 House in Kensington, and mine above the canyon:
 Then the flat by Sears in Cambridge, where we
 Moved when we got married, and the third floor
 Of the house on Francis Avenue, near Harvard Square;
 The big apartment in Milwaukee where we lived the 
 Year that John was born, and last of all the
 House in Whitefish Bay, where you live now
 And all those years came inexplicably undone
 In mid-July. The sequence ended late last year.
 Suppose we use a lifetime as a measure of the world
 As it exists for one. Then half of mine has ended,
 While the fragment which has recently come to be
 Contains no vantage point from which to see it whole.
 I think that people are the sum of their illusions,
 That the cares that make them difficult to see
 Are eased by distance, with their errors blending
 In an intricate harmony, their truths abiding 
 In a subtle "spark or psyche (each incomparable,
 Yet each the same as all the others) and their
 Disparate careers all joined together in a tangled
 Moral vision whose intense, meandering design
 Seems lightened by a pure simplicity of feeling,
 As in grief, or in the pathos of a life
 Cut off by loneliness, indifference or hate,
 Because the most important thing is human happiness--
 Not in the sense of private satisfactions, but of
 Lives that realize themselves in ordinary terms
 And with the quiet inconsistencies that make them real.
 The whole transcends its tensions, like the intimate
 Reflections on the day that came at evening, whose
 Significance was usually overlooked, or misunderstood,
 Because the facts were almost always unexceptional.
 Two years ago we took our son to Paris. Last night
 I picked him up and took him to a Lou Reed show,
 And then took him home. I look at all the houses as I
 Walk down Hackett Avenue to work. I teach my classes,
 Visit friends, cook introspective meals for myself,
 Yet in the end the minutes don't add up. What's lost
 Is the perception of the world as something good
 And held in common; as a place to be perfected
 In the kinds of everyday divisions and encounters
 That endowed it with integrity and structure,
 And that merged its private moments with the past.
 What broke it into pieces? What transformed the 
 Flaws that gave it feeling into objects of a deep and
 Smoldering resentment--like coming home too early,
 Or walking too far ahead of you on the rue Jacob?
 I wish that life could be a window on the sun,
 Instead of just this porch where I can stand and
 Contemplate the wires that lace the parking lot
 And feel it moving towards some unknown resolution.
 The Guggenheim Museum just reopened. Tonight I
 Watched a segment of the news on PBS--narrated by a 
 Woman we met years ago at Bob's--that showed how
 Most of Wright's interior had been restored,
 And how the ramp ascends in spirals towards the sky.
 I like the houses better--they flow in all directions,
 Merging with the scenery and embodying a milder,
 More domestic notion of perfection, on a human scale
 That doesn't overwhelm the life that it encloses.
 Isn't there a way to feel at home within the
 Confines of this bland, accommodating structure
 Made of souvenirs and emblems, like the hammock
 Hanging in the backyard of an undistinguished
 Prairie School house in Whitefish Bay--the lineal,
 Reduced descendant of the "Flameproof Wright house
 Just a block or two away from where I live now?
 I usually walk along the street on Sunday,
 Musing on how beautiful it seems, how aspects of it
 Recapitulate the Oak Park house and studio, with
 Open spaces buried in a labyrinthine interior,
 And with the entrance half-concealed on the side--
 A characteristic feature of his plans that made it
 Difficult to find, although the hope was that in
 Trying to get inside, the visitor's eye would come to 
 Linger over subtleties he might have failed to see--
 In much the way that in the course of getting older,
 And trying to reconstruct the paths that led me here,
 I found myself pulled backwards through these old,
 Uncertain passages, distracted by the details,
 And meeting only barriers to understanding why the
 Years unfolded as they did, and why my life
 Turned out the way it has--like his signature
 "Pathway of Discovery, with each diversion
 Adding to the integrity of the whole.
  
 There is this sweep life has that makes the 
 Accidents of time and place seem small.
 Everything alters, and the personal concerns 
 That love could hold together for a little while
 Decay, and then the world seems strange again,
 And meaningless and free. I miss the primitive
 Confusions, and the secret way things came to me
 Each evening, and the pain. I still wonder
 Where the tears went, standing in my room each day
 And quietly inhabiting a calm, suspended state
 Enveloped by the emptiness that scares and thrills me,
 With the background noise cascading out of nothing
 Like a song that makes the days go by, a song
 Incorporating everything--not into what it says,
 But simply in the way it touches me, a single
 Image of dispersal, the inexhaustible perception
 Of contingency and transience and isolation.
 It brings them back to me. I have the inwardness
 I think I must have wanted, and the quietude,
 The solitary temper, and this space where I can
 Linger with the silence curling all around me
 Like the sound of pure passage, waiting here
 Surrounded by the furniture, the books and lists
 And all these other emblems of the floating world,
 The prints of raindrops that begin as mist, that fall
 Discreetly through the atmosphere, and disappear.
 And then I feel them in the air, in a reserved,
 More earthly music filled with voices reassembling
 In a wellspring of remembrance, talking to me again,
 And finding shelter in the same evasive movements
 I can feel in my own life, cloaked in a quiet
 Dignity that keeps away the dread of getting old,
 And fading out of other people's consciousness,
 And dying with its deepest insecurities and fears
 Concealed by their own protective colorations,
 As the mind secretes its shell and calls it home.
 It has the texture of an uncreated substance,
 Hovering between the settings it had come to love
 And some unformulated state I can't imagine--
 Waiting for the telephone to ring, obsessed with 
 Ways to occupy these wide, unstructured hours,
 And playing records by myself, and waking up alone.
 All things are disparate, yet subject to the same
 Intense, eradicating wills of time and personality,
 Like waves demolishing the walls love seemed to build
 Between our lives and emptiness, the certainty they
 Seemed to have just two or three short years ago,
 Before the anger spread its poison over everything.
 I think about the way our visions locked together
 In a nightmare play of nervousness and language,
 Living day to day inside the concentrated
 Force of that relentless argument, whose words
 Swept over us in formless torrents of anxiety, two
 People clinging to their versions of their lives
 Almost like children--living out each other's
 Intermittent fantasies, that fed upon themselves
 As though infected by some vile, concentrated hatred;
 Who then woke up and planned that evening's dinner.
 It's all memories now, and distance. Miles away
 The cat is sleeping on the driveway, John's in school,
 And sunlight filters through a curtain in the kitchen.
 Nothing really changes--the external world intrudes
 And then withdraws, and then becomes continuous again.
 I went downtown today and got a lamp with pendant
 Lanterns made of opalescent art glass--part, I guess,
 Of what this morning's paper called the "Wright craze.
 I like the easy way the days go by, the parts of aging
 That have come to seem familiar, and the uneventful
 Calm that seems to settle on the house at night.
 Each morning brings the mirror's reassuring face,
 As though the years had left the same enduring person
 Simplified and changed--no longer vaguely desperate,
 No longer torn, yet still impatient with himself
 And still restless; but drained of intricacy and rage,
 Like a mild paradox--uninteresting in its own right,
 Yet existing for the sake of something stranger.
 Now and then our life comes over me, in brief,
 Involuntary glimpses of that world that blossom
 Unexpectedly, in fleeting moments of regret
 That come before the ache, the pang that gathers
 Sharply, like an indrawn breath--a strange and 
 Thoughtful kind of pain, as though a steel
 Band had somehow snapped inside my heart.
 I don't know. But what I do know is that 
 None of it is ever going to come to me again.
 Why did I think a person only distantly like me
 Might finally represent my life? What aspects
 Of my attitudes, my cast of mind, my inconclusive
 Way of tossing questions at the world had I
 Supposed might realize another person's fantasies
 And turn her into someone else--who gradually became
 A separate part of me, and argued with the very 
 Words I would have used, and looked at me through
 Eyes I'd looked at as though gazing at myself?
 I guess we only realize ourselves in dreams,
 Or in these self-reflexive reveries sustaining
 All the charms that contemplation holds--until the
 Long enchantment of the soul with what it sees
 Is lifted, and it startles at a space alight with
 Objects of its infantile gaze, like people in a mall.
 I saw her just the other day. I felt a kind of 
 Comfort at her face, one tinctured with bemusement
 At the strange and guarded person she'd become--
 Attractive, vaguely friendly, brisk (too brisk),
 But no one I could think might represent my life.
 Why did I even try to see myself in what's outside?
 The strangeness pushes it away, propels the vision
 Back upon itself, into these regions filled with 
 Shapes that I can wander through and never see,
 As though their image were inherently unreal.
 The houses on a street, the quiet backyard shade,
 The room restored to life with bric-a-brac--
 I started by revisiting these things, then slowly
 Reconceiving them as forms of loss made visible
 That balanced sympathy and space inside an
 Abstract edifice combining reaches of the past
 With all these speculations, all this artful
 Preening of the heart. I sit here at my desk,
 Perplexed and puzzled, teasing out a tangled
 Skein of years we wove together, and trying to
 Combine the fragments of those years into a poem.
 Who cares if life--if someone's actual life--is
 Finally insignificant and small? There's still a
 Splendor in the way it flowers once and fades
 And leaves a carapace behind. There isn't time to
 Linger over why it happened, or attempt to make its
 Mystery come to life again and last, like someone
 Still embracing the confused perceptions of himself
 Embedded in the past, as though eternity lay there--
 For heaven's a delusion, and eternity is in the details,
 And this tiny, insubstantial life is all there is.
 --And that would be enough, but for the reoccurring
 Dreams I often have of you. Sometimes at night
 The banished unrealities return, as though a room
 Suffused with light and poetry took shape around me.
 Pictures line the walls. It's early summer.
 Somewhere in Remembrance of Things Past, Marcel,
 Reflecting on his years with "Albertine--with X--
 Suggests that love is just a consciousness of distance,
 Of the separation of two lives in time and space.
 I think the same estrangement's mirrored in each life,
 In how it seems both adequate and incomplete--part
 Day-to-day existence, part imaginary construct
 Beckoning at night, and sighing through my dreams
 Like some disconsolate chimera, or the subject
 Of a lonely, terrifying sadness; or the isolation
 Of a quiet winter evening, when the house feels empty,
 And silence intervenes. But in the wonderful
 Enclosure opening in my heart, I seem to recognize
 Our voices lilting in the yard, inflected by the
 Rhythms of a song whose words are seamless
 And whose lines are never-ending. I can almost
 See the contours of your face, and sense the
 Presence of the trees, and reimagine all of us
 Together in a deep, abiding happiness, as if the
 Three of us inhabited a fragile, made-up world
 That seemed to be so permanent, so real.
 I have this fantasy: It's early in the evening.
 You and I are sitting in the backyard, talking.
 Friends arrive, then drinks and dinner, conversation
  
 The lovely summer twilight lasts forever
  
                                        What's the use?
 What purpose do these speculations serve? What
 Mild enchantments do these meditations leave?
 They're just the murmurs of an age, of middle age,
 That help to pass the time that they retrieve
 Before subsiding, leaving everything unchanged.
 Each of us at times has felt the future fade,
 Or seen the compass of his life diminished,
 Or realized some tangible illusion was unreal.
 Driving down to Evanston last week, I suddenly 
 Remembered driving down that road eight years ago,
 So caught up in some story I'd just finished
 That I'd missed the way the countryside was changing--
 How in place of trees there now were office towers
 And theme parks, parts of a confusingly panoply of
 Barns and discount malls transfiguring a landscape
 Filled with high, receding clouds and rows of flimsy
 Houses in what used to be a field. I thought of
 Other people's lives, and how impossible it seemed
 To grasp them on the model of my own--as little
 Mirrors of infinity--or sense their forms of 
 Happiness, or in their minor personal upheavals
 Feel the sweep of time reduced to human scale
 And see its abstract argument made visible.
 I thought of overarching dreams of plenitude--
 How life lacks shape until it's given one by love,
 And how each soul is both a kingdom in itself
 And part of some incorporating whole that
 Feels and has a face and lets it live forever.
 All of these seemed true, and cancelled one another,
 Leaving just the feeling of an unseen presence
 Tracing out the contours of a world erased,
Like music tracing out the contours of the mind--
 For life has the form of a winding curve in space
 And in its wake the human figure disappears.
 Look at our surroundings--where a previous age
 Could visualize a landscape we see borders,
 Yet I think the underlying vision is the same:
 A person positing a world that he can see
 And can't contain, and vexed by other people.
 Everything is possible; some of it seemed real
 Or nearly real, yet in the end it spoke to me alone,
 In phrases echoing the isolation of a meager
 Ledge above a waterfall, or rolling across a vast,
 Expanding plain on which there's always room,
 But only room for one. It starts and ends
 Inside an ordinary room, while in the interim
 Brimming with illusions, filled with commonplace
 Delights that make the days go by, with simple
 Arguments and fears, and with the nervous
 Inkling of some vague, utopian conceit
 Transforming both the landscape and our lives,
 Until we look around and find ourselves at home,
 But in a wholly different world. And even those 
 Catastrophes that seemed to alter everything
 Seem fleeting, grounded in a natural order
 All of us are subject to, and ought to celebrate.
 --Yet why? That things are temporary doesn't 
 Render them unreal, unworthy of regretting.
 It's not as though the past had never happened:
 All those years were real, and their loss was real,
 And it is sad--I don't know what else to call it.
 I'm glad that both of us seem happy. Yet what
 Troubles me is just the way what used to be a world
 Turned out, in retrospect, to be a state of mind,
 And no more tangible than that. And now it's gone,
 And in its place I find the image of a process
 Of inexorable decay, or of some great unraveling
 That drags the houses forward into emptiness
 And backwards into pictures of the intervening days
 Love pieced together out of nothing. And I'm
 Certain that this austere vision finally is true,
 And yet it strikes me as too meager to believe.
 It comes from much too high above the world
 And seems to me too hopeless, too extreme--
 But then I found myself one winter afternoon
 Remembering a quiet morning in a classroom
 And inventing everything again, in ordinary
 Terms that seemed to comprehend a childish
 Dream of love, and then the loss of love,
 And all the intricate years between. 
 





White Buttons
 

Having been blown away
by a book
I am in the gutter
at the end of the street
in little pieces
like the alphabet
(mother do not worry
letters are not flesh
though there's meaning in them
but not when they are mean
my letters to you were mean
I found them after you died
and read them and tore them up
and fed them to the wind
thank you for intruding
I love you now leave)
Also at the end of the street
there is a magnolia tree
the white kind
that tatters
after it blooms
so the tree winds up
in the street
Our naked shivering bodies
must be at some distance
missing us    come back
come back they cry
come home
put down that book
whenever you read
you drift away on a raft
you like your parrot
more than you like me
and stuff like that
(dear father
you always were a bore
but I loved you more
than interesting things
and in your honor
I've felt the same about myself
and everyone I've ever met)
I like to read in tree houses
whenever I can    which is seldom
and sometimes never
The book that blew me away
held all the problems
of the world
and those of being alive
under my nose
but I felt far away from them
at the same time
reading is like that
(I am sorry I did not
go to your funeral
but like you said
on the phone
an insect cannot crawl
to China)
Here at the end of the street
the insects go on living
under the dome
of the pacific sky
If Mary and Joseph
had walked the sixty miles
to Bethlehem vertically
they would have found
themselves floating
in the outer pitch of space
it would have been cold
no inns
a long night
in the dark endless
and when they began to cry
the whole world would think
something had just been born
I like to read into things
as I am continually borne forward
in time by the winds like the snow
(dear sister
you were perfect in every way
like a baby
please tell brother
the only reason
we never spoke
was out of our great love
for each other
which made a big wind
that blew us apart)
I think I am coming back
I feel shoulders
where a parrot could land
though a tree would be
as good a place as any
You cannot teach a tree to talk
Trees can say    it is spring
but not    though bright sunlight
can also be very sad
have you noticed?





Women in Labor
 

Women who lie alone at midnight
because there is no one else to lie to

Women who lie alone at midnight
at noon in the laundromat
destroying their own socks

Women who lie alone at midnight:
Hans Brinker, or The Silver Skates

Women who lie alone at midnight
as the first furl of starlight
pearls the moon with nacre

Women who lie alone at midnight
sending a postcard bearing
the face of a bawling infant
who cries "I am for the new

Women who lie alone at midnight
reciting the names of shoes

Women who lie alone at midnight
spurting unjustified tears,
the kind that run sideways
never reaching the mouth,
the kind you cannot swallow

Women who lie alone at midnight
singing breast away the burden of my tender
and afterwards burp

Women who lie alone at midnight
obeying the laws of physics
Women who let their dreams curl at the end
Women in a monastery of flamingos

Women who die alone at midnight
contributing to the end, to 
lost time, to the rain and flies,
seeing the bird they saw trapped in the airport
surviving by the water fountain

What's more, try it sometime
It works





Shalimar
 

God put his finger on my sacrum
and he lifted me, he set me
in the center of the universe,
the curious desire
of my chronically lonely life.

It was cold and dark and lonely
and I was scared.

There were no accessories.
I burst into tears over nothing.

What would Jimmy Schuyler do?
wwjsd?

And as quietly as the sound of Kleenex
being pulled from a box,
I sneezed.

And morning, that goddess,
as if she were slightly deaf,
barely lifted her head off the horizon
before laying back down.

And a rose opened her portals
and the scent ran up an elephant's trunk,
or tried to.

Such a long way for everything to travel!

From here I look like a front moving in

An icy purple light
a poet would say belonged to a perfume stopper
belonging to his mother.
When it was her nipple.

You know, neither in the past
or in the future.






The Flurry
 

When we talk about when to tell the kids,
we are so together, so concentrated.
I mutter, "I feel like a killer. "I'm
the killer--taking my wrist--he says,
holding it. He is sitting on the couch, 
the old indigo chintz around him, 
rich as a night sea with jellies, 
I am sitting on the floor. I look up at him,
as if within some chamber of matedness,
some dust I carry around me. Tonight,
to breathe its Magellanic field is less
painful, maybe because he is drinking
a wine grown where I was born--fog,
eucalyptus, sempervirens--and I'm
sharing the glass with him. "Don't catch
my cold, he says, "--oh that's right, you want
to catch my cold. I should not have told him that,
I tell him I will try to fall out of 
love with him, but I feel I will love him
all my life. He says he loves me
as the mother of our children, and new troupes
of tears mount to the acrobat platforms
of my ducts and do their burning leaps.
Some of them jump straight sideways, and, for a
moment, I imagine a flurry
of tears like a whirra of knives thrown
at a figure, to outline it--a heart's spurt 
of rage. It glitters, in my vision, I nod
to it, it is my hope.





Piet
 

I hunted heaven
for him.

No dice.

Too uppity,
it was. Not enough

music, or dark dirt.

I begged the earth empty
of him. Death

believes in us whether
we believe

or not. For a long while
I watch the sound

of a boy bouncing a ball
down the block

take its time
to reach me. Father,

find me when
you want. I'll wait.






Apocrypha
 

Wisdom is a kindly spirit but does it love me? And righteousness? There's nothing in it.
To poetry I leave my senses, my deregulation, custodial duties, and to be a janitor is a great consolation.
It gave me my mother back through all her years.
To love these children, so full of neurons and consciousness. What joy to clean up and put a shine on their mess.
To my mother I leave my veil, my wing, the window and time. I, artifact. In this age the hand is a voice.
I leave the voice, the wonder, the mirror, and my lens, bent and beholden to the worm, leaf-work in wrought iron, eerie illuminations and deep-sea vision.
I've seen the Eurostar, the drunken boat, and Davy Jones' Locker. I've seen Spanish galleons and the H.S. Mauberley covered in brine.
There is this line from cloud dander to the solo bulb of mourning, a string through common prayer.
I like it when the gray-green shadows suddenly dayglo over the rushes. The wind in my head.
To write is an equal and opposite reaction my comrade, communard, my friendo.
What is it finally thinking what in winter's dusty alcove, the body tocks. The day was cloudy. The light muddy, dreary when they took it down.
To Times Roman I give my stammer, my sullenness, my new world violence, form and all that, forms, and all that paper, gusts. Little buttress.     
I send love and weapons to everyone possessed with night visions.
When those green lights flash and blink, is that it? When the "it continues strangely for a bit, then falls into a line, is it over?
I quantified daily the wonder in the grain.
I found I was over and singular yet many, the many and the singular, the many and the evolutionary, the many in the grain. Many more.
Who in hell am I writing for?
This vision is silly, teenage, and mine, a spot on the negative, a hole in composition. I quantify, I loaf, I wonder, I find, I rev.    
Here the days' mud, night is a satellite, and anger, my cleft, my birthmark and star.
Anger might be a better way to say "I love you, truer than "how are you in space? Are you cold, can I get you a blanket?
To the polestar I leave my alien regalia, my off-world headdress. I leave acoustic forms in time, blooming, sudsy, inconsolable.
If you are unsatisfied, then welcome.    
Here there are people working every corner of every inch of grass. The meticulously arranged outside reminds me of ocean and feels old.
In space the letterforms "I love oscillate in waves.
I lose myself in waves speaking the half of me that forgot to say "goodbye when I meant to say "how come.
Memory continues to bloom. More songs about death and dying, songs of inexperience.
More songs about being and loss, being in loss, more songs about seeing and feeling.
If you are critical, all the better to see and to miss it, to misunderstand, to fail at empathy and love, to not understand love and to love, to be diseverything and to love, whatever.
To mercy I leave whatever.






"For you: anthophilous, lover of flowers
 

For you: anthophilous, lover of flowers, 
green roses, chrysanthemums, lilies: retrophilia, 
philocaly, philomath, sarcophilous--all this love,
of the past, of beauty, of knowledge, of flesh; this is
catalogue & counter: philalethist, negrophile, neophile.
A negro man walks down the street, taps Newport
out against a brick wall & stares at you. Love 
that: lygophilia, lithophilous. Be amongst stones,
amongst darkness. We are glass house. Philopornist,
philotechnical. Why not worship the demimonde?
Love that--a corner room, whatever is not there, 
all the clutter you keep secret. Palaeophile,
ornithophilous: you, antiquarian, pollinated by birds.
All this a way to dream green rose petals on the bed you love; 
petrophilous, stigmatophilia: live near rocks, tattoo hurt;
for you topophilia: what place do you love? All these words 
for love (for you), all these ways to say believe 
in symphily, to say let us live near each other.





Draw Near
 


For near is where you'll meet what you have wandered 
far to find. And near is where you'll very likely see 
how far the near obtains. In the dark katholikon
the lighted candles lent their gold to give the eye
a more than common sense of what lay flickering
just beyond the ken, and lent the mind a likely
swoon just shy of apprehension. It was then
that time's neat artifice fell in and made for us
a figure for when time would slip free altogether.
I have no sense of what this means to you, so little
sense of what to make of it myself, save one lit glimpse 
of how we live and move, a more expansive sense in Whom.





Soundings
 

The birdhouse made from a gourd is wired
to a flanged loop of steel and screwed to the southeast post
of the shack. Two holes at the top--near where the stem was,
for a thong of leather to hang it by, which long ago broke--
are now the fingerholes of the mournful wind instrument it's become.
The broad round bowl of it makes a sort of birdly
basso profundo that pearls through the steel, into the post,
the floor joists and walls in two notes: a slightly sharp D
and an equally sharp F, says the guitar tuner,
which explains why all my thinking these days
is in B-flat, a difficult key for all but the clarinet
and this sudden covey of nuthatches, whose collective woe
makes it a minor chord I am in the middle of.
Nothing to do but hoist such silks as the luff
of limbs and needles suggests, and sail on,
the barely-escaped-from-the-cat chipmunk chattering
like a gull, and the mountain's last drift of snow
resembling the back of a sounding whale. Hear the thrum of the rigging,
Daggoo? Hear its profoundest woo, its sensible gobbledy-goo
and doo-wop, the boo-hoos of the spheres, by vectors and veers,
by tacks and refractal jabberings, taking us deeper into the weirdness
of the ghost sea those prairie hills were the bottom of once,
this nowhere we shall not be returning from.
Draw the lines! Assume the crow's nest, Pip. This ship
sails on music and wind, and away with birds.





Anatomy of Melancholy
 

Lucy Doolin, first day on the job, stroked his goatee
and informed the seven of us in his charge
his name was short for Lucifer, and that his father, a man
he never knew, had been possessed,
as his mother had told him, of both an odd sense of humor
and a deep and immitigable bitterness. Also 
that the same man had named Lucy's twin brother,
born dead, Jesus Christ. These facts, he said,
along with his tattoos and Mohawked black hair,
we should, in our toils on his behalf, remember.

As we should also always remember to call him
only by that otherwise most womanly diminutive,
and never, he warned, by his given nor surname,
least of all with the title "Mister attached,
which would remind him of that same most hated father
and plunge him therefore into a mood
he could not promise he would, he said, "behave 
appropriately within. Fortunately, our job,
unlike the social difficulties attached thereto,
was simple: collect the trash from the county's back roads.

Although, given Lucy's insistence on thoroughness,
this meant not only beer cans and bottles,
all manner of cast-off paper and plastics, but also
the occasional condom too, as well as the festering
roadkill fresh and ridden with maggotry,
or desiccate and liftable only from the hot summer tar
with a square-bladed shovel, all of which was to be tossed
into the bed of the township flatbed truck we ourselves
rode to and from the job in. By fifty-yard increments
then we traveled. He was never not smoking a cigarette.

Late every afternoon, at the dump, while we unloaded
our tonnage of trash, he sat with Stump McCarriston,
sexton of the dump and the dump's constant resident,
in the shade, next to a green, decrepit trailer
we marveled at and strangely envied, since every inch
of wall we could see through the open door
was plastered with fold-outs and pages
from every Stump-salvaged Playboy and nudie magazine
he had ever found among the wreckage there.
Stump, we understood, was the ugliest man on earth.

Even had Lucy not told us so, we would have known,
by the olfactory rudeness within twenty yards
of his hovel, that he never bathed. And once,
while we shoveled and scraped, he took up the .22
from the rack beside his door and popped
with amazing accuracy three rats not fifty feet from us,
then walked to their carcasses, skinned them out,
and hung their hides on a scavenged grocery store rack
to dry. He was making, Lucy explained, a rat hide
coat we could see, come the fall, except for school.

As for school, it was a concept Stump could not fathom
and Lucy had no use for, on the truck's dash
all that summer Robert Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy,
a tome he said he'd read already eleven times,
this summer being the twelfth. We thought, in some way,
it might have had to do with something like the gallery
Stump's trailer contained, the first word of its title
meaning something to us, the last nothing at all.
There were things about men we might be
unable ever to know, which we somehow knew was lucky.

And Lucky, incidentally, was the name of the cat,
fat and mangy, that, once Stump was back in the shade
with Lucy, began, one by one, to consume the hideless rats.
The town we came from was sinking into the emptiness
of a thousand abandoned coal mine shafts beneath it,
and rats were more common than hares
and universally despised. They shamed us, it seemed,
as we were shamed by ignorance and curiosity--
the bodies of those women on the walls, the provenance
of rats the very earth offered up like a plague,

the burden of a name like Lucifer or Stump,
whose name, as it was scrawled on his mailbox,
seemed to be Stumplin Reilly McCarriston, Esquire.
Of the seven of us, one would die in Vietnam,
one, after medical school, would hang himself
from a beam in his parents' basement, the others
merely gone, vanished in actuality if not in memory.
Leaving me, alone, to tell this story. How Stump
would spend his last twenty years in prison,
having shot Lucy--one slender, flattening .22 slug

through the forehead--as he stood fifty feet away, 
balanced atop the tub of an ancient wringer washer,
arms extended, like Jesus Christ, said Stump,
whose trailer was bulldozed into the dump itself
even before the trial, and who, no doubt, by some
court-appointed lawyer if not the appalled sheriff himself,
was forced to bathe and shave, to step into the unknown country
of a scentless white shirt and black businessman's trousers,
in order to offer his only yet most sincere defense,
that Lucifer--Mr. Doolin, as the court insisted--had told him to.





Under Beinn Ruadhainn
 

For Andrew O'Hagan
Three moons in the sky
the night they found him
drowned in Sawtan's Bog;
just his cap, sitting there
and his wee fat hands poking out.
It was no loss 
to the village, I told them 
next morning,
and the villagers agreed. 
Horn-daft, he was,
havering and glaikit
and scaring the children.
I mind that time
he picked up a mouse
and ate it, quick, 
in two mouthfuls;
set the tail aside
on the ground
like a cocktail stick.

I used her well, after that,
his Jennie,
still in her widow's weeds,
gilping into her
whenever I could,
in the barn or the boathouse
or off in the fields.
She slipped two or three out at least,
and sank each one in a lobster creel.
Her head was away
by the end, as mad as her man
and no good to me.
She sleeps now 
under Beinn Ruadhainn, her face 
covered in ivy, 
scab, and sticky-willow.

The dreams came then.
Last night, the burning loch, 
so full of bairns
they bobbed to the surface 
with their hair on fire;
black snow; fingers 
coming through the floorboards;
rain like razor blades;
the foosty-faced man, 
there at every corner,
hands furred with grey-mould.
And her, as always, 
star-naked, hatching
in the herring-nets.
The last I remember 
was my body being driven
with sticks through the town
to Sawtan's Brae, and hanged.

I broke from sleep and sat up sweating, 
dream-fleyed in the dark.
I groped around for the matches
and the matches were put in my hand.








Head Handed
 

Stop belonging to me so much, face-head.
Leave me to my child and my flowers.

I can't run with you hanging on to me like that.
It's like having ten dogs on a single lead

and no talent for creatures.
No hands, no trees. Not my dogs, nobody's.

Don't you have a place to go, face-head? 
Deep into the brick basement of another life? 

To kill some time, I mean. That furnace 
light could take a shine to you. 

There are always places, none of them mine. 
And always time--rainbow sugar show 

of jimmies falling from ice cream's sky--
but that stuff's extra, it's never in supply. 

"Never, however, acres of it. Violet beans 
and sarcasm. Too many flavors of it. 

All those prodigal particles, 
flimsily whimsical miracles, an embarrassment 

of glitches. The chorus just more us. 
But nowhere bare and slippery have I 

got a prayer. If I had two hands 
to rub together I wouldn't waste the air.





Card 19: The Sun
 

When you show yourself to the woman 
you love, you don't know your fear

is not fear, itself. You have never been good,
but now you are so good,

who are you? Is it the liquidity of her skin
that bathes the world for you,

or her face, captured like a she-lion
in your own flesh?

This summerbed is soft with ring upon ring 
upon ring of wedding, the kind

that doesn't clink upon contact, the kind
with no contract,

the kind in which the gold is only (only!) light. 
Cloud covers and lifts, 

and sleep and night and soon enough, love's
big fire laughs at a terrible burn, 

but only (only!) because pain absorbs excess 
joy and you shouldn't flaunt 

your treasures in front of all day's eyes.





Visitor
 

I am dreaming of a house just like this one

but larger and opener to the trees, nighter

than day and higher than noon, and you,

visiting, knocking to get in, hoping for icy

milk or hot tea or whatever it is you like. 

For each night is a long drink in a short glass. 

A drink of blacksound water, such a rush 

and fall of lonesome no form can contain it.

And if it isn't night yet, though I seem to 

recall that it is, then it is not for everyone.

Did you receive my invitation? It is not 

for everyone. Please come to my house

lit by leaf light. It's like a book with bright

pages filled with flocks and glens and groves

and overlooked by Pan, that seductive satyr

in whom the fish is also cooked. A book that 

took too long to read but minutes to unread--

that is--to forget. Strange are the pages 

thus. Nothing but the hope of company.

I made too much pie in expectation. I was 

hoping to sit with you in a tree house in a 

nightgown in a real way. Did you receive

my invitation? Written in haste, before 

leaf blinked out, before the idea fully formed.

An idea like a storm cloud that does not spill

or arrive but moves silently in a direction. 

Like a dark book in a long life with a vague

hope in a wood house with an open door.





Piano
 

Her wattled fingers can't
stroke the keys with much
grace or assurance anymore,
and the tempo is always
rubato, halting, but still
that sound--notes quivering
and clear in their singularity,
filing down the hallway--
aches with pure intention, the
melody somehow prettier
as a remnant than
whatever it used to be.





The Plate
 

Now he has silver in him. When sometime
Death shall boil down unnecessary fat
To reach the nub of our identity,
             When in the run of crime
The skull is rifled for the gold in teeth,
And chemistry has eaten from the spine
Superfluous life and vigor, why then he
Will show a richness to be wondered at,
             And shall be thought a mine
Whose claim and stake are stone and floral wreath.

The body burns away, and burning gives
Light to the eye and moisture to the lip
And warmth to our desires, but it burns
             Whatever body lives
Into extinction though it wear a plate
Of armor in it: therefore do we thrive
In fear of fire, in terror of the ship
That carries us to fire. A soldier learns
             To bear the silver weight
Where in his head the fire is most alive.





A Friend Killed in the War
 

Night, the fat serpent, slipped among the plants,
Intent upon the apples of his eyes;
A heavy bandoleer hung like a prize
Around his neck, and tropical red ants
Mounted his body, and he heard advance,
Little by little, the thin female cries
Of mortar shells. He thought of Paradise.
Such is the vision that extremity grants.

In the clean brightness of magnesium
Flares, there were seven angels by a tree.
Their hair flashed diamonds, and they made him doubt
They were not really from Elysium.
And his flesh opened like a peony,
Red at the heart, white petals furling out.





Mathematics Considered as a Vice
 

I would invoke that man
Who chipped for all posterity an ass
             (The one that Jesus rode)
Out of hard stone, and set its either wing
Among the wings of the most saintly clan
On Chartres Cathedral, and that it might sing
             The praise to all who pass
             Of its unearthly load,
Hung from its neck a harp-like instrument.
             I would invoke that man
             To aid my argument.

             The ass smiles on us all,
Being astonished that an ass might rise
             To such sure eminence
Not merely among asses but mankind,
Simpers, almost, upon the western wall
In praise of folly, who midst sow and kine,
             Saw with its foolish eyes
             Gold, Myrrh, and Frankincense
Enter the stable door, against all odds.
             The ass smiles on us all.
             Our butt at last is God's.

             That man is but an ass--
More perfectly, that ass is but a man
             Who struggles to describe
Our rich, contingent and substantial world
In ideal signs: the dunged and pagan grass,
Misted in summer, or the mother-of-pearled
             Home of the bachelor-clam.
             A cold and toothless tribe
Has he for brothers, who would coldly think.
             That man is but an ass
             Who smells not his own stink.

             For all his abstract style
Speaks not to our humanity, and shows
             Neither the purity
Of heaven, nor the impurity beneath,
And cannot see the feasted crocodile
Ringed with St. Francis' birds to pick its teeth,
             Nor can his thought disclose
             To normal intimacy,
Siamese twins, the double-beasted back,
             For all his abstract style
             Utters our chiefest lack.

             Despite his abstract style,
Pickerel will dawdle in their summer pools
             Lit by the flitterings
Of light dashing the gusty surfaces,
Or lie suspended among shades of bile
And lime in fluent shift, for all he says.
             And all the grey-haired mules,
             Simple and neuter things,
Will bray hosannas, blessing harp and wing.
             For all his abstract style,
             The ass will learn to sing.









An Offering for Patricia
 


The work has been going forward with the greatest difficulty, chiefly because I cannot concentrate. I have no feeling about whether what I am writing is good or bad, and the whole business is totally without excitement and pleasure for me. And I am sure I know the reason. It's that I can't stand leaving unresolved my situation with Pat. I hear from her fairly frequently, asking when I plan to come back, and she knows that I am supposed to appear at the poetry reading in the middle of January. It is not mainly loneliness I feel, though I feel it; but I have been lonely before. It is quite frankly the feeling that nothing is really settled between us, and that in the mean time I worry about how things are going to work out. This has made my work more difficult than it has ever been before.

  From a letter to his parents dated November 9, 1955, Rome.

Hardly enough for me that the pail of water
              Alive with the wrinkling light
              Brings clearness home and whiter
Than mind conceives the walls mature to white,
Or that the washed tomatoes whose name is given
              To love fulfill their bowl
              And the Roman sea is woven
Together by threading fish and made most whole.

I delight in each of these, delight moreover
              In the dark skill of those hands
              Closer to wise than clever
Of our blind Italian landlady who stands
Her shoes fouled with the lustful blood of rabbit
              Lightly dispatched and dressed
              Fixing it to the gibbet
Of the clothesline where the laundry sails to rest.

These textures solicit of us our instant homage
              But are disparate senseless things
              Unless a reigning image
Bring them to purpose as your presence brings
The world in offering, like a chaplet worn
              In Aphrodite's name,
              The furious unicorn
Come to the virgin's lap tethered and tame.

And thus it is as you stand in this morning's shadows
              Where ancient chamber pots
              Are grown to little meadows
Of mint and parsley; surely it's love unknots
The winds for Ulysses and recalls to man
              A summer without cease;
              Sprung from the same dishpan
Onion and lily work their primal peace.





The Fountain
 

My dear, your eyes are weary;
Rest them a little while.
Assume the languid posture
Of pleasure mixed with guile.
Outside the talkative fountain
Continues night and day
Repeating my warm passion
In whatever it has to say.

             The sheer luminous gown
                           The fountain wears
             Where Phoebe's very own
                           Color appears
             Falls like a summer rain
                           Or shawl of tears.

Thus your soul ignited
By pleasure's lusts and needs
Sprays into heaven's reaches
And dreams of fiery deeds.
Then it brims over, dying, 
And languorous, apart,
Drains down some slope and enters
The dark well of my heart.

             The sheer luminous gown
                           The fountain wears
             Where Phoebe's very own
                           Color appears
             Falls like a summer rain
                           Or shawl of tears.

O you, whom night enhances,
How sweet here at your breasts
To hear the eternal sadness
Of water that never rests.
O moon, o singing fountain,
O leaf-thronged night above,
You are the faultless mirrors
Of my sweet, bitter love.

             The sheer luminous gown
                           The fountain wears
             Where Phoebe's very own
                           Color appears
             Falls like a summer rain
                           Or shawl of tears. 






Dilemma
 


"Dark and amusing he is, this handsome gallant,
           Of chamois-polished charm,
Athlete and dancer of uncommon talent--
           Is there cause for alarm
In his smooth demeanor, the proud tilt of his chin,
           This cavaliere servente, this Harlequin?

"Gentle and kindly this other, ardent but shy,
           With an intelligence
Who would not glory to be guided by--
           And would it not make sense
To trust in someone so devoted, so
           Worshipful as this tender, pale Pierrot?

"Since both of them delight, if I must choose
           I win a matchless mate,
But by that very winning choice I lose--
           I pause, I hesitate,
Putting decision off, says Columbine,
"And while I hesitate, they both are mine.

They're all dressed up in carmine 
floor-length velvet gowns, their upswirled hair 
festooned with matching ribbons: 
their fresh hopes and our fond hopes for them 
infuse this sort-of-music as if happiness could actually be 
each-plays-her-part-and-all-will-take-care-of-itself. 
Their hearts unscarred under quartz lights 
beam through the darkness in which we sit 
to show us why we endured at home 
the squeaking and squawking and botched notes 
that now in concert are almost beautiful, 
almost rendering this heartrending music 
composed for an archduke who loved it so much 
he spent his fortune for the musicians 
who could bring it brilliantly to life.





Virgin Mule
 

The conversations of the French

Quarter mules in their stables
after a full day of pulling
tourists and voters over cobble-
stones is not espresso witty
and in their dark no TVs feed
them news of the ends of mules
elsewhere in the Middle East
and West. In our stables the ends
of others are a fact of atmosphere.
The yoyos on the mystery island
nextdoor are revving familiar tools
in backyard now gripped by failure
first of electricity than of
a meaner something that'll grow
into nothing we'll know in the A.M.
Once they were visitors like us
then they grew mulish in their
bubbles and pulled whatever
was put around their necks in-
cluding a banner that said, About
What Kills Us We Know Little.
On certain nights after a good
internal fight we hear the voice-
less others through the glass
fearfully sweet'n'soft like dough.
Oh let the monsters in. Help us
rise above our not seeing them,
may they let us into their eyes
as well. Banish the blindness
of these cobblestones, clop, clop.
But! Pffsst! Our notes are in-
complete. Loving you was
never on the agenda. Better
to sing as roughly as the stones.
On Memorial Day we had one
thousand hotdogs & counting.
Didn't visit a single graveyard.
We the Grant Wood folks scan
the sky for incoming missiles:
blips ourselves we understand
timing and touring in America.
The gilded dads in the portraits
sought the idealized continuity
now moving before us democratically
in showers of pixels and dots.
I'll go with the distracted mariner,
my lover, and we'll be in the world.
It will be late by then and dark.
We lyric virgin mules keep our
book of hours in a dream apart,
having stranded a billion turistas.
But we could not break the chummy hand.
Ready to brave the snow without a hat,
severe weather notwithstanding,
we merely nod and understand.
  
 





April Midnight
 

Side by side through the streets at midnight,
 Roaming together,
 Through the tumultuous night of London,
 In the miraculous April weather.
 
Roaming together under the gaslight,
 Day's work over,
 How the Spring calls to us, here in the city,
 Calls to the heart from the heart of a lover!
 
Cool to the wind blows, fresh in our faces,
 Cleansing, entrancing,
 After the heat and the fumes and the footlights,
 Where you dance and I watch your dancing.
 
Good it is to be here together,
 Good to be roaming,
 Even in London, even at midnight,
 Lover-like in a lover's gloaming.
 
You the dancer and I the dreamer,
 Children together,
 Wandering lost in the night of London,
 In the miraculous April weather.
 





April Love
 

We have walked in Love's land a little way,
 We have learnt his lesson a little while,
 And shall we not part at the end of day,
 With a sigh, a smile?
A little while in the shine of the sun,
 We were twined together, joined lips, forgot
 How the shadows fall when the day is done,
 And when Love is not.
We have made no vows--there will none be broke,
 Our love was free as the wind on the hill,
 There was no word said we need wish unspoke,
 We have wrought no ill.
So shall we not part at the end of day,
 Who have loved and lingered a little while,
 Join lips for the last time, go our way,
 With a sigh, a smile?
 





Sonnet 1 
 

Loving in truth, and fain in verse my love to show,
That the dear She might take some pleasure of my pain,
Pleasure might cause her read, reading might make her know,
Knowledge might pity win, and pity grace obtain,--
I sought fit words to paint the blackest face of woe,
Studying inventions fine, her wits to entertain,
Oft turning others' leaves, to see if thence would flow
Some fresh and fruitful showers upon my sunburned brain.
But words came halting forth, wanting Invention's stay:
Invention, Nature's child, fled step-dame Study's blows,
And others' feet still seemed but strangers in my way.
Thus great with child to speak, and helpless in my throes,
Biting my truant pen, beating myself for spite:
"Fool, said my Muse to me, "look in thy heart and write.
 





Sea Fever
 

I must go down to the seas again, to the lonely sea and the sky,
And all I ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by;
And the wheel's kick and the wind's song and the white sail's shaking,
And a grey mist on the sea's face, and a grey dawn breaking,
 
I must go down to the seas again, for the call of the running tide
Is a wild call and a clear call that may not be denied; 
And all I ask is a windy day with the white clouds flying,
And the flung spray and the blown spume, and the sea-gulls crying.
 
I must go down to the seas again, to the vagrant gypsy life,
To the gull's way and the whale's way where the wind's like a whetted knife;
And all I ask is a merry yarn from a laughing fellow-rover,
And quiet sleep and a sweet dream when the long trick's over.





The Sorrow of True Love 
 

The sorrow of true love is a great sorrow
And true love parting blackens a bright morrow:
Yet almost they equal joys, since their despair
Is but hope blinded by its tears, and clear
Above the storm the heavens wait to be seen.
But greater sorrow from less love has been
That can mistake lack of despair for hope
And knows not tempest and the perfect scope
Of summer, but a frozen drizzle perpetual
Of drops that from remorse and pity fall
And cannot ever shine in the sun or thaw,
Removed eternally from the sun's law.
 





Houses, Scams, Language
(with a line in romanian)

 

silver & gossamer & porcelain & cobwebs

some people are made out of
they walk from here to there
a limited number of times only--
but the bony phone is just dumb plastic
it rings not at all
 
i don't understand: my ideas are universal
but my audience is five guys at the shell
station people just don't get it
 
she longs for what makes her grin
(tnjete dup ce rnjete)
the sweetness of want
the repulsiveness of having
after days she was returned
by the storms of language
that had tossed her far
& she rearranged her face
for the english language--
 
what i heard i did not hear
what i saw i did not see
i trust my sense to dullness then
i kill my joy & cease to be
 





A Geography of Poets
 

is all wrong, ed
 
what poets now live
where they say they do
where they started out
where they want to
 
half the midwesterners
did time in new york
the other half in california
 
only new yorkers write
as if they are from new york
and mostly they are not
 
the ones in california
were wounded elsewhere
when they feel better
or can't afford the rent
they'll go back where
they came from
 
this is america
you get hurt where you are born
you make poetry out of it
as far from home as you can get
you die somewhere in between
 
the only geography of poets
is greyhound
general motors rules them all
ubi patria ibi bene
or ibi bene ubi patria
bread out of nostalgia
not a lot of it either
some of us came from very far
maps don't help much
  
 





The Obvious Tradition
 

I haven't remembered anything, only the names
and that their dates have been replaced by fees
toted up out of mischief:
a whopping yellow sun, finesse swallowed hard,
a scrapbook in pantyhose dawdling beside some Shreveport-like expanse.
 
But now you see it, she's supposed to call.
Surely neither will converse, they merely tell,
succumbing to a disorderly shelf life like Tampax in June.
Salute the budding terminus where the East Side was.
Can there be a way to redefine the tense behind its jaunts,
the pubescent imagery a hand calls forth
as, rippling, it is thrust into the brine?
 
                                      The phantom tugboat slips along
in depths past Garbo's awnings and the united glaze
which wilts, harnessing dim signatories in the windows' sarong.
Do things go further in need as I could? Or are they immune?
How else have I been taught to guess
and then been told to know, because matter equals good?
A silken light masks the entrance to the market proofs of time.





October
 

I
 
It's odd to have a separate month. It
escapes the year, it is not only cold, it is warm
and loving like a death grip on a willing knee. The
Indians have a name for it, they call it:
"Summer! The tepees shake in the blast like roosters
at dawn. Everything is special to them,
the colorful ones.
 
 
II
 
Somehow the housewife does not seem gentle.
Is she angry because her husband likes October?
Is it snow bleeds softly from her shoes?
The nest eggs have captured her,
but April rises from her bed.
 
 
III
 
"The beggars are upon us! cried Chester.
 
Three strangers appeared at the door, demanding ribbons.
 
The October wind . . . nests
 
 
IV
 
Why do I think October is beautiful?
It is not, is not beautiful.
                                                  But then
what is there to hold one's interest
between the various drifts of a day's
work, but to search out the differences
                                          the window and grate--
but it is not, is not
beautiful.
 
 
V
 
I think your face is beautiful, the way it is
close to my face, and I think you are the real
October with your transparence and the stone
 of your words as they pass, as I do not hear them.
  
 





Christmas Eve

 

for Vincent Warren
Behind the black water tower

under the grey
of the sky that feeds it
smoke speeds to where a pigeon
spreads its wings
 
This is no great feat
Cold pushes out its lust
We walk we drink we cast
our giggling insults
 
                           Would you please
leave the $2.50 you owe me
I would rather not talk about it
just now           Money bores me I would like
to visit someone who will stay
in bed all day           A forest is rising
imperceptibly in my head
                                                  not a civilized park
 
I think it would be nice this "new
moral odor no it would not mean
"everything marching to its tomb
                                                            The water tower
watches over us            Is there someone
you would like to invite        no one.

January in Detroit or Search for Tomorrow Starring Ken and Ann
 

I think it is interesting
 though not exactly amusing
 how we go from day to day
 with no money. How do we
 do it, friends ask, suspecting
 we really have some stash
 stacked away somewhere.
 But we certainly do not
 and we also do not know
 how we do it either.
 You sure are lucky,
 some of our friends say. I am
 none too sure of that though,
 as I wait for the winning
 lottery numbers to be announced
 on CKLW. Thursday in Detroit
 is the day of dreams. We have
 been dreaming of a place
 in the country lately and I'm
 none too sure that is very healthy.
 And speaking of health that's
 also been a problem that probably
 has something to do with no money,
 since we've all been sick lately,
 taking turns politely of course.
 Could you bring me some more
 tea one of us will ask,
 and the other will.
 In between the coughing and
 worrying our thoughts
 have often turned to crime.
 We seriously wonder how we can
 get away with a bundle with
 as little risk as possible.
 Last week we took our last
 $12 out of the bank
 and noticed how much more
 they had there though
 we had none. Of course
 we wouldn't rob that bank,
 they know us there
 as the ones who bring
 the rolls of pennies in.
 And just yesterday they
 fish-eyed us for trying
 to cash our son's xmas bond
 from his grandparents
 after only one month.
 So we wouldn't try to rob that bank,
 but I do know of one up north
 that may be possible. . .
 I know this just seems like
 romantic dreaming
 but I practically make a career
 of reading detective stories,
 and God knows, I have no other.
 Anyway if the right opportunity
 comes along, we are more
 than ready to meet it.
 But this is a time of waiting,
 the I Ching says, though it does
 not say how we are to eat
 while waiting. And soon
 we will have another mouth to feed--
 Ann now in her seventh month,
 and that is often in our thoughts.
 Besides all that we are both
 over thirty, artist and poet,
 still waiting to cross the great water.
 Meanwhile, day after day,
 there is still Detroit
 to be dealt with -- a small pond
 says our friend Snee.
 Big fish we used to answer him,
 but that was a while back.
 Now we think maybe Lake Erie
 is the great water referred to
 in the I Ching, and if we wait
 long enough we can
 walk across -- to Buffalo
 or Cleveland. In a healthy person,
 says the philosopher, self-pity
 can be a forerunner to action:
 once the problem is seen clearly,
 a solution may be found at hand.
 And as I said, I think it is interesting
 though not exactly amusing.





Nothing
 

can replace

poetry
in my life
and one day
surely
it will
 





The Flower-Fed Buffaloes
 

The flower-fed buffaloes of the spring
In the days of long ago,
Ranged where the locomotives sing
And the prairie flowers lie low:--
The tossing, blooming, perfumed grass
Is swept away by the wheat,
Wheels and wheels and wheels spin by
In the spring that still is sweet.
But the flower-fed buffaloes of the spring
Left us, long ago.
They gore no more, they bellow no more,
They trundle around the hills no more:--
With the Blackfeet, lying low,
With the Pawnees, lying low,
Lying low.
 





Invitation to Ground Zero
 

Into the smouldering ruin now go down:
And walk where once she walked and breathe the air
She breathed that final day on the burning stair
And follow her, beyond the fleeing crowds,
Into the fire, and through the climbing clouds.

Into the smouldering ruin now go down:
And find, in ashes bright as hammered tin,
A buried bone-white naked mannikin
That flung from some shop window serves to bind
Her body, and its beauty, to your mind.





The Test of Fantasy
 

1.

It unfolds and ripples like a banner, downward.  All the stories 
come folding out.  The smells and flowers begin to come back, as
the tapestry is brightly colored and brocaded.  Rabbits and violets.

Who asked you to come over?  She got her foot in the door and
would not remove it, elbowing and talking swiftly.  Gas leak?
that sounds like a very existential position; perhaps you had
better check with the landlord.

                                                            This was no better than the
predicament I had just read about.  Now it was actually changing
before my eyes.  Sometimes it will come to a standstill though,
and finally the reflection can begin.

Selfless--that was the proposition.  Smiling and moving instantly
there was no other purpose than that which brought them there,
to be in a particular place.


2.

This time the mule gave its face away.  Take your cadillac
where you want to go in the morning, convertible as it might be,
and enjoy a good bottle of rum.

Running on this way she used various modes of expression that
were current.  Nothing seemed to bring the woods any closer.
What Woods, she was questioned, realizing that as far as the 
woods went, they were largely inhabitable through the facility
of her mind.  At the Philadelphia Flower Show, an ideal situation
was built up.  Here through various regulated artificial conditions,
spring grass, waterfalls, the newly-sprouted bulbs completed
her ideal concept of nature.  The smell was overpowering.

All right then.  She had a thing about nature, from flower
show glamor and enormous greenhouses the rich cultivated.

A beauty of cultivation--in living?  Hastiness did not prevent
her from rising quick and ready to misnomers and other odd
conclusions, throwing the telephone book to the floor, "OH OH
the life I am entangled in.  Four sides of it.

                                                                                        Above was a paradisical
level, incompleted.  With working possibilities.

Below, endless preoccupations and variations were possible.
Currently in vogue were shelves, the vacuum cleaner, a new
bedspread and color scheme for pillows.

                                                                               Taste treats were
unresponsive.  Glamor do's were out.  Conversation was nil.
Languid

she could not even find a place to languish upon that was
fulfilling in its own way.

                            So out of the lifelessness that was around her,
the grape leaves drying out, and even though the avocado was
sprouting,

she thought, Why not fantasy?  Tugging at this character and
that, trying to push a little life in a prince or a charmer, a half-
blind bat, dryad, the works of the story teller.  Here the four
walls of the room and ceiling became apparent again.  "I ought
to tighten down and make sure I say exactly what I mean.

And her face took on a tight pinched expression, and thrifty scotch
economy gave her shrewd eyes in the prescribed way.  Use every
tidbit, usefully.  Once upon a time there was a princess who
had a long white fur coat with a high fluffy collar, and inside the
coat were stitched beautiful butterflies in many bright colors.
The princess languished.  She was not sure where to sit to her best
advantage to enjoy herself the most.  She could not go in her mind 
or out.  She looked at her long white hand, I am the Queen of the
High Mountain Hag, she murmured to herself, still knowing she was
a princess.  She lay down upon the floor as if it were the garden of
eden, the coat spread around her.

                                                                No, that poor little house she
had built was a bore.  It's better that it go up in flames, as it did.

She went down to Grand Central Station and gave away flowers.
Some people took them and some people didn't.


3.

I'm glad to get back.  I had to repeat a rough discontinuous journey.
Questioning myself all along the way.  Was I jumping on her because
her time had come to an end.  Indeed I pounded on his arm all night,
over his concern for this soft-spoken individual, I can see nothing
but their softness.  Me ME, and the time we might spend together,
reading and talking, to tear away that putrid husk.

My flippancy is gone.  Now I have started my secret life again,
in transition, reminding.  As the moth reminds, its feeble antenna
groping, taken like a stalk of fern, coins of money.

All over I was shaking as the fear and tension made itself apparent.
It was a cold night out.  It was colder still between the airy gaps,
between blankets.

                                     You can see she is thoughtful
as she draws the string to the bow.  Where to go indeed.  The
point is brought forward and discussed very cleverly.

A sleeping angel or a sleeping troll?  I was rather proud of being
used, pushing the clothing hampers up and down the downtown
street.  Here, pleasant mentors conveyed their anxious solicitations,
drawing from their bags, long lists of memorandum due, what I owed.
It was a lot, if I hesitated.  I choose to go on, saying this is the
way I go, owing nothing, being that kind of person.  Hung up?

That thought intrudes as the clearly marked vista is not so clearly
marked.  Certainly one supposes in all honesty, that an essential
core of feeling blooms in each encounter.  Lost under the weight
of the garbage of who are you that you are not making apparent.
Thus unhappy, I don't want it to be this way, and so forth.
Not costumes, or paraphernalia, the immediate reactions.


4.

We of course are in a family situation.  Anything I wish might
happen, but the larger situations are not real, not to be
considered possible, discussable as to what sense of reality
they possessed.

In the snow, the wood piled up underneath.  Oh those drifting
sensibilities.  At this point it is scarcely believable that people
gather and like each other.  Eating chocolate pudding, getting
in touch with some other sense of alikeness.  The form is no
longer obvious to me.  Whether they meander or are joined together
in their senses in the mechanics or regular grooves they run along.

                                                     I suspect that in this house, this
place that is musty and left as it was some years ago, there is
no real fear; the objects are old and I am not familiar with them,
only the sense that the Ghost or spirit world strikes you with
its familiarity, pleasurable fear.

                                                           Here the familiar
is apt to make its presence known, at any moment the unexpected
lurk in the hall, into the room.  Pieces of leather, old silken fans
laid upon the table top, rooms filled with something left unexpectedly
terror is the wrong combination of ignorance.  It contains its own
self with dusty fragments of velvet and fringe.  100 pieces of voice
with no name, called it myself, as they spoke all day, sucking the
soft slush, admitting their real deficiencies as--
I am never sure; Oh it's that power

and disease of believing in the stale that doesn't demand a real 
climate, takes its capacity when the demons come down.


5.

The night passes in night time.  The head moving to the shoulder,
the head rising with a frown.

In a firm voice, it doesn't matter if the hair is flying from undue
spring breezes, the self has been raptured on the wine that produces
appropriate madness, and sad she says, my dear the bacchanal is a
lovely way to be rid of waste.

However, in seeing the house more manageable, one cannot even have
fear larger than the unknown portions of the continent which
refuses to sink. 

                                                                                  There once was a woman
who grew older, not that she minded, but the passage of time was
always constant.  Why does one have to contend with that she said, 
puzzled, as she got carried along, and constantly had to think up
new coping modes of behavior.  If he behaved to me thus when he was
40, now that I am 30, I can hardly behave like that to those that are
20, and so forth.  There wasn't any model except the one she built,
and one could scarcely believe there was no established pattern.  This
offered wonderful possibilities, but also indecision and gutlessness.


6.

You can't see them, all bundled up, all those that choose
to move other than where the distance seems appealing.  Knowledge
has no depth.  There isn't any message to be spoken.

Wrangling, she speaks ill-advised my dear, as the cat has no
point in laying its head down.  She ought to watch carefully.

                                                                             The claws.  It could be
the bent hands, as they grow, that as the fur impeaches the
rose, doesn't make the thing she hangs her body on any realer.
What could it be all about?  The necessity to follow, balancing,
contemplating words, as the basis of why we move at all.

Just a little touch.  The leader cautioned further progression.
I could hardly listen to the music for long.  Now there
seemed to be interruptions, pleasurable interludes, nothing
definite, of a fragmented nature.

                                                               Certainly I wished the best
for all.  The sadder soldiers stumbled idly, as I also in the
profound reaches of my slumber noted the elegant turns, the
twisting statements grooving into the language building something
to listen to.  The dress made from silk.  Trusting was awkward
and not of a nature to ease any further building.  Whosoever
you revere will come back tenfold upon you and lighten the
burden carried as those who desire the warmth and necessity of
communication.


7.

I am sure my dreams must have been of the wrong sort.  However, as
dreams are reflections of inner dilemmas, how did those arise, from
a day of relaxation and summer enjoyment of the fund.

Knowledge comes from what purported strike?  From that which cleanses,
and let us knot say "heart but tissue.  Hopefully and helpfully I have
built up a language in which to talk myself to sleep.  Not for purposes
of letting in the cold.

                                         However, I have found that not all blockaded
against is the cold, the dreary reign of the dead, etc., and tasteless
realm of the mushroom.  As much can be denied as the bilious sun
strives to cause an enlargement of singing in the back of the neck and
the head.  That is uncorraled ecstasy.  I call it enthusiasm, free energy.
But it has no place to land, it is bursting and unfocused; it is a real force
and the counterpart of the gloomy depths.

                                                                              As the pieces of the house
ooze sap, blossoms and green twigs burst from the cracks.  Whether or
not to join in what I was half committed to see and do.


8.

At this point, when Jack picked up the pussy willow branches, I said
they can't possibly be ours for the taking, and smiled with dedication
to an older Con Edison man.  The buildings were like the unexplored
garbage in my mind, fascinating and dirty, pulling pieces of cloth
from boxes left overnight.  Energy as limitless possibility, in
the attempt to transmit non-energy situations.

For example, if once I stop to realize what little gets through, I am
much more interested in the cover than the contents; it is difficult
to find any interest in anything.  Good energy displaces bad karma.
And other non entities like that sort, producing flow that in its own
place has a good bed, stocked well with what can be called fleet-footed
fishes, and approaching places of investigation, such as relations
between.

                    As I saw the blood flow to the surface of his skin, I 
forgot to watch for the telltale visions that again might come from
something I have never seen; more possibly the components of what
every man views.  If this was a possibility, the rays from every person
converging pass through the state of shock to numbness to unity without
any mind at all, for this horror fits the cat on the stairs, between
the fifth and sixth rung.  This is the way people glow and pulse similar
to an inlet of jellyfish blocking the way, full of human life; until
I who will name myself a swimmer come along and refuse to be
blocked on the way, although I turn back gladly, and will again swim
through for it is possible they do not kill, the sting's compounded measure
is fear, and thus one not need join the broad expanse of human mouths
calling people to join their ranks to comfort their newfound recognition
or orifices, stomachs and legs.

I reminded myself twice there were several stories that kept continuing
themselves.  She ignored her face, blotched and red upon times, but
fuller.  Did you forget to wax and wane?  Her head was full of energy
brought forward and positively that what was said would turn the obvious
into color, but no sense.  Sense was for the thinkers.  Here the thinkers
forgot their word orders or sense; it was better to give them coffee,
and those off worse could smoke.

                                                                                          I had felt very
foolish when I leaned forward and grasped his hand, with effort, and
his cloak slipped down over one shoulder as he shouted, which is the
way.  And I followed for certainly no one would follow me.  As the day
is cold and colder, and what comes out of the head is of its own sort and
nature.  These words, like Nature, and Head, Thinking and Words,
repeat themselves, as the lines of landscape, attics and other closed-off
sections have reprimanded themselves by repetition.  Light

was such an enormous possibility.  Taking sight into a frenzy, it was
possible that just to look was full of excitement and wonder, for 
ages at a time, things appeared as beautiful, the sky, the street
where cars had gone by.

                                                  I worried about certain characters: ones
that never seemed to be other than puzzles to me but I was drawn to
them with certainty only because there seemed to be no understanding?
As when the mysteries were performed, the house then itself became
distilled with reason as the pots and pans were used apparently filled
with the stuff of continuity.  The sorrow that each day sinks into the
infertile other side of day, where voice comes out of the dark, and
does its rituals.  Memory has its own screen across the room to view
itself, and the continuous dwelling of conjecture takes permanent form
in stiff-legged walks to remind, thus on and on the breathing goes.



                                                                  New York. January  March, 1967





The Crystal in Tamalpais
 


    In Tamalpais is a big crystal. An acquaintance told
me the story. A Miwok was giving his grandfather's medicine
bag to the Kroeber Museum in Berkeley. He said this man 
took him over the mountain Tamalpais, at a certain time
in the year. I believe it was about the time of the
Winter Solstice, because then the tides are really low.
They stopped and gathered a certain plant on the way over
the mountain. On their way to the Bolinas Beach clam patch,
where there is a big rock way out there.

                                                                            Go out to
the rock. Take out of the medicine bag the crystal
that matches the crystal in Tamalpais. And
                                              if your heart is not true
                                              if your heart is not true
when you tap the rock in the clam patch
                                                            a little piece of it will fly off
                                                   and strike you in the heart
                          and strike you dead.

And that's the first story I ever heard about Bolinas.





September
 


              The grasses are light brown
              and the ocean comes in
              long shimmering lines
              under the fleet from last night
              which dozes now in the early morning

Here and there horses graze
              on somebody's acreage

                               Strangely, it was not my desire

that bade me speak in church to be released
         but memory of the way it used to be in
careless and exotic play 

               when characters were promises
      then recognitions.  The world of transformation
is real and not real but trusting.

                            Enough of these lessons?  I mean
didactic phrases to take you in and out of
love's mysterious bonds?

                      Well I myself am not myself

           and which power of survival I speak
for is not made of houses.

          It is inner luxury, of golden figures
 that breathe like mountains do
            and whose skin is made dusky by stars.





"When I used to focus on the worries, everybody"
 

When I used to focus on the worries, everybody
                      was ahead of me, I was the bottom
                of the totem pole,
              a largely spread squat animal.

How about a quick massage now, he said to me.
I don't think it's cool, I replied.
Oh, said he, after a pause, I should have waited
                     for you to ask me. 

The waves came in closer and closer.

When I fall into the gap of suspicion I am no longer here.

In this world that has got closed over by houses
                       and networks, I fly out
from under the belly.     Life's dizzy crown
of whirling lights, circles this head.    Pure
with wonder, hot
with wonder.    The streets become golden.     All
size increases, the colors glow, we are in myth.

We are in easy understanding.
Scarcely talking, thoughts pass between us.
                                    It is memory.    As I search to find
this day's sweet drifting.    The fog out to sea, the wind.







[He is pruning the privet]
 


                       He is pruning the privet

                of sickly sorrow   desolation
           in loose pieces of air he goes clip clip clip
       the green blooming branches fall--they're getting out
             of hand'    delirious and adorable    what a switch
                               we perceive        multiple
identities     when you sing     so beautifully     the shifting
       clouds  You are not alone is this world
               not a lone  a parallel world of reflection 
       in a window keeps the fire burning
                    in the framed mandala,  the red shafted flicker
               sits on the back of the garden chair in the rain
the red robed monks downtown in the rain  a rainbow arises

                   simple country      practices thunder
      lightning,  hail and rain    eight Douglas Iris
            ribbon layers of attention

              So   constant creation of self' is a tricky
       mess    He is pruning the loquat,   the olive
     which looks real enough in the damp late morning air


                                                                                          May 15, 1995





Trophies
 

IHow can we accommodate these reforms? The nights of bell-flowers are as finished as the hell of water that has unrolled and become news. Pull at the ox's ring and the wall of the sinuses falls down. Pull at the hoop in the eyelid, dormitories are felled. A marriage of fists and kites, the smile is hammered so painstakingly into the gut it forms a ring.III am staring up at a boxing match in which white Everlasts and red Everlasts take on the breakneck speed of cupids. Art Deco faades hem in the open-air courtyard; a black belt of skyline circles off their incandescent white waists. The sunrise pulls level with the sea. The boxers' shadows furl and unfurl, drawing into cups.IIIYou open your heart's wings like a bread riot, split the uncooked potatoes on the table with a glance, and eat. You make the hours work like fragile perceptions for the food they get, the warmth they get, for the variable, contradictory spontaneities imposed on their bodies as love or triumph in mistaken assertions.
        




Wave Trough
 

Sets the folds in alignment; 
this a shallow, a constitution of drops 
that moves to displace itself 
and unconsciously reverts 
to image. 

In such a state, 
the wave has become a setting-- 
a table across which cups 
with propositions rolled inside them 
are passed. 

The passage of cups does not limit 
the range of potential outcomes, 
and yet at no point does the wave 
dissolve into abstraction. 

The shades 
are drawn and we are 
overwhelmed by flags 
crossing the black divan. 

An axis of rotation, 
gliding a fraction of an inch 
and yet unveiling its total mass. 

Advancing, the disc of its body 
shimmers. Alighting on the sand, 
it reveals itself in a cluster of pulses. 

Dilated, it lifts from the sea floor: 
fine spokes radiating on a wheel. 
It passes between bands of bright 
water, a kiss or a plow.





Epithalamion
 

At once this dragnet of cousins
Whips its way into your presence saying
None of them among us. They are
Oracles on the court of midnight,
The tight filigree of a mind or your
Splashing around in, your pandemonium
Of copper graffiti inexpertly put up.
They make weapons of furled hands.
"We will walk, but our bones will carry
Ribbons of lead, or we will, like
Acrobats mill-headed in 3s (3 blades,
3 hips, 3 tongues), answer to what comes
Before, what comes before? Eleousa,
Master of Dark Eyelids, eye opening
Like a fennel seed, you are generous
Or are you not, do you shore up and
Wink at the soul? What does the soul say
Other than "my divorce from . . ., "tan
Holiday . . ., "smoking crystal in teak rooms . . .
But should have asked, "What do you
See? The sun a sequence of fans, a bridge,
Only so exquisitely cabled as to make us
Still--shall we fall
Or travel between bridges
Among the robust, sane clouds,
A face cut from smoke, heat, and light?
The sun, dancing in a vial, the initial
Memory of what it was to be born--
Doberman of a sheer-white universe--
To school out--the audacity of rising
Without name or color to new rooms,
New youth, fruitful, born singularly
To precise moments not in epiphany
But duration--as under new weather
We become--in action, receive--our
Bodies uncasked like umbrellas under
The flamingo-red light of the racing day.





Fairy Tales from the Web
 

Somebody who would never refuse money told me this--
about the syncretic effect when each person plugs
their attention into a field to read ad copy, let's just say
they become opened up and other beings can see into
their minds. This was considered a science fiction idea
to many people, but not to me.
In my negative space construction is always occurring.

The liftoff from awful to tolerable
to positive and then finally to bright new beautiful
has been my most difficult task to swing.
But swing I will; there's nothing else to do.
I live here and being here and hearing myself
or my mind's divide through others convinces me
that I must do everything I can to save us from the pit.

That is, until the pit splits and the fruit tree finally grows.
You may have a tree of your own--you may have a home
in your own tree. Congratulations. If you write an instructive
pamphlet you can bet I will read it.
I do not want to go out in darkness.
I am doing everything I know to prevent this,
and thank you, by the way, if you've written a pamphlet.

The shared information system
and each being at the end of its screen
emits an LED (light emitting diode) on an often
green screen--you say I should give my
father up to the authorities. You blame your
circumstances on my choice--but it's the authorities who
did this to him. How do you think a person loses his mind?
He let someone take it.

He is sort of my mind and you are too,
God help me.
The green screen is an ingenious discovery.
You can record events in a studio before the screen
and then key in whatever environment you like.
It's a special color: Chroma Green,
but it can be blue too.

The experience of things is determined by our
feelings about them. Information is colored
by us. You may see remotely, in a photograph
for instance, the image of an ambush victim.
Maybe it is a war and/or she is caught naked.
If she is unhappy--indicated by face and body
arrangement--you may feel that.

Some people will hate the state of things that made her
so alone and vulnerable but few will do anything about it.
How do you find her? What guns surround her country?
And after all, maybe she would hate it.
To have to feel grateful to someone moved by her humiliation.
She may only be thinking about humiliation.

That is a tough feeling to shake.
Then, and I need not go too far into this,
then there are those who see the pain of someone
and they just love it. This may have something
to do with a revenge sentiment over their own unclosed wound.
The wound, they think, is everyone else's fault
and they cannot forgive. This is only information,
in the form of speculation.

Some feelings you get when you consider
"What if this happened to me? and you will want to remedy
the situation to secure yourself from the (negative) condition of it.
Together, humans create one body--the planet earth
and its projections. The things in the stomach
affect what goes on in the head. On the web
many people make money with miracle potions.

Some curb the human appetite.
Some say you can lose while consuming whatever you want.
I heard the other girl refer to me as a skull.
She was very angry and did not look or say hello.
There is a prevalent competitive notion
that each only has one place. That her face is only
hers and that I don't have a face or to her it is death.

This she reads as me--the death of her.
Obviously I am not. I write and read and
then roll on. I wear an ordinary human face,
some could compare me to a bird of prey
because my nose is hooked and my fingers are long
and I like to ride my bicycle with the wind at my back.
I am not here to attack.

You are also a mutant.
Do you think you can keep the heavy metals outside of you?
Do you think you can go to sleep here
and wake up the same?
The screen is framed by plastic,
beneath that you use words to issue commandments
or call-outs.

Most people use the web to send messages
to people who are already their friends.
They make arrangements for later and
detail what happened in the past.
This information may be not true.
The web cannot know intention.
It records and is open to influence.

People make money through advertisements,
or so they think--well, selling ads, that's quantifiable--
if ads make money, that is more difficult
to know unless there are special offers.
The web is full of special offers and 30-day
trials. If you fall for those, or I should say,
if you respond to the offer

what often happens is that your information
is shared with other companies who will fill your inbox
with offers (that which is known as spam).
Because you are someone who wants to look great
and there are other companies with products compatible
with your stated desire. Ways for you to achieve
the prevailing notion of beauty.

It is my job to tell you the models
are selected because they are physically improbable.
They are elevated to be made desirable.
Their desirability is physical because they are models.
If it were easy to be like that, they would not
be sought-after by manufacturers.
Generally, working people need to be sturdy.

Advertisers want to make money.
They go with psychology and so create a sort of
self-rejection by advocating forms not reflected in most people.
They know that people will pay in to be of an elevated form
no matter what station they are from.
Everyone wants to be beautiful.
Everyone wants to be the agreed-upon beautiful thing.

Probably everyone is beautiful somewhere inside
if not outside. You can create an excellent argument
for your being and improve upon ability. That is my opinion.
If you live alone, you may know how great the web can be.
On it there is information and pornography.
Information includes
the prospects.

Pornography is the biggest industry in America.
It is designed to bring about a certain state
of arousal, generally, couched in anger
that will allow the person to fuck exactly how they want to
without worrying about the one fucked.
Pornography is addictive for many.
Of course, sometimes people want to touch, to hear a voice

to imagine a partner and what they can do together.
The web has many dating services. My ex-psychiatrist
advised me against trying them.
She had transferred the daughter role onto me.
I do appreciate the dangers of strangers.
I am prepared with the information that pictures
are not people in both obvious and non-obvious ways.

I know at least three people who have been in love
with people they met online.
Each one is intelligent and down-to-earth.
I've gleaned from their descriptions of online courting
that the early questions are essential.
That and no expectation and somehow you have
to withhold your own personal information.

That is, until you meet up in a non-threatening place.
You will have to have someone know where you are,
a point person. And you will need a defense; mace, for instance
or a rape whistle or a dog leashed nearby
or in the car.
It will be important for him or her to know you have a dog.
They should meet each other as soon as possible.

This is the magic of the machine.
The meeting and love trial and,
if it works, the love made.
Well, that really is amazing.
Objectively amazing.
And good for the machine.
Good for the machine.

The electric web courses heavily through me.
This may be how we make history:
we can put up our movies, our words, or costume dramas.
We say we are so and so
and people follow the saga.
Do you ever get the problem which is opposite
to the problem of the watcher?

Have you ever only seen yourself through other people?
Or thought that's what it was but it was really your
thought processes transferred through them?
I should look up the word rubric again.
That and lacuna and devi.
In the thrift store nobody looked at me.
But the woman said, "Devi (hee, hee) Devi.

A celestial being: what we all are.
True she might have meant devil.
I am not a devil.
I love my friends most of the time.
I love animals--I don't think devils do that.
My friend sends me pictures
of jackrabbits and frogs.

Yesterday, he said he saw buttercups, a type of flower.
You go over the tracks first, on the other side of the river

and there they are.





No Promissory Notes
 

The word penis is probably the most misattributed word in
English, I think. Because almost nobody has a real one.
The standards are made in Japanese or German factories.

Womb/vagina sets are unusual too if genuine.
Standards are from China; they are recycled sheepskin wallets.
I was shocked too when I heard this.

I do not have an actual either but they called
me a genius when I figured it out about the fetal
lamb/sheep skin. What else to do with all the wallets

now that there's no money? Only barter.
I do not know what the inside of this thing looks like
but I think it looks like a brain made of mozzarella cheese.

Standard penises are made of a certain kind of plant.
An ocean weed and how it's fitted is by body weight
at birth which is why you shouldn't smoke

if you are pregnant, you will be blamed
even though it's complicated to know exact reasons
as we all in the new world know better each day.

They've made new lingo to go with the genuine penis.
They say unicorn, I say wasabi.
Apparently, almost everyone gets green horseradish with sushi.

Wasabi takes several million years to grow,
its taste is delicate. When I mentioned Japan
earlier, I meant the motor city.

When I say Wasabi near Japan; it's island
of slow unit dance or Remarkable Mask.
When I say new world, it's where the newly suited go.

T-cell robots, we of lambs and plants and jellyfish that are
in our eyes which are colored by their place in the ocean.
Really, if you broke us down, you'd have quite a collection:

resins from pine, precious stones,
silver dust, and sea grass filaments,
stalks, pig livers, skin, a milk protein.

This is the equipment for the dominant standard penis holders
of the unreal, and I would love to be one with a genuine
but I have not the stomach to pull off the cunning necessary

for the genuine purse/penis license.
You barter for it; you lie.
Don't get me wrong, it must be nice

to have options. But to get them dishonestly?
It's bothering. I know, I know!
I have got to say goodbye to the babyhood phase.

Learn to thrive! Nobody has a father or a mother.
I know this means to thrive!
To be one's own lover.

My sheepskin wallet is . . . 
What could a person say? Stuck in the past,
tripped up by the concept of wallet?

It's not like anything gets taken out
unless it's rotten which it probably isn't
because I feel okay and you look alright.

It's that it wants to be ultimate although
a new and genuine vagina/womb set from a biped
has not been recorded in over 180 years

which means billions of here/now moments.
Which means forgotten a trillion times
and remembered exactly one plus that.

There's not as much empty space as we thought
in the old blueprints that made donuts
in space--the halo, the Homeric lure.

The one electron penis and the drone.
I've been sick and found all this out because I couldn't
get out of bed and there was a diamond near my head.

I was reading about moray eels,
their hydraulics. How they practically
fly-fish with agility.

It's the forward going.
I'd like to go boldly.
I've kept a card of energy.

Wilderness saved from childhood.
Of this secret, one must be silent
so the sun can trust us.

Kids need each other.
Better they never get 
separated entirely.

Contra this, I do want to fly fish.
To cast off and plant it then go with
the nylon line. Where to take off

the old wallet and give it back
to a lamb. I'll be the promo homo
making arrangements to go to the show

where we trade our new pieces congenially
and find others, depleted by scavengers,
and get them up-and-running to better suns,

not the promised land, exactly
the opposite. Exactly the opposite
of anything promised.





Reading
 

--For My Students

Breakfast, and I'm eating plain yogurt, figs from my garden, and honey.
             I'm sitting in a lawn chair on the backyard patio--

life is good, and the sunlight warming my lap and the pages 
             of a book remind me of Tucson 

and the subterranean apartment I rented alone and far from home.
             There was a sofa in front of my one window 

where at noon the sun burned briefly on the cushions as starlings 
             stirred in the trees with their admonishments.

Stepping back there now, I remember feeling hopeless after reading 
             Lorca's "Lament for Ignacio Snchez Mejas.

I recall how I put the book on the coffee table and closed my eyes 
             and saw blood glowing in my arteries.

In the leaves, the starlings went on with their disconnected chatter,
             and I said to myself, "I'll never write anything like

And the bull alone with a high heart! At five o'clock in the afternoon.'
             For three months, I didn't write one word

but instead passed the days swimming in the public pool where, 
             from my half-closed eyes, I watched light ride

the splashing water or resting on the surface when I floated, face down, 
             sinking with fear: "What do I do now? I asked.

Some nights, I filled my red truck with gas and drove west on the 19 
             until my headlights flooded the desert, and when 

the city was less than pinpoints of glitter, and when all I could hear 
             was the whine of silence in my ears, 

I parked alongside the highway, leaned against my pickup, and stared
             at stars so sure of themselves as they shone

that I believed they couldn't help but give me something that would
             make me sit at my desk and write. 

I felt directionless and wanted to walk out into the landscape, 
             but I feared snakes and scorpions 

hiding in the buckhorn and staghorn as I recalled my father's words, 
             "You'll be lost forever on the far side of the moon--

words that haunted me as I imagined slipping into lunar shadows 
             that no human telescope would spot 

as I wandered lost and ripped with nostalgia for the nights I read
             in used bookstores on Campbell--a time when 

the future seemed so clear I smelled it in dirt that somebody 
             rinsed from the sidewalk as I walked home. 

Then, one night while sipping black coffee along the side of the 19, 
             I remembered lying on the living room floor

as my father and I listened to Brahms's "Lullaby, which inspired me
             to practice "Away in a Manger on my trumpet: 

"It's a lullaby. Play it like that, my father said as my sixth grade lips 
             struggled to phrase notes that would 

please a child under the beating stars, and remembering this, 
             I looked up to the oblivious heavens 

and tied words to images--Cassiopeia, Perseus, Cygnus, Pegasus--
             and let them sing clearly through my mind.





Wedding Portrait
 

Yesterday afternoon, I hung a framed print in the living room--
a task that took two head-throbbing hours.
It's a wedding portrait that we love: Frida and Diego Rivera.
I wonder how two people could consistently hurt each other,
but still feel love so deeply as their bones turned into dust?
Before Frida died, she painted a watermelon still life;
before his death, Diego did too.
I want to believe that those paintings were composed
during parallel moments because of their undying devotion.
If I close my eyes, I can see melon wedges left like
centerpieces except for the slice
Diego put on the table's corner--
one piece of fruit pecked at by a dove
that passed through a window.
I know that I won't be building a bookshelf anytime soon
and that the chances of me constructing a roll-top desk
are as slim as me building an Adirondack chair that sits plumb,
but I'm good with the spackle and putty knives in my tool belt.
The knots in my back might not be there
if I had listened to her suggestions,
and I could well have done without two hours of silence
over a few holes in the wall.
But somehow, life has its ways of working things out.
This afternoon, I shut the blinds,
turned off the TV, lights, and phone,
and massaged my wife's feet to fight off a migraine--
her second one this week despite
the prophylactics and pain killers that we store in the breadbox.
For once, I'd like to experience what she feels:
nausea, blindness, and pain that strike
when the cranial vessels dilate,
fill with blood, leak, and make the brain swell.
Earlier, an MRI triggered the reaction as it mapped her head 
with electrical current, gradient magnets, and radio waves
hammering her floundering eyes.
For now, we have our room, the bed frame, and the mattress
where she lies as I knead her toes.
Come nightfall, I hope that we'll sit in the patio and watch
the breeze stirring the lemon, lime, and orange trees
that I planted along the back fence.
On certain nights, the moon turns our lawn
into green acrylic where we sip Syrah and mint tea
until all we know is the sound
of our breathing among the whispering leaves.





The Pointless Nether Plow
 

It is farming in an inclement sun system
like a powerless nether beast
fallen amidst random stellar debris

fruit changes form
light then quavers across distorted mural relics

the farmer then living as a clarified adder
his land forms compressed
his wheat suspended & flaring
his unstable forms
carving his soil with volcanic blue seeds





On Anti-Biography
 

          
          For me, biography is a lantern, burning in the midst of parenthetical opaqueness. In a sense, it is a ruse, a phantasmic meandering, brighter or dimmer, according to the ecletic happenstance of terror. Me, I've been sired in anomaly, in an imagery of brewing grenadine riddles, a parallel poesis spawned from curious seismographic molten. I say curious, because the original stalking arc has disappeared into the wilderness of an a priori blizzard, which gives birth to a level, like a portal of fire conjoined with the lightning field of mystery. I call it the poetic guardian dove, the hieratic alien wing. It is the non-local field, the non-particle acid, flowing into my cognitive iodine rays, into the vicious fires of my tarantella marshes. So I dance with vibration, with the solar arc spinning backward around the miraculous force of a double green horizon. Simultaneously, I escape the territorial, while remaining within the burning loops of my own momentary seizures, guarded by ferns, legs plowing land, the face and the mind guided by stars. So, I am a martyr of drills, of spates of specific lingual flooding, casting at times, a mist or a mirage, like a caravan of yaks, transporting tungsten and water. Conversely, to give a graph of dates, to single out a bevy of personal social lesions, would invert me, would turn me around a diurnal bundle of glass, staggered, with a less than fiery temperature, partially nulling my sensitivity to falling phonemic peppers, to the inclination towards victory which burns in the dawn above heaven. For me, this is the green locale, the pleroma of eternal solar essence, glinting, full of fabulous maelstrom diamonds, an empowered hegira of drift, of claustrophobic rainbow spectrums which empty themselves, and return to themselves, like having an image go out and return to itself, so that its power transmutes by the very energy of its looping; and I think of myself, the poet sending signals into mystery, and having them return to me with oneiric wings and spirals, so much so, that I forget my prosaic locale with its stultifying anchors, with its familial dotage and image reports, with its dates inscribed in trapezoidal feces. I am only concerned with simultaneity and height, with rays of monomial kindling, guiding the neo-cortex through ravens, into the ecstasy of x-rays and blackness.
        




Coping Prana
 

It is the way I breathe
through chronic terrifying ferns
through a black ungracious stoma

it is this uranium rejoinder
this impact pointing backwards

& when witnessed
causes observers to panic
to blur
& forget
& to flee

they can't see my approach
my wayward dorsal looming
my lettering in black drizzle

it is my approach
my weaving
my sigil as curved embankment

therefore
I can never name myself
or plot myself
according to the sparks or the splinters from the work bench

dazed
ruthless with salivation
with my awkward insular roaming
I am like a few darkened eaglets riveted against the moon

then I am brought to a table by deafness
feasting with herons
which spins me by embranglement
by in-circular abatement
always seeking to have me neutered beneath my derma
so as to talk to myself
so as to cancel my structureless scrutiny

they speak of me as lawless
as despicable
as a typhoon in a sea well
as to morals
as to fixed & accelerated combination

they fix me
as deserted
bereft
as a fragment from a starving lion's compendium

I am considered
as pointless positron without image
as hieroglyph
as sundial
as martyr

being leakage from a barbarous index province





Wayfaring
 

I see into them
as they see out of me
& dissolve the wattage
to avoid future legends
young pharaohs on Fillmore cracking dutches 
it is a lonely frontier by contrast
forgotten game skulking around
big hearts, small temper
thine absence overflows 
thine presence undoes
do not attempt to circle the inferno
a tremor in the throne
is a tremor in the throne





First Rites
 

          
          Besides Sundays there were Wednesday evenings and the occasional Tuesday. They called Tuesdays "visitation and we would meet in the parking lot and load into a van. There were little cards with peoples' names and addresses on them and we'd drive around until contact was made. I always managed to hide a few cards and claimed carsickness but it was too humid to stay in the van. Oftentimes I'd recognize someone from school and felt like apologizing but couldn't. On Wednesdays, it was a bit easier because we arrived early so my mom could volunteer. I skated the parking curbs on the side of the building and could hear the choir practice. Other times I'd wait on the stairs at the cosmetology school next door. There was this kid who dropped out of eighth grade, and I was his lookout while he smoked. He preferred to be called Fluid and got kicked out of youth group more than once. The youth minister was large and pale and wore tight shirts that made sweat stains around his belly. One day we went on a retreat that turned out to be a rented trailer in the country. In the afternoon we watched films inside and at night played games in the dark. I wound up sleeping under a table listening to Sanitarium from Master of Puppets on repeat. The following morning my headphones were taken away so I could be open to the message. Other retreats included all night bowling and Friday night lock-up. Arrival was at ten and they would keep us awake with caffeine, sweets, and more games. I frequently got nervous being separated into groups and remember once winning a race in the foyer wearing high-heels. Later I escaped to the pews of the sanctuary. It was pitch black and I found myself standing in a drained baptismal with white robes hanging over the windows. It was strange to see where all those people went after the altar calls. Those were on Sunday mornings and the services were very long and formal. It was important to sit behind the older ladies so you could sleep behind their hair. After the closing song I'd wait in the car seemingly for hours, listening to mix tapes, mostly Suicidal Tendencies or Maiden. Then we'd drive to a Chinese restaurant or go to this pizza place that had a buffet. I'd watch the others play video games but most of the time I'd just go outside. The clouds were always cumulus and some afternoons you could hear the wind and think about what it'd be like to be somewhere else. It really didn't matter though, maybe I could get dropped off at a friend's, watch Kung-Fu Theater, or skate the mini-ramp in the backyard. He had twin sisters and we could do whatever we wanted.
        




A Few Miles Off
 

Too many are leaving
     usually they greet in sleep before dashing
as in today with this gentleman
     (awkward not to type his name)
when yesterday in the shower
     I remembered his face in Aardvark
something about NWA but not about them
     just a played reference
There were newspaper clips
     all police brutality, all framed with snow
& I vaguely recalled something 
     about Uma Thurman & the Menils 
when the guard ushered me out 
     for touching the African sculptures
I waited in the lobby for hours
     like this morning reading 
that he overdosed. It was a hotel 
     & I didn't even know him
I don't even know his work





Just Sepia
 

I refuse to settle 
out of the true 
choose to communicate 
through pay phones and paper
out here in the country of McAllister & Steiner
we are the only Victorians left
& I wish I wouldn't have said 
that one something that one time
when what I really wanted
was to finish cutting the okra for the gumbo
& read Baudelaire again
his L'Invitation au Voyage 
backwards reveals all of the magic 
in writing that one can endure
each line out loud resounds perfect
all week I've been thinking about printing
a pirated book of such, nothing grand
typed on the Remington, 3x4, no address
no copyright and fifty limited
for whomever I run into





Song for Baby-O, Unborn
 

Sweetheart
when you break thru
you'll find
a poet here
not quite what one would choose.

I won't promise
you'll never go hungry
or that you won't be sad
on this gutted
breaking 
globe

but I can show you
baby
enough to love
to break your heart
forever





The Window
 

you are my bread
and the hairline 
noise
of my bones
you are almost 
the sea

you are not stone
or molten sound
I think
you have no hands



this kind of bird flies backward
and this love
breaks on a windowpane
where no light talks

this is not time
for crossing tongues
(the sand here
never shifts)



I think 
tomorrow
turned you with his toe
and you will
shine
and shine
unspent and underground





First Snow, Kerhonkson
 

for Alan
This, then, is the gift the world has given me
(you have given me)
softly the snow
cupped in hollows
lying on the surface of the pond
matching my long white candles 
which stand at the window
which will burn at dusk while the snow
fills up our valley
this hollow
no friend will wander down
no one arriving brown from Mexico
from the sunfields of California, bearing pot
they are scattered now, dead or silent
or blasted to madness
by the howling brightness of our once common vision
and this gift of yours--
white silence filling the contours of my life.





Buddhist New Year Song
 

I saw you in green velvet, wide full sleeves
seated in front of a fireplace, our house
made somehow more gracious, and you said
"There are stars in your hair-- it was truth I
brought down with me

to this sullen and dingy place that we must make golden
make precious and mythical somehow, it is our nature,
and it is truth, that we came here, I told you,
from other planets
where we were lords, we were sent here,
for some purpose

the golden mask I had seen before, that fitted
so beautifully over your face, did not return
nor did that face of a bull you had acquired
amid northern peoples, nomads, the Gobi desert

I did not see those tents again, nor the wagons
infinitely slow on the infinitely windy plains,
so cold, every star in the sky was a different color
the sky itself a tangled tapestry, glowing
but almost, I could see the planet from which we had come

I could not remember (then) what our purpose was
but remembered the name Mahakala, in the dawn

in the dawn confronted Shiva, the cold light
revealed the "mindborn worlds, as simply that,
I watched them propagated, flowing out,
or, more simply, one mirror reflecting another.
then broke the mirrors, you were no longer in sight
nor any purpose, stared at this new blackness
the mindborn worlds fled, and the mind turned off:

a madness, or a beginning?





An Exercise in Love
 

for Jackson Allen
My friend wears my scarf at his waist
I give him moonstones
He gives me shell & seaweeds
He comes from a distant city & I meet him
We will plant eggplants & celery together
He weaves me cloth

                   Many have brought the gifts
                   I use for his pleasure
                   silk, & green hills
                   & heron the color of dawn

My friend walks soft as a weaving on the wind
He backlights my dreams
He has built altars beside my bed
I awake in the smell of his hair & cannot remember
his name, or my own.

The Road to Emmaus
 

For Nathan Gebert
                                                    I
The chair from Goodwill smelled of mildew.
I sat with Sister Ann, a Franciscan. 
In her small office, at the Cenacle Retreat House, 
right off Dixie Highway in Lantana, Florida,
I began my story--
it was an interview, much of life is an interview.
She said I did not need to pay her, but donations,
yes, donations were appreciated:
they could be left anonymously in a plain white envelope
that she could take back to the cloister.
She was dressed in a turtleneck and a denim jumper.
She could have been mistaken in a grocery store for an aging housewife.
My meetings with her went on for a few years.

I had come to speak about Durell.
I did not know how to end sentences about Durell.
He had taught me--what? To live? Not to wince in the mirror? 
What? There were so many ways to end my sentence.
He was an unlikely candidate for so many things.
Outside, it was always some subtle variation of summer.
I paused, then spoke urgently, not wanting to forget some fact, 
but much I knew I would forget or remember in a way my own,
which would not exactly be correct, no, not exactly.
Durell was dead, I said, and I needed to make sense of things.

Sister Ann's face was open, fragile--
parts were chipped like on a recovered fresco.
Above her gray head, 
a garish postcard of the Emmaus scene,
the colors off, as if painted by numbers, with no concern for shading-- 
the style of it had an unoriginal Catholic institutional uniformity.
There it hung, askew in its golden drugstore frame.
It was the scene from the end of Luke, the two disciples,
one named Cleopas, the other anonymous, 
forever mumbling Christ's name, and with them, 
the resurrected Christ masquerading as a stranger. 
They were on their way to that town, Emmaus,
seven miles out from Jerusalem,
gossiping about the impress of Christ's vanishing--
they argued about whether to believe what they had seen;
they were restless, back and forth the debate went--
when there is estrangement there is little peace.


                                                    ii
 
Every time we met, Sister Ann prayed first.
At times, my recollections blurred or a presumption would reverse.
Sister Ann told me Durell was with me still,
in a more intimate way than when he lived.
She frequently lost her equilibrium, as older people sometimes do,
before settling into her worn-out chair 
where she listened to me, week after week. 

The day I met Durell, I said, the morning light was clear,
startling the town with ornament.
The steeple of Christ Church held the horizon in place,
or so I imagined, as if it had been painted first
with confident amounts of titanium white
before the rest was added. Trees clattered.
The reiterating brick puzzle of Cambridge brightened--
Mass Avenue, Mount Auburn, Dunster, Holyoke--
proclaimed a new September, and new students trudged the streets.
Every blood-warm structure was defined in relief.

Hours before, while the moon's neck wobbled on the Charles 
like a giraffe's, or the ghost of a giraffe's neck, 
I imagined Durell labored, having slept only a few hours,
caged in his worries of doctor bills, no money,
and running out of people to ask for it:
mulling over mistakes, broken love affairs--
a hospital orderly, a man upstairs,
he probably mumbled unkind epithets about blacks and Jews,
even though the men he loved were blacks and Jews.
Some of his blasphemies, if you want to call them that,
embarrassed me in front of Sister Ann,
but she seemed unflappably tolerant.

At sixty, he was unemployable.
He had taught school and guarded buildings,
each job ending worse than the last.
His refrain was always: "It is not easy being an impoverished aristocrat.
He spoke with the old Harvard accent, 
I can still hear it, I will probably always hear it,
with New York City, the North Shore and the Army mixed in,
the a's broadened, the r's were flat, the t's snapped--
so a sentence would calibrate to a confident close,
like "My dee-ah boy, that is that.
He lived on 19 Garden Street in a rent-controlled studio
on the second floor, number 25; he said the "25 reminded him of Christmas.

At eleven o'clock, 
he probably pulled on his support hose,
increasing the circulation in his legs, blotched green and black.
Next, he would have locked the door with his gold key
and moved deliberately, his smile beleaguered.
Bowing to Miss Littlefield in the landlord's office
at the building's dark cubbyhole of an entrance:
they probably spoke of Queen Elizabeth ii, 
her disappointments, for Miss Littlefield and he were Royalists both.
Then Durell began to move towards me, entering the Square.
Breathing heavily, he might have passed the Brattle 
advertising Judgment at Nuremberg--
inside the shut black theatrical box where the world repeated the past,
Maximilian Schell interrogated Judy Garland and Montgomery Clift;
Marlene Dietrich let the phone ring and ring.
Maybe he passed the Store 24 sign, bright orange,
passed Nini's Corner where sex magazines were stacked like a cliff.
Maybe, maybe. But, maybe not. 
Maybe he went another way.

Then I recalled how the t shook that place, 
the subway grates pushing up the scent of rat-life and all things fallen,
mixing with Leavitt & Peirce exuding its masculine snuff.
Down Plympton Street he might have gone, past the Grolier, 
which I always remembered, for some reason, as closed,
gilded with spines of poetry books for its reredos.
Yes, he probably, most likely, certainly, did that.
Sister Ann wondered if I thought he paused. 
I thought not--
poetry offered him no solutions.

At twelve o'clock, 
the chairperson called our aa meeting to order.
We called ourselves "The Loony Nooners, 
and met in a Lutheran church basement.
We ate salads out of Tupperware,
shaking the contents like dice to mix the dressing.
Some knitted. Schizophrenics lit multiple cigarettes.
Acne-pocked Kate wanted to be a model,
Electroshock Mike read paperbacks,
and an Irish professor named Tom,
welcomed Tellus, who could not get over Nam.
Darkened figures in the poor light, we looked like the burghers of Calais,
and smelled of brewed coffee, smoke, perfume, urine, human brine. 
We were aristocrats of time:
"I have twenty-one years, "I have one week, "I have one day.
I have often thought we were like first-century Christians--
a strident, hidden throng, electrified by a message.
Or, another way of thinking of us, 
is that we were inconvenient obstacles 
momentarily removed, much to the city's relief.
From each window well, high heels and business shoes hurried.
Durell H., as he was known to us, took his place,
his thick hair fixed as the waves of an 1800s nautical painting
(perhaps he kept it set with hair spray?),
his Tiffany ring polished to a brilliance,
he set himself apart in his metal folding chair.
He had the clotted girth of Hermann Gring.
What was he thinking about?
Was he thinking about blood clots and possible aneurysms?
Imperious, behind prism-like trifocals,
quietly he said to me, "I've grown as fat as Elizabeth Taylor.


                                                    iii
 
The meeting ended and Durell folded his metal chair.
He hated his Christian name--
"Durell, he said, "Who names their child Durell?
Moving among the crowd, listening to success and failure,
he passed out meeting lists, literature, leaflets.
Durell sponsored men, he referred to them as "pigeons.
I met him that day. I was his last.

After that, every day we spoke on rotary phones.
I was young and spoke as if my story was the only one.
I told him I had underlined key passages in Plato's Symposium,
told him I had been graded unfairly on Dante's Inferno and Purgatorio,
told him my schedule might not allow for the Paradiso.
He matched my telling with listening, advising, 
and more listening, mostly over the phone, 
and the more he listened the more he was alone. 
"Why was that? Sister Ann asked.
It was some sort of offering, perhaps. 
At times it seemed he needed to guarantee a pardon,
that old Catholic idea of indulgences 
lurked somewhere there unspoken,
as if he believed a larger offering might guarantee a larger pardon. 
Such a task demanded his increased singleness. 
Yes, that was true. Or was it?
I had trouble settling on the right words with Sister Ann.
Many of my words were not exactly right, the syntax awkward.
I kept having trouble translating Durell, so much I guessed. 
How to know?
(Why hadn't I asked him more questions?
He wasn't the sort that invited questions, I do remember that.)
Another way of saying it was that when he was with me, 
on the phone, then and only then, did he seem to move in truth 
and in his truths, reprimanding and hard, 
he was made more singular. Maybe that was it.
Whatever the case, he listened, he listened to me.
I missed his listening.
Listening, Sister Ann said, is a memorable form of love.

After the meeting, he gave me his calling card.
The cards were placed inside his compulsively polished silver card case,
the black capitals raised on their ecru background,
containing his name, bracketed by a "Mr. and a "Jr.--
the "Mr. denoting lost civility,
the "Jr. tallying a lineage that did not bridge.
As we walked down Church Street, the bells of St. John the Evangelist rang.
The road was bright, the road full.
Behind the brown gate with the thick black rusted latch,
the monks sang, "It is well, it is well, with my soul, with my soul.
We peered in at bookshop clerks locating titles,
watch repairmen bent over lit ocular devices, fixing movements,
florists, hands wet, arranging stems and branches broken.
We saw ourselves reflected.
I laughed with deference, the way a student laughs before a teacher.
His skin was flecked with milk-blues, lead-whites, earthen reds.
In dress and demeanor he was as rigid as a toy soldier,
for he was a part of a republic with standards, atrophied, devoted to order.

Everyone found him impossible,
including, at times, me.
Of queers, his word for what he was but could not admit to,
he said, "You know in the army they could never be trusted.
I mentioned romantic love.
In profile, a silhouette, he paused.
He said, "It has been very vexing, indeed.
By his tone, I knew never to ask again.
A decorum of opprobrium kept him whole,
and so he guarded himself with intensity. 
Maybe, Sister Ann suggested, he was guarding me.

Durell said, "I've whittled my world down to no one,
Spencer, with the possible exception of you.


                                                    iv
 
"What happened then? Sister Ann asked.
He excused himself with a handshake, his palms soft as bread dough
from all the Jergens he had slathered on,
and then he probably returned to his ambry of a studio, 
a place where I would be one of his only visitors.
Although he handed out his number, he did not always answer.
I remember...
(What do I remember?)... 
I was free to turn away but the moment I looked back,
Durell would come back to me, 
waiting for me. It seems to me now, after all this time, 
few things have as much fidelity as the past.

I remember he had nailed memorabilia above his head
as one would place stones to fortify a castle:
a photograph of him in the army, liberating people, undoing Russian codes;
a framed marriage license from England
(although the marriage failed, he often mumbled her name);
his framed diploma, Harvard, and over the corner hung
his graduation cap's faded black tassel.
Next to his pill bottles, an Edward viii coronation mug he doted on,
commemorating an event that never took place.
Maybe he made a bread and baloney sandwich.
Maybe he stepped over the rolled-up tag-sale carpet and drew the shades.
By late evening, he might have jotted down notes about God,
obedient as he was to the twelve steps of aa.
He might have written in his tightly-looped feminine penmanship,
informed by the Palmer Method,
and later repeated a phrase or two to me over the phone.
Or maybe he read from his Twenty-Four Hours a Day book
to find a rule maybe, or to search for a sanctuary.
Or maybe he listened to the Reverend Peter Gomes on the radio,
The Plummer Professor of Christian Morals at Harvard,
for he often mentioned how he loved the preacher's parallel constructions,
yes, maybe he did that, maybe, possibly, he did that.

And then, perhaps, he slept a bit
before the whole routine began once more 
with the support hose, the hair spray, Miss Littlefield, the sex magazines, 
the Grolier, the folding chair, the meeting, the calling card.
How crazy America was, he said, how he wanted to leave,
but he never left town, except jolting trips to the hospital
in an ambulance down all those brick roads.


                                                    v
 
I lived in Cambridge two years. 
After that, wherever I moved, we spoke, daily, over the phone, on landlines --
talking and listening, listening and talking, for fifteen years:
"You alright? "Yes. You?
In all that time, I saw him only once more, and by then he was nearly blind.
In all that time, we barely touched one another.
Why our relationship required its rood screen, 
I could not fully explain to Sister Ann,
indeed, I can never seem to properly explain it to anyone.
But I have tried, and I will probably always keep trying.
But if I get nothing right,
I must try to get a nuance of our friendship
and his sponsorship right-- 
we were bound, bound by a vow, a vow of attention
(there are many causes for attention, among them redemption).
Our attention concerned the spirit,
although that sounds pious and we were not so pious,
we were more selfish, more human than pious.
What else can I say?
I needed a liberator
and liberators can come in some unexpected guises.
I may never wholly explain the two of us.
Perhaps the spirit defies the human mind, 
even after all my time with Sister Ann.

Finally, from a hospital, came the report of Durell's last day.
A charge nurse said: "I touched the gangrene leg, pink flesh was coming back.
His compliments had increased the more his life failed.
In the final week, he quoted Cole Porter songs to me--
You're a Bendel bonnet, a Shakespeare sonnet, you're Mickey Mouse...
I did not repeat the rhymes to Sister Ann.
Who Durell was and why he did what he did and why he hid
what he hid I kept asking her. 
Sister Ann quoted from Deuteronomy:
"I set before you life and death...choose life.

Old pigeon flying back,
when I arrived at the hospital his body was gone.
The formalities were few,
for he had become a ward of the state.
The staff gave me a brown grocery bag of his things:
a roll of dimes, a pair of shoes, a belt buckle, an Einstein quote,
something about mediocre minds.
Afterwards, I went through Cambridge and found the meeting gone.
Night was coming. 
Blindness worked on the people, shops, churches, streets.
No one knew me.
People said: "Where will we go? and "What will we eat?
I thought I recognized this or that face, but no, no, too much time had passed.
On Church Street, restaurants had replaced bookstores.
Windows on Mass Avenue shone with chandeliers.
Someone backed up photographing with a flash.
"Hold still, they said, "hold still.
A new set of homeless people pleaded,
coins rattled inside the used coffee cups they shook.
Everyone moved with packages, briefcases, textbooks, flash cards, cell phones, flowers.
The Charles advanced, determined as a hearse,
its dark waters gathering up every unattached thing.
An umber, granular dusk-light fell on the elms over Harvard Yard
as they swayed dark and slow
like the chords in the waltz from Copeland's Rodeo.
There I stood, unsure of which way to go.
The light had more ghosts in it as it must have had that day in Emmaus.


                                                    vi
 
Suddenly, Sister Ann announced our last meeting.
Down the linoleum hallway,
Sister Katherine and Sister Ruth moved and prayed.
Their numbers had dropped from seven to six,
and the nuns decided the Retreat House would close.
Soon, the chapel and offices would be leveled and replaced with condominiums.
In the halls, the swoosh-snap of duct tape yanked, pulled and cut,
straps tightened, vans bleating, and backing up into the back,
weather reports exchanged with the movers.
Sister Ann told me about herself that final time:
parents dead, alcoholic brother dead,
the brother embarrassed she had been a nun.
She opened her Bible on the shipping box between us,
leaned in, her hearing aids on, her silver crucifix knocking on her chest.
Above her head, a nail where the Emmaus scene had hung.

I asked: "What caused him to remain? 
Why did he want freedom for me?
Sister Ann spoke then of the Gospel of John
and the Samaritan woman at the well, 
the one married nearly as many times as Elizabeth Taylor, 
and how when Christ listened to her she became the first evangelist. 
It was Christ's longest conversation with anyone Sister Ann said.
The Samaritan woman's life changed because Christ listened to her.

John K., from the meetings, dead now too, once said:
"Oh, I knew Durell. He was odd. But we're all odd you know.
All I know now
is the more he loved me the more I loved the world.


                                                    vii
 
I lost track of Sister Ann. 
I have often thought about her and all the time she spent with me.
I have wanted to tell her now for some time
that not long after the cloister closed, Durell's sister located me,
leaving a message on my answering machine,
(it was still the time of answering machines),
inviting me to her winter house in Boynton Beach.

Durell's sister gave me directions. 
She was quite close to me, as it turned out.
She had some of Durell's belongings that she wanted me to have.
"There isn't much, she said. 
"But still, I think you should have what's here.
Durell spoke of his sister often, 
but I did not know his family.
However, when we met, we recognized each other
as one sometimes recognizes what one has never seen before.

I said to her: "He knew me better than anyone.
The sentence surprised us.
We sat by the pool in her gated country club.
The Florida evening was a watercolor in the making,
colors bleeding into striking mistakes.
After all the members withdrew, 
she said, "There are many things you do not know about my brother.
A worker folded terry cloth towels under a bamboo hut.
Her voice halted as voices halt 
when words have been withheld. 
"They called him names, she said, "A nancy boy, a priss, a sissy, a fairy...
The pool's tempos ceased 
until the silence about us was the silence in a palace.

Light disappeared everywhere. 
The sun fell. She looked away,
said that he'd been to the army language school,
learned German and Russian, played the organ in his spare time,
mentioned he'd taken music with Copland at Harvard
(he had received a "gentleman's C'-- 
the "C stood for Copland she said he always said--
which made us laugh and seemed to beckon him to us).
He had hoped for an army career, she went on,
and then she mumbled something about a little German town, 
I think she said it was in Schleswig-Holstein, near Lbeck,
where he was stationed while borders were being redrawn,
the letters stopping, the army, the men, something, the drink...
and then her words fell and sank 
into subtle variations of all that goes unsaid.

We heard the distant sound of a train on its track,
crossing the Florida map going brown then black.
He became difficult, isolated--
she spoke softly then like the penitent.
He was always asking for money.
As his requests persisted she began to screen her calls. 
"It became easier to tell him I had not been home, she said.
His behavior was affecting her marriage.
She chose never to introduce her children to Durell.
Perhaps he had a mental illness, perhaps he invented-- 
perhaps, perhaps, perhaps--
but no, she pressed on, perhaps it was his sexuality, he was too sensitive...
"People can be cruel, she said.
She felt he had never adjusted to cruelty
as if cruelty was something that one needed to adjust to.
Later, he was picked up for charges of soliciting sex.
And the more she told me, the less I knew.
All about us, a stillness began to displace the light
and Durell was there, and no longer there, staining that stillness.
After an estrangement ends there comes a great stillness, 
the greater the estrangement the greater the stillness.
Across the parking lot, a gate rattled.

I told her he often said his life had been a failure,
I tried to convince him otherwise, but he never believed me.
Half a century ago, she broke off contact.
Her protracted estrangement made her look ill.
"Please, please, she said.  
Her voice trailed off,
although what she was pleading for was not clear.
No, no, she did not want her grandchildren to know.
Subtle variations of Florida evening light withdrew with finality.
The pool brightened with moonlight, the color of snow.
The pool was still.
There we were,
a man and a woman sitting in cushioned lounge chairs, 
as if the world would always be an endless pair of separated things.
We did not touch each other.
We were still a long time.





Poem (External Scene)
 

The field blank in snow. But I mean this page.
Now print mars the surface to make surface
Seen. Sheen only error brings. Perfect rage
So the sun rises. Rage is your slow practice
That makes of every day another day
In whose gathering promise the shy sparrows
Shiver instead of sing. I want to go away.
See these footsteps? These black shapes in the snow?
If there is a word for them, it's no word 
I know. Pursuit?, no. Proof?, no. Don't call it fear.
Could I cross this white sheet if I were coward,
Edge to edge, margin to margin, never
Referring to anything outside itself?--
Stop that. Stop pointing to the photo on the shelf.





Poem (Internal Scene)
 

To make beauty out of pain, it damns the eyes--
No, dams the eyes. See how they overflow?
No damns them, damns them, and so they cry.
What shape can I swallow to make me whole?
Baby's bird-shaped block, blue-painted wood
That fits in the bird-hole of the painted wood box?
The skeleton leaf? The skeleton key? Loud
Knock when the shape won't unlock any locks.
I hear it through the static in the baby's room
When the monitor clicks on and off, sound
Of sea-ice cracking against the jagged sea-rocks,
Laughing gull in the gale. What is it dives down
Past sight, down there dark with the other blocks?
It can't be seen, only heard. A kind of curse,
This kind curse. Forgive me. Blessing that hurts.





Blast
 

The holes have
almost left the 
sky and the blanks
the paths--the
patches next to
natural, corroborated
by the incidental
sounds of practical
activities and crows,
themselves exhibiting
many of the earmarks
of the actual. This
must have happened
many times before,
we must suppose.
Almost a pulse
if we could speed
it up: the repeated
seeking of our several
senses toward each
other, fibers trying to
reach across the gap
as fast as possible,
following a blast.





Pinhole
 

We say 
pinhole. 
A pin hole 
of light. We
can't imagine 
how bright 
more of it 
could be, 
the way
this much
defeats night.
It almost
isn't fair,
whoever 
poked this, 
with such 
a small act 
to vanquish
blackness.







Cantata for Lynette Roberts
 

Lynette, the stars are kerned so far apart--
Through a herniated zodiac I almost see your waled skylanes, your shocked Capricorn and Cancer.
In the hundred and two years since you were born, and the sixteen since your heart failed, and the nearly sixty since you gave up poetry, it seems we can't navigate by the same star chart.
I'd like to think we were fated to work the same coracle: you steering with one hand, grasping your corner of the seine while I grasp mine; together sweeping the weirs.

Lynette saw the sky made wide-waled corduroy by the flight paths of fighter jets.
Corde du roi--"Cloth of the king.
("A baseless assertion, states the oed.)
A fireman from the Midlands nfs said the raids on Swansea were worse than on Birmingham, where a ten-year-old Roy Fisher gaped at the garden where his cousins were slaughtered, and later wrote, It was like a burst pod filled with clay.

Last night, Lynette, my son thought he saw his father in the jumbo jet roaring over Cherryhurst: the weather softer, flight paths altered.
Three weeks now his father gone.

                                                                             

Insofar as Moses came to in a coracle, it wasn't a Welsh one-off; it wasn't a hapax of vessels.
Insofar as it's kind of a kiddie boat, not a kayak, not the royal barge the Makah sent William Blake, aka Johnny Depp, with into the northern Pacific; not even the Viking ship, its carved prow like an uncial; insofar as it is calico wrapped up in tar, insofar as it is swaddled willow whippets.

                                                                             

"Pastoral ding-dong is out, Lynette wrote, and no wonder-- bombs hidden on the glossy knolls. 
In the sorrel. 
In the tormentil.
I thought she was perhaps the closest I could get to my grandmother.
While Lynette was writing "Displaced Persons--

                   Neither from the frosted leaf nor from
                   The grey hard ground could they find
                   Relief

--Lydia was migrating, on foot, a thousand miles from Minsk to Hanover through the German lines in a different tongue.
I only have this tongue, so I adopt Lynette's epic as a stand-in.
She slipped back to childhood in Buenos Aires, garrulous in her dying, her children spiriting a Spanish dictionary into the facil with them on visits.
I would see again So Paolo, she wrote (my mother would be reared there): the coffee-colored house with its tarmac roof.
I can imagine myself down the same funnel reverting to Portuguese and the small pure word-hoard shared between child and grandparent: suja, limpo, bom, mau, com fome, cansado.
Porcaria.
Disgraada!
Let my children bring the dictionary too.

Lynette was ardent for penillions, and "experimented with a poem on Rain by using all words which had long thin letters....
Maybe you thrill to such things when English isn't fully naturalized.
Hers was a poetry full of metals and alloys; air raids they were, ear raids...

                                                                             

I'm not so much crusted with parasangs, or dipped in leagues, as fried in miles of a journey resembling the arc between Cleo and asp.
The jacuzzi, on a timer, sank a quarter-hour in froth on a fifty-degree afternoon. 
There were sight lines to windy breakers, heaving palms; we floated like epiphytes grown from pond scum, flowers of the abyss.

The meliorative, moist air was soft around a gigantic neon cross.
And it's true I found it hard to think of you with the hardness I thought of myself.
Since it took hundreds and hundreds of dollars of posters to adorn the walls of that apartment
(Pillsbury dough kitsch; an art deco cigar teetering on a stiletto; a wall plaque of a trilobite fossil; photo of the Sydney Opera House at night; a three-foot geode with its own spotlight on the end of what looked like a colonoscope--)
since it took all that to match the bric-a-brac on the beach, the beach that stretched to fill the picture window, 
I thought it took many waves to round the facts; an asp to soften geometric Cleopatra; and that giant cross was earth's axis extracted--
tendering foliage over all of Florida.

                                                                             

I'm in the backyard weeding cotyledons.
Croton.
It's spring. 
There's larvae noodling in the soil.
"I was rendering a whipping' stitch, Lynette wrote, on a silk-and-georgette petticoat, the utility of which would be tested in Dover, where Keidrych had been called up to man the anti-aircraft guns.
Had his Conscientious Objector status been approved on appeal, no end to their Arcadia.
Dylan read Rabelais, drank with Keidrych; Lynette visited with Caitlin.
Household talk. 
Debts. 
Children. 
Insofar as Croton is rank with cotyledons, insofar as weeding is gleeful, insofar as the seed case still caps their tips, I am revising the look of spring on the face of the village.
Insofar as Moses slips through the reeds in his coracle.
With new beaks scissoring the air.

                                                                             

Lynette's village, Llanybri, is pronounced clan-ubree.
Even the l's turn into c's where modern warfare enters the poem as discord: clinic air. 
St. Cadoc and curlews versus confervoid; cranch-crake versus ceraunic clouds; into Euclidian cubes grid air is planed.
Where did she get the nerve?

I pencil in her age where various dates are given: 32 when she began Gods with Stainless Ears; 36 when she had her first child, 37 when she had the second; 39 or 40 when she divorced.
The nervous breakdown came at 47.
Jehovah's Witness thereafter.
Lynette, if you were here, I'd ask you the one salient question for a woman at the midpoint of life:
How not to harden?

                                                                             

In Little Sparta, Ian Hamilton Finlay made an image of an Oerlikon gun and inscribed:

                                                                     To Apollo: 
                                 His Music                His Missiles                His Muses

Like Lynette he observed the swarm-like behavior of fighter jets.
He saw "flame-bearing honey in the gasoline leaked by immolated warships.
He commemorated the Flower Class Corvette, each a small naval vessel named for a blossom. 
Alyssum.
Loosestrife.
The fragility of men in battle.
The Loosestrife had eight mounts for each two-pound pom-pom anti-aircraft gun.
This was no Arcadian ding-dong either, as the corduroy bridge Finlay built on a stream had a line from Heraclitus on each plank:
That which joins and that which divides is one and the same.
Lynette says: He, of Bethlehem treading a campaign....

                                                                             

It's the nickel in my cheap wedding ring that brings on this rash that starts at the corners of my lips.
The ring bought at age twenty-one, paid for with the tips from Buddy's Crabs and Ribs.
Which I now paint religiously with clear nail polish on the inner band, across the names, the ampersand, where the graving bit exposed the nickel.

                Out of this hard. Out of this sheet of zinc.
                . . .
                We, he and I ran
                On to a steel escalator, the white
                Electric sun drilling down on the cubed ice;
                Our cyanite flesh chilled on aluminum

                Rail.

The tin Madonnas of warplanes, writ small and annular in marriages, hammered out in Lynette's ear raids.

                                                                             

My library is wreathed in double staircases climbing to a glass dome.
I imagine birds trapped at the top, a cucucurrucued curricula, forming and dissolving figures ad hoc.
Insofar that these are books that were ernes, atom-wise, in former eons.

The abbess of Streoneshall, Caedmon's abbess, Hilda, was announced to her mother in a pregnancy dream: "a most valuable jewel delivered from under her garments.
She wrote one of the books in this aerie, this library, wreathed in double staircases; lodged also in subdural interfaces.
Insofar as we're just pre-ceviche, pre-cadavers-reinterpreting-flan, Lynette, let's research articles, with babies at our feet: on Welsh architecture, the potato tax, coracles...
I see you floating out to sea in your coracle, the spirit of the Makah accompanying you as far as the Azores: halfway from a kitchen garden in Llanybri, halfway to a quinta in Buenos Aires.







Leaves
 

He was cleaning leaves for one at a time
was what he needed and a minute before the two
brown poodles walked by he looked at the stripped-down trees
from one more point of view and thought they were
part of a system in which the dappled was foreign
for he had arrived at his own conclusion and that was
for him a relief even if he was separated,
even if  his hands were frozen,
even if the wind knocked him down,
even if his cat went into her helpless mode
inside the green and sheltering Japanese yew tree.





The Name
 

Having outlived Allen I am the one who 
has to suffer New York all by myself and 
eat my soup alone in Poland although
sometimes I sit with Linda he met in Berkeley
or San Francisco when he met Jack, the bread
just coarse enough, the noodles soft but not
thin and wasted, and not too salty the way the
Chinese further down sometimes make them, the
name still on my mind whatever the reason for
mystery, or avoidance, though rat Netanyahu
and pig that swings from a needle or lives in some
huge incubator, they do darkness where there
was light, the name hates them, the name
in hiding, the name with a beard, and Linda she
loves the name though she invokes her Christ
as Jack her lover and tormentor did and
taught her to do though it is too easy, that,
it troubles me but what can I say, what should I
say while we walk north on the right hand side,
past the pork store and the hardware store, me lecturing
on Logos (my God) and what not Hebrews and Greeks
where Allen and I once kissed, Jack in the sun now.





Boonies
 

Where we could be boys together. This region of want:
the campestrial flat. The adolescents roving across the plat.
Come hither. He-of-the-hard would call me hither.

Sheer abdomen, sheer slickensides, the feldspar buttes
that mammillate the valley right where it needs to bust. 

And I could kiss his tits and he could destroy me 
on the inflorescent slopes; in his darkest dingles;
upon the grassland's raffish plaits. And he could roll me
in coyote brush: I who was banished to the barren
could come back into his fold, and I
would let him lay me down on the cold, cold ground.

Clouds, above, lenticular, the spreading fundament, 
a glorious breech among the thunderheads
and in their midst, a great white heron magnifies 
the day. We'd keep together, he and I,
and we'd gain meaning from our boyage; we'd pursue
each other through the crush of darkling rifts.
Climb into each other's precipitous coombes.

Where would it end, this brush and bush, this brome
and blazing star? There is always some new way
to flex a limb and find its secret drupe.

Not only the hope of nature; the nature of hope:

so long as culverts carry us, so long as we stay ripe
to one another's lips, and welcoming to hands,
as long as we extend our spans, to tangle them, 
as spinning insects do their glistered floss.

This is not a time to think the trumpet vine is sullen.
Rather: the trumpet's bell is but a prelude.
It says we all are beautiful at least once.
And, if you'd watch over me, we can be beautiful again.  







Gotham Wanes
 

The mask? Because we were never ugly
enough. Because our ugliness was epic.
Because we were given to it, because 
we were so misgiven. You wear one. I
wear one. Yes. Kings, Pharaohs had them
fabricated, poured out in gold and beaten.
Most wore them to the grave. In Mexico
the living wear them, not to scare the dead
away, but as invitation. They leave candy
on the mounds of those they mourn. New
Orleans? Women wear them in order
to bare everything else. Men wear them
in order to watch. I can remember, back
before it all grows grim, making one
out of the news, trying to paste it together. 
I remember my mother helping me. I don't 
really remember my father. Something
like a face, like the man in the moon.
I understand we're hardwired this way,
to make faces before anything else.
It's why we see the Madonna in mold,
alien architecture in Martian crater creep.
We keep looking for those first faces, first
familia. Every culture, every eon. Witness 
the oldest we know, his cave, his wall, one
hundred seventy centuries gone. They call 
him Sorcerer. They call me Knight.
We have always lived in the dark.





Spent
 

Suffer as in allow.

List as in want.

Listless as in transcending
desire, or not rising
to greet it.

To list
is to lean,
dangerously,
to one side.

Have you forgotten?

Spent
as in exhausted.

What do we like best

You would not say that.

You come to tell me
you're saving money

new bodies for us!








"No longer if well get cancer but when
 

          
          No longer if we'll get cancer but when, the doctor said. Now questions accrete around the irritant like pearl: Not when but how? Not how but whom? And then why. And then why not. I take a can of ashes to the beach and empty them into the wind. Outside the trash man collects bottles like a miser rattling his jewels, tossing them onto the growing heap.
        




"The pond is sheathed in ice
 

          
          The pond is sheathed in ice, a duck troubles the reeds, the air around us still enough to hear the baby stir, but we don't know where it is yet. By the force of our longing it is getting made for us, as thrilled people, palms full of seed, long for the chickadees to light, and they do. Light.
        




"I came upon the gnawed torso of a seal
 

          
          I came upon the gnawed torso of a seal, silver fur agleam against the sand like a coin thrown down in a losing bet. What left this bounty of meat on the beach to rot? I watched the neighbor's small boys skirt the dead seal the way sandpipers tease themselves in the surf, dodging up and back along the body's shore. "It's dead, I told their father as he ambled behind them up the beach. He called to the little boys, his voice borne toward them on the mild breeze. "Boys, come back, he said, and they did not.
        




"I used to love the run-up to a storm
 

          
          I used to love the run-up to a storm, watching from the porch as the grown-ups hurried to bring things in, my mother rummaging through drawers for a flashlight, cursing: nothing was where it was supposed to be in our house. It can't be so, but the only people I ever remember huddled in the basement were my mother and me, suspended in that eerie half-light like bats. We've just spent a week like this, my mother perched in a chair above the water keeping watch for the next bad thing. We were happy so sometimes she'd let the vigil rest, the sentry of her shoulders easing to a more receptive pose, a quarter moon, until something called her back to the watch, mother first no longer but this white, foremost light. You can read by it. You can see.
        




A Certain Kind of Eden
 

It seems like you could, but
you can't go back and pull
the roots and runners and replant.
It's all too deep for that.
You've overprized intention,
have mistaken any bent you're given
for control. You thought you chose
the bean and chose the soil.
You even thought you abandoned
one or two gardens. But those things
keep growing where we put them--
if we put them at all.
A certain kind of Eden holds us thrall.
Even the one vine that tendrils out alone
in time turns on its own impulse,
twisting back down its upward course
a strong and then a stronger rope,
the greenest saddest strongest
kind of hope.





Ice Men
 

One cuts blocks
From the abundant river,
Hauls them house to house.
 
One falls, unseen,
The heart
Inoculated cold
 
Against a sky still moving.
Moving even now
Above the river,
The canal.
Willows shimmering
 
Across the water,
Muskrats diving out of reach.
The river whispers
Till it freezes--
 
A body
Twirling sluggishly
Beneath the surface as again
 
One stack, then
Spreads the straw.
 
Another falters,
Slips, or
Puts a sliver on your tongue
To feel it melting there--
The ice-lit
 
Underworld
Of someone else.





Buried Life
 

Imagine cities you've
Inhabited, streets
Paved in lava stone.
You never intended to pray
 
In the temples, had
Nothing to sell.
Now imagine yourself
 
Returning to those same cities.
Hunt for people you knew,
Knock on their doors.
Ask yourself
 
Where are the vases, animals
Etched in gold?
Where are the wines
 
From distant places,
Banquets ferreted
From the bowels of the earth?
While you were missing
 
Other people wore
Your garments,
Slept in your bed.
 
How frightening
The man who said
In his affliction
 
Wood has hope.
Cut down
It will flourish.
 
If the root grows old
And the trunk withers
In dust, at the scent of water
It will germinate.





Second Life
 

Accompanied
To the Campi Flegrei
By a shadow,
 
She listened to voices rise
From the darkness,
Then recede.
 
Instruments
Sustained them.
When one had finished
 
Others played.
False proportions
Sung boldly.
 
Rain on the roof tiles.
O selve, o campi.





Back to Country with Pulitzer
 

I left here at eight
And returned at 75.
In between
 
I largely wasted America.
I married, had children,
Distinguished myself in a profession
 
Full of fools, becoming one myself,
As is the way
Of this (or, I suppose, of any other) world.
 
I missed
The Nobel but I did bring down
The Pulitzer. The weather,
 
The politics, the stars,
And my own small contribution
All lined up, and I got one.
 
So "Pulitzer became my middle name
Before I came here, where no one cares
A whit about such things.
 
I failed at love.
That's where I truly fucked up.
I couldn't.
 
The women in this town
Are mostly severe, resentful
--The men bitter, disappointed:
 
A perfect place for my purposes.
I stay in a room
In the house of an old woman
 
Who doesn't want to have sex any more
And neither do I
So we do not
 
Trouble each other on that front,
Which is good.
I do like to drink.
 
I used to love to eat
But then I don't much
Give a shit
 
About any of that now.
The old woman sometimes says wistfully
God will soon be calling both of us
 
Back home, but as an agnostic
I don't believe that.
As an American,
 
I don't buy that.
I came here to retire from love,
To face my failure to love
 
As I attempted to face everything
Else before, and that
Is exactly what I am doing and doing
 
With the exactness I used to put into
My work, for which I received the Pulitzer.
I hate a coward.
 
My son
Came here the other day and asked
Exactly when I might
 
Be coming back
And I sent him off without an answer.
The answer
 
Seems to be staying here,
Staying honestly here and coming to terms
With my greatest single failure.
 
My wife is dead. To me,
It seems I am left over
To eat a shit sandwich.
 
"Eat me, the world says,
Now that I have lost my appetite.
We used to say, "Eat me
To each other in high school,
Another thing from which no one
Ever recovers. America likes to think
 
Every one can recover from every thing,
But about this,
Especially, America is wrong.





Mental Mommy
 

Home from school at six years old, first grade,
And uncle there to tell me Mommy
Gone, Mommy not be coming back any
 
Time soon, Liam, Mommy had to go to
Mental hospital. Nervous breakdown.
Years later Mommy, when she gets out
 
Of mental, often says, "If you're
A bad boy for me Liam you're
Going to send me back, back
 
Into mental hospital, like you did
First time. At 13
I find out Mom had been doing years
 
In a federal prison all that time,
For stealing, so no mental hospital for
Mommy. Breakdown ours alone.
 
I was on my one.





Soon the City
 

Soon the summer
Now the pleasant purgatory
Of spring is over,
 
Soon the choking
Humidity
In the city
 
On the fire escapes
In a sleeveless T-shirt
Smoking a cigar
 
In tune with the tremor
Of the mindless yellow
Commercial traffic
 
Moving in the city,
Where no one really
Buys a car,
 
American
Or otherwise,
Where we will,
 
As Rilke said we would
Where we will
Wake, read, write
 
Long letters
And in the avenues
Wander restlessly
 
To and fro
On foot in
The humidity,
 
Where soon I'll shower, dress,
Take the dog out for a piss,
And mail this.





Time in a Brown House
 

Sam paused on the stairs. He had forgotten a thing.
In Leland's room a copy of Thomas Merton lay on the floor.
The air was full of gnats of possibility. What was the story?
Sam looked at the clock twice. The day was dropping
softly away while Sam's sneakers made the wood stairs creak.
The wood was sure it was wood. Alice got home from the store.
The bags had to be unloaded as the day went and went.
Then the sundown kitchen grew quiet.
Sam crossed his legs one way, then the other way. He had chosen
purple corduroys. They were pants of the day; one possibility.
On the tilted table sat the damaged typewriter.
What about Thomas Merton? Did he know the central story?
Someone was quietly reading by the fireplace but not Sam.
Next day there was badminton with the troubled carpenter
and the story of an awful egg salad, causing laughter;
but Sam had forgotten some thing. Then Alice brought in
the brownies and minor pleasure colored the house
 
and there went the evening. J.J. came downstairs
all gleamy from her bath. She had three reasons to get downtown fast.
Sam picked up a novel by Sukenick. The clue must be nearby.
Between Sam and the page swarmed the gnats of possibility.
Leland stowed his bicycle in the basement and came upstairs
with a point about capitalism. Look at the time said someone.
Where was J.J. now? Where was the story? Under the red chair
lay the newspaper whose relevance was all mystery or
not mystery enough. Then Alice went out to see a movie.
Some man meets some woman with big eyes on a jet
and changes his whole life for her, disastrously but thrillingly.
Alice told about it briefly, and went to make tea. Sam paused
on the hard wooden stairs. J.J. was gone. She was gone.
Leland was eating yogurt at midnight. The whole brown house
was floating, gliding very smoothly for some reason
with Sam not clear whether the gliding was a story
and if so was it central and was it his?





Poetry Failure
 

For example, I wrote my first poem in 1976 about being in the Vermont house
after my mother's death; she died the year before;
she loved that house. My father said he kept having moments
of thinking she must have just stepped outside for a minute
to weed the garden or to walk just a little way
along Prospect Street, for a few minutes only and now
almost now she'd be coming back, we'd hear the screen door,
Bev would be back and saying something casual about--
 
about the cats, Daphne and Chloe, or about Mrs. Yamokofsky next door
or about the pear tree, "or a colored stone she found.
That was the phrase that ended my poem in 1976:
"or a colored stone she found. The phrase rang slightly false
but I wanted it--the "ound and "one sounds sounded profound
and in 1976 "stone was still a word guaranteed poetic.
But did my mother ever pick up colorful stones?
Wasn't that more something I did fifteen years earlier?
In the poem I was trying to turn my ironic mother into
an ideal figure certified sweet like a child.
 
But what could I make her say? Something very sly and wry?
The poetry would be in her voice, the way of her voice being
hers--voice of my mother--whether the words were about
the cats or Mrs. Yamokofsky or potatoes to peel for mashing.
Not your mother. My mother. Poetry of her
saying in her Bev way "those potatoes or "Mrs. Yamokovsky
or "Daphne's gone down by the Black River
but if we feed Chloe I'm sure she'll be back.
And my father and Kimbo and me just going "Yeah or "In a minute
because this was all just life.





Divorced Fathers and Pizza Crusts
 

The connection between divorced fathers and pizza crusts
is understandable. The divorced father does not cook
confidently. He wants his kid to enjoy dinner.
The entire weekend is supposed to be fun. Kids love
pizza. For some reason involving soft warmth and malleability
 
kids approve of melted cheese on pizza
years before they will tolerate cheese in other situations.
So the divorced father takes the kid and the kid's friend
out for pizza. The kids eat much faster than the dad.
Before the dad has finished his second slice,
 
the kids are playing a video game or being Ace Ventura
or blowing spitballs through straws, making this hail
that can't quite be cleaned up. There are four slices left
and the divorced father doesn't want them wasted,
there has been enough waste already; he sits there
 
in his windbreaker finishing the pizza. It's good
except the crust is actually not so great--
after the second slice the crust is basically a chore--
so you leave it. You move on to the next loaded slice.
Finally there you are amid rims of crust.
 
All this is understandable. There's no dark conspiracy.
Meanwhile the kids are having a pretty good time
which is the whole point. So the entire evening makes
clear sense. Now the divorced father gathers
the sauce-stained napkins for the trash and dumps them
 
and dumps the rims of crust which are not
corpses on a battlefield. Understandability
fills the pizza shop so thoroughly there's no room
for anything else. Now he's at the door summoning the kids
and they follow, of course they do, he's a dad.





The Missing Poem
 

It would have been dark but not lugubrious. It would have been
fairly short but not slight. It would have contained a child
saying something inadvertently funny that was not said by my daughter,
something strangely like what your daughter or sister said once
if you could remember. The child's voice flies across
a small parking lot where, in one of the cars,
a man and a woman sit listening to the silence between them.
The child's voice probably hurts them momentarily
with a sense of beauty apparently very possible
yet somehow out of reach. In the missing poem this is
implied, conveyed, transmitted without being flatly said.
And it does a dissolve into the look of a soccer field
after a game--the last three or four players walk
slowly away, their shin-guards muddy, their cleats caked,
one player dragging a net bag full of soccer balls--
the players seem to have known what it was all for
yet now they look somehow depleted and aimless there
at the field's far end; and a block away on a wood-grainy porch
the eyes of a thin woman sixty-three years old search the shadows
in each passing car, as the poem recalls what she wants to recall.
Hours later the field is dark
 
and the hills are dark and later even Firehouse Pizza has closed.
In the missing poem all this pools into a sense of how much
we must cherish life; the world will not do it for us.
This idea, though, in the missing poem is not smarmy.
Remember when you got the news of the accident--
or the illness--in the life of someone
more laced into your life than you might have thought;
the cool flash of what serious is. Well,
the missing poem brings that. Meanwhile not seeming like
an imitation of Mark Strand or Mark Doty or Mark Jarman!
Yet not like just another Halliday thing either.
Instead it would feel like a new dimension of the world,
the real world we imagine. With lightness!
With weight and lightness and, on the hypothetical radio,
that certain song you almost forgot to love.





The Halls
 

Five more books in a box to be carried out to the car;
your office door closes behind you and at that moment
you turn invisible--not even a ghost in that hall
from the hall's point of view.
If the halls don't know you, the halls and the rooms
of the buildings where you worked for seven years--
if the halls don't know you,
                                                               and they don't--
some new woman or two new men come clattering
down these halls in the month after your departure, indeed
just two days after you left forever
they come clattering with ideas about
the relation between mind and body or will and fate
filled with hormones of being the chosen workers here
and they feel as if the halls and rooms begin to recognize them,
accept them, as if there is a belonging in the world--
 
but these new workers are wrong, the halls don't know
who is working under the unobtrusive fluorescent panels:
 
this is appalling and for a minute you are appalled
though your being so now is not an event
in the life of your new rented house or even
your new condominium . . .
So if they don't, if they don't know you,
the halls, the walls, the fixtures,
then what? Then there is for you
no home in that rock, no home in the mere rock of
where you work, where you briskly walk, not even
in the bed where your body sleeps alone or not--
 
so if there is to be a place for you, for you
it must not be located in plaster and tile and space,
it will have to be in that other house,
the one whose door you felt opening just last night
when you dialed from memory and your friend picked up the phone.





Pasco, Barbara
 

I find I am descending in a propeller plane upon Pasco
in the state of Washington. I accept this;
I have reasons for participating in the experiential sequence
that has brought me here. Down below the land is printed
with huge circles, doubtless an irrigation system,
doubtless it makes sense. There are people who understand it
living with dignity in square houses
and the result possibly is one billion radishes.
Now some so-called time has passed. This nation
is a huge nation in which the infinity of for example
Washington State
is just one segment of an even less thinkable hugeness
and yet zim zim zim zim United Airlines has me
here in my Eastern metropolis
with its ten thousand makers of third-rate pizza
uncannily far from the possible radishes of Washington State.
The taxi driver experiments with narrow streets
to shorten our detour caused by sports fans and he says
the Eagles will out-tough the Steelers.
I defer to his judgment, I am conserving my powers.
After "a while I have this unsettlingly smooth tuna salad
with a pale pickle
in a drugstore designed by Dwight D. Eisenhower,
reading a few poems by David Rivard. I have thoughts.
I have my Uncle Ralph's jacket soft and droopy giving me
a Sense of the Past. The rain out there
on the roofs of retail outlets is saying No Guarantee
and in a way I am nowhere, in another way maybe
definitely not. In a wide wet parking lot
I turn back toward the store to explain to the cashier
that she charged me for six cans of seltzer when in fact
I only had one from a six-pack
but the idea of justice seems so fatiguing
I would rather read a surprisingly serious detective novel
so I vibrate with indecision in the parking lot
till all the car windows rattle imperceptibly. Then
an alleged interval ostensibly intervenes, at the mall
a woman at a piano has played 1800 songs from memory
according to the radio personality who stands with a mike
explaining her bid for the Guinness Book of Records.
I am walking away at an unplanned angle singing "Tiny Montgomery
which I bet she wouldn't have been ready to play.
I have this inner life, I think of my father
lonely in Vermont, I think of myself lonely in Syracuse
and my old poem about a detective who can't solve his biggest case
and as a result I have feelings--but my teacher said
the future of American poetry can't be merely
the notation of sensibility. When he said that I felt
a chilly fear at the edge of consc-consc-consc-consciousness
like an ice cube in the corner of my stomach.
That's how I felt. So then, so then consequently
I thought "I must gather up some serious ideas but then
Ashberry phoned and left a message after the beep.
"Don't be a sucker, ideas are where it isn't.
This made my throat get sort of dry so I drank a Classic Coke
and then another Classic Coke two hours later
as time so-to-say passed. What was always there?
Texture, that's what, how it was/is, the how of how;
when I pick up my color prints at the camera shop
the disappointment I always feel is actually a blessing
is it not? I can say "I'll go along with this charade
until I can think my way out even though I'll never
think my way out. I've come this far;
that day in 1971 I hitchhiked all the way to Montpelier
didn't I? And here I am.
Suddenly I have a son
who focuses with tremendous insistence upon
dogs, balloons, air conditioners, hats, clocks, and noses.
To him I convey that the world is okay:
life is good: we accept it. Your dad is a little mixed up
but your shoes got tied, right?
As Barbara Cohen in high school said about politics
it's interesting, giving the word four earnest syllables,
in-ter-est-ing.





Bad People
 

The guys who drank quarts of Busch last night
here by the backstop of this baseball diamond
had names given them by their mothers and fathers--
"Jack and "Kenny let us say.
 
Jack might be
a skinny guy in a black fake-leather jacket,
he's twenty-five, his gray pants are too loose on his hips,
his jaws always have these little black extra hairs,
his mother won't talk to him on the phone,
she lives on french fries and ketchup,
he hasn't been able to send her any cash
in the last two years, ever since he lost
his job unloading produce trucks at Pathmark;
Jack's father disappeared when he was ten.
"No big deal, Jack says, "he was a bastard anyway,
he used to flatten beer cans on the top of my head.
Kenny offers a laugh-noise. He's heard all that before.
Kenny is forty-eight, a flabby man with reddened skin,
he is employed at the Italian Market selling fish
just four hours a day but his shirts hold the smell;
his female companion Deena left him a note last month:
"You owe me $12 chocolate $31 wine $55 cable TV plus
donuts--I have had it--taking lamp and mirror
they are mine. Kenny hasn't seen her since.
He hangs with Jack because Jack talks loud
as if the world of cops and people with full-time jobs
could be kept at bay by talking, talking loud . . .
 
(I'm talking gently and imaginatively here
as if the world of bums and jerks could be kept far off--)
 
Jack and Kenny. (Or two other guys dark to me with wounds
oozing in Philadelphia ways less ready to narrate.)
Last night at midnight they got cheesesteaks at Casseloni's
and bought four quarts at the Fireside Tavern
and wandered into this park. After one quart of Busch
Jack said he was Lenny Dykstra
and found a stick for his bat. "Pitch to me asshole he said
so Kenny went to the mound and pitched his bottle
for want of anything better and Jack swung in the dark and missed;
Kenny's bottle smashed on home plate and Jack heard in the sound
the absurdity of all his desiring since seventh grade,
absurdity of a skinny guy who blew everything since seventh
when he hit home runs and chased Joan Rundle around the gym
so Jack took his own empty bottle and smashed it down
amid the brown shards of Kenny's bottle.
Then they leaned on the backstop to drink the other two quarts
and they both grew glum and silent
and when they smashed these bottles it was like
what else would they do? Next morning
 
Nick and I come to the park with a rubber ball
and a miniature bat. Nick is not quite three
but he knows the names of all the Phillies starters
and he knows the area around home plate is not supposed to be
covered with jagged pieces of brown glass. Like a good dad
I warn him not to touch it and we decide to establish
a new home plate closer to the mound (there's no trash can
handy). "Who put that glass there? Nick wants to know
and to make a long story short I say "Bad People.
Nick says "Bad? How come?





La Tuvera or An Earrings Lament
 

En Cuba tuve--
 
I'm tired of hearing your complaints.
All that whining about el exilio, the tragedy of loss,
 
In Cuba I had--
 
the catalogue of things, the status, the riches,
the opulence of it all.
 
I had a mate. We were a pair. Our mistress was young. We
were young. We would dangle on her ear
 
Concentrate on what you have.
Forget the past.
 
and go out on the town. Mojitos at La Floridita,
dancing at the Tropicana and later
 
No, don't tell me about later.
 
in the jewel case, an aqua Tiffany box
with white satin interior, we
 
Tiffany's? From New York? I didn't know you--
 
would lie together in the pillowy luxury,
my ruby top layer and his aligned, our bases
 
Please you needn't--
 
touching, my diamond waist and his forming a continuous
line. Sometimes we would switch backs, I'd push
 
I understand that in communities of exile
the population
 
my piercing needle through his back, his
through mine. That's
 
tends to lose ground politically as
assimilation takes place, that
 
how I liked it best, a little harsh, but sweet.
Tu y yo, you and I, is what she called us because our very
 
longing is a constitutive ingredient
of not only the condition of exile but--
 
body parts were paired, he and I, forming a single unit, an I and a
thou. Apart
 
Surely you have adjusted. Look, you're mounted on a ring, you
are independent, and prized. Very attractive for your age, I might add.
 
we are nothing. Longing doesn't quite--
 
One adapts?
 
As to an amputation.
 
And La Revolucin?
 
Don't make me vomit.





Playa Colorada
 

It was a beach
like all beaches, only perhaps more beautiful.
And the sand was pink not red.
 
We would arrive in caravans,
hampers overflowing with food and drink
like Aziz and his party on the way to Malabar.
 
The colonials and their servants away on an outing.
We would stop under thatch umbrellas,
towels and tablecloths spread out against the sea.
 
My mother in her skirted swim suit
surrounded by fathers of other children,
her olive skin lit through her straw hat.
 
They would laugh and drink beer
and leer
while the children did the usual beach things,
 
boring futile tunnels to China, running
at waves and then away,
daring each other to be swallowed.
 
I would go out by the forbidden rocks and pick off oysters,
then give them to the men to pry open,
cover with lime juice and suck dry.
 
Once, I saw my mother sucking
an oyster out of another daddy's hand.
Her dappled face bobbed and smiled and her tongue
 
searched the shell for pearls.





Agony in the Garden
 

At supper he whispers something in your ear,
the Judas boy, who wants you.
 
We go to the garden where it's cool
and wait.
 
From my place against the tree
I see you through the window,
 
watch as you walk from door to desk,
reach into your pocket,
 
pull out your wallet, empty it and leave it by the lamp,
pick up a pen, lean over to write, then don't,
 
take something heavy from the drawer, put it back
then sweep the money into a paper bag.
 
You walk from desk to door and out, your hand
reaching back to put out the light.
 
On the security film you leave the building
alone, holding the heavy bag.
 
Off camera you walk towards the Charles, leave
your saddle shoes under the pedestrian bridge.
 
We wait in the garden.
And wait.
 
We don't know yet whom you meet or why.
 We don't know yet that the river has claimed you.





Queen Christina
 

To celebrate his final Pride, in June,
my friend, lymphatic, thin, and in distress,
managed to dress in drag. He shot the moon:
outstretched, he'd used his dying to think--obsess--
 
about the Prada pumps, their skin a snake;
the heavy pantyhose, two pair; the moot
but lacy underthings; the makeup, cake,
to overlay his pain. I called him beaut-
 
i-ful; he said he felt like Greta Garbo
in Queen Christina (our campy interplay);
I countered that he looked more like a hobo-
sexual in heels. We howled. That day,
 
we never left his Castro flat. His rhinestone
glittered, and everywhere, the smell of cologne.





Politics
 

This is what he dreams of:
a map of burned land,
a mound of dirt
in the early century's winter.
 
A map of burned land?
A country is razed
in the early century's winter.
And God descends.
 
A country is raised
because of industry.
And God descends,
messengers rush inside
 
because of industry,
in spite of diplomats.
Messengers rush inside
to haunt the darkened aisles.
 
In spite of diplomats,
the witnesses know well
to haunt the darkened aisles,
experimentally--
 
the witnesses know well
that ushers dressed in black
experimentally
lurk by the cushioned seats.
 
That ushers dress in black
should tell you something:
lurking by the cushioned seats,
the saved and the terrible.
 
I should tell you something:
this is what he dreams of,
the saved and the terrible--
a mound of dirt.





The Mortician in San Francisco
 

This may sound queer,
but in 1985 I held the delicate hands
of Dan White:
I prepared him for burial; by then, Harvey Milk
was made monument--no, myth--by the years
since he was shot.
 
I remember when Harvey was shot:
twenty, and I knew I was queer.
Those were the years,
Levi's and leather jackets holding hands
on Castro Street, cheering for Harvey Milk--
elected on the same day as Dan White.
 
I often wonder about Supervisor White,
who fatally shot
Mayor Moscone and Supervisor Milk,
who was one of us, a Castro queer.
May 21, 1979: a jury hands
down the sentence, seven years--
 
in truth, five years--
for ex-cop, ex-fireman Dan White,
for the blood on his hands;
when he confessed that he had shot
the mayor and the queer,
a few men in blue cheered. And Harvey Milk?
 
Why cry over spilled milk,
some wondered, semi-privately, for years--
it meant "one less queer.
The jurors turned to White.
If just the mayor had been shot,
Dan might have had trouble on his hands--
 
but the twelve who held his life in their hands
maybe didn't mind the death of Harvey Milk;
maybe, the second murder offered him a shot
at serving only a few years.
In the end, he committed suicide, this Dan White.
And he was made presentable by a queer.





The End of Landscape
 

There's a certain sadness to this body of water
adjacent to the runway, its reeds and weeds,
handful of ducks, the water color
 
manmade. A still life. And still
life's a cold exercise in looking back,
back to Florida, craning my neck
 
like a sandhill crane in Alachua Basin.
As for the scrub oaks,
the hot wind in the leaves was language,
 
Spanish moss--dusky, parasitic--
an obsession: I wanted to live in it.
(One professor in exile did,
 
covered himself in the stuff as a joke--
then spent a week removing mites.) That's
enough. The fields of rushes lay filled
 
with water, and I said farewell,
my high ship an old, red Volvo DL,
gone to another coast, another peninsula,
 
one without sleep or amphibious music.
Tonight, in flight from San Francisco--
because everything is truer at a remove--
 
I watch the man I love watch
the turn of the Sacramento River, then Sacramento,
lit city of legislation and flat land.
 
I think of Florida, how flat.
I think of forgetting Florida.
And then the landscape grows black.





Breakfast with Thom Gunn
 

in memory, 1929-2004
We choose a cheap hotel
because they're serving drinks.
We drink. I hear him tell
a tale or two: he thinks
 
that so-and-so's a sleaze;
and then there was the time
that Milosz phoned, oh please.
Another gin with lime?
 
I want to say that once,
I saw him dressed in leather,
leaning on a fence
inside a bar. Rather,
 
walking to the N,
I gush about his books;
he gives his change to men
who've lost their homes and looks:
 
how like him, I've been told.
Our day together done,
I hug him in the cold.
And then the train is gone.





Anonymous Lyric
 

It was the summer of 1976 when I saw the moon fall down.
 
It broke like a hen's egg on the sidewalk.
 
The garden roiled with weeds, hummed with gnats who settled clouds on my
 
oblivious siblings.
 
A great hunger insatiate to find / A dulcet ill, an evil sweetness blind.
 
A gush of yolk and then darker.
 
Somewhere a streetlamp disclosed the insides of a Chevy Impala--vinyl seats, the rear- view,
 
headrests and you, your hand through your hair.
 
An indistinguishable burning, failing bliss.
 
Because the earth's core was cooling, all animals felt the urge to wander.
 
Wash down this whisper of you, the terrible must.
 
Maybe the core wasn't cooling, but I felt a coolness in my mother.
 
That girl was shining me on.
 
In blue crayon, the bug-bitten siblings printed lyrics on the walls of my room.
 
I wrote the word LAVA on my jeans.
 
It must be the Night Fever, I sang with the 8-track.
 
But the moon had not broken on the sidewalk, the moon
 
was hot, bright as a teakettle whistling outside my door,
 
tied up in sorrow, lost in my song, if you don't come back . . .
 
and that serious night cooled, settling like sugar on our lawn.
 
I wrote the word SUGAR on my palms.
 
I shall say what inordinate love is.
 
The moon rose itself up on its elbows and shook out its long hair.





To Ireland, To Bethlehem
 

The plane is packed and over sweaty heads,
                         rumpled hair, the movie glows in the transatlantic nighttime
            murmur of priests and nuns and Riverdancers returning
 
home--a baby is cooed by an older mother, a boy feels
                          for his seat in the dark. I've read my books
            already, 2 days traveling, the difficulties
 
technical. I hate that money, says the priest beside me,
                           and he orders another scotch, his third.
            The Feast of the Epiphany tomorrow, he studies religious 
 
journals for a message, writes in a notebook
                            impossibly small. We are having problems
            with sound, the flight attendant announces,
 
it is not your headset, and so the oceans swell in silence,
                            bright blue tumbles across the screen mutely, foam
            collapsing over a tiny nimble figure
 
but she darts through to a green glow,
                            sunshine through a veil of wave, her surfboard tense between
            her feet and the world's largest ocean. Her ride
 
is long, impossibly long--her hips stay low, a friend
                              drops onto her wave and, together, they glide towards the shore.
             No music. Just water and that blue. I check the SkyMall catalogue
 
for something I might need and didn't know. There are
                              reasons I am flying over the ocean, reasons I
              I wish I were sure of. Someday I might say, yes, I chose
 
him, and it wasn't wise. Or maybe we'll be old and
                          surrounded by our own. The screen flashes;
              the surf is wild, but the bright sky makes me whisper,
 
Hawaii, where nothing could be that beautiful
                          but is. The waves are bigger and she sets out, flowered
               bikini, hair pulled back in a serious bun.
 
But too soon she's underwater, arms above her head,
                           spinning down into a champagne sea.
              The priest asks would I like some English chocolate. I say no
 
at first then say yes. I say,
                             how many Euros for the scotch? The baby Jesus
               is about to be adored by black men, foreign kings, in
 
fact, tomorrow. They're stumbling, the Magi,
                         12 days across an ocean and through the desert.
                It's hot so they must travel at night--
 
who wouldn't? And there was that star, sudden and perhaps a sign.
                          We've already tried to get there once,
                I want to say to the kings. It's cool in this 747,
 
which later the pilot will land with only one engine.
                          A problem with
                compressors. But what a sweet,
 
sweet ocean, and those few younger girls
                         who try to ride it. And what a night,
                warmed by the sun-shocked smell
 
of saddle and sweat, the strong breath of camels.
                          What carved, fragrant trunkfuls
                born across deserts and ready to be opened before an infant god.





Moonlight
 

Your soul is like a landscape fantasy,
Where masks and Bergamasks, in charming wise,
Strum lutes and dance, just a bit sad to be
Hidden beneath their fanciful disguise.
 
Singing in minor mode of life's largesse
And all-victorious love, they yet seem quite
Reluctant to believe their happiness,
And their song mingles with the pale moonlight,
 
The calm, pale moonlight, whose sad beauty, beaming,
Sets the birds softly dreaming in the trees,
And makes the marbled fountains, gushing, streaming--
Slender jet-fountains--sob their ecstasies.





Innocents We
 

Their long skirts and high heels battled away:
Depending on the ground's and breezes' whim,
At times some stocking shone, low on the limb--
Too soon concealed!--tickling our navet.
 
At times, as well, an envious bug would bite
Our lovelies' necks beneath the boughs, and we
Would glimpse a flash--white flash, ah! ecstasy!--
And glut our mad young eyes on sheer delight.
 
Evening would fall, the autumn day would draw
To its uncertain close: our belles would cling
Dreamingly to us, cooing, whispering
Lies that still set our souls trembling with awe.





In Muted Tone
 

Gently, let us steep our love
In the silence deep, as thus,
Branches arching high above
Twine their shadows over us.
 
Let us blend our souls as one,
Hearts' and senses' ecstasies,
Evergreen, in unison
With the pines' vague lethargies.
 
Dim your eyes and, heart at rest,
Freed from all futile endeavor,
Arms crossed on your slumbering breast,
Banish vain desire forever.
 
Let us yield then, you and I,
To the waftings, calm and sweet,
As their breeze-blown lullaby
Sways the gold grass at your feet.
 
And, when night begins to fall
From the black oaks, darkening,
In the nightingale's soft call
Our despair will, solemn, sing.





Ars Poetica
 

for Charles Morice
Music first and foremost! In your verse,
Choose those meters odd of syllable,
Supple in the air, vague, flexible,
Free of pounding beat, heavy or terse.
 
Choose the words you use--now right, now wrong--
With abandon: when the poet's vision
Couples the Precise with Imprecision,
Best the giddy shadows of his song:
 
Eyes veiled, hidden, dark with mystery,
Sunshine trembling in the noonday glare,
Starlight, in the tepid autumn air,
Shimmering in night-blue filigree!
 
For Nuance, not Color absolute,
Is your goal; subtle and shaded hue!
Nuance! It alone is what lets you
Marry dream to dream, and horn to flute!
 
Shun all cruel and ruthless Railleries;
Hurtful Quip, lewd Laughter, that appall
Heaven, Azure-eyed, to tears; and all
Garlic-stench scullery recipes!
 
Take vain Eloquence and wring its neck!
Best you keep your Rhyme sober and sound,
Lest it wander, reinless and unbound--
How far? Who can say?--if not in check!
 
Rhyme! Who will its infamies revile?
What deaf child, what Black of little wit
Forged with worthless bauble, fashioned it
False and hollow-sounding to the file?
 
Music first and foremost, and forever!
Let your verse be what goes soaring, sighing,
Set free, fleeing from the soul gone flying
Off to other skies and loves, wherever.
 
Let your verse be aimless chance, delighting
In good-omened fortune, sprinkled over
Dawn's wind, bristling scents of mint, thyme, clover . . .
All the rest is nothing more than writing.





Last Hope
 

Beside a humble stone, a tree
Floats in the cemetery's air,
Not planted in memoriam there,
But growing wild, uncultured, free.
 
A bird comes perching there to sing,
Winter and summer, proffering
Its faithful song--sad, bittersweet.
That tree, that bird are you and I:
 
You, memory; absence, me, that tide
And time record. Ah, by your side
To live again, undying! Aye,
 
To live again! But ma petite,
Now nothingness, cold, owns my flesh. . .
Will your love keep my memory fresh?





The Drunken Boat
 

As I was going down impassive Rivers,
I no longer felt myself guided by haulers:
Yelping redskins had taken them as targets
And had nailed them naked to colored stakes.
 
I was indifferent to all crews,
The bearer of Flemish wheat or English cottons
When with my haulers this uproar stopped
The Rivers let me go where I wanted.
 
Into the furious lashing of the tides
More heedless than children's brains the other winter
I ran! And loosened Peninsulas
Have not undergone a more triumphant hubbub
 
The storm blessed my sea vigils
Lighter than a cork I danced on the waves
That are called eternal rollers of victims,
Ten nights, without missing the stupid eye of the lighthouses!
 
Sweeter than the flesh of hard apples is to children
The green water penetrated my hull of fir
And washed me of spots of blue wine
And vomit, scattering rudder and grappling-hook
 
And from then on I bathed in the Poem
Of the Sea, infused with stars and lactescent,
Devouring the azure verses; where, like a pale elated
Piece of flotsam, a pensive drowned figure sometimes sinks;
 
Where, suddenly dyeing the blueness, delirium
And slow rhythms under the streaking of daylight,
Stronger than alcohol, vaster than our lyres,
The bitter redness of love ferments!
 
I know the skies bursting with lightning, and the waterspouts
And the surf and the currents; I know the evening,
And dawn as exalted as a flock of doves
And at times I have seen what man thought he saw!
 
I have seen the low sun spotted with mystic horrors,
Lighting up, with long violet clots,
Resembling actors of very ancient dramas,
The waves rolling far off their quivering of shutters!
 
I have dreamed of the green night with dazzled snows
A kiss slowly rising to the eyes of the sea,
The circulation of unknown saps,
And the yellow and blue awakening of singing phosphorous!
 
I followed during pregnant months the swell,
Like hysterical cows, in its assault on the reefs,
Without dreaming that the luminous feet of the Marys
Could constrain the snout of the wheezing Oceans!
 
I struck against, you know, unbelievable Floridas
Mingling with flowers panthers' eyes and human
Skin! Rainbows stretched like bridal reins
Under the horizon of the seas to greenish herds!
 
I have seen enormous swamps ferment, fish-traps
Where a whole Leviathan rots in the rushes!
Avalanches of water in the midst of a calm,
And the distances cataracting toward the abyss!
 
Glaciers, suns of silver, nacreous waves, skies of embers!
Hideous strands at the end of brown gulfs
Where giant serpents devoured by bedbugs
Fall down from gnarled trees with black scent!
 
I should have liked to show children those sunfish
Of the blue wave, the fish of gold, the singing fish.
--Foam of flowers rocked my drifting
And ineffable winds winged me at times.
 
At times a martyr weary of poles and zones,
The sea, whose sob created my gentle roll,
Brought up to me her dark flowers with yellow suckers
And I remained, like a woman on her knees...
 
Resembling an island tossing on my sides the quarrels
And droppings of noisy birds with yellow eyes
And I sailed on, when through my fragile ropes
Drowned men sank backward to sleep!
 
Now I, a boat lost in the foliage of caves,
Thrown by the storm into the birdless air
I whose water-drunk carcass would not have been rescued
By the Monitors and the Hanseatic sailboats;
 
Free, smoking, topped with violet fog,
I who pierced the reddening sky like a wall,
Bearing, delicious jam for good poets
Lichens of sunlight and mucus of azure,
 
Who ran, spotted with small electric moons,
A wild plank, escorted by black seahorses,
When Julys beat down with blows of cudgels
The ultramarine skies with burning funnels;
 
I, who trembled, hearing at fifty leagues off
The moaning of the Behemoths in heat and the thick Maelstroms,
Eternal spinner of the blue immobility
I miss Europe with its ancient parapets!
 
I have seen sidereal archipelagos! and islands
Whose delirious skies are open to the sea-wanderer:
--Is it in these bottomless nights that you sleep and exile yourself,
Million golden birds, o future Vigor? 
 
But, in truth, I have wept too much! Dawns are heartbreaking.
Every moon is atrocious and every sun bitter.
Acrid love has swollen me with intoxicating torpor
O let my keel burst! O let me go into the sea!
 
If I want a water of Europe, it is the black
Cold puddle where in the sweet-smelling twilight
A squatting child full of sadness releases
A boat as fragile as a May butterfly.
 
No longer can I, bathed in your languor, o waves,
Follow in the wake of the cotton boats,
Nor cross through the pride of flags and flames,
Nor swim under the terrible eyes of prison ships.





Lives
 

I
      Oh! the huge avenues of the holy land, the terraces of the temple! What has happened to the brahmin who taught me the Proverbs? From then and from there I can still see even the old women! I remember silvery hours and sun near rivers, the hand of the country on my shoulder, and our caresses as we stood in the fiery fields. --A flight of red pigeons thunders around my thoughts--In exile here I had a stage on which to perform the dramatic masterpieces of all literatures. I might tell you about unheard-of wealth. I follow the story of the treasures you found. I see the next chapter! My wisdom is as neglected as chaos is. What is my void, compared with the stupefaction awaiting you?
 
II
      I am a far more deserving inventor than all those who went before me; a musician, in fact, who found something resembling the key of love. At present, a noble from a meager countryside with a dark sky I try to feel emotion over the memory of mendicant childhood, over my apprenticeship  when I arrived wearing wooden shoes, polemics, five or six widowings, and a few wild escapades when my strong head kept me from rising to the same pitch as my comrades. I don't miss what I once possessed of divine happiness: the calm of this despondent countryside gives a new vigor to my terrible scepticism. But since this scepticism can no longer be put into effect, and since I am now given over to a new worry--I expect to become a very wicked fool.
 
III
      In an attic where at the age of twelve I was locked up, I knew the world and illustrated the human comedy. In a wine cellar I learned history. At some night celebration, in a northern city, I met all the wives of former painters. In an old back street in Paris I was taught the classical sciences. In a magnificent palace, surrounded by all the Orient, I finished my long work and spent my celebrated retirement. I have invigorated my blood. I am released from my duty. I must not even think of that any longer. I am really from beyond the tomb, and without work.





Phrases
 

          
          When the world is reduced to a single dark wood for our two pairs of dazzled eyes--to a beach for two faithful children--to a musical house for our clear understanding--then I shall find you.
      When there is only one old man on earth, lonely, peaceful, handsome, living in unsurpassed luxury, then I am at your feet.
      When I have realized all your memories, --when I am the girl who can tie your hands,--then I will stifle you.
 

 
      When we are very strong, who draws back? or very happy, who collapses from ridicule? When we are very bad, what can they do to us.
      Dress up, dance, laugh. I will never be able to throw Love out of the window.
 

 
      --Comrade of mine, beggar girl, monstrous child! How little you care about the wretched women, and the machinations and my embarrassment. Join us with your impossible voice, oh your voice! the one flatterer of this base despair.

       I stretched out ropes from spire to spire; garlands from window to window; golden chains from star to star, and I dance.

In a Restless World Like This Is
 

Not long ago, or maybe I dreamt it
Or made it up, or have suddenly lost
Track of its train in the hocus pocus
Of the dissolving days; no, if I bend
The turn around the corner, come at it
From all three sides at once, or bounce the ball
Against all manner of bleary-eyed fortune
Tellers--well, you can see for yourselves there's
Nothing up my sleeves, or notice even
Rocks occasionally break if enough
Pressure is applied. As far as you go
In one direction, all the further you'll
Have to go on before the way back has
Become totally indivisible.

But to whatever animal we ascribe these remains, it is certain such a one has existed in America, and that it has been the largest of all terrestrial beings. It should have sufficed to have rescued the earth it inhabited, and the atmosphere it breathed, from the imputation of impotence. . . .

CONSTITUTION AVE, CAPITALSAURUS DAY
 
Beneath the marble, beneath the paper laws;
the paved boglands and legs-up taverns,
the slave-built steps of the Capitol. Winter 1898,
a sewer-man digs up a dinosaur spine,
      a nomen nudum, naked & unnamed fossil
 
tombed later at the Smithsonian
near Jefferson's Mammoth tooth
that rattled his pocket, cherished knuckle-bone
and proof against the French naturalist
      who with powdered hands
 
wrote that New World dampness and cold
had stunted flora, animals, and Man:
the American Degeneracy. 
Jefferson ordered Lewis & Clark to find
      a living Mammoth,
 
the "animal de l'Ohio
grazing somewhere west
of Big Bone Lick, Kentucky, and--
lest a species wither, or Nation grow small--
      brought Mammoth bones to Monticello.
 
"WHEREAS, the remains of a large carnivorous dinosaur,
which may be an ancestor of the Tyrannosaurus rex,
were found at First and F' Streets, SE,
 
NOW, THEREFORE, I, MAYOR OF THE DISTRICT
OF COLUMBIA, do hereby proclaim January 28, 2001,
as CAPITALSAURUS DAY.'

DISCOVERY IN SIBERIA
 
Reindeer of the herdsman Jarkov nuzzle
a tusk frozen 20,000 years. Soon,
French naturalists arrive. Radar shows
the Holy Grail of Mammoth hunters,
      a frigid bulk, twice an elephant's size--
 
Timber saws cut the block. Hoisted by
military helicopter to Stalin's
gulag caves, frozen labs for scientist-prisoners,
now re-opened. Waving hair-dryers
      to sublimate the ice, so that Discovery
 
can film them planting clone eggs
inside an elephant, hatching a Mammoth
American defender to split the ramparts,
show scheduled for release in 2001
      --the year, in the sci-fi film,
 
the monkeys learn to talk;
when Mayor Williams greets      
the Capitalsaurus and the new President Bush;
when Mohammed Atta decides he
      cannot date a waitress.
 
 
SECURITAS
 
Weary headlands roll through zones of night,
red lights flash the muted streets,
crotch-of-moss draining a blue spark dawn--
We sleep, staring. Tree-shapes and stars prod us,
      the belt of Orion is a martyr's bomb.
 
And the king, our godsbody, lies abed
groaning, chill spirit belaboring the flesh--
His spit and sperm are tallied; his temperature,
a weather report told by doctors. Until
      lady Securitas peers from a cloud--
 
her bloodlined hands, the blank, bureaucratic face!
We pray with our bodies: cold sweat, a hymn
of twitches, heart racing, shrieking dreams . . .
But fragrant Securitas has only
       come for him--
 
To compass him about.
Lifting out her breast.
Stoppers his mouth with a thick nipple.
Squeezing till the ichor throbs from his eyes,
      milk to make us thirsty--
 
 
IRAQ & TEXAS: DJINN ROADS
 
Helicopters park at Forward Base EXXON;
only the sand is flying today, and it breaks
the speed limits, 50 miles an hour. Visibility zero;
the air is hot as blood, the sky is burnt amber.
      Lord keep still our hands.
 
In Texas, teens patrol the roads by night,
burning the body's fuel--State Troopers pull them over.
George, fishtailing dauphin, a graceful
falldown drunk, clouds the breathalyzer:
      FELONY DUI. Daddy's name sinks the report--
 
Election night, heaven staring, and Laura's
yellowcake Chevy mows down her boyfriend:
VEHICULAR HOMICIDE: the car found guilty.
"I know this as an adult, it was crushing,
      she recalls. Her scented, unmarked body
 
sweats beneath foundation garments and paste.
His unmarked body, and fructifying breath,
his stone squint chasing snakes from the sun--
They walk, O my darling, the hill of light;
      the bite of remorse teaches them to bite.
 
Then it rains. What falls from the sky is not water
but mud, raindrops pulling clouds of sand
into large wet globs. "It was biblical, says
Col. Gibbs. Lights a cigarette, his back to the storm:

HOTEL AFTERMATH
 
From the dust, the limbs jerk up alive, stagger home
to camp. Martian: neck gators for the nose, goggles
seal off the eyes, baby wipes. WHAT DID YOU FIND THERE?
A slipper, an ear, some wire. A chemical suit.
      A map of water.
           ----

 
From Stalin's cave, just bits of gristle--unreadable,
no Frankenstein DNA. They rewrite the Mammoth show.
 
From Walter Reed, "an aggressive campaign
to deal with the mice infestation.
      Recovery rooms, "spit-polish clean.
 
Whose mother swallows all the soldier medicine.
 
Who wheels himself in to play Texas Hold Em.
 
Whose father says, "It was OK for my son
to give his body. They try in their power,
      but it reverses itself.
 
Jefferson's American Incognito
is ground up for fertilizer--
the maid said it was cow bones. Sweet heartland,
Governor Meriwether Lewis
      of Louisiana, depression pre-existing,
 
shoots himself in the chest and head.
 
Who sit by the apples and wingback chairs.
"If I had two hands, I'd order two vodkas--
 
Who cannot count his change.
      Who wake up and punch the air.





Mbius
 

for R.G.
As if sliding down the green, scuffed face
      of the wave, a seaplane falls
and turns together, keeping the waters of
 
the ear flat: a dead calm. But when the window's
      frowning strip of shoreline,
the battalions of tropical-drinks umbrellas
 
guarding the sandcastles and saltboxes
      of the rich,
when these flip upside down, and the pale
 
clouded sky floats below the ocean,
      then we jolt awake--
But this is not her dream, not water or land.
 
      Tell me again, what illness do I think I have?
 
The ropes of blood coil through her neck,
      they twist as it twists,
as the head looks for parents and young men,
 
for nurses, strangers, year upon year attending
      until the pulpy blood
knots up at last, and the warrens of
 
the brain dry and crackle, a town of names
      she saunters one long night:
streets without signs lead to a girlhood park,
 
to songs under stars, and lipstick,
      old houses forever
unbuilding themselves--but within the blue
 
jungle scaffolding, a gallery of faces
      stares back at her,
portraits she can't place . . . and then the town
 
flattens and crumbles behind her, it grows
      to dry scrabbled pasture
under a dishplate moon, hanging there
 
in the tints of the sky, yet like a stopped
      clock, right twice a day:
 
      Now ma'am, can you remember the name of
      the President who was shot in the 60s?
 
      --Lincoln?
 
And if the names had sunk beneath the sea,
      rolling hump and hollow,
leopard spotted foam--surgeons would haul up
 
the big sharks and club them silly, knife off a fin,
      then drop them
bleeding onto the docks of Alcatraz,
 
warning the inmates: "See that?
      No inside fin,
they'll  swim round this Rock forever. . . .
 
The convicts build the prison, then move inside,
      their block minds
ignite a thousand homes by dawn,
 
then melt in the butter sun of
      breakfast porridge. . . .
But this is not the Philosopher's circle prison,
 
no lidless Eye radiates from the center,
      beneficent
and watchful: the neutered grounds
 
here at the Residence for Life
      are groomed
like the campus of Depression State U:
 
past the dwarfish berms and drumlins
      a mazy cobalt
walkway slithers to the storage lake,
 
with its hooded fount of aqua vitae sudsing
      the green larvae,
its dry Gazebo Isle no one shuffles to . . .
 
One night, the distraught Residence cook
      shoots himself dead:
everyone mourns, but only the young staff
 
seek counseling, their threshold of death
      not yet raised
to that of teetering Mr. On-His-Toes,
 
of Ms. Wheelchair-With-Political-Bumper-Stickers,
      or elegant
Mrs. Whisper, polite confused survivors of
 
wiped-out families, trolley cars, jobs learned
      and lost, a cosmos
squeezed beneath the blood boulder--
 
      Why can't I remember my problem?
 
They do not scream. They who once
      made things happen
now watch things happen to them:
 
they hand their middle chapters to
      their children,
and quietly appraise the spindle of
 
a leafless sapling outside, staked
      to three larger
poles of wood: all of them under arrest.
 
And you must calm yourself. In the acrid hold
      of their boat,
whose strangely knotted sail whips the wind
 
round on each side, anchorless boat
      that hugs the dock,
and keeps the dock from drifting to sea,
 
you can hear the first, reeling chapters,
      of pierside painters
crowding a rustic barrel-and-shanty scene
 
so clichd the locals called it "Port Motif
      Number One--:
the washy dab and smear of the medical test,
      
      Can you tell me what day this is?
      

      --You mean now?
 
The brush like an oar rinses off its paints;
      a filmy rainbow
upon the waters, coils and ribbons
 
you trace in your own sweet time.





Proteus
 

To take,
              like water,
whatever shape you flow through, fill, or rest in.
 
And to choose that shape.

As: Brian, become a gangster,
six feet from my face.
Voice no longer a caress
but a sharpened projection,
belly a ram in a buttoned vest.
 
The whole body shows                                                                                                         
                                       the thing done:
goat-song in the rites of a god,
transforming, starting to speak now
through him
                     as he walks on stage.

Remember when you turned
into moonlight, the bark of an oak,
an orange going to shreds
in your own cold palm?
 
Everything you saw
                                 you were,
and you saw everything.
 
No choice.
That face light gnarled around a tree

Flesh is approximate.
We clothe it in dreams,
wrestling with our eyes closed
down through layers:
                                   thug, wraith,
chieftain, devouring angel (held
by my shoulders I
am trying to make you
stay put) daddy mama breath
balm a man a woman in
separate desires
                          overlapped.

Curious,
               cautious enough
to disguise himself as a woman,
the voyeur peeks at the rite.
 
Women, leaping, mothers and daughters--
their rapt beauty draws him out.

                   Never alive,

now it swims the blood, unravels
in light, never alive, now
                                         it floats on air.
 
Lost in the host a thousand years,
inert chemical mechanism

To mime--
                     not a statue

Steel jumpsuit and boots,

aluminum.

Dream he is a sea god,

Dream he is a stone, a bull, no,
a tree
          rippling over
the waves' quick light, he is
shape always becoming, he is a flame
and the stream that drowns it.





Air
 

Air as lost time
Voice of a cloud, of a ghost crowned with nimbus
Smack-thin, it lingers forty years
I thought it came from the jeweled world we'd seen
Everything stuffed, urgent, glittering alive
But it was just pleasure, blank and sure
Now what is there to sing
From speakers, the tune folds and fades in waves
Earphones drive it through your head





Vaporizer
 

A charm,
               a dream of protection.
Gurgles hold the night light's glow.
 
A stream of clouds
                                misting the branching tubes.
 
Water, in fog, a tub, plug to
wire in the wall saying
 
Okay, it's okay all night.

School, a door closing
he opens:
                haze of playground French,
the five names for different kinds of marbles,
games, bullies he wandered among
while I was staring at the sea.
 
Shut off,
not my past,
                     nothing I could do--
 
I keep making up
all the world he lived.
 
His new name, intricate drawings of aliens,
long tunnel of lunch
(Mais il ne mange rien monsieur)--
school hours shadows
                                  that smother my days.

Burnt-out hills:
char and velvety ash
                                  along the dropped limbs,
magpies, new gullies.
 
A dry time clears the ground.
 
He was standing where the road split,
arms spread, a small x
straddling the crack.
That bird call a slash, then,
on the edge of things.
 
He was standing,
                             behind him
the green blue of ocean, the white blue of sky.

The house of childhood sold,
or razed--
 
not lost but
                   softened, distended:
diaphanous linked chambers springing from
a lightshaft or a varnish smell,
the way a floorboard aches,
a scrap of wallpaper
                                  tunnels the heart.
 
    *    *    * 
 
A film of
                "events--
tiny collisions, tracks of light
in the bubble chamber--you'd scan
for hours (smell of formica, rock headsets,
eyes going furry near four AM).
 
This celluloid memory now
your memory, coursing
chemical fissures in the brain.
 
Matter split like time,
                                     thinner and thinner parings--
Anything that happens is too fast to see
 
   *    *    *
 
There the sky kept reeling as she ran--
wisps, then puffy clumps,
then rain--
                   the park spread low
beneath the blanketing.
 
Who could have worn
that purple coat
cartwheeling in the grass?
 
It grows
                as I look at it,
puts on pillowy layers.
 
Now the coat wears memory,
warms a ghost.

Wind off the world's top,

Girton, that one year
twenty years away.
 
He learned to walk, she started school,
read, slowly,
                      the first book Red.
 
Moss edging the garden wall,
little flags on the clothesline.





Give It Back
 

Give it back--I made it all up
That alcove where surplus glowed under dust
Unfinished, an attic space with nails poking down
Khaki of sheet metal, orange flickering in tubes
Ephemeral as the smells, which were plywood, solder, and Kents
Color words, smell words--I put them in a book
Everything there is still missing
Two lies of remembrance: it was always winter
Things could speak





Handy Guide
 

Avoid adjectives of scale.
Dandelion broth instead of duck soup.
Don't even think you've seen a meadow, ever.
The minor adjustments in our equations
still indicate the universe is insane,
when it laughs a silk dress comes out its mouth
but we never put it on. Put it on.
Cry often and while asleep.
If it's raw, forge it in fire.
That's not a mountain, that's crumble.
If it's fire, swallow.
The heart of a scarecrow isn't geometrical.
That's not a diamond, it's salt.
That's not the sky but it's not your fault.
My dragon may be your neurotoxin.
Your electrocardiogram may be my fortune cookie.
Once an angel has made an annunciation,
it's impossible to tell him he has the wrong address.
Moonlight has its own befuddlements.
The rest of us can wear the wolf mask if we want
or look like reflections wandered off.
Eventually armor, eventually sunk.
You wanted love and expected what?
A parachute? Morphine? A gold sticker star?
The moment you were born--
you have to trust others because you weren't there.
Ditto death.
The strongest gift I was ever given
was made of twigs.
It didn't matter which way it broke.





Dear Bob,
 

The mountain thinks it's the same
without you but it's wrong. Maybe
the same stars whisking themselves
further off, the darker the brighter,
same chamomile crushed underfoot
but the little, wiry dog we loved
has preceded us into paradise, not
that I expect to join her even though
my own crappy heart's worse, running's
out but I may be finally learning how
to sit in a chair. I still don't know
what to call the good morning bird
although whatever word'd be no truer
than manzanita. I think namelessness
has a crush on me, on how clean
I keep my room, the usual stunned
ruckus of wake up. But it's a different
moon, different woman on the hotel balcony
yet the same kinda scary, vacant stare,
caryatid foreseeing what? Before
turning back to the customary, immaculate
vacation squalor inside. The cash machine
still says "enter to exit but there's
more water in the creek than I've ever seen,
the brighter the darker, in that first dream
there was none.





Crash Test Dummies of an Imperfect God
 

Because we are so stupid,
the prizes in Cracker Jacks are now paper
so they can be swallowed, ladders
spackled with warnings. No getting
within a hundred feet of Stonehenge because
everyone wants to hack off a souvenir
and the way home is clogged to one lane
so whoever wants to can stare into a pothole
until coming up with a grievance. I'd vote
the greatest accomplishment of mankind
is the pickle spear. God created paradise
to tell us Get out! which is why we probably
created God who doesn't much like being created
by ilk like us. No wonder it's pediatrics
every morning and toxicology by happy hour.
Is it all in the mind, the dirty, dirty mind?
Maybe God tried to turn you into a garbage can
so you could be lifted by the truck's hydraulic
arms and banged empty. Maybe a snow cone
so you could be sticky-sweet and dropped.
Maybe a genital-faced bivalve to be dashed
with Tabasco and eaten whole or, to his glory,
produce a pearl.





Birdsong
 

Bustle and caw. Recall the green heat 
rising from the new minted earth, granite

and basalt, proto-continents shuffling
and stacking the deck, first shadows flung 

from the ultraviolet haze. A fern 
uncurls from the swamp, the microscopic furnace

of replication warms the world, one 
becoming two, two four: exponential blossom. 

Lush with collision, the teacup balance 
of x and y, cells like balloons

escaping into the sky--then the dumbstruck
hour, unmoored by a river,

a first fish creeps to the land to marvel
at the monstrous buds of its toes. And stars

grow feet and walk across the years, into these dozing,
ordinary days, climbing the spine's winding

stair, where crickets yawn and history spins.





Epiphany
 

A momentary rupture to the vision: 
the wavering limbs of a birch fashion

the fluttering hem of the deity's garment, 
the cooling cup of coffee the ocean the deity

waltzes across. This is enough--but sometimes
the deity's heady ta-da coaxes the cherries 

in our mental slot machine to line up, and
our brains summon flickering silver like 

salmon spawning a river; the jury decides
in our favor, and we're free to see, for now. 

A flaw swells from the facets of a day, increasing
the day's value; a freakish postage stamp mails

our envelope outside time; hairy, claw-like
magnolia buds bloom from bare branches; 

and the deity pops up again like a girl from 
a giant cake. O deity: you transfixing transgressor,

translating back and forth on the border
without a passport. Fleeing revolutions 

of same-old simultaneous boredom and 
boredom, we hoard epiphanies under the bed, 

stuff them in jars and bury them in the backyard; 
we cram our closet with sunrise; prop up our feet 

and drink gallons of wow!; we visit the doctor 
because all this is raising the blood's levels of 

c6h3(oh)2chohch2nhch3, the heart caught 
in the deity's hem and haw, the oh unfurling 

from our chest like a bee from our cup of coffee, 
an autochthonous greeting: there. Who saw it?





The World Is in Pencil
 

--not pen. It's got

that same silken 
dust about it, doesn't it, 

that same sense of 
having been roughed 

onto paper even  
as it was planned. 

It had to be a labor
of love. It must've

taken its author some
time, some shove. 

I'll bet it felt good
in the hand--the o

of the ocean, and
the and and the and 

of the land.





Bedivere/Horatio
 

Each living thing is like a kingdom
that rises not quite out of nothing: April stirrings
of some boy and the May beauty
of a generous princess. Then came children--
who could calculate their splendor?
And there were factories in valleys, mile after mile,
dragons of purple smoke, blue flames at night,
castles hidden in forests equally hidden
where a shining company rode through flowers
to pacify the dangerous land. Triangular sails,
violet, saffron, and rose, glowed beyond coves
under cliffs dangling silver torques of waterfall.
Later the parents aged and grew more grateful,
more full of a certainty that could not be glimpsed
or dismayed, and then the children
were gone to some other land
as if to heaven, yet the mourning
was not for death. Now by a quiet wall
buckled cement gives a bright home
to milkweeds like strange skeletons,
pale green, intact and upright, and tall white grasses
that never wave. The sole survivor--
a duty was laid on him
to tell the tale among new minds, other ways,
and how do we imagine him,
wherever he's gone--all that remains,
scholar of an unread book,
beggar of an unfilled cup,
an unknown variation,
the thought of the kingdom in a lost man?





Essential Poem
 

For John Hollander
Although it's likely you're on your own
at this moment in this city of three million
reading the poems of Traherne,
and there was no one till you lit your lamp,
the kingdom of childhood keeps being founded
in his voice and his seeing,
which are a sort of birth. A birth goes on
in the dark of a poor family, or a mother alone.
Then comes the small bright circle of the faces:
lover pores over sleeping loved one, parent over child
in their enclosure we name home,
a hut in the plain so bare there's not a tongue
of grass to make the wind hiss. Unknown
to the world a world exists:
trees and streams, birds all the colors of the flowers.
So Traherne pours over you
his wild remembrance of the world to come. And would
even in the silence of his book
if it were lost and lay unopened
two hundred years. Even if he had died
before he sang the Eden in his look.





As If
 

How do you explain why elephants
appear to move their unwieldy hulks
with greater dignity than most humans do
in their finest moments,
as if they had evolved beyond wanting
anything but what they have?
Why does the field begin to ripple
before the wind arrives in whispers,
as if there were a communication,
as if the landscape were poorly dubbed,
and we weren't expected to notice?
What butterfly does not dart away from us
as if it could sense our latent cruelties,
and yet return to check and double-check? 
Has the night not gotten recently darker,
as if to insinuate that we have squandered 
the light that was there?
Have we made too much of our own?
And did you notice afterward the dawn 
opening up with a tentative eagerness
as if there were something crucial to illumine,
as if we would wake up early just to see it?
I imagine you reading this now 
with an expression of quiet trouble
itself troubled by currents of hope, 
as if you imagined me here with you, 
as if I might be able to see your expression,
and at least answer it with mine.





(This Line Intentionally Left Blank)
 

we all got tickets to The Truth
finally we thought finally 
when the curtain fell away
our indrawn breaths could be heard
even in the next theater 
even the gasp of the mime 
who had slipped in among us
a loud whushing like reams of litter
whirling upward in a gale
hands shot to mouths and mouths 
fell open I couldn't say within
how many seconds 
all our minds shut some 
slamming others just a click 
like 300 parallel
rows of tipped dominoes  
a racket of almost unison

believe me we wouldn't 
have resisted anything 
but the truth
so instantly and universally
yet we sat there and waited 
for something else
which you could say we also got 
if you count the mime's
unpleasant remark
so she wasn't even a real mime
probably part of what was 
clearly just a performance





Thanatos Machine
 

You don't need a machine to do that.
A plastic bag will do. But he built it,
his tools cast about in the unit
while he got up his nerve to use it.

Nothing more was stored there.
A poured cement floor, a triple-locked door
after door after door down a corridor 
reeking with the odor of everything over.

In heretofore phrases, he left a note
outlining his Help! in argot
so wrought it was hopeless to ferret out
his intent, meant or not.

A ball-peen hammer was all she had.
The shards cut her. What else had he hid?
At least, she cried, he'd thought ahead.
He drove home instead.





Caned
 

A stick, pared clean--no, a silver-topped
bamboo-with-dagger, class doubling as club,
the advantage of gravity lifted high 
overcoming the disadvantage of poking ahead.

He demurs. Weakness either way.
A man should crush opponents with a word.
Naive, I muse, at your age. A cane
replaces the sole's sensors, bolsters them. 

Balance is a matter for the unbalanced, 
he says, all nuance, accusing me, Lear-lover,
of too much. The earth is now close, I tell him.
A sharp look. I'll walk, he says, without.





Ode
 

How glorious
is this strange muscle in my mouth.
Child's tease, lips' balm, baton of speech
unless it's tied.

What's forgotten is on the tip.
Sides slip out the truth. The root
is how far a kiss can go.

One can lose it when guilty.
Be lashed by another's.
Feel it twisting over rooky woods and wordless
hear it swinging in a bell, sliding through a groove

or placed firmly in a cheek. Beware it
should be held most often for most often
a forked one has no friend.





Wizard
 

All this havoc
just means I'm a poor wizard.

Once, I lit three twigs and fanned the smoke,
from miles away,
into the girl who jumbled scales through my spine.

As she vanished I clapped a delighted tune.
But not without aches of my own.

Did the sack of no echoes fail me?

Now, on such a mild curse--
boils, sewn eyes, a shrew
in the loin my ankle reddens up and eyes me
with disdain. Toenails fall off.

How far will this go?

Poor wizard. Poorly done in.
These pangs are power are power as both
knees lock up
ashamed to move under me.





Minnows 2
 

Whatever the cost I pay up at the minnow pools.
I don't know anything of the misery of these trapped fish,
or the failure of the marsh I'm so hidden.

Up above is the island with its few houses facing
the ocean God walks with anyone there. I often
slosh through the low tide to a sister
unattached to causeways.

It's where deer mate then lead their young
by my house to fields, again up above me.

Pray for me. Like myself be lost.
An amulet under your chest, a green sign of the first
rose you ever saw, the first shore.

Then I wash my horse, dogs, me behind the barn.
Only the narrow way leads home.





Capital One
 

          
          All day I have been thinking about the color of his cauterized skin,the burned young man lying flat on his back on the rehab slab in Wiesbaden,and think, finally, that it is the color of rhubarb, that drab maroon and green,but seared on, blasted into a mottled, speckled, crystallized sheen.Rhubarb, meaning a fight or disagreement, the ump getting into it with a player,their faces turning red, sputtering, blustering, kicking dirt on each other,until finally someone gets vulgar, says something about the other one's mother.Rhubarb, from the ancient word for the Volga River, its watery line of demarcation,and the barbarians who lived beyond it, the real ones, Vandals, Visigoths, Huns,not the ones we see now as buffoons in commercials, battle-axing, caterwaulingthe civilized world for the right credit card, for Capital One, asking us what's inour wallets. CNN says the rehab here is good, so the film crew has come in.They thank him for his service. They tell him he's a credit to his country, to all of us,all our brave young women and men. They ask if he has any hobbies, if he can tell uswhat he'd most want to do that he used to enjoy doing. He says he'd like to walk again.I hate everyone, all of us who have sent him into flames. I hate the film crew, hate CNN, the rehab facility, every tube that goes in and out of him, every monitor that beeps, even the morphine feed that drips and seeps. They ask him if it is frustrating and he weeps.
        




Like Gods
 

          
          The philosopher David Lewis spun a fantasy of two omniscient gods who know about one world, which might as well be ours. Each knows precisely all there is to know, the grand "totality of facts, not things. Each knows the pattern of the light on each neglected leaf millennia ago. Each knows the number of the stars, their ages, all the distances between them, all the "things too tiny to be remembered in recorded history--the backfiring of a bus/In a Paris street in 1932, as well as all the things that history distorts or just can't see, like the thought that must have flashed across Patroklos's mind (if he'd existed and had had a mind--the middle knowledge of the schoolmen) when Hektor split his stomach with a spear (if he'd existed too). Each one looks on, as though through ordinary eyes, as "Mme Swann's enormous coachman, supervised by a groom no bigger than his fist and as infantile as St George in the picture, endeavored to curb the ardour of the quivering steel-tipped pinions with which they thundered over the ground, and sees "the gray toppers' of old the gentlemen strolling with her wore, the little "woolen cap from which stuck out two blade-like partridge feathers that she wore (or would have worn if they and she'd been real). Each monitors the photons through the slits, the slow decay of radium, and knows the ratio of vermouth to gin in someone's first martini at Larre's. Each knows what Darragh, Geoff and Willy knew before the bullet or the pavement killed their worlds, and where the shots came from in Dallas. Each knows precisely what the other knows, in all the senses of those words, and if a question has a factual answer, each can answer it. Yet there's a question neither can resolve: which god am I?The question posits both a world and a unique perspective on that world, which neither has. And if gods One and Two could reify themselves by wondering who or what they were, they'd have to know the answer--and, because they don't, they can't. Could gods like those be real, in something like the sense that you and I are real? But then, what sense is that? Gods One and Two are you and I writ large: I wander out into the day and feel the sunlight on my face. I see the sunlight on the first spring leaves like green foam on the trees, and so do you. The world we have in common, that the gods can comprehend in its entirety, remains beyond my grasp, and yours. The world I know belongs entirely to me, as yours belongs entirely to you. I know my world completely, as the gods know ours, because it's nothing but my take on things, and starts and ends with me. I'm both the author and the captive of my world, because my take on things is all there is to me. When Mary, in Frank Jackson's philosophical diversion, wanders from her room of black and white and shades of gray and finally sees a rose, and then goes on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten, and drinks coffee, and talks for hours, it's hard to see how all of this (as she might say) could be an artifact of her perspective. But it is.So what? Philosophers tell stories, but they make them up, and what are they to me? Sometimes I think I'm humoring myself (a good thing I suppose) with an extended exercise in nonsense. Have breakfast, have a cup of strong black common sense, get over it, I tell myself, refuting Berkeley with my foot. Instead of this entanglement of self with self, why can't I just relax into my place inside the natural order, be a thing within the solid scheme of things, a Dane in Denmark? How can fantasies, unreal by definition, show me what I am, and know? How can the poetry of possibilities dissolve the prose of facts? My little life sustains me while it can, and that's enough. It may be all contingent, but it's real, and when catastrophes occur, as they inevitably do, I'd rather they occur to me, instead of writing them away, or redefining happiness or sorrow or tranquility as alterations of some abstract point of view that points at nothing. Inescapable illusions must be real, or might as well be real, no matter where reflection on them leads; and if accepting them means taking things on faith, that's fine. Who wants to be a posit, or a site of possibilities? Who wants to walk out and evaporate into this green spring day? Who wants to have sex with a wraith?No matter where reflection on them leads. It leads, of course, to me. A cri de coeur is not an argument, but where the real argument begins. Hopkins: "searching nature I taste self at one tankard, that of my own being. Kant: "the feeling of an existence without the least concept, meaning that despite the certainty I have, I've no idea what I really am, or where, and as for "searching nature, I have no idea even where to start. These matters mean the world to me, and yet no matter how I try to come to grips with them, they slip away. I and here and now are ever present, yet they vanish in the act of apprehension, as a poem turns into language as you write it down. Dimensionless, atemporal, imprisoned in the present--even as I say them to myself the words fall short of what I thought I started out to say, like the conclusion of an argument too close to me to share, or like an empty thought balloon that hangs above me in the air. It's not the question of what makes me who I am through time--of how a figure in a photograph from 1985, a couple sitting in the garden of the small Htel des Marronniers just off the rue Jacob, could be the person who remembers her and thinks of him today--but of what constitutes me now, and of what made me then. If giving it a name won't help, then neither will pretending it's divine. If I should be supplanted by a bright recording angel knowing everything about me in the way the gods know all about their world, I wouldn't have survived. She takes the whole thing in--the house on Maxim Street, the bike rides down the hill on Wabash Street, my high school friends, their friends, the friends of friends of friends--with eyes that monitor my back, my face, the traces in my brain projected on a screen, the n degrees of separation linking me to nearly everyone who's ever lived, a thing within a wilderness of things, with each one locked inside a universe with no outside, of which there's nothing she can see. How could it be an afterlife? It's just a different life, another life, complete or incomplete as anyone's, consumed by questions that elude it, not because she can't remember, but because the words that make them up are undefined: which one of them was I? which world was mine?
        




Little Wife
 

At the Oriental Institute, Chicago
They redid King Tut splendid, 
once stone-huge as this 
yet his wife's feet 
tiny, the only thing of her now
low, next to him. A few toes, some of the rest, 
a bit of ankle, that's it
in the shade of her husband's looming, massive 
looking straight ahead into the future 
where we live and can't
eye-to-eye, where to stare at him
is to suffer warbler neck, head back and up
 la the high just-leafing-out trees as bright bits
wing their blink
and hide. Little wife, 
such small feet, the thought 
dwarfs the king 
as ache, as what is 
ever left of us 
and oh, I like her better.





Grendels Mother
 

When the moon's worn scutcheon 
touches the flint-gray flood,
I will lave him in foxglove 
and vetch until the blood
of his wretched heart heals.

Without a scar, he stood--

as the men make their way 
into the quaking wood.





If
 

For Julie
If I could tie a river around my love's waist like ribbon, 
              make sails out of her blood
and pin down death like a squirming bug.

If I could lift and rock each coffin in my arms
              I would start with hers.





Bryant Park at Dusk
 

Floodlights have flared on behind and above
              Where I sit in my public chair.
The lawn that had gradually darkened has brightened.
              The library windows stare.

I'm alone in a crowd--e pluribus plures.
              Far from a family I miss.
I'd almost say I'm lonely, but lonely
              Is worse, I recall, than this.

Loneliness is a genuine poverty.
              I'm like a man who is flush
But forgot his wallet on the nightstand 
              When he left for work in a rush,

And now must go without food and coffee
              For a few hours more than he'd wish. 
That's all. He still has a wallet. It's bulging.
              It floats through his brain like a fish...

Money for love: a terrible simile,
              But maybe it's fitting here,
A couple of blocks from Madison Avenue
              Where commodities are dear,

Where all around me, rich skyscrapers 
              Woo the impoverished sky,
Having sent on their way the spent commuters 
              Who stream, uncertain, by--

And as for this whole splurge of a city, 
              Isn't money at its heart?
But I'm blathering now. Forgetting my subject.
              What I meant to say at the start

Is that I noticed a woman reading
              In a chair not far from mine.
Silver-haired, calm, she stirred a hunger 
              Hard for me to define,

Perhaps because she doesn't seem lonely.
              And what I loved was this:
The way, when dusk had darkened her pages, 
              As if expecting a kiss,

She closed her eyes and threw her head back,
              Book open on her lap.
Perhaps she was thinking about her story,
              Or the fall air, or a nap.

I thought she'd leave me then for pastimes
              More suited to the dark.
But she is on intimate terms, it seems,
              With the rhythms of Bryant Park,

For that's when the floodlights came on, slowly,
              Somewhere far above my need, 
And the grass grew green again, and the woman
              Reopened her eyes to read.







Brutal
 


Brutal to give
the prisoner a window--
a blue sky glimpse--

as if an afterlife
existed. Brutal
for you to parade 

in a body
in the same 
room where I dream you.





My Death Space Dot Com
 

Now that obituaries come online
with coroner reports and full disclosure, 
imagine the ways to betray a man 
come out of hiding to die. Ask the bloggers
who weigh in on my friend's bad habit,
who make of it their own drug strung out
across a mirror, so when they pay tribute
to their power, how they had their doubts
about his talent, his flu, I think how lucky
I was to receive the kindness of the weak.
My death space, as they call it, as if it's me
who died. A life, we know, is complex.
But death is simple. A place to talk shit,
to license grief, or barring that, to kill it.







An Ether
 

Past the fountain out of repair
And the boarded diner

A small studio
You'd never told anyone about

Where old clothes have remained
Right where you've dumped them

Side by side
With random notes and sketches

When someone close to you
Has a different idea of what you represent

He insisted
You'll write a check for the loan

There were other misjudgments
As well. Exits were being blocked

Down every hall I walked

Until a sort of muscle memory--
Well, I knew it all along, of course,

But thought it was in the future,
It rested like a memory--

This desire 
For a place respecting anonymity

Oiling your .38 Special,
Like a criminal readying for benefits

A bottle of Jack Daniels--

This and more

Shaded by echoing buildings
With a glance toward the harbor

The water rough with small debris
Today





Wild Turkeys
 

When Ronnie's husband stepped out of the shower
She spotted bite marks on his buttocks

I was so listless
I wished the dog could talk



The room was frowsty. Then men
Were discussing the legacy of Wendell Willkie

Those little cupids of nostalgia
Fading into doubt...

All that fussing
Followed by a creamy silence--

Oh mother, my daughter said, you're so '80s

To winkle out meaning, I've given up,
I'm simply nosing through the thistle.

Prudish light of a candle
As night closes with a tail over water



A rufous backdrop of brush.
A clot of gardening tools

When Mrs. Mast took a photo in September
Of a cougar lounging beneath her clothesline
Everyone stopping strolling our lazy road.
Even Jack felt uncomfortable
Smoking a cigarette on the patio
Before retiring





Enochs Blocks
 

Little Enoch learned his colors from lettered blocks

(for a is the color of fleet,
b is the color of war and demolition,
c is the color of echo and blur,
&c.) and built
a bricolage:

So cab was a whirring warbler.
bach was the Spanish Armada crashing
                                      and crashing.
And enoch he couldn't describe.

And when it reached the height of Enoch,
standing, he tore whole tongues
down to their colors.





Bone and Hue
 

There was a young woman 
who lived in her shoes.

Bare-backed, she sat 
with elders and sheened 
her nails with sloe. 

Felt purse, trunk, 
berries in bottled gin.

Smoke rose 
from the purples of the ground. 

Moscow maybe next, or 
Poland, where the numbers burned.

Purples of the mosses turned.
Some million shades.
Six million more.

Purples of the mosses,
and all the millions, blue.

She had so many lives,
she didn't know what to do.





Don Giovanni
 

Women asleep. Carlight,
east red and west white.

Women, and men made of them,
and lambs in their droves, and power lines east

to the women-made men and women of men,
when a man is a sum
of what women he knows, and I 

blurred my vision till I
saw a woman and lambs in the streets,
west red and white east,

and I wanted to eat. Women and men,
don't fear me, I am 
a hand come to wake her. Red 

in the west says
woman is man is woman is man.





West of Silicon Valley
 

A field of thistles, dscharging 
                  concentric waves of negative 
                                       theology, on a mountainside, 
                  2010, May 23rd (is Whitsuntide),
would certainly
suffice as a source of the ever-obtainable not 
enough sought 
state of subtle shock 
if he'd close 
this computer 
                  and walk up the summit road 
                  until the sea's in view. And maybe in 
                  the southeast wind, 
                  in broadcast waveform data therein,
                  microsystems stocks he has been
checking, clicking all day like an addict gambler, will 
                                                                                      float up until 
red numbers cross the black horizon 
into green--two redtail hawks                                float up 
                                                                                      on a thermal--
maybe even make some money while you're up here--
ask why is each second so
                             charged with a feeling of living in freak
Gtterdmmerung days
of live free radical notion or die into negative white on white sun pride
burning away, but equally
                             charged with utopian headlong longevity crowing--
why can't I be steady? 
Why is my only 
balance built 
of collisions and 
cancelings-out of such sharp spike-of-chaos moods?

Field of thistles, 
red and green. 

Fields of dollars, thistles, 
solidi and yen 
and rand and rupees blowing off the curve of land. 






from Supplice
 

Raking lace
at the fringe of the tide,
raking with fingers
the English and cutwork
and French of the froth,
with the negative black
dwarf sun in her eye echo
eye mirror eye, she, 
taking his fingers, 
English and Hebrew bones, 
bobbin bones, 
to lace with her own,
said love, if you like,
but abyss of light.





Clover
 

On a brain-gray day,
                                      he lay on the hill-slanted solar
array with a southern exposure,
toes in the clover
                                mixed in with what are these
pentagrammatic sprays
of pinnate leaves.
                                No clover
here has four leaves:
to each one he says
I have seen you before
                                          in the nuclear hazard 
symbol and then again (as 
again slants backward) 
before that, as nothing but clover
                                                             when childhood was not yet over
and everything was symbol therefore 
nothing was.







The Way We Were Made
 

But you made every
delicate, elegant wrist
& glistening ankle.
But you made them
beautiful
in braided rope
& dime store gold. 
But you made every
necklace clasp.
But you made them
caress the nape
like an errant wind
after a shower. 
But you made every
eyelash erotic. Every
single strand of hair
soft.
But you made them
from dust & bone.
Made every glorious 
singing thigh. Every
button nose.
But you made them
with holes--
wide open
to the faintest hints
of salt
in a sea breeze, salt
in the sweaty mouth
of a navel, salt
in the blood, sweet
in every wrong way.





Bay Window Lauds
 

Cul-de-sac Pastoral
The sill plays a cruel joke--thrones me. Frames me
lording over lawn mower stripes--myself

in a shallow trench. In grass blades. Myself
persisting, despite a dickhead sun--me

in chlorophyll. Early, I find myself
swaying--me! in the black chokeberry, me!

in the rabbit's throat. Me, the rabbit. Me  
dancing out pellets. Out-dancing myself--

my father's pellet gun, the hawk. The joke
is a bright belly full of dark hopping

along my father's garden & the joke
small, between wrapped talons, is the hawking

too, is the axe sun, swift, rising, this joy.
This joy, it swallows itself far too soon!





Animal Farm
 

Consider the toucan's festive gold breast.
Its multicolored pecker, oddly cutesy  
& perhaps, a cartoon-comfort 
to the gym-roped Westerners
reclining on a beach in Costa Rica. 
It's the same old song: good-natured
smile, hard work, a hat's off kind
of attitude & before you can say
post-racial, you're a Resort Toucan.
The benefits are room & board
but the cost is blood. Most times
it's the closest ones--birds
of the same rainforest, same
quadrant, same tree--who give up 
your whereabouts to the jaguar. 
Quick as you got the gig, the boss 
is tossing you out on your ass 
all over some flipped umbrellas   
& a tourist's scarfed thumb. So now
you're roofless, alone, vulnerable
& the beast is licking his chops
in your mirrored aviators. Stifling 
too is the Midwestern Subdivision
in its treatment of the black squirrel.    
Science tells us black squirrels
have driven out native grey squirrels 
in numerous areas, but no bullshit 
in my development, black squirrels 
are relegated to lots with a view
of the highway. Mornings
they work shade for acorns
between homes narrow as Lincoln Logs.
History tells us black squirrels
can't afford robust landscaping
but will pay their mortgage--
chair the neighborhood watch
if you like. Slenderizing, their night
of hair. They're sun's prey. 
They avoid overexposure, make tanning
trend. Black squirrels
they fit in, get along. Know no one.
They see other black squirrels & run.





Town of Unspeakable Things
 

Then there was the time I looked directly into the face 
of the life I thought I was missing, 

of love. I used to think to be not alone meant 
never having to walk through the high wheat 

or struggle in the water. Not having to decide not
to fling from some height.

Once, the two of us rode one bicycle.
I wore a straw hat and perched on the handlebars 

and beside us the sea oats swayed like skirts 
and I heard a trilling in the crabgrass. 

The sidewalks were bleached as Grecian stone
as we rode past the fish shop smelling of morning--
salt, bread, limes, men.

Riding in front, it was such that 
I could not be heard always, at least not the first time

for you pedaled into the wind 
and my hair was a ribbon in your eyes.

I said I thought bougainvillea was a stoic plant 
and then had to say twice, no, stoic! and then 
no, the bougainvillea! and then you said easily 

it was nothing like that at all. 

But our future was clear enough when I asked if you saw 
the clean aprons of those men 

(how much longer you think until they clean the fish? 
did you see how white those aprons were? did you see?)
 
To which you said 
How much is it, then, you think you need?





To See the Queen
 

Since I was the one who had been ill, it was me she came to see.
Everyone wanted a glimpse of her.
The people emerged from their houses toward mine 
and with such caution. 
They made a visor of their hands.
It was as if they were to be accounted for,
wading the long uphill, little moving triangles 
all I could distinguish at first.
But the queen came to see only me and I saw her. 
And my life for a while was dismissed
and so repaired.





Time of Need
 

In the road, a dog. Days dead, 
that dog. Liliana was walking beside me awhile 
(I am sure) and I was almost not crying but then found 

what I was looking for. 
She heaved it for me--all of it, the stench, the weight--
in her thin arms until it was too much. 

Tired, she dragged the thing by its wasted paws 
all the way home. Her dress was stained. This is how 

I learned about love. She did not mind at all 
the silent, steady distance I placed between us.





Sparrow
 

This was more like the atmosphere
had been pinched, whose chirp was an unexpected gust 
in a harmonium enough 
to break all that high horse talk
that curdles the atmosphere. While centaurs

ate grass and hurdled epitaphs, that chirp 
in the midst did change one of us. 
'Twas clawed out in a feeling's flock
'Twas 'couraged by the tall grass
Did you not catch it? 

It is enough to gather at your age;
It is enough to note just what 
was said that provoked the Alps to rage. 
And the eye sews along. But can it cup 
a crazing off the tops of trees?

Just one eye as yours could be enough--
one for six moons that surround 
the mind's water birth, while a lily on its cot
bloated, lapses. Sparrow, here again! Countless
consuls tower and luff but the world sizes
down to a restless heart:

To the one note that repeats itself and is all. 
To the note one repeats to one's self and all. 
To the one line spitting the heart into flight. 

Metaphor is elsewhere, a jewel resulting 
in the snout of a pig. Sparrow, here--nearly unresting thing
which always seems suddenly to never have left 
my mind. Because you will so easily disappear, 
I think of you as infinitely near. 







Sympathy
 

Whose table is that, left on three legs?
If there's been a mistake, it may be 
in assuming less vulnerability 
as one fills the vase--

whose buoyant comfort exaggerates 
at the sight of his own proffered, 
sympathetic hand, striking him so clean
in comparison

gloved white, magician--for a sec 
he even sees the calla lily's furl
in the gesture of voil!





The Youngest Two Hear Cicadas
 

Tennessee: We are here, between trees, 
with the tempo of a rosary being strung
in a queue of escalating beads--

Carolina: It's not quite the count in
the countinghouse of my chest
but the heart does make an awful attempt

t: and a circle wherever it may be 
there was music coming on

c: which though machinery-like 
moves not in cogs, and never
springs, but waves through

t: like wired applause for antic backstage
buds on the pre-comeuppance buzz; but it 
fades

c: but only after the chorus has pulsed

t: it drops off with sudden decision, like fountain
water gone dross

c: or it reaches the furthest point
the branch turns from us, and is for some arc 
fully quiet...

t: until the roulette snaps its jaw and the choir's
circuit opens to one

c: like a pigeon unhinged, its wings
in sudden white-rumped ascent

t: unopposed by iridescence

c: unopposed by iridescence






from d e l e t e, Part 2
 

          
          Set up curbside, jewelry tray entanglement with things looking up, but nothing sells unless there is someone looking down, and who might that be? For the moment it's not raining and off-coast in pods the gray whales parade south. Photographs sprout with the season. The gray whale's spout is heart shaped, enough said. Just listen for the icon's intake of breath and see what you can see. Yes, but that was yesterday and which way are prices going to go? There is a pack forming and they will need a leader. It's then you kick the snot out of them, not before, and make it believable this one last time; but don't depend on it, auditors, even though it's turned out like this so many times before. There may be an image whose mind has changed. Sorry, no rain checks in this scheme of things, the windows are broken and boards keep out the light, it's the cheapest thing to do and then forget it, as has been done before, before, etc. Could you pick out of a lineup who is the culprit here? The mirror is one-way and there's no way to be sure which side you're on, but so what? Go on making faces anyway, but be sure, now and then, to check your hand before your face, if just to say Wheaties, the best is yet to be. Our inventions, gods and needles, for instance, are built to say this to us ever and forever. It's obvious why we can't give them up, they're ours, for ourself self's sake! We live in the afterlife of what, unalterable, has already taken place. The minute you start acting like Robinson Crusoe it's plain to see you've lost your hold on the world. There are many such, so many, washed up on our island shores! They end up sleeping over grates and in doorways at night, far distant from tree ripe fruit and warm sand. The dumps of our artifacts bewilder them. They probe, not knowing what to expect from excess. They act out an experiment, a hairline calculation for survival: is the expenditure of energy to dig up carrots from the frozen ground more than their return in calories? Did you notice the price tag when the wine was poured, the cool chardonnay, the special cabernet, white and red absurdities of words? The motion lights are set to react outside the house but, tell me, did you see the clutter in the study, one would think! Those catalogs, the cave, shadows.
        




from d e l e t e, Part 6
 

          
          Assume you have discovered an entropy of spirit, immeasurable of course, but it pulls graveward all those whose element is breath, not as the in and out again of water and the sun, but oblivion's ass-first downhill twenty-four-hour drag. Knowledge is an after-the-fact affair, fair game for a hunger striker's skeptic gopher tooth. Remember your "agenbite of inwit, but don't, please don't, go knocking on doors declaring you've gone hollow with all the others, no one will believe you so long as your bag of flesh is fair. Fall down the stairs to another street. Have you noticed nature does not care for you, no matter the pathos of your fallacies, your antiperspirant, or you arms folded over the stretch marks of your hardest years? That's you, cell mate, roping a Platonic calf. Rare air, this is all you'll catch and never can. Live on that for a week and leave a message on your machine, "nourished by words alone. Those fireworks you inherited, where are they now? Will you set them off to end the show? You have a story that simply cannot be sold, and no rewrite can change country or cast, so here you are in never-never land again. That figure off there in the mist is Nietzsche, stay clear, they say his breath is vile, he needs his space or so the professors say. Were you handed this out of an old script or are you improvising this to-do? Whatever you are, an actor or a human merely with all the other actors, or can you tell the difference without a script in hand, you talk about a text that is not there. Each morning your own short-form obituary appears on every page. An open mike will follow. But this is only in the babblesphere, don't inhale those dialogues that bubble up. Weariness grows in direct proportion to answers that recede nightly as you snore. Did you audition for this part or did you win it in an all-night poker game? The difference is the same, none, today. Don't give your chips to another to bet, that's stacking the odds in your favor, sharing the blame. Avoid places where the lights are always on. Try finding a sunset through a simple gift of looking west. There can be too much light for your own good. Pace Pascal. Let someone close your eyes. Necessary, or so I'm told. That hand in front of your face, try it now.

 3.
  
 In memory sickness
  
 eyes unlace
  
 open
 as last night's boots
  
 a glacier of light
 saps the air
  
 remember 
  
 the torturer's 
 tinnitus 
 starts the day.
  
  

 4.
  
 The   irrationality
 of it
  
 mob noise
  
 angels struck
 from the block
 of darkness
  
 a sunlit sky breaks
 through in shrapnel
  
 hard screaming night
  
 feather touch
  
 troops improvising
 for the kill
  
 panic
  
 my enemy
  
 my nail-hold.
  
  

 5.
  
 Of the texture
 of elbows shattered
 and stairwell falls
  
 hallucinations 
 of confession
  
 rush to stop pain.
  
  

 6.
  
 Andean snow-stats
 blind me
  
 the flashlight 
 of the Burglar
 of Death flares
  
 and holds 
 on my eyes.
  
  

 7.
  
 In the Feast Halls
  
 ghosts linger
  
 feeding
  
 avoiding
  
 dogs
  
 and the memory
  
 of cracked bones.
  
  

 8.
  
 Present danger
  
 colors hiss
 from a blue masque
  
 bone-bonded
  
 Autumn in no
 year's season
  
 a nerve twitches
 across the path.
  
  
  
 9. 
  
 Planets by lamplight
  
 street laughter
 embraced in being
  
 parallel lines
 collapse curbside
  
 cornices fall
  
 from a stranger's dream
 moon-sand ears
  
 the inhabitants
 lean in to hear.





A Reminiscence
 

Held in a late season
 At a shifting of worlds,
 In the golden balance of autumn, 
 Out of love and reason
  
 We made our peace;
 Stood still in October
 In the failing light and sought,
 Each in the other, ease
  
 And release from silence,
 From the slow damnation
 Of speech that is weak
 And falls from silence.
  
 In the October sun
 By the green river we spoke,
 Late in October, the leaves 
 Of the water maples had fallen.
  
 But whatever we said
 In the bright leaves was lost,
 Quick as the leaf-fall,
 Brittle and blood red.            


                 For Kenneth Rexroth, 1950





Listen. Put on Morning
 

Listen. Put on morning.
 Waken into falling light.
 A man's imagining
 Suddenly may inherit
 The handclapping centuries
 Of his one minute on earth. 
 And hear the virgin juries
 Talk with his own breath
 To the corner boys of his street.
 And hear the Black Maria
 Searching the town at night.
 And hear the playropes caa
 The sister Mary in.
 And hear Willie and Davie
 Among bracken of Narnain
 Sing in a mist heavy
 With myrtle and listeners.
 And hear the higher town
 Weep a petition of fears
 At the poorhouse close upon
 The public heartbeat.
 And hear the children tig
 And run with my own feet
 Into the netting drag
 Of a suiciding principle.
 Listen. Put on lightbreak.
 Waken into miracle.
 The audience lies awake
 Under the tenements
 Under the sugar docks
 Under the printed moments.
 The centuries turn their locks
 And open under the hill
 Their inherited books and doors
 All gathered to distil
 Like happy berry pickers
 One voice to talk to us. 
 Yes listen. It carries away
 The second and the years
 Till the heart's in a jacket of snow
 And the head's in a helmet white
 And the song sleeps to be wakened
 By the morning ear bright.
 Listen. Put on morning.
 Waken into falling light.





Approaches to How They Behave
 

1
  
 What does it matter if the words
 I choose, in the order I choose them in,
 Go out into a silence I know
 Nothing about, there to be let
 In and entertained and charmed
 Out of their master's orders? And yet
 I would like to see where they go
 And how without me they behave.
  

 2
  
 Speaking is difficult and one tries
 To be exact and yet not to
 Exact the prime intention to death.
 On the other hand the appearance of things
 Must not be made to mean another
 Thing. It is a kind of triumph
 To see them and to put them down
 As what they are. The inadequacy
 Of the living, animal language drives
 Us all to metaphor and an attempt
 To organize the spaces we think
 We have made occur between the words.
  

 3
  
 The bad word and the bad word and
 The word which glamours me with some
 Quick face it pulls to make me let
 It leave me to go across
 In roughly your direction, hates
 To go out maybe so completely
 On another silence not its own.
  

 4
  
 Before I know it they are out
 Afloat in the head which freezes them.
 Then I suppose I take the best
 Away and leave the others arranged
 Like floating bergs to sink a convoy.
  

 5
  
 One word says to its mate O
 I do not think we go together
 Are we doing any good here
 Why do we find ourselves put down?
 The mate pleased to be spoken to
 Looks up from the line below
 And says well that doubtful god
 Who has us here is far from sure
 How we on our own tickle the chin
 Of the prince or the dame that lets us in.
  

 6
  
 The dark companion is a star
 Very present like a dark poem
 Far and unreadable just out
 At the edge of this poem floating.
 It is not more or less a dark 
 Companion poem to the poem.
  

 7
  
 Language is expensive if
 We want to strut, busked out
 Showing our best on silence.
 Good Morning. That is a bonny doing
 Of verbs you wear with the celandine
 Catching the same sun as mine.
 You wear your dress like a prince but
 A country's prince beyond my ken.
 Through the chinks in your lyric coat
 My ear catches a royal glimpse
 Of fuzzed flesh, unworded body.
 Was there something you wanted to say?
 I myself dress up in what I can
 Afford on the broadway. Underneath
 My overcoat of the time's slang
 I am fashionable enough wearing
 The grave-clothes of my generous masters.
  

 8
  
 And what are you supposed to say
 I asked a new word but it kept mum.
 I had secretly admired always
 What I thought it was here for.
 But I was wrong when I looked it up
 Between the painted boards. It said
 Something it was never very likely
 I could fit in to a poem in my life.
  

 9
  
 The good word said I am not pressed
 For time. I have all the foxglove day
 And all my user's days to give
 You my attention. Shines the red
 Fox in the digitalis grove.
 Choose me choose me. Guess which
 Word I am here calling myself 
 The best. If you can't fit me in
 To lying down here among the fox
 Glove towers of the moment, say
 I am yours the more you use me. Tomorrow
 Same place same time give me a ring.
  

 10
  
 Backwards the poem's just as good.
 We human angels as we read
 Read back as we gobble the words up.
 Allowing the poem to represent
 A recognizable landscape
 Sprouting green up or letting green
 With all its weight of love hang
 To gravity's sweet affection,
 Arse-versa it is the same object,
 Even although the last word seems
 To have sung first, or the breakfast lark
 Sings up from the bottom of the sea.

 
 11
  
 The poem is not a string of knots
 Tied for a meaning of another time
 And county, unreadable, found
 By chance. The poem is not a henge
 Or Easter Island emerged Longnose
 Or a tally used by early unknown
 Peoples. The words we breathe and puff
 Are our utensils down the dream
 Into the manhole. Replace the cover.

 
 12
  
 The words are mine. The thoughts are all
 Yours as they occur behind
 The bat of your vast unseen eyes.
 These words are as you see them put
 Down on the dead-still page. They have
 No ability above their station.
 Their station on silence is exact.
 What you do with them is nobody's business.

 
 13
  

Running across the language lightly
This morning in the hangingover
Whistling light from the window, I
Was tripped and caught into the whole
Formal scheme which Art is.
I had only meant to enjoy
Dallying between the imaginary
And imaginary's opposite
With a thought or two up my sleeve.
 
 
14
 
Is the word? Yes Yes. But I hear
A sound without words from another
Person I can't see at my elbow.
A sigh to be proud of. You? Me?
 
 
15
 
Having to construct the silence first
To speak out on I realize
The silence even itself floats
At my ear-side with a character
I have not met before. Hello
Hello I shout but that silence
Floats steady, will not be marked
By an off-hand shout. For some reason
It refuses to be broken now
By what I thought was worth saying.
If I wait a while, if I look out
At the heavy greedy rooks on the wall
It will disperse. Now I construct
A new silence I hope to break.





The Night City
 

Unmet at Euston in a dream
 Of London under Turner's steam
 Misting the iron gantries, I
 Found myself running away
 From Scotland into the golden city.
  
 I ran down Gray's Inn Road and ran
 Till I was under a black bridge.
 This was me at nineteen
 Late at night arriving between
 The buildings of the City of London.
  
 And the I (O I have fallen down)
 Fell in my dream beside the Bank
 Of England's wall to be, me
 With my money belt of Northern ice.
 I found Eliot and he said yes
  
 And sprang into a Holmes cab.
 Boswell passed me in the fog
 Going to visit Whistler who
 Was with John Donne who had just seen
 Paul Potts shouting on Soho Green.
  
 Midnight. I hear the moon
 Light chiming on St Paul's.
  
 The City is empty. Night
 Watchmen are drinking their tea,
  
 The Fire had burnt out.
 The Plague's pits had closed
 And gone into literature.
  
 Between the big buildings 
 I sat like a flea crouched
 In the stopped works of a watch.





Giving Directions to McDonalds
 

                                                    when I'm
braced for a mugging is stranger than the
Eritrean boy asking the question
outside Clifton Hill station. The skinnier
for baggies he's hop & a skip
across three lanes following my hand.
No way to countermand him.
No way he'd stay for the whole
story. The ghosts of spray-can gangs
who tagged the length & breadth of the subway
are benign I'd tell him. There'll be
the odd gutter-crawler in front of the House
of Love. Keep walking. The garage'll be closed
but in summertime a gaggle
of mechanics will punt a football
in the road there. One missing his mark
is bound to call an Eritrean
to kick it back. Ignore them.
Continue to a far flung franchise
of the American dream. Once it was
the dull red brick of the United Kingdom
pub where the last of the blessed
aged quicker than most
on Victoria Bitter.
Now it's the McDonalds
of this convergence of worlds
in whose vicinity I'm more
or less lost.





Four Haiku
 

(i)
 
(for Robert Grey)
 
caged by dappled light
unlike Rilke's beast     content
this side of heaven
 
 
(ii)
 
perennial green
ephemeral butterfly
what time's time enough?
 
 
(iii)
 
red roof in full leaf
sail now grey threatening sky
cry blue land ahoy!
 
 
(iv)
 
in this green waiting
birds trill leaves quiver then time
interjects its train!





"to come away with Hesiod
 

to come away with Hesiod
and leave the rock as though to rocks
the tree to trees and dwell on other things
 
imagine the injunction
to leave the mint to its own devices
among the dust & stones in the shadow
of rocks or tree-roots hard as rocks
 
imagine poems left to their own devices
as poets gorge on air & airy thoughts
& figures  the thought sobers me
to the bone of a sobriety earned
at the expense of the airiness Hesiod
was commissioned to name
 
but who wouldnt seize a staff of bay
or ash or gum and trade common or
garden cough for lungsfull of song
taking the world in one's stride
careering towards heaven?





First Love
 

Titian's Young Englishman with a Glove, circa 1530
It happened in Physics,
reading a Library art book under the desk,
(the lesson was Archimedes in the bath)
I turned a page and fell
for an older man, and anonymous at that,
hardly ideal 
he was four hundred and forty-five,
I was fourteen.
Eureka!' streaked each thought
(I prayed no-one would hear)
and Paradise all term
was page 179
(I prayed no-one would guess).
Of course
my fingers, sticky with toffee and bliss,
failed to entice him from his century;
his cool grey stare
fastened me firmly in mine.
I got six overdues,
suspension of borrowing rights
and a D in Physics.
But had by heart what Archimedes proves.
Ten years later I married:
a European with cool grey eyes,
a moustache,
pigskin gloves.





Mirror Image
 

Thirty years ago. And only yesterday,'
says Balzs, slapping at a fly.
We sit beside a bottle underneath his vines
and watch the football arc between his sons.
 
Check through the corner one,' the sergeant says,
and make it short and sweet. Take a couple of men.'
(Seventeen-year-olds still nervous with a gun.)
It's an office block like most
down the derelict street;
he keeps a good five metres ahead,
tries the rooms along each corridor
and beckons the two boys on.
They reach the third floor,
breathing easier now.
The Council Chamber's here,
empty but for a tangle of chairs
at the northern window end
(unseemly three-day corpses,
wooden legs in the air);
dried into the floor  blood-stains;
and seeping through the shattered panes
the distant dialogue of cross-fire.
Directly opposite him  another door.
He notes the fact an instant before
it opens sharply and his counterpart 
the hated AVO uniform of green 
levels his gun and time is not.
They freeze. Somewhere beyond,
the seconds slide away;
between their eyes the slender lifeline holds
across the mirror of air.
Dntetlen bartom azt hiszem':
Stalemate I think, my friend.
Each slightly lowers his gun
and slowly, eyes still locked, takes one step back.
The two doors close together, softly as hands on a prayer.
Senki sincs ott,' each says to his men:
Nobody there.
 
In Hungary we used to say
Nha a msodik alkalom jn elszr 
sometimes the second chance comes first.'
He's silent, years away.
The day is insubstantial, seems to float
in the dry gum-scented heat.
Only the football's thud,
steady as the beat of some huge heart,
holds us in time and space.
He rouses himself to swear:
Az anyd, off the kohlrabi, rossz gyerekek,'
then pours us another beer.
The head on each glass whispers small talk;
we blow the froth into the air.





The Return
 

Mondays Began
with one plait loose, a pip in your teeth
and late for Geography, lined and blank,
facts to the right, tall stories left.
To sail the heat in a weatherboard classroom boat
with banana and vegemite colouring the air
sargasso green. To ship ten thousand things
on cursive seas to the edge of the known page
--coffee, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves.
To import small desires and grown-up needs
in little packets of time for show and tell.
To carve your name on the prow.
To wait for the bell.
 
 
 
In the Parlour
only the French clock answered back.
They sat cross-legged on the Persian carpet;
destinations flashed by
the smell of Marveer, lavender, dusty velvet.
They opened their eyes in the olden times
to fossick under the coffin flaps
of the jarrah window seat
for proper advice from disheveled magazines:
nose straighteners, recipes, posture improvers,
the runt who smoked and the chap who rowed.
They didn't see foresight's guarded smile,
they didn't hear hindsight howl like a dog;
the riddles were wordy, the clues were dumb:
lopped head of a doll, silk wedding sleeve,
gilt volumes, silverfish,
and in the glass case,
untouchable figurines locked away
as grown-ups always seemed to be:
shepherd and shepherdess on their marks,
Wedgwood, Royal Doulton, Limoges?
The real thing?
 
 
Almond Trees
cover Willunga Plains: like the misty breath
of winter children, the blossom hovers. Dearth,
says the black bark, splits to let scent through
with open questions where when why what who?
As for that earliest aroma fear,
she'd  smell it, taste it, anywhere,
one part in a million, pungent as coffee or smoke,
already there in her mother's milk.
Against its grey unbeing she caught
at talismans  black stones on a white plate,
concrete nouns clattering out of thought.
Marking time down the dead-end street
to morning. Why was it always dark
in the quiet hall? Through a memory crack
of light an edge squeezed round the door:
regret to inform stop missing in stop the air
elliptic with tracer fire, familiar eyes
glancing away, prismatic as flies'.
Voices crept and huddled, where's Daddy's girl?
He did come back, but who? They could not tell.
Collections began. The tang of foreign coins
lent her a lingo and currency for the unknown;
Brother stuck down squares of expedited
love with serrated edges. And they were invited
to a fancy-dress ball with games of us and them.
Father could not come for he was lame
and Mother had to watch and wait not play
so they learned dolls and trains and night and day
and Snakes and Ladders and Hide and Seek.
Knight's gambit. Castle your king. Check.
And when the black door opened and they knew
threshold was famished, Brother stepped through.
Now fear had her ID and her address.
Best send an invitation. Tell her guest
the lightest thing she served would ward off harm 
a stick, a stone, a cloud of white perfume,
thought itself, needing a go-between
to say this fragrance is like newborn skin,
these quickening trees, like Mary's aging cousin
conceiving all baptism out of season'.
 
 
 
She Collected Dictionaries
as other women take up men
and shelve them:
manuals, grammars, Teach Yourself
German, Malay, Italian, Swahili, Welsh,
like a passion for clothes that would hang
unworn in the dark,
for peridots, garnets, amethysts, pearls
in a shut case, nouns declined.
Each unknown word shone with delicious fire
and the alien phrases silked her skin
with their genders and connotations.
 
She might have been the end house
on the waterfront of Macau
welcoming every sailor in.
But the longing for many tongues
to part her lips  si, igen, ja,
ah oui, yes, yes 
was departure's smile,
a leaning to the wind
that sweeps a glitter of light
across the sea and sets a silvery chill
at the neck. Quick, to those books
guarding the mantelpiece,
ISBNs snug as a span of days;
to bread and fruit and sparkling wine.
 
She had been given a cyclamen with scent,
some new trick that married violet and rose,
as if a flower should yearn to sing
and the pink timbre tremble
into quietest words.
She touched her flesh and knew
that it would fade as speech did
and did not.
And yet it was not language that she sought,
nor the music of any meaning.
An old allegiance drew her on
beyond the first ground of thought
and the idea even of silence
to the fifth season which must at last return
with its weather of recognition
and its lost ends.





Eclogues
 

1
The first ten steps from the house to the shed, I break
two or three promises the night has strung
                                                                             like spiders' webs across my path.
The morning is sprung with secrets
the night's been spinning all night and now they're trapping daylight
between the oak and the mendicant poplars and snapping
 
 
2
Before me on the broken trail to my desk. In the cowshed
the spider hangs on the cross of herself
                                                                             above the first stall door,
where, these seven days, she's been dying,
and I bank a fire and shoo the children when they follow me in
and I sit to work. Winter's come, and down on the river the kangaroos
 
 
3
Know it. I winter here all day, the poplars, wasted saints, laying on their hands,
and nine hours on there's a shoal of cloud in a cold sky
                                                              and a blue moon loose in it like a man overboard.
Why is it so hard to keep a fire burning
all day? You turn your back and it's gone out
somewhere, and yet you sit here still, every thought broken,
                                                                                                            your feet cold in your boots
 
 
4
Two nights later the moon rises nicotine-stained and peaceable
into the fingers of the silver trees,
                                                             and the floodplain is a smokefilled basement.
Out of the blue sprawling mist the plover's mad call:
why will a river not stay in the ground?
Out on the deck, I draw down deep on the evening and turn and walk
 
 
5
Its balm inside and search again briefly for the frequency of family life
and I find it in the bath, my girl
                                               and our three children, sleek as seals,
and in that moment a truck passes on the road
and snaps the powerline from the eaves. The house shudders and we fall
back in time to candles and stories by heart and reading news from memory.
 
 
6
The earth, it seems, has caught a fever, and where will she lie
to rest? When the men come
                                               and plug us back in, I believe I hear her
groan. How will she begin
to forgive us, or is that what she's been doing all along?
In the night the mist rolls away, and at dawn there's a frost over everything.
 
 
7
You'd call it a blessing if you hadn't been woken four times
by minor deities, pyjamaed like children
                                                                             and frantic in the dark with oracles.
Why do our children not know how to sleep?
Do they fear we've left our waking late? At first light they dawn
and have you rise and lead them out into the story
 
 
8
The river has told the grass again, a parable the day has forgotten by nine.
And by ten, at your desk, you've forgotten it, too.
                                                                              A man so easily distracted
by himself. But what are you here for
and what do they love, if not the way you leave each day to change the world's mind
and return with the night, your fire spent, your face lined with secrets?
 
 
9
One night, you arrive home late and tongue-tied and the child wakes choking.
For three hours you wait in emergency
                                                              and the boy sleeps himself well against you,
while an old man and then a woman come with broken-down hearts
and don't leave. You drive home at three and you stand with the boy
in the cold outside and you look up and show him the perfect celestial circle
 
 
10
Ringing the imperfect moon, and you wish you could tell him what it means.
This is what silence looks like, you think later,
                                                                            and a possum lands like ordnance
on the roof, and down in the paddock
a dozen souls are reborn in the bawling cattle and the fox plays the geese
like oboes with broken reeds. Night is the world in its other life.
 
 
11
One's own life is an absurd miracle, waning as long as it lasts,
in beauty or poverty, it makes no difference
                                                                              in the end. One is nothing anymore.
Our works are our children. They carry us on.
They tell us, as though we meant something more than our mere being
here. Landscape is another way, a practice longer than love and death.
 
 
12
For instance, the brown horse alone in the paddock all day,
the canting of the black cockatoos,
                                                              the grass parrots parsing the morning,
the grass trembling with afternoon, the paratactic catechism
of sulphur-crested cockatoos in the orange trees, the patience of the river.
Go the way the place goes; die beautifully to yourself.
 
 
13
Adopt the lively practice of the bluewrens in the hedge and the yoga of the hens.
Learn the rules,
                             and forget the rules,
like Basho in the naked birches on the river,
flaring now under blue cloud in the late light of winter. A small death. A second
coming. Drink tea and watch the landscape forget itself. Think of your life
 
 
14
in place, not time. Another time, you're walking home beside the same river.
Evening is crimson
                               along the horizon.
Look, you say to the child, pointing west.
It's over there, too, he says, pointing east. The place has you almost surrounded.
And there's a dragon, he says. (There's always a dragon.) Wingecarribee Zen.
 
 
15
But it's no good pretending; we are creation's anchorites.
The places don't sing,
                                GS said to me once; in particular they don't sing you--
George, a father to me, who died in his garden last week,
a man with a river in him when we met, until we fished it out, and I'm still in it.
They don't sing, GS; they just are. That's how they sing, and that's what they teach
 
 
16
And what you taught me. Time, that bad idea, is passing anyway, like water.
If you've been sleeping, you once said,
                                                               you've been missing nearly everything.
Meaning, the world wakes up at night; but what if it doesn't wake again?
Another time you said, You're either writing, or you're not; so why aren't you
writing? Well, I'm writing now. It's either raining, or it's not, and it's raining now
 
 
17
Like a life sentence on the roof and the paddocks and horses and the roos,
and deep down below
                             the syntax of the river and up a bit
my friend wakes from the anaesthetic
dark into the clinical noon of an American summer and wonders how the sun
got inside her and cast these shadows, and how much afternoon she'll get to keep.
 
 
18
Over east, beyond the ridge I can see from the desk and under the basalt hills
and the feet of the Holsteins
                                              and the potato fields and brown-barrel gums
an aquifer runs where it always ran;
but they're mining it now, and if they draw it all down, it'll keep the city in water
a week. And how much rain and time will it take to make it rise again?
 
 
19
But seven days is all eternity for a people with no memory;
the future is someone else's
                                              country to care for.
Landscape, though, has all the time in the world;
it's we who are running out. Cars careen like idiots through the dusk, and in the roof
the possum calls it a day, and the rain keeps on. It won't be enough, but it'll do.
 
 
20
My friend in Virginia who's singing her cancer down looks on cows with love,
and I think of her and it pleases me
                                             to work where cows came and stood each day and let men
drain them dry. This is still their concrete floor.
This is still their draught, coming off the edge of night and under the barn door.
Poems come like that, she told me once, on the wind to where we labour in wait.
 
 
21
But, listen: no one reads poems to learn how to vote. Verse can't change
the future's mind. You write it like rain;
                                                                              you enter it like nightfall.
It isn't for anything; a poem is country,
and it needs you to keep walking it, and I walk out into it now, carrying my friend
and smelling the paddocky wind and feeling the rain cold on my face.





Urban Eclogues
 

1
Adrift in the middle of my years, I sit in a corner and drink. I eavesdrop
a tableful of girls romancing their cell phones, workshopping
love's abstract particulars,
                                               while football plays on the big screen;
I listen like a thief in case the women know the score.
But I never could tell. At fulltime I walk home like a motherless child.
 
2
Witness is a solitary game. There isn't a thing I have left to say
but back in my room I ring like a singing bowl,
empty and unable to stop.
                                               You're in nine kinds of pain, my friend; you know
the twenty-seven strains of despair. And your lovely hair has fallen.
The moon at my window is a rusted shot, caught in its corrupt trajectory down.
 
3
The world was always someone else's oyster, a metaphor
I never could prise open. 
All I'm good for tonight
                                             is to let the night pass,
while beyond me the world peters and my friend fights beautifully
like a trout on god's line. The usual idiots are still in power. But they'll keep.





Red Moon Eclogues
 

I
Every year the moon inches away from us. In time she'll swim too far out
to anchor us at our habitual angle to the sun, and that will be the end
of the well-tempered and recursive wildness
                                                             that conceived and suffered us,
and that will be the end of us. We have just two
billion years to thank her for our time here. Eternity has a use-by date
 
II
But it'll be up long before that, and in the meantime,
I sit on the cold step of the cowshed and watch the world throw its shadow
on the moon like a horseblanket;
                                                             in the meantime the moon reddens
in the refraction of all our dawns and sunsets, in a kind of transfigured cosmic
smog. An apocalypse that lasts three hours until it's time to go to bed.
 
III
And in the meantime on the floor of my shed, blue planets sing in the hands
of children as they once sang in war. Two small worlds forged to cry terribly down
like creation unravelling upon one's foes now
                                                               make a peaceful clangour on my secular desk.
One spins from its orbit and quakes and chips its cerulean shell on the floor
of heaven. The tectonics of play. We are loved like this, and this is how it ends.
 
IV
I'm arguing a lot with death these days. And last night I found myself
in court poised to clinch the case against the absurdity of life.
Certainly, this was sleeping and certainly
                                                            I was dreaming and I'd been losing the thread,
but all at once I saw where my argument must run, and I was running it there
when my small boy cried and woke me and I went to him and now I'll never know.
 
V
Spring now, and the river has drawn back her bow. The lark ascends
from the cd-player, and black ducks sip brown ditchwater in the yard.
Everything's in bud or leaf, last of all
                                                              the silver poplars and the Osage Orange,
trees flaring even now in the backyard of the childhood of my friend, the poet,
the poet's son. The world happens twice. Draw the linen string taut and shoot.
 
VI
One lives in paradox. Debussy plays; trucks flounder past like gods
who've lost control of their machines. In between one makes one's life up.
The sound is the price you pay for the sight
                                                             that meets you every morning and half
of what you paid for the house. The shed puts the perfect sky in her pocket,
and possums rut in the roof. Eternity is in rehearsal, and this is its soundtrack.
 
VII
Brad mows an acre an hour. A general at ease on his machine, a banker
in overalls, he's rationalised our small republic on one tank of gas. And this now--
cutgrass at four o'clock--is how
                                                              hope smells. Some days I can see no way out:
the body of the world in entropy. But today I sit among the ruins
of the afternoon, and I cannot see how it can't all go on forever.
 
VIII
Meantime the moon has made herself new again, and there has been rain.
The Marulan hills, which had almost forgotten the taste of the word,
are spelling green again this afternoon,
                                                             and there's water in a lake that's been a paddock
for a decade. Three black cockatoos, and then three more, fly over as I take
the southwest road. And into all this panoply of hope, the new moon falls.





Woman and Child
 

They listen to the myna birds dicker in the grass.
   The child's blue shoes are caked with
garden dirt. When he runs, she sees the antics
   of a pair of wrens. She works the garden,
 
a pot of rusting gardenias has given off its ales
   and infused the danker germinations of her
grief. She watches her son chase pigeons,
   kick at the leaves piled high. Now, a magpie
 
adds to his cascades of laughter as he runs with
   the hose, pours a fine spray, happy to be giving
to the grass this silver courtship. She sighs,
   watches the drops settle in. Today, who
 
can explain the sadness she feels. Surely this
   day is to be treasured: the sun out, the breeze
like a cat's tongue licking a moon of milk;
   her son expending himself in small, public
 
bursts, happy among clover where bees hover,
   and unfold centrefolds of nectar. Today,
who can explain the heaviness in her head, as if
   all her worries were tomes toward a larger work,
 
one she knows she will never finish, but to which
   she must keep adding, thought by thought.
She sweeps the petals, smells their russet imprint.
   Soon dusk will come with an envoy of smoke
 
and her son outlast her patience by a rose.
   Already he is tiring, puling at the flowers.
It won't be long before they'll go in, listen
   to the jug purr comfort. He'll sleep and she'll
 
lie back, or get up to unhook the cry of her cat
   from the wire door. Now, a few cicadas are idling,
giving each other the gun and a cockatoo calls,
   a haughty felon. She sighs, knowing she won't
 
escape her mood today, the turned earth
   or its rank persuasions; her child's petulance
flaring like an orchid, or a cockatoo's unruly crest.
   Today, she knows she will need to consider
 
her unhappiness, of what she is a prisoner  if not
   the loss of hope's particulars. Her son soaks
the path, rinses the sky of its featureless blue.
   He is giving that water, now, to everything.





The Kite
 

Today I watched a boy fly his kite.
It didn't crackle in the wind  but
gave out a barely perceptible hum.
 
At a certain height, I'd swear I heard
it sing. He could make it climb in
any wind; could crank those angles up,
 
make it veer with the precision of
an insect targeting a sting; then he'd
let it roil in rapturous finesse, a tiny
 
bird in mid-air courtship. When
lightning cracked across the cliff 
(like quick pale flicks of yak-hair
 
fly-whisks)  he stayed steady. For
so long he kept his arms up, as if
he knew he'd hoist that kite enough.
 
I asked if it was made of special silk,
if he used some particular string 
and what he'd heard while holding it.
 
He looked at me from a distance,
then asked about my alms bowl,
my robes, and about that for which
 
a monk lives. It was then I saw
I could tell him nothing in the cohort
wind, that didn't sound illusory.





How to Love Bats
 

Begin in a cave.
Listen to the floor boil with rodents, insects.
Weep for the pups that have fallen. Later,
you'll fly the narrow passages of those bones,
                                                       but for now --
 
open your mouth, out will fly names
like Pipistrelle, Desmodus, Tadarida. Then,
listen for a frequency
lower than the seep of water, higher
than an ice planet hibernating
beyond a glacier of Time.
 
Visit op shops. Hide in their closets.
Breathe in the scales and dust
of clothes left hanging. To the underwear
and to the crumbled black silks -- well,
give them your imagination
and plenty of line, also a night of gentle wind.
 
By now your fingers should have
touched petals open. You should have been dreaming
each night of anthers and of giving
to their furred beauty
your nectar-loving tongue. But also,
your tongue should have been practising the cold
of a slippery, frog-filled pond.
 
Go down on your elbows and knees.
You'll need a spieliologist's desire for rebirth
and a miner's paranoia of gases --
but try to find within yourself
the scent of a bat-loving flower.
 
Read books on pogroms. Never trust an owl.
Its face is the biography of propaganda.
Never trust a hawk. See its solutions
in the fur and bones of regurgitated pellets.
 
And have you considered the smoke
yet from a moving train? You can start
half an hour before sunset,
but make sure the journey is long, uninterrupted
and that you never discover
the faces of those Trans-Siberian exiles.
 
Spend time in the folds of curtains.
Seek out boarding-school cloakrooms.
Practise the gymnastics of web umbrellas.
 
                                             Are you
floating yet, thought-light,
without a keel on your breastbone?
Then, meditate on your bones as piccolos,
on mastering the thermals
beyond the tremolo; reverberations
beyond the lexical.
 
                                           Become adept
at describing the spectacles of the echo --
but don't watch dark clouds
passing across the moon. This may lead you
to fetishes and cults that worship false gods
by lapping up bowls of blood from a tomb.
 
Practise echo-locating aerodromes,
stamens. Send out rippling octaves
into the fossils of dank caves --
then edit these soundtracks
with a metronome of dripping rocks, heartbeats
and with a continuous, high-scaled wondering
about the evolution of your own mind.
 
But look, I must tell you -- these instructions
are no manual. Months of practice
may still only win you appreciation
of the acoustical moth,
hatred of the hawk and owl. You may need
 
to observe further the floating black host
through the hills.





Paralysis
 

Laid out flat
in the back of the station wagon my father borrowed
I look up:
the leaves are immense,
green and golden with clear summer light
breaking through 
though I turn only my neck
I can see all of them
along this avenue that has no limits.
 
What does it matter
that I am only eyes
if I am to be carried
so lightly
under the trees of the world?
From beyond the numbness of my strange body
the wealth of the leaves
falls forever
into my small still watching.





Persimmon
 

Like buying a ticket inland
                           to barely understandable provinces
with no language at all I bargain and pay
                                                      for this warm planet
tipping the scales of wrist and elbow
spreading my fingers with its weight to read
                                           my life-line my heart-line
my seams and mounds of fortune.
I stare
into the sun on smoggy evenings
                                     the throat of an old street oven
that seems to expand as I anticipate
                            its glow engulfing my solar system.
I open my mouth
                   and China fills it sliding into tartness
                                                               forcing my lips
to begin its name
over and over then finger-painting my chin
                                                with the gel of ripeness.
I swallow the pabulum of infancy
                                          the sweet mucilage of age.
It makes me eat like a person alone
                                          who hasn't loved for years.
There seems to be no core
                            the few black seeds hardly noticed
in its one undifferentiated cell
other tongue
               that makes mine lazy    the flavour . . .
                                                             the flavour is . . .
my hand moves like an incantation
through an alley of blunt flames
                                   that can be eaten with a spoon.
I gorge
on a people's staple
                            fat Buddha   squat Amida
                                                            repeat three times
persimmon persimmon persimmon
and go to heaven.





Equation
 

Someone said
                 that working through difficult equations
was like walking
in a pure and beautiful landscape 
                                              the numbers glowing
                                                           like works of art.
And in the same crowded room
a woman I thought I didn't like
                                               was singing to herself 
talking and listening
                                          but singing to herself too
and instantly
                        with the logic of numbers
                                                                       I liked her
as if she had balanced something
I couldn't.
The corridors are long and pristine
                                                          but I'm not lost 
just working
         towards some minute
                                                 or overwhelming
                                                                        equipoise.





Solitude
 

It's something they carry with them
                       explorers  night shifts  seamen 
like a good pair of binoculars
or a camera case
                perfectly and deeply compartmented.
It has a quiet patina
that both absorbs and reflects
                           like a valuable instrument
                                                you have to sign for
  contract with alone 
                     and at the end of the voyage
                                                          you get to keep.
Sometimes it's very far away.
Sometimes so close
               at first you think the person next to you
is picking up  putting down
                                 a personal cup
                                    a book in another language
before you realise what
 when talk has moved off
                               leaning its arms
                                       on someone else's table 
is being
handed to you.





The Poet Asks Forgiveness
 

Dead to the world I have failed you
Forgive me, traveller.
 
Thirsty, I was no fountain
Hungry, I was not bread
Tired, I was no pillow
 
Forgive my unwritten poems:
the many I have frozen with irony
the many I have trampled with anger
the many I have rejected in self-defence
the many I have ignored in fear
 
unaware, blind or fearful
I ignored them.
They clamoured everywhere
those unwritten poems.
They sought me out day and night
and I turned them away.
 
Forgive me the colours
they might have worn
Forgive me their eclipsed faces
They dared not venture from
the unwritten lines.
 
Under each inert hour of my silence
died a poem, unheeded





Letting Go
 

Tell the truth of experience
they say they also
say you must let
go learn to let go
let your children
go
 
and they go
and you stay
letting them go
because you are obedient and
respect everyone's freedom
to go and you stay
 
and you want to tell the truth
because you are yours truly
its obedient servant
but you can't because
you're feeling what you're not
supposed to feel you have
let them go and go and
 
you can't say what you feel
because they might read
this poem and feel guilty
and some post-modern hack
will back them up
and make you feel guilty
and stop feeling which is
post-modern and what
you're meant to feel
 
so you don't write a poem
you line up words in prose
inside a journal trapped
like a scorpion in a locked
drawer to be opened by
your children let go
after lived life and all the time
a great wave bursting
howls and rears and
 
you have to let go
or you're gone you're
gone gasping you
let go
till the next wave
towers crumbles
shreds you to lace--
 
When you wake
your spine is twisted
like a sea-bird
inspecting the sky,
stripped by lightning.





Soup and Jelly
 

"Feed Fred and sit with him
and mind he doesn't walk about.
He falls. Tell him his ute is safe
back home. Thinks someone's pinched it,
peers around the carpark all the time.
His family brought him in it and
he thinks it's gone.
He was a farmer once . . .
 
I take the tray. The ice-cream's almost
melted round the crumbled orange jelly
and the soup's too hot. I know
I'll have to blow on it.
 
Hunched, trapped behind a tray,
he glances sideways, face as brown
and caverned as the land itself,
long thin lips droop ironic
at the corners, gaunt nose.
The blue and white pajamas cage
the restless rangy legs.
In and out they go, the feet
in cotton socks feeling for the ground.
 
"Are you a foreigner?
"Not exactly. Just a little sunburnt,
and I put the jelly down. I musn't feel
a thing: my smile has come unstuck.
I place a paper napkin on his lap. He winces.
"You're a foreigner all right, he says.
"OK, I say. What's one displacement more or less,
wishing I were a hearty flat-faced Fenian
with a perm and nothing doing in the belfry.
Someone like his mother. Or a wife who
spared him the sorrow of himself.
Now he grabs the spoon. "I'll do it.
"Right, I say, "You go ahead. Just ask me
if you want some help. The tone's not right.
I watch the trembling progress of the spoon
for what seems years, paralysed with pity
for his pride.
 
How does a dark-faced woman give a man called Fred
who cropped a farm and drove a battered ute
a meal of soup and jelly?
 
Outside the window, clouds are swelling
into growing darkness and there's a man
hard on his knees planting something in the rain.





The Age of Aquarius
 

She slumps in the disabled bay
clutching a waffle-cotton gown
around a spreading paunch,
shambling breasts.
Why not say I'?
For that's who sits at 6 a.m.
waiting for the health club
pool to open in the rain.
A grown woman, after all,
supposed to know her whereabouts.
 
Today's my mother's birthday,
a 1907 Aquarian of the self-
denying kind, never say "I' her motto.
She had me nailed for years. Her voice
drowns out the radio's chattering static.
Now I'm the same age she was, dying,
observing noble savagery:
 
a gathering knot of skinny women,
tight black butts in leotards,
regulation sneakers, Brazil-waxed calves,
gripping i-pods, mobiles, water bottles.
The men stand back, silent, sullen,
balding, bored and out of it. Health stalkers,
renouncers of smoke and flame,
deniers of brimstone.
One hell of a century:
between the holocaust and the atom bomb
who are these people?
 
Between the deep and shallow end,
never say thank you or good morning.
Avoid eye contact.
Signals may be misinterpreted.
Slow Lane, Fast Lane, Walking Lane
Only's where I'm at.
The moving parts count laps:
twenty five's a half-hour's worth.
I sing myself a rumba to keep rhythm;
the Speedo wall clock ticks a strict 4/4
defeats my ruse while dove's feet skitter
arrow-wise across the perspex roof.
No Diving Running Eating Smiling
Share if lanes are busy.
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps.
 
The waiting crowd are all, like me,
up early talking or silent,
more vivacious than galahs,
more foolish than parrots.
 
We stand and wait, walk up and down
in the rain talking or not, holding
in sagging muscle, spreading paunch,
talking about things that must matter.
So much seems to hang on
getting in that door.





Loving in Truth
 

Someone will push the house over one day,
Some spacedozer give it a shove,
But the cobbles we laid down here in the yard,
These are a labour of love.
 
All winter we set these cobbles in place,
Or was it the summer as well?
Sorting through lumpy bluestone pitchers
For ones that looked suitable.
 
The old house decayed  along with us 
Will a strange new resident
Admire the patio made in joy
Wondering what we meant?
 
Things fall apart, the poet wrote,
Certainties crumble and move
But the cobbles oddly plotted together,
These are our labour of love.





Christ at Gallipoli
 

This synod is convinced that the forces  of the Allies are being used of God to  vindicate the rights of the weak and to  maintain the moral order of the world.                                                          Anglican Synod, Melbourne, 1916.
 
Bit weird at first,
That starey look in the eyes,
The hair down past his shoulders,
But after a go with the ship's barber,
A sea-water shower and the old slouch hat
Across his ears, he started to look the part.
Took him a while to get the way
A bayonet fits the old Lee-Enfield,
But going in on the boats
He looked calmer than any of us,
Just gazing in over the swell
Where the cliffs looked black against the sky.
When we hit he fairly raced in through the waves,
Then up the beach, swerving like a full-back at the end
When the Turks'd really got on to us.
Time we all caught up,
He was off like a flash, up the cliffs,
After his first machine gun.
He'd done for three Turks when we got there,
The fourth was a gibbering mess.
Seeing him wave that blood-red bayonet,
I reckoned we were glad
To have him on the side.





My Mothers God
 

My mother's God
has written the best
of the protestant proverbs:
 
you make the bed
you lie in it;
God helps him
 
who helps himself.
He tends to shy away from churches,
is more to be found in
 
phone calls to daughters
or rain clouds over rusty grass.
The Catholics
 
have got him wrong entirely:
too much waving the arms about,
the incense and caftan, that rainbow light.
 
He's leaner than that,
lean as a pair of
grocer's scales,
 
hard as a hammer at cattle sales
the third and final
time of asking.
 
His face is most clear
in a scrubbed wooden table
or deep in the shine of a
 
laminex bench.
He's also observed at weddings and funerals
by strict invitation, not knowing quite
 
which side to sit on.
His second book, my mother says,
is often now too well received;
 
the first is where the centre is,
tooth for claw and eye for tooth
whoever tried the other cheek?
 
Well, Christ maybe,
but that's another story.
God, like her, by dint of coursework
 
has a further degree in predestination.
Immortal, omniscient, no doubt of that,
he nevertheless keeps regular hours
 
and wipes his feet clean on the mat,
is not to be seen at three in the morning.
His portrait done in a vigorous charcoal
 
is fixed on the inner
curve of her forehead.
Omnipotent there
 
in broad black strokes
he does not move.
It is not easy, she'd confess,
 
to be my mother's God.





The Lid
 

The story keeps on coming back,
a man my father knew,
that grazier across the river
up north a mile or two,
 
a story that my father spun
to last me all my life
of how a man should not behave
when burying a wife.
 
All through the funeral he'd wept . . .
the priest there going on
about St Peter and the gates
through which his wife had gone.
 
His sobbing at the grave, Dad found,
was harder still to bear.
Then men in suits, the women in
the best they had to wear
 
knew deeper down it couldn't pass,
no matter who had died.
Extravagance like this was always
better kept inside.
 
At last the man who sent his beasts
to die on Tuesday gave
one final, high unseemly cry
and leapt into the grave.
 
Mate,' he yelled. Don't go. Don't go!'
And scrabbled at the wood.
A friend reached in to fish him out
as any Christian would.
 
The women in their hats stood back.
Two men jumped in the trench
and skidding on the polished lid
contrived at last to wrench
 
him out and lead him to his car.
The clergyman intoned
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.'
They heard the broken moans
 
coming from a side window.
He hammered at the wheel.
Mate,' he yelled. Don't leave me mate.'
Not knowing what to feel,
 
the mourners now were drifting off
towards their dusty cars.
My father always finished here
as if he'd gone too far.
 
But I could hear the slamming doors,
the hearse without much chrome
and duel decisions made to miss
the wake and head straight home.
 
Mate, oh mate!' the man had cried,
releasing all their fears.
The sound of boots on coffin wood
survives them down the years.





Incident at Grantley Manor
 

Seven o'clock, the time set in his mind
Like herbs displayed in aspic, as the chimes
Were striking. Then the squeaking of his shoes'
 
Black leather tread, pacing those measures down
The first-floor hall, where sunset's apricot
Was oozing nectar through the open doors.
 
Her voice, conspiratorial and astonished,
Called him across the bedroom's drowning cube
Towards the window. How well Miss Waterson
 
Remembers it: "Please come and look at this,
Mr Devine; the clock on the mantelpiece
Rehearsing for the hour of seven. She pointed
 
Down. There, a moving picture on the lawn,
His father, like a patient whose long months
Of immobility meant learning afresh
 
The art of walking, climbing the light's green slope
Towards the summer house, looking intently
As though for a cuff link or a signature.
 
That evening he still thinks of, lying now,
No longer needing lessons for his legs,
How he cast back his glance and saw the windows
 
Blazing like cats' eyes on his uselessness,
And in that golden mirror, two gold figures
Recording him, two shadows of dark gold--
 
Miss Waterson (was it?) and another one--
And then took out his watch on which the hands
Were so meticulously assembling seven.
 
Young Emily, appointed just the week
Before, came rushing to the stairs--she'd seen
Him stumble--to advise Mr Devine
 
About his father's fall. And so, almost
Immobilized herself in that clinging syrup,
She observed the hall clock's quaint rendition of
 
Seven, the time set clearly in his mind
Like summer herbs in aspic, as the chimes
Were striking. Then the squeaking of his shoes'
 
Black leather tread, pacing those measures down
The corridor, where sunset's apricot
Was oozing nectar through the open doors.
 
Her voice, companionable but astonished,
Floated across the bedroom's drowning cube
As he descended. How well Miss Waterson
 
Remembers it: "Please come and look at this;
And Emily, who had just been taken on
That week, came rushing to the window. She pointed
 
Down, smartly on the stroke of seven. There,
A moving picture on the lawn, was old
Mr Devine, like a patient whose long months
 
Of immobility meant learning afresh
The art of walking, climbing the light's green slope
Abstractedly towards the rose garden.
 
That evening he still thinks of, lying now,
No longer needing lessons for his legs,
How he cast back his glance and saw the windows
 
Glaring like cats' eyes on his helplessness,
And in that golden mirror, two gold figures
Gesticulating, two shadows of dark gold--
 
The new girl (was it?) and another one--
And then took out his watch on which the hands
Were so laboriously assembling seven.
 
Miss Waterson, with Emily behind her
In a panic, dashed to the stairs to find
Mr Devine, anxious to let him know
 
About his father's fall. And there they saw him,
Almost immobile in that clinging syrup,
And heard the hall clock's muffled tolling of
 
Seven, the time set firmly in his mind . . .





At the Parrot House, Taronga Park
 

What images could yet suggest their range
of tender colours, thick as old brocade,
or shot silk or flowers on a dress
where black and rose and lime seem to caress
the red that starts to shimmer as they fade?
 
Like something half-remembered from a dream
they come from places we have never seen.
 
They chatter and they squawk and sometimes scream.
 
Here the macaw clings at the rings to show
the young galahs talking as they feed
with feathers soft and pink as dawn on snow
that it too has a dry and dusky tongue.
Their murmuring embraces every need
from languid vanity to wildest greed.
 
In the far corner sit two smoky crones
their heads together in a kind of love.
One cleans the other's feathers while it moans.
The others seem to whisper behind fans
while noble dandies gamble in a room
asserting values everyone rejects.
 
A lidded eye observes, and it reflects.
 
The peacocks still pretend they own the yard.
 
For all the softness, how the beaks are hard.





Night Life
 

Disturbed at 2 a.m. I hear a claw
scratching the window, tapping at the pane,
and then I realise, a broken branch,
and yet I can't turn back to sleep again.
 
Slowly, not to wake you, I get up,
thinking of food, perhaps a quiet read.
A cockroach runs across the kitchen floor,
its lacquered shell as quick and dry as seed.
 
Outside the chalice lily lifts its cup
in adoration to the mirrored moon,
full of purpose as it trembles there,
collecting drops of moisture on its spoon.
 
Noises of the night, it's all alive,
birds shifting in the steady trees,
slugs and snails eating fallen flowers,
a moth freighted with fragilities.
 
Nocturnal life, the other side of things,
proceeding whether we observe or not,
like rows and rows of brown coastal ants
transporting food from here to another spot.





Summer of the Ladybirds
 

Can we learn wisdom watching insects now,
or just the art of quiet observation?
Creatures from the world of leaf and flower
marking weather's variation.
 
The huge dry summer of the ladybirds
(we thought we'd never feel such heat again)
started with white cabbage butterflies
sipping at thin trickles in the drain.
 
Then one by one the ladybirds appeared
obeying some far purpose or design.
We marvelled at their numbers in the garden,
grouped together, shuffling in a line.
 
Each day a few strays turned up at the table,
the children laughed to see them near the jam
exploring round the edges of a spoon.
One tried to drink the moisture on my arm.
 
How random and how frail seemed their lives,
and yet how they persisted, refugees,
saving energy by keeping still
and hiding in the grass and in the trees.
 
And then one day they vanished overnight.
Clouds gathered, storm exploded, weather cleared.
And all the wishes that we might have had
in such abundance simply disappeared.





Song for Connie
 

The sun met the moon at the corner
           noon in thin air
 
Commotion you later
           choose to notice
 
Love shapes the heart
           that once was pieces
 
You take in hand
           the heart in mind
 
Your fate's consistent
           alongside mine
 
Unless a mess
           your best guess
 
That is right, thanks, the intimate
           fact that you elect it
 
At corners, dressed or naked, with lips taste         
           full body, time thick or thin, fixated
 
Love, take heart
           as heart takes shape
 
And recognition
           ceases to be obscure
 
One line down the center
           another flying outward enters





Gilligans Island
 

The Professor and Ginger are standing in the space in front 
of the Skipper's cabin. The Professor is wearing deck shoes,
brushed denim jeans, and a white shirt open at the throat.
Ginger is wearing spike heels, false eyelashes, and a white
satin kimono. The Professor looks at her with veiled lust
in his eyes. He raises an articulate eyebrow and addresses
her as Cio-Cio-San. Ginger blanches and falls on her knife.
 
* * *
 
Meanwhile it is raining in northern California. In a tiny
village on the coast, Rod Taylor and Tippi Hedren are totally
concerned. They realize that something terrible is happening.
Each has been savagely attacked by a wild songbird within
the last twenty-four hours. Outside their window thousands
of birds have gathered in anticipation of the famous school-
yard scene. Tippi Hedren is wearing a colorful lipstick.
 
* * *
 
Ginger stares back at the Professor. His sullen good looks
are the perfect foil for her radiant smile. The Skipper and
Gilligan come into sight. The Skipper has been chasing
Gilligan around the lagoon for a long time now. Gilligan
holds onto his hat in the stupid way he has of doing things
like that. The Professor's lips part in a sneer of perfect
contempt. Ginger bares her teeth, as if in appreciation.
 
* * *
 
Jackie Kennedy bares her teeth. Behind and above her, the
muzzle of a high-powered rifle protrudes from a window. A little
man is aiming at Jackie Kennedy's husband. The man is wearing
bluejeans and a white T-shirt. There isn't a bird to be seen.
As he squeezes the trigger, the little man mutters between
clenched teeth, "Certs is a candy mint. The hands of Jackie
Kennedy's husband jerk automatically toward his head.
 
* * *
 
The Professor is noticing Ginger's breasts. He thinks of
the wife he left at home, who probably thinks he's dead.
He thinks of his mother, and all of the women he has ever
known. Mr. and Mrs. Howell are asleep in their hut, secure
in their little lives as character actors. Ginger shifts her
weight to the other foot. The intensity of the moment reminds
the Professor of a Japanese city before the end of the war.
 
* * *
 
In his mind he goes down each aisle in his government class,
focusing on each face, each body. He is lying on his bed
with his white shirt off and his trousers open. Dorothy
Kirsten's voice fills the room. He settles on a boy who sits
two desks behind him. He begins to masturbate, his body moving
in time with the sad music. At moments like these he feels
farthest away. As he shoots, his lips part and he bares his teeth.
 
* * *
 
The Professor and Ginger are watching each other across the
narrow space. The Skipper and Gilligan have disappeared down
the beach. The Howells are quietly snoring. The Professor
and Ginger are alone. From the woods comes the sound of
strange birds. From the water comes a thick and eerie
tropical silence. The famous conversation scene is about
to start. Clouds appear in the sky, and it begins to snow.





White Petals
 

The Republic lies in the blossoms of Washington.  --Robert Bly
White petals
drop into the dark river.
Heedless of political significance,
they ride out to the sea like stars.
 
I'm the space explorer.
I travel to a planet
where there are no plants or animals.
Everyone lives in harmony.
I don't want to go home.
 
I'm the pioneer man and the pioneer woman,
both at the same time.
I build my house with my own hands,
and it's beautiful,
with simple, perfect lines.
 
I'm the farmer waiting for the vegetables
to grow, so I can eat.
I'm the hunter aiming at the bear.
I don't want to shoot it, but my family needs meat.
The bear gives me a long dumb animal look.
We'll use his skin for blankets,
his fat to light our lamps.
Our cabin will stink all night.
 
I'm the cabin boy who graduates to captain.
Shipboard sex is rough, but it suits my taste.
I'm the man on the steps of the house
where the President's widow lives.
All night I wait for the stranger
to get out of his car
so I can flash my look of recognition.
 
I'm the cowpoke who sleeps with his horses.
I'm the man who loves dogs.
I'm the cranky President sneaking away
to swim in the Potomac.
 
I'm the black man.
I close my eyes
and it gets dark inside.
 
I feel the sun on my face.
I see the light through my eyelids.
It's bright, intelligent
free of all cares.
 
I'm the heir of a great American family.
My success is guaranteed.
Unexpected tragedy is all that can stop me.
I'm the popular senator teaching his son to shave.





Pretty Convincing
 

Talking to my friend Emily, whose drinking
patterns and extravagance of personal
feeling are a lot like mine, I'm pretty
convinced when she explains the things we do
while drinking (a cocktail to celebrate the new
account turns into a party that lasts till 3
a.m. and a terrific hangover) indicate
a problem of a sort I'd not considered.
I've been worried about how I metabolize
the sauce for four years, since my second bout
of hepatitis, when I kissed all the girls
at Christmas dinner and turned bright yellow
Christmas night, but never about whether
I could handle it. It's been more of a given,
the stage set for my life as an artistic queer,
as much of a tradition in these New York circles
as incense for Catholics or German
shepherds for the blind. We re-enact
the rituals, and our faces, like smoky icons
in a certain light, seem to learn nothing
but understand all. It comforts me
yet isn't all that pleasant, like drinking
Ripple to remember high school. A friend
of mine has been drinking in the same bar for decades,
talking to the same types, but progressively
fewer blonds. Joe LeSueur says he's glad
to have been a young man in the Fifties with his
Tab Hunter good looks, because that was the image
men desired; now it's the Puerto Rican
angel with great eyes and a fierce fidelity
that springs out of machismo, rather than a moral
choice. His argument is pretty convincing, too,
except lots of the pretty blonds I've known
default by dying young, leaving the field
to the swarthy. Cameron Burke, the dancer
and waiter at Magoo's, killed on his way home from
the Pines when a car hit his bike on the Sunrise Highway.
Henry Post dead of AIDS, a man I thought would be around
forever, surprising me by his mortality the way
I was surprised when I heard he was not
the grandson of Emily Post at all, just pretending,
like the friend he wrote about in Playgirl, Blair Meehan,
was faking when he crashed every A List party for a year
by pretending to be Kay Meehan's son, a masquerade
that ended when a hostess told him "Your mother's here
and led him by the hand to the dowager--Woman, behold
thy son--underneath a darkening conviction that all,
if not wrong, was not right. By now Henry may have faced
the same embarrassment at some cocktail party in the sky.
Stay as outrageously nasty as you were. And Patrick
Mack, locked into memory as he held court in the Anvil
by the downstairs pinball machine, and writhing
as he danced in Lita Hornick's parlor when the Stimulators
played her party, dead last week of causes I don't know,
as if the cause and not the effect were the problem.
My blond friend Chuck Shaw refers to the Bone-
crusher in the Sky, and I'm starting to
imagine a road to his castle lit by radiant
heads of blonds on poles as streetlamps for the gods,
flickering on at twilight as I used to do
in the years when I crashed more parties and acted
more outrageously and met more beauties and made
more enemies than ever before or ever again, I pray.
It's spring and there's another crop of kids
with haircuts from my childhood and inflated self-esteem
from my arrival in New York, who plug into the history
of prettiness, convincing to themselves and the devout.
We who are about to catch the eye of someone
new salute as the cotillion passes, led by blonds
and followed by the rest of us, a formal march
to the dark edge of the ballroom where we step out
onto the terrace and the buds of the forsythia
that hides the trash sprout magically
at our approach. I toast it
as memorial to dreams as fragile and persistent
as a blond in love. My clothes smell like the smoky
bar, but the sweetness of the April air's
delicious when I step outside and fill
my lungs, leaning my head back
in a first-class seat on the shuttle
between the rowdy celebration of the great deeds
to come and an enormous Irish wake in which
the corpses change but the party goes on forever.





Ordinary Time
 

Which are the magic
moments in ordinary
time? All of them,
for those who can see.
That is what redemption
means, I decide
at the meeting. Then
walk with David wearing
his new Yale T-shirt
and new long hair to 103.
Leonard and Eileen come, too.
Leonard wears a shark's tooth
on a chain around his neck
and long blond hair.
These days he's the manager
of Boots and Saddles ("Bras
and Girdles, my beloved
Bobby used to say) and
costumer for the Gay Cable
Network's Dating Game.
One week the announcer is
a rhinestone cowboy, sequin
shirt and black fur chaps,
the next a leatherman, etc.
Eileen's crewcut makes
her face light up.
Underneath our hairstyles,
23 years of sobriety, all told--
the age of a girl who's "not
so young but not so very old,
wrote Berryman, who flew
from his recovery with the force
of a poet hitting bottom.
It's not the way I choose
to go out of this restaurant
or day today, and I
have a choice. Wanda
the comedian comes over
to our table. "Call me
wicked Wanda, she smirks
when we're introduced.
Why is New York City
awash in stand-up comics
at the least funny point
in its history? Still,
some things stay the same.
People wonder what the people
in their buildings would think
if the ones who were wondering
became incredibly famous,
as famous as Madonna.
Debby Harry lived in Eileen's
building in the Village
in the early seventies, and she
was just the shy girl
in the band upstairs.
Poets read the writing
of their friends, and
are happy when they like it
thoroughly, when the work's
that good and the crippling
sense of competition stays away.
Trips get planned: David
home to California, Eileen
to New Mexico, Chris and I
to France and Spain, on vectors
which will spread out
from a single point, like ribs
of an umbrella. Then
after the comfort of a wedge
of blueberry peach pie and cup
of Decaf, sober friends
thread separate ways home
through the maze of blankets
on the sidewalk covered with
the scraps of someone else's life.
Mine consists of understanding
that the magic isn't something
that I make, but something
that shines through the things
I make and do and say
the way a brooch or scrap of fabric
shines from the detritus
to catch Leonard's eye
and be of use for costumes,
when I am fearless and thorough
enough to give it room,
all the room there is in ordinary
time, which embraces all
the people and events and hopes
that choke the street tonight
and still leaves room for everyone
and everything and every
other place, the undescribed
and indescribable, more various
and cacophonous than voice
can tell or mind conceive,
and for the sky's vast depths
from which they're all
a speck of light.





G-9
 

I'm at a double wake
in Springfield, for a childhood
friend and his father
who died years ago. I join
my aunt in the queue of mourners
and walk into a brown study,
a sepia room with books
and magazines. The father's
in a coffin; he looks exhumed,
the worse for wear. But where
my friend's remains should be
there's just the empty base
of an urn. Where are his ashes?
His mother hands me
a paper cup with pills:
leucovorin, Zovirax,
and AZT.  "Henry
wanted you to have these,"
she sneers. "Take all
you want, for all the good
they'll do."  "Dlugos.
Meester Dlugos."  A lamp
snaps on. Raquel,
not Welch, the chubby
nurse, is standing by my bed.
It's 6 a.m., time to flush
the heplock and hook up
the I.V. line. False dawn
is changing into day, infusing
the sky above the Hudson
with a flush of light.
My roommate stirs
beyond the pinstriped curtain.
My first time here on G-9,
the AIDS ward, the cheery
D & D Building intentionality
of the decor made me feel
like jumping out a window.
I'd been lying on a gurney
in an E.R. corridor
for nineteen hours, next to
a psychotic druggie
with a voice like Abbie
Hoffman's. He was tied
up, or down, with strips
of cloth (he'd tried to slug
a nurse) and sent up
a grating adenoidal whine
all night. "Nurse . . . nurse . . .
untie me, please . . . these
rags have strange powers."
By the time they found
a bed for me, I was in
no mood to appreciate the clever
curtains in my room,
the same fabric exactly
as the drapes and sheets
of a P-town guest house
in which I once--partied? stayed?
All I can remember is
the pattern. Nor did it
help to have the biggest queen
on the nursing staff
clap his hands delightedly
and welcome me to AIDS-land.
I wanted to drop
dead immediately. That
was the low point. Today
these people are my friends,
in the process of restoring
me to life a second time.
I can walk and talk
and breathe simultaneously
now. I draw a breath
and sing "Happy Birthday"
to my roommate Joe.
He's 51 today. I didn't think
he'd make it. Three weeks
ago they told him that he had
aplastic anemia, and nothing
could be done. Joe had been
a rotten patient, moaning
operatically, throwing chairs
at nurses. When he got
the bad news, there was
a big change. He called
the relatives with whom
he had been disaffected,
was anointed and communicated
for the first time since the age
of eight when he was raped
by a priest, and made a will.
As death drew nearer, Joe
grew nicer, almost serene.
Then the anemia
began to disappear, not
because of medicines, but
on its own. Ready to die,
it looks like Joe has more
of life to go. He'll go
home soon. "When will you
get out of here?" he asks me.
I don't know; when the X-ray
shows no more pneumonia.
I've been here three weeks
this time. What have I
accomplished? Read some
Balzac, spent "quality
time" with friends, come back
from death's door, and
prayed, prayed a lot.
Barry Bragg, a former
lover of a former
lover and a new
Episcopalian, has AIDS too,
and gave me a leatherbound
and gold-trimmed copy of the Office,
the one with all the antiphons.
My list of daily intercessions
is as long as a Russian
novel. I pray about AIDS
last. Last week I made a list
of all my friends who've died
or who are living and infected.
Every day since, I've remembered
someone I forgot to list.
This morning it was Chasen
Gaver, the performance poet
from DC. I don't know
if he's still around. I liked
him and could never stand
his poetry, which made it
difficult to be a friend,
although I wanted to defend
him one excruciating night
at a Folio reading, where
Chasen snapped his fingers
and danced around spouting
frothy nonsense about Andy
Warhol to the rolling eyes
of self-important "language-
centered" poets, whose dismissive
attitude and ugly manners
were worse by far than anything
that Chasen ever wrote.
Charles was his real name;
a classmate at Antioch
dubbed him "Chasen," after
the restaurant, I guess.
Once I start remembering,
so much comes back.
There are forty-nine names
on my list of the dead,
thirty-two names of the sick.
Cookie Mueller changed
lists Saturday. They all
will, I guess, the living,
I mean, unless I go
before them, in which case
I may be on somebody's
list myself. It's hard
to imagine so many people
I love dying, but no harder
than to comprehend so many
already gone. My beloved
Bobby, maniac and boyfriend.
Barry reminded me that he
had sex with Bobby
on the coat pile at this Christmas
party, two years in a row.
That's the way our life
together used to be, a lot
of great adventures. Who'll
remember Bobby's stories
about driving in his debutante
date's father's white Mercedes
from hole to hole of the golf course
at the poshest country club
in Birmingham at 3 a.m.,
or taking off his clothes
in the redneck bar on a dare,
or working on Stay Hungry
as the dresser of a then-
unknown named Schwarzenegger.
Who will be around to anthologize
his purple cracker similes:
"Sweatin' like a nigger
on Election Day, "Hotter
than a half-fucked fox
in a forest fire. The ones
that I remember have to do
with heat, Bobby shirtless,
sweating on the dance floor
of the tiny bar in what is now
a shelter for the indigent
with AIDS on the dockstrip,
stripping shirts off Chuck Shaw,
Barry Bragg and me, rolling
up the tom rags, using them
as pom-poms, then bolting
off down West Street, gracefully
(despite the overwhelming
weight of his inebriation)
vaulting over trash cans
as he sang, "I like to be
in America in a Puerto Rican
accent. When I pass,
who'll remember, who will care
about these joys and wonders?
I'm haunted by that more
than by the faces
of the dead and dying.
A speaker crackles near
my bed and nurses
streak down the corridor.
The black guy on the respirator
next door bought the farm,
Maria tells me later, but
only when I ask. She has tears
in her eyes. She'd known him
since his first day on G-9
a long time ago. Will I also
become a fond, fondly regarded
regular, back for stays
the way retired retiring
widowers return to the hotel
in Nova Scotia or Provence
where they vacationed with
their wives? I expect so, although
that's down the road; today's
enough to fill my plate. A bell
rings, like the gong that marks
the start of a fight. It's 10
and Derek's here to make
the bed, Derek who at 16
saw Bob Marley's funeral
in the football stadium
in Kingston, hot tears
pouring down his face.
He sings as he folds
linens, "You can fool
some of the people some
of the time, dancing
a little softshoe as he works.
There's a reason he came in
just now; Divorce Court
drones on Joe's TV, and
Derek is hooked. I can't
believe the script is plausible
to him, Jamaican hipster
that he is, but he stands
transfixed by the parade
of faithless wives and screwed-up
husbands. The judge is testy;
so am I, unwilling
auditor of drivel. Phone
my friends to block it out:
David, Jane and Eileen. I missed
the bash for David's magazine
on Monday and Eileen's reading
last night. Jane says that
Marie-Christine flew off
to Marseilles where her mother
has cancer of the brain,
reminding me that AIDS
is just a tiny fragment
of life's pain. Eileen has
been thinking about Bobby, too,
the dinner that we threw
when he returned to New York
after getting sick. Pencil-thin,
disfigured by KS, he held forth
with as much kinetic charm
as ever. What we have
to cherish is not only
what we can recall of how
things were before the plague,
but how we each responded
once it started. People
have been great to me.
An avalanche of love
has come my way
since I got sick, and not
just moral support.
Jaime's on the board
of PEN's new fund
for AIDS; he's helping out.
Don Windham slipped a check
inside a note, and Brad
Gooch got me something
from the Howard Brookner Fund.
Who'd have thought when we
dressed up in ladies'
clothes for a night for a hoot
in Brad ("June Buntt) and
Howard ("Lili La Lean)'s suite
at the Chelsea that things
would have turned out this way:
Howard is dead at 35, Chris Cox
("Kay Sera Sera)'s friend Bill
gone too, "Bernadette of Lourdes
(guess who) with AIDS,
God knows how many positive.
Those 14th Street wigs and enormous
stingers and Martinis don't
provoke nostalgia for a time
when love and death were less
inextricably linked, but
for the stories we would tell
the morning after, best
when they involved our friends,
second-best, our heroes.
J.J. Mitchell was master
of the genre. When he learned
he had AIDS, I told him
he should write them down.
His mind went first. I'll tell you
one of his best. J.J. was
Jerome Robbins' houseguest
At Bridgehampton. Every morning
they would have a contest
to see who could finish
the Times crossword first.
Robbins always won, until
a day when he was clearly
baffled. Grumbling, scratching
over letters, he finally
threw his pen down. "J.J.,
tell me what I'm doing wrong.
One clue was "Great 20th-c.
choreographer. The solution
was "Massine, but Robbins
had placed his own name
in the space. Every word
around it had been changed
to try to make the puzzle
work, except that answer.
At this point there'd be
a horsey laugh from J.J.
--"Isn't that great?
he'd say through clenched
teeth ("Locust Valley lockjaw).
It was, and there were lots
more where that one came from,
only you can't get there anymore.
He's dropped into the maw
waiting for the G-9
denizens and for all flesh,
as silent as the hearts
that beat upon the beds
up here: the heart of the drop-
dead beautiful East Village
kid who came in yesterday,
Charles Frost's heart nine inches
from the spleen they're taking
out tomorrow, the heart of
the demented girl whose screams
roll down the hallways
late at night, hearts that long
for lovers, for reprieve,
for old lives, for another chance.
My heart, so calm most days,
sinks like a brick
to think of all that heartache.
I've been staying sane with
program tools, turning everything
over to God "as I understand
him.  I don't understand him.
Thank God I read so much
Calvin last spring; the absolute
necessity of blind obedience
to a sometimes comforting,
sometimes repellent, always
incomprehensible Source
of light and life stayed
with me. God can seem
so foreign, a parent
from another country,
like my Dad and his own
father speaking Polish
in the kitchen. I wouldn't
trust a father or a God
too much like me, though.
That is why I pack up all
my cares and woes, and load them
on the conveyor belt, the speed
of which I can't control, like
Chaplin on the assembly line
in Modern Times or Lucy on TV.
I don't need to run
machines today. I'm standing
on a moving sidewalk
headed for the dark
or light, whatever's there.
Duncan Hannah visits, and
we talk of out-of-body
experiences. His was
amazing. Bingeing on vodka
in his dorm at Bard, he woke
to see a naked boy
in fetal posture on the floor.
Was it a corpse, a classmate,
a pickup from the blackout
of the previous night? Duncan
didn't know. He struggled
out of bed, walked over
to the youth, and touched
his shoulder. The boy turned;
it was Duncan himself.
My own experience was
milder, don't make me flee
screaming from the room
as Duncan did. It happened
on a Tibetan meditation
weekend at the Cowley Fathers'
house in Cambridge.
Michael Koonsman led it,
healer whose enormous paws
directed energy. He touched
my spine to straighten up
my posture, and I gasped
at the rush. We were chanting
to Tara, goddess of compassion
and peace, in the basement chapel
late at night. I felt myself
drawn upward, not levitating
physically, but still somehow
above my body. A sense
of bliss surrounded me.
It lasted ten or fifteen
minutes. When I came down,
my forehead hurt. The spot
where the "third eye appears
in Buddhist art felt
as though someone had pushed
a pencil through it.
The soreness lasted for a week.
Michael wasn't surprised.
He did a lot of work
with people with AIDS
in the epidemic's early days
but when he started losing
weight and having trouble
with a cough, he was filled
with denial. By the time
he checked into St. Luke's,
he was in dreadful shape.
The respirator down his throat
squelched the contagious
enthusiasm of his voice,
but he could still spell out
what he wanted to say
on a plastic Ouija board
beside his bed. When
the doctor who came in
to tell him the results
of his bronchoscopy said,
"Father, I'm afraid I have
bad news, Michael grabbed
the board and spelled,
"The truth is always
Good News. After he died,
I had a dream in which
I was a student in a class
that he was posthumously
teaching. With mock annoyance
he exclaimed, "Oh, Tim!
I can't believe you really think
that AIDS is a disease!
There's evidence in that
direction, I'll tell him
if the dream recurs: the shiny
hamburger-in-lucite look
of the big lesion on my face;
the smaller ones I daub
with makeup; the loss
of forty pounds in a year;
the fatigue that comes on
at the least convenient times.
The symptoms float like algae
on the surface of the grace
that buoys me up today.
Arthur comes in with
the Sacrament, and we have
to leave the room (Joe's
Italian family has arrived
for birthday cheer) to find
some quiet. Walk out
to the breezeway, where
it might as well be
August for the stifling
heat. On Amsterdam,
pedestrians and drivers are
oblivious to our small aerie,
as we peer through the grille
like cloistered nuns. Since
leaving G-9 the first time,
I always slow my car down
on this block, and stare up
at this window, to the unit
where my life was saved.
It's strange how quickly
hospitals feel foreign
when you leave, and how normal
their conventions seem as soon
as you check in. From below,
it's like checking out the windows
of the West Street Jail; hard
to imagine what goes on there,
even if you know firsthand.
The sun is going down as I
receive communion. I wish
the rite's familiar magic
didn't dull my gratitude
for this enormous gift.
I wish I had a closer personal
relationship with Christ,
which I know sounds corny
and alarming. Janet Campbell
gave me a remarkable ikon
the last time I was here;
Christ is in a chair, a throne,
and St. John the Divine,
an androgyne who looks a bit
like Janet, rests his head
upon the Savior's shoulder.
James Madden, priest of Cowley,
dead of cancer earlier
this year at 39, gave her
the image, telling her not to
be afraid to imitate St. John.
There may come a time when
I'm unable to respond with words,
or works, or gratitude to AIDS;
a time when my attitude
caves in, when I'm as weak
as the men who lie across
the dayroom couches hour
after hour, watching sitcoms,
drawing blanks. Maybe
my head will be shaved
and scarred from surgery;
maybe I'll be pencil-
thin and paler than
a ghost, pale as the vesper
light outside my window now.
It would be good to know
that I could close my eyes
and lean my head back
on his shoulder then,
as natural and trusting
as I'd be with a cherished
love. At this moment,
Chris walks in, Christopher
Earl Wiss of Kansas City
and New York, my lover,
my last lover, my first
healthy and enduring relationship
in sobriety, the man
with whom I choose
to share what I have
left of life and time.
This is the hardest
and happiest moment
of the day. G-9
is no place to affirm
a relationship. Two hours
in a chair beside my bed
after eight hours of work
night after night for weeks
 it's been a long haul,
and Chris gets tired.
Last week he exploded,
"I hate this, I hate your
being sick and having AIDS
and lying in a hospital
where I can only see you
with a visitor's pass. I hate
that this is going to
get worse. I hate it,
too. We kiss, embrace,
and Chris climbs into bed
beside me, to air-mattress
squeaks. Hold on. We hold on
to each other, to a hope
of how we'll be when I get out.
Let him hold on, please
don't let him lose his
willingness to stick with me,
to make love and to make
love work, to extend
the happiness we've shared.
Please don't let AIDS
make me a monster
or a burden is my prayer.
Too soon, Chris has to leave.
I walk him to the elevator
bank, then totter back
so Raquel can open my I.V.
again. It's not even
mid-evening, but I'm nodding
off. My life's so full, even
(especially?) when I'm here
on G-9. When it's time
to move on to the next step,
that will be a great adventure,
too. Helena Hughes, Tibetan
Buddhist, tells me that
there are three stages in death.
The first is white, like passing
through a thick but porous wall.
The second stage is red;
the third is black; and then
you're finished, ready
for the next event. I'm glad
she has a road map, but I don't
feel the need for one myself.
I've trust enough in all
that's happened in my life,
the unexpected love
and gentleness that rushes in
to fill the arid spaces
in my heart, the way the city
glow fills up the sky
above the river, making it
seem less than night. When
Joe O'Hare flew in last week,
he asked what were the best
times of my New York years;
I said "Today, and meant it.
I hope that death will lift me
by the hair like an angel
in a Hebrew myth, snatch me with
the strength of sleep's embrace,
and gently set me down
where I'm supposed to be,
in just the right place.





The Far West
 

The city and the continent
trail off into cold black
water the same way: at
the western edge, a flat
stretch with precipitous
planes set perpendicular
and back from the beach
or beach-equivalent, a blacktop
margin where the drugged
and dying trudge, queue up
for Hades. Bolinas
had its junkie lady with gray
skin, gray sweater, stumbling
through the sand with the short-
burst intensity and long-run aimlessness
of crackhead hustlers on the West Street piers.
Dreams of Bolinas haunted me for years
before I saw it. I'd huddle
at the foot of the cliff in a cold
wind late at night, wrapped
in Indian blankets, waiting
with strangers as the tidal wave
or temblor hit. Tonight I walk
with old friends in a new dream
past a vest-pocket park of great
formality and charm in the far
West Village. My disaffected
former confidant has grown
a pony tail and cruises up
the street on a "hog, a "chopper,
which seems a perfect locomotive choice.
I walk out to the quay where gondola
after enormous gondola departs
for "the other side, not New Jersey
anymore, anymore than something
prosaic as another mass of land
past the bright horizon
could function as a mirror
of the chopped-away Bolinas hill.
O western edge, where points
of interest on maps of individual
hearts and bodies disappear
in waters of a depth unfathomable
even in a dream, I had thought
that sleep was meant to blunt
your sharpness, not to hone
and polish with the lapping
of the hungry waves of Lethe.





Parachute
 

The Bergman image of a game
of chess with Death,
though not in a dreamscape
black-and-white as melancholy
films clanking with symbols,
but in a garden in Provence
with goldfish in the fountain
and enormous palms whose topmost
fronds cut into the eternal
blue of sky above the Roman
ruins and the dusty streets
where any door may lead to life's
most perfect meal: that is what
I think of when I remember
I have AIDS. But when
I think of how AIDS kills
my friends, especially
the ones whose paths
through life have least
prepared them to resist
the monster, I think of
an insatiable and prowling beast
with razor teeth and a persistent
stink that sticks to every
living branch of flower
its rank fur brushes
as it stalks its prey.
I think of that disgusting
animal eating my beautiful friends,
innocent as baby deer. Dwight:
so delicate and vain, his spindly
arms and legs pinned down with needles,
pain of tubes and needles, his narrow
chest inflated by machine, his mind
lost in the seven-minute gap
between the respirator's failure
and the time the nurses noticed
something wrong. I wrapped
my limbs around that fragile body
for the first time seven years
ago, in a cheap hotel by the piers,
where every bit of his extravagant
wardrobe--snakeskin boots, skin-tight
pedal pushers in a leopard print,
aviator's scarves, and an electric-
green capacious leather jacket--
lay wrapped in a corner of
his room in a yellow parachute.
It's hard enough to find a parachute
in New York City, I remember thinking,
but finding one the right shade
of canary is the accomplishment
of the sort of citizen with whom
I wish to populate my life.
Dwight the dancer, Dwight the fashion
illustrator and the fashion plate,
Dwight the child, the borderline
transvestite, Dwight the frightened,
infuriating me because an anti-AZT
diatribe by some eccentric
in a rag convinced him not to take
the pills with which he might
still be alive, Dwight
on the runway, Dwight on the phone
suggesting we could still have sex
if we wore "raincoats, Dwight
screwing a girl from Massapequa
in the ladies' room at Danceteria
(he wore more makeup and had better
jewelry than she did), Dwight planning
the trip to London or Berlin where he
would be discovered and his life
transformed. Dwight erased,
evicted from his own young body.
Dwight dead. At Bellevue, I wrapped
my arms around his second skin
of gauze and scars and tubing,
brushed my hand against
his plats, and said goodbye.
I hope I'm not the one
who loosed the devouring animal
that massacred you, gentle boy.
You didn't have a clue
to how you might stave off
the beast. I feel so confident
most days that I can stay
alive, survive and thrive
with AIDS. But when I see
Dwight smile and hear his fey
delighted voice inside my head,
I know AIDS is no chess game
but a hunt, and there is no
way of escaping the bloody
horror of the kill, no way
to bail out, no bright
parachute beside my bed.





D.O.A.
 

"You knew who I was
when I walked in the door.
You thought that I was dead.
Well, I am dead. A man
can walk and talk and even
breathe and still be dead.
Edmond O'Brien is perspiring
and chewing up the scenery
in my favorite film noir,
D.O.A. I can't stop watching,
can't stop relating. When I walked down
Columbus to Endicott last night
to pick up Tor's new novel,
I felt the eyes of every
Puerto Rican teen, crackhead,
yuppie couple focus on my cane
and makeup. "You're dead,
they seemed to say in chorus.
Somewhere in a dark bar
years ago, I picked up "luminous
poisoning. My eyes glowed
as I sipped my drink. After that,
there was no cure, no turning back.
I had to find out what was gnawing
at my gut. The hardest part's
not even the physical effects:
stumbling like a drunk (Edmond
O'Brien was one of Hollywood's
most active lushes) through
Forties sets, alternating sweats
and fevers, reptilian spots
on face and scalp. It's having
to say goodbye like the scene
where soundtrack violins go crazy
as O'Brien gives his last embrace
to his girlfriend-cum-Girl
Friday, Paula, played by Pamela
Britton. They're filmdom's least
likely lovers--the squat and jowly
alkie and the homely fundamentally
talentless actress who would hit
the height of her fame as the pillhead-
acting landlady on My Favorite Martian
fifteen years in the future. I don't have
fifteen years, and neither does Edmond
O'Brien. He has just enough time to tell
Paula how much he loves her, then
to drive off in a convertible
for the showdown with his killer.
I'd like to have a showdown too, if I
could figure out which pistol-packing
brilliantined and ruthless villain
in a hound's-tooth overcoat took
my life. Lust, addiction, being
in the wrong place at the wrong
time? That's not the whole
story. Absolute fidelity
to the truth of what I felt, open
to the moment, and in every case
a kind of love: all of the above
brought me to this tottering
self-conscious state--pneumonia,
emaciation, grisly cancer,
no future, heart of gold,
passionate engagement with a great
B film, a glorious summer
afternoon in which to pick up
the ripest plum tomatoes of the year
and prosciutto for the feast I'll cook
tonight for the man I love,
phone calls from my friends
and a walk to the park, ignoring
stares, to clear my head. A day
like any, like no other. Not so bad
for the dead.





Monster [It's possible I misconstrued you]
 

It's possible I misconstrued you,
  
 laid too much emphasis on the uniqueness of a birth, 
 failed to acknowledge circumstance could corrupt, sustain;
 I indulged myself in accusations against an absolute.
  
 I don't believe what I then believed. You are not responsible
  
 for Leibniz or the Lisbon quake, for the twenty-six-eyed
 and sixty-arsed box jellyfish, that the cosmos
 is shaped like a soccer ball; or for the dosido
 of right and wrong around the garden bed.
  
 You are not the monster I thought you were,
  
 not by definition or necessity the one immutable.
 You are a creator caught in a creator's net, in fact
 a creature. Every horror has its own pathology, 
  
 the disease infects the flock. Prey present as predators,  
 the malefactors replicate even as the angels 
 experiment with cures. Each encounter pulls against reductive story,
 says I will not, I am just (an instant, an instance),
  
 and reference skews on maps not drawn to scale.
  
 I know saintliness exists. It's all around me.
 My next door neighbours in their simple modesty,
 the lady down the street who is always
 helping someone older than herself. Even the slow
 judicial process conceives it natural to be better 
 than we are. I'm trying to shoo the gloomy birds away 
  
 but crows repeat about me on the lawn; and the vulture
 and the kite, the cuckoo and the owl: should I have given up the ghost 
 when I was drawn from the womb?





Monster [I can't get my head around it]
 

I can't get my head around it. How did we devise
  
 a concept like just war: the slain of the Lord
 are dung upon the ground. I know there are distinctions
 it is important to make and I don't expect perfection
 but the chicanery of subtle thought . . . if I pick it all apart
 will anything be left to sew back into sense?
  
 Cleverer minds are reconciled. Cultured, poised,
 the government official (Should I give him spectacles?
 Should they reflect the light?) pauses and replies:
 The President regrets . . . but consider the alternative 
  
 would you offer succour and I can almost understand.
  
 I sleep with reason as my lover, wake beside a monster
 in my bed. I fumble beneath the mask, shape my lips
 to the prospect of a kill, feel your thigh
 against my rump, your fingers at my throat.
  
 Oh, Rakosi, I'm still strumming on my lyre. Is there really
 so much wrong with that? I'm embarrassed
  
 by the flimsiness of my resolve, the silliness of saints and monsters,
 conversations with a being who can't plausibly exist,
 this mockery of flagellation: this is my defective heart, 
 this my amputated foot, this the bandage from around my head.
 A monster dies in the middle of his trial, another
 denies the power of the court, two more evade arrest:
 in politic's parlour game, each day annuls the last.
  
 9/11, I say, and Afghanistan, Bali and Iraq, 
 but I can't fix a year to each event, what is, 
 what well might be, are steam against a bathroom mirror: 
 I see bits, an eye but not its double, the other ear,
  
 a chin that lacks a jawbone for support.





The Paradise Flick
 

How do we know Eve and Adam were happy,
deprived, as they were, of a childhood?
 
Eve never knew, unlike Adam, a world
that was free of the chatter of others.'
 
How did she cope? And how could she choose,
if she'd wanted, to live by herself?
 
What did the man eat that made him hear voices,
while Eve was inventing frustration?
 
Where could she go for a break from the sound
of Himself, in his skin suit, like Tarzan,
 
assuring the bush that he'd just given birth to a woman?
Did she smile at the fool, or remind him that he was
 
asleep when she turned up and found him?
Where could she go to be shot of his need for a mother?
 
(A pity she woke him.)
Life for them both was a training film shown in real time,
 
on the zen of zoo-keeping.
When the encyclopedia seller arrived, who could blame her for buying?
 
No exit pollster asked how she felt
when she left at the end of the movie.





Eating Sin
 

          
          A man began to eat his order of fish, and the ghost of the fish arose and spoke. Forgive me, it said, please hear me. I died in despair, which is, as you know, the worst of the deadly sins. As I slowly suffocated in the alien air, I gave up hope of salvation, and so died without the consolation of religion. In your compassion and mercy, have a Mass said for me, and pray for my soul. With that, the ghost of the fish vanished, and the man, congratulating himself on possessing the carcass of such a remorseful creature, tucked in.
        




Imaginary Countries: The Real World
 

In the real world
lovers part at morning with a kiss
and look back longingly
before they pass from sight.
 
They go insouciant to work
and smile at times;
their life's Vivaldi.
 
Others bring what poetry they can into a life
by counting days
until employment comes again.
They look at cherries in the fruit store and imagine
biting in. They look so good.
 
Children break from singing in the drill hall,
burst outside to toss their frisbees in the park.
A boy plays Satie on the piano;
two Americans embrace
as traffic whispers up the drive.
They are embarking for the real world's farthest shore.
 
In the real world
someone signs petitions
every moment, tidies other people's trash
and greets another who is loved by someone else.
This is how the real world copes with being economics,
mathematics and ecology and botany
and waiting for the bus.
 
Costumed people earn their living slipping
from the real world to persuade us to buy moon-cakes,
supple skin and perfect hair.
We smile to see them aping us.
 
Gymnorhina tibicen swoops low and boasts her turf:
the children run and shout out, Magpie'
while the bird recalls the day in mimic song;
order then restored, she dines alfresco on their scraps.
 
And while we watch Magritte's sky turn El Greco,
roofs de Chirico beneath the plastic clouds,
a plane is pasted on a sudden patch of blue.





A Glass of Water
 

Un seul verre d'eau claire le monde Cocteau
Behind the wedding couple, a mirror harbours
their reception.
Outside, from the verandah, the harbour mirrors
the exception
of city from sky, hills snug with houses
and a glass of water standing on the railing,
half empty or half full. In the failing
afternoon light
brightening buildings counterpoint the darkness,
glinting upside-
down inside the glass, and the newly-weds,
seen from outside
joining hand to hand for the wedding reel,
 glide under its meniscus, head over heels.





Dew
 

for Ben Fenton-Smith
None are more familiar with dew
         than professional footballers. From early
grades they are used to running through
         practice drills and hurling their burly
frames through rucks while the moist chaff
         of wet grass under the winter lights
softens their fall, accustoms the half-
         back to the slippery ball and writes
green cuneiform on wet sandshoes.
         And they fear it in the morning,
kicking off the dew in the twos'
         because they ignored a coach's warning.
Half their lives are spent in clouds
         of condensation or the cold heat
of a winter sun where even the crowds
         seem like droplets on the concrete
rose of the stadium. In the final days
         of their season , sweat-spangled on the eve
of their triumph, the ball on a string and their plays
         honed, even the doubters believe.
And the last day is, once again,
         already an aftermath: the ground's been shaved
and sucked dry by the noon sun
         and the paddock has become a paved
and bristled hell for those who will
         collide with it and pinion flesh on
earth, earth on flesh and spill
         blood for the sake of the game. Possession
is the law; all are possessed.
         And when the crowd melts into the dry
darkness, after that great red football's
         booted between the uprights of the sky-
scrapers and gone, the sky bawls
         cheerless little drops for the victors
and decks the oval with the losers' jewels.

The jungle, from the floor to the canopy,
 Clogs and entwines
 Its every rung and level with rank growth.
 The python dines
 Among an epiphytic gaudery
 And hungry vines.
 On the mizzled hair of the two-toed sloth
 Moss has designs.
 Yet all that climbing tonnage is content-free.
 The top limbs sway as though to write in air,
 But can't remember what they scribble there.
 Through the savanna's heat-glaze the herds pause,
 Ripple and shiver,
 Or graze hypnotically, or drop their young,
 Which may deliver
 Their wet thin steps into the lion's jaws.
 By pool or river
 They stoop at evening side by side among
 The surface quiver
 Of their reflexions as the light withdraws:
 A fable set down in invisible ink;
 They print their shadows on the pool they drink.
 Even the perfect pictures in the shale's
 Slow-motion traps,
 The filamentous feathers, which one or two
 Sharp hammer taps
 Release, the fish in their meticulous scales,
 The precise maps
 Of leaves, did not direct this rendezvous.
 They're simply gaps
 In time, and have no part in these details.
 The weird wiwaxias, worms and arthropods
 Were empty of intention as stone gods.
 Once, though, a figure had the thought to crawl
 Out of the day
 Into a cave's dark reach, its first invoker,
 And there to splay
 His hand against the tallow-glimmered wall,
 And pause to spray
 His mouth's cargo of spittle and red ochre
 On the array
 Of his five fingers, clear, indelible:
 Author and content of the space displayed,
 The maker's hand becoming what it made.





Editing the Moon
 

Be precise
 authority is magic.
 When you think you've got it straight
 wax wane declination
 feel the movement under your hand
 one summer morning
 as you observe it set
 then rise that night.
 Always use a well-sharpened pencil
 followed by a good eraser.
 Watch the white emerge.





Robert Frost at Eighty
 

I think there are poems greater and stranger than any I have known.
 I would like to find them.
 They are not on the greying paper of old books
 or chanted on obscure lips.
 They are not in the language of mermaids
 or the sharp-tongued adjectives of vanishing.
 They run like torn threads along paving stones.
 They are cracked as the skull of an old man.
 They stir in the mirror
 at fifty,
 at eighty.
 My ear keeps trying to hear them
 but the seafront is cold.
 The tide moves in.
 They migrate like crows at a cricket ground.
 They knock at the door when I am out.
  
 I have done with craft.
 How can I front ghosts with cleverness,
 the slick glide of paradox and rhyme
 that transforms prejudice
 to brittle gems of seeming wisdom?
  
 Though I bury all I own or hold close
 though my skin outlives the trees
 though the lines fall shattering the stone
 I cannot catch them.
 They have the lilting accent
 of a house I saw but never entered.
 They are the sounds a child hears 
 the water, the afternoon, the sky.
 I watch them now
 trickling through the open mirror.
 Sometimes, but almost never
 we touch what we desire.





Education
 

Seven years old,
 on loan to an uncle
 and a bundle of cash went missing.
 For three days locked in a room, beaten.
 The golden orbs of pennies roasted in an oven
 removed by tongs
 glisten on a child's skin
 as she screams and screams.
 These round white scars 
 that remain even today
 without pigment
 without the shadow of colour
 with only the ash's afterglow.

 After telling that story
 you burnt your hand on the iron,
 burnt it yourself,
 your punishment for breaking silence.

 You rushed to the balcony but they pulled you back inside.
 You wanted to spit, to scream insults at the soldiers
 to stop them beating up the old man in the street.
 "Listen, she said as she held you back, your mother.
 "Listen, you have to learn to say nothing.
 Learn to be nobody.
 Learn to be the white wall
 that has no face and no tongue.





The Bush
 

for Seamus Heaney
Overture:
                  violins:
it is all scraggy,
wideawake,
                  ironical,
decked out
                  in denim fatigues.
Witty and welcoming,
                  leathery-evergreen,
bemedalled with beercans,
cowpat and wallaby-dung,
flap,
    nub,
         hinge,
            node,
blindeye quartzite,
                  wafery sandstone,
bright as a button
subtle for mile on mile
far from vulgarity
                  (far from sleek Europe)
in its array of
                  furniture tonings
sheeted by sunglaze
                  lovingly dusted,
wispy and splintery,
tussocky,
                  corduroy,
all of its idiom
dry as a thesis
to moist outsiders:
wonderfully eloquent
                  on its home ground,
branchful of adverbs,
lovingly
                  wombat-hued,
dreamily
                  sheeptoned,
fluted with scalloping surf
and every step a joke.





The Menger Sponge
 

God made everything out of nothing; but the nothing shows through --Paul Valry
Lost from all angles but the sun's,
This woken morning,
It clicks its brilliance into place at once,
If you follow the fall of light--
A spider web, head-high, adorning
The woodshed's entrance like a sheet
Of gold-shot fabric, metal-tight,
That, even so, one handswipe could delete,
Collapsing all
That spacious architecture to a tacky ball.
 
It brings to mind the mathematician's
Monstrous idea,
The Menger sponge, where infinite excisions
Out of a solid cube delete
Its substance while its form stays clear:
The central ninth is cut from a square;
Eight smaller squares remain; repeat
For each; and so on with this lattice of air:
A formula
For zero volume, infinite surface area.
 
Enough. The estuary's slung
Like gold-shot cloth
Over a gulf of shifting airs. Among
Cloud-drifts of beaten eggwhite floats,
As though confected of such froth,
The mountain. Like a Chinese screen,
The fabric of the view devotes
Almost all blankness to this hanging scene,
This one handsweep
Of water, creased like the cheek of someone roused from sleep.





Very like a Whale
 

I seem to wake

                        and sleep ambiguously,
 to see and misconceive,
                         to feel on the brink of something
                                                 that doesn't end, beauty
                                                 that is more than beautiful,
                                                 meaning that is more.
  
  
 The present is all around me, dreams,
                         a panoply of crimes, smudges of erasure,
                         memory made of clouds, camels,
                                                 weasels and the unlikelihood
                         of somewhere within and beyond this world.
  
  
 Here's light,
                         angular, ubiquitous
                                                 with the milky pigments of belief.
 Here's plodding time, breathing hard.
                                                 Birds fly up, perch on branches,
                         peck seed from the grass, (tug worms from the soil).
I am not what I imagined, 
                                                 here I am the illusionist
                                                 and dupe of my illusions,
                         making the angels disappear, wishing them back again.
  
  
 Stories that shifted in the telling
                                                 once were true:
                                                 a virgin birth, a resurrection,
a tiger who regained his human form, a crocodile
                         who didn't. I'm pitching words against the sea,
                                                 it drags them out,
                                                 flings them back again
                         still freighted with my weight. The waves are red with blood,
  
  
 brown with shit, yellow with the sickly light, anything
                                                 but blue and green.
                         I am an insistent fizz and drone,
                                                 deft, adroit, as elastic
                                                 as necessity and chance,
  
 
one more clay figurine with beseeching hollows
                                                 where the eyes should be,
                                                 as different from the others
 as I am the same, no more evolved
                                                 than a roach,
                                                 no better than a rat,
                                                 happy as a labrador in the sun.
                         This is grace, the rest is commentary
                         and I would let it go: in millennia
  
  
 I'll chatter metaphysics with a chimpanzee, now
                         my thoughts are the antlers of the Irish elk,
                                                 the wings of flightless birds, peptides
                                                 spelling out the phrase
                                                 very like a whale. Most organisms
  
  
 produce more offspring than can possibly survive.
                         Nothing can follow that.
                         Something will. Blunt heads of rain,
                                                 faithless wind,
                                                 the stricken sun at dusk,
  
  
 knock-kneed girls somersaulting on the beach,
                                                 the commonplace surprise
                                                 of making love face to face,
the heart breaking apart, an instrumental eye
                                                 and instrumental mind rejoicing,
                                                                         a last cacophony of birds.





The Amorous Cannibal
 

Suppose I were to eat you
I should probably begin
with the fingers, the cheeks and the breasts
yet all of you would tempt me,
so powerfully spicy
as to discompose my choice.
 
While I gobbled you up
delicacy by tidbit
I should lay the little bones
ever so gently round my plate
and caress the bigger bones
like ivory talismans.
 
When I had quite devoured the edible you
(your tongue informing my voice-box)
I would wake in the groin of night
to feel, ever so slowly,
your plangent, ravishing ghost
munching my fingers and toes.
 
Here, with an awkward, delicate gesture
someone slides out his heart
and offers it on a spoon,
garnished with adjectives.





Of What is Real
 

I like to lie with you wordless
 on black cloud rooft beach
 in late june 5 o'clock tempest
 on clump weed bed with sand
 fitting your contours like tailor made
  
 and I like to wash my summer brown face
 in north cold hudson rapids
 with octagon soap
   knees niched in steamy rocks
   where last night's frog stared
   at our buddhist sleep
  
 but most of all I like to see
 the morning happen . . .
  
 I like to go down vertical mountains
 where lanny goshkitch
 meditated
   crashing poplars
   sap sticky arms flailing
   as thermosed green tea
   anoints sneakers
   and blood soakt brow I taste and love
   myself a split second
  
 and I like to feel my own full scrotum
 as I horizon the whole crisp linen earth
 in my beatitude waiting miguel-like
 in maskt fantasy for christ-like
 you--
 whoever you are
  
 but most of all I like to see
 the morning happen . . .
  
 I like to look at books howl
 haikus of the seasons
 of the mind
 that I might know the knowing
 and the simplest to think of all of us
 taking turns at catching each other
 in the rye
  
 and I like to taste cold absinthe
 on hot hung sunday mornings
 discussing orgies symposiums
 and sounds with hoary headed poets
 in upstairs jazz club
 in Japan
  
 but most of all I like to see
 the morning happen when k and ike still sleep
 and only the denver night riders hum contrasts
 to orient jazzy feather beasts
 in the dewy garden of real earth
 where I can sink my naked feet
 cool





Rivus
 

Immersed
 we don't
 ask
 who entered
 whose stream.
  
 Take
 my hand there
 is no
 line no
 bridge only
 fond
 foolishness--
  
 the bread
 crumbs I
 bring you
 in
 morning--
  
 they float
 on the
 surface
 water with
 two
 violins
  
 un-
 strung like
 the silent
 song
 on your
 lips soft
  
 as the
 same
 hands I
 crushed to
 keep
 you from
 death.





Triptych for Believers
 


I  
Hung up on body parts in the particulate daylight, you step out of a Beckett play to find yourself in a memory resisting itself, as meat hits the fan so to speak against the white blanket of the grainy void. You never know where it's going, the body, the boy swathed in bullets with those black eyes pissing a letter-opener in the desert mud near a disabled Mercedes. When things enter the room you think bazooka and check your hat. A puddle of warm ice-cream in anticipation. Here's where Coney Island drops like a discarded napkin and you can't go home again. Mucous brimming the banks, a cake of dust in the shape of a rocking chair ticking away. But soon it will snow as exquisite dogs languish from inside a sandwich tied to a parachute. No time for ballads, the table is set.  
II  
Light solidifies in cells, the keeper of lost keys. They don't belong to anyone, the keys. Playing the game backwards reveals nothing a blind child could not guess by the hairs on his arm. The lips on old men are lockboxes in the terminal of no-knowing without gratitude for the despair of angels. You have to suffer, you have to fill up in order to implode, to be recognized for the necessities of commerce. They unhinge, finally, the doors you walk through into phantom stairwells in telephonic hum smelling of wet coal and doll's hair. Precipitous adjectives gush from a cracked faucet in the chancellery restroom. Someone is stifling laughter from underneath a card table where an electric utility had fallen from his sleeve. They say that trussed birds derive no pleasure from the music of mangled wagons and that gas seeps like a well-kept secret imperiling dust mites in the spleens of hooded maidens locked away from the light. Everything is descending, even the scholarship of the ancient adverbs. Mouths twist into almonds and you wonder how the noise can drown itself out with nothing but nouns and dinner plates and gallows, with history a hiccup waiting to happen.  
III  
The music is an absence of colliding masses. You can cut your feet on the proverbial and be too close to hear it, the other music, the suffocation of things that can't fly. A beautiful cacophony flutters in the brightness of dead calm as true objects lost in the politeness of daylight fill the grail of a new primitive. You choke on little candles and all through the night your legs cramp in the sweat of the moonlight. For no good reason a tenderness of geese is billowing in the curtains, as holes in the face open and close and paper scorches sky with futile encryption. Those armchairs foundering in the scum of the surf. Deafness craving disaster green in the spine, knowing the cocktail party's over. Now it's all red and your lips are trembling in believability, but it's only a flickering image in the dark quadrant of your eye bending the light as they mow the daisies under the stars, for no good reason.





Enter a Cloud
 

1
  
 Gently disintegrate me
 Said nothing at all.
  
 Is there still time to say
 Said I myself lying
 In a bower of bramble
 Into which I have fallen.
  
 Look through my eyes up
 At blue with not anything
 We could have ever arranged
 Slowly taking place.
  
 Above the spires of the fox
 Gloves and above the bracken
 Tops with their young heads
 Recognising the wind,
 The armies of the empty
 Blue press me further
 Into Zennor Hill.
  
 If I half-close my eyes
 The spiked light leaps in
 And I am here as near
 Happy as I will get
 In the sailing afternoon.
  
  
    2
  
 Enter a cloud. Between
 The head of Zennor and 
 Gurnard's Head the long
 Marine horizon makes 
 A blue wall or is it
 A distant table-top
 Of the far-off simple sea.
  
 Enter a cloud. O cloud,
 I see you entering from 
 Your west gathering yourself
 Together into a white
 Headlong. And now you move
 And stream out of the Gurnard,
 The west corner of my eye.
  
 Enter a cloud. The cloud's 
 Changing shape is crossing
 Slowly only an inch
 Above the line of the sea.
 Now nearly equidistant
 Between Zennor and Gurnard's
 Head, an elongated
 White anvil is sailing
 Not wanting to be a symbol.
  
  
    3
  
 Said nothing at all.
  
 And proceeds with no idea
 Of destination along
 The sea bearing changing
 Messages. Jean in London,
 Lifting a cup, looking
 Abstractedly out through
 Her Hampstead glass will never
 Be caught by your new shape
 Above the chimneys. Jean,
 Jean, do you not see
 This cloud has been thought of
 And written on Zennor Hill. 


    4

The cloud is going beyond
What I can see or make.
Over up-country maybe
Albert Strick stops and waves
Caught in the middle of teeling
Broccoli for the winter.
The cloud is not there yet.

From Gurnard's Head to Zennor
Head the level line
Crosses my eyes lying
On buzzing Zennor Hill.

The cloud is only a wisp
And gone behind the Head.
It is funny I got the sea's
Horizontal slightly surrealist.
Now when I raise myself
Out of the bracken I see
The long empty blue
Between the fishing Gurnard
And Zennor. It was a cloud
The language at my time's
Disposal made use of.


    5

Thank you. And for your applause.
It has been a pleasure. I
Have never enjoyed speaking more.
May I also thank the real ones
Who have made this possible.
First, the cloud itself. And now
Gurnard's Head and Zennor
Head. Also recognise
How I have been helped
By Jean and Madron's Albert
Strick (He is a real man.)
And good words like brambles,
Bower, spiked, fox, anvil, teeling.

The bees you heard are from
A hive owned by my friend
Garfield down there below
In the house by Zennor Church.

The good blue sun is pressing
Me into Zennor Hill.

Gently disintegrate me
Said nothing at all.





Bless Their Hearts
 

At Steak n Shake I learned that if you add 
"Bless their hearts after their names, you can say 
whatever you want about them and it's OK. 
My son, bless his heart, is an idiot, 
she said. He rents storage space for his kids' 
toys--they're only one and three years old! 
I said, my father, bless his heart, has turned 
into a sentimental old fool. He gets 
weepy when he hears my daughter's greeting 
on our voice mail. Before our Steakburgers came 
someone else blessed her office mate's heart, 
then, as an afterthought, the jealous hearts 
of the entire anthropology department. 
We bestowed blessings on many a heart 
that day. I even blessed my ex-wife's heart. 
Our waiter, bless his heart, would not be getting 
much tip, for which, no doubt, he'd bless our hearts. 
In a week it would be Thanksgiving, 
and we would each sit with our respective 
families, counting our blessings and blessing 
the hearts of family members as only family 
does best. Oh, bless us all, yes, bless us, please
 bless us and bless our crummy little hearts.





[They travel in threes]
 

They travel in threes, usually in station waggons or utes,
 often have dogs, and eat out of cans in country motels, 
 always the one on the edge of town 
 near the truckstop with good hamburgers 
 I remember the Isis Motel in Guyra
  
 They drive old cars, or horses made of wind, 
 whose manes are streamers of wind. They tend 
 to wear black. I have met them as young as fourteen  
 Beck's friend Kristin had written her autobiography
 already, it was called These Days' but it was stuck
  
 in her computer somewhere, in the shed 
 at her mother's. Her mother and the girlfriend, 
 they were also storm spirits. 
 They taught swimming
 and they were kind at first, often charming
  
 After watching the birds' mating rituals
 on the forest floor at the bottom of the steep train, 
 under the speckled trees, we decide to go north. 
 We borrow Beck's sister Jade's car,
 and Alecto gets her licence first go.
  
 We hear the Sibyl is staying at the Isis Motel. 
 This time there's no bush festival, no whip-plaiter, 
 the pumpkins from the scarecrow bellies 
 have all been eaten in baked dinners cooked for the 
 Lamb and Potato Festival. That will be fifty-three dollars.
  
 The others shower and go to bed, I'm as usual awake. 
 At night across the road, five types of frogs set up 
 their orchestra, and the Mother of Ducks lagoon throbs 
 around the gazebo  tree frogs like the ones at home
 chaka-chaka, chaka-chaka
  
 I go out and unroll my sleeping bag on the picnic table
 suspended over the lagoon, and watch
 the sun come up over the railway line. 
 In the distance across a golf course, I see smoke
 and walking I come to a woman in black near a tent.
  
 The Cumaean Sibyl, I presume? I say.
 She laughs in her mantle, invites me in.
  So you've left the infernal regions too, I say
 and she laughs again, going out and poking kindling
 under the damp logs. I notice a laptop on her sleeping-bag.
  
 She's written a book about birds in New England
 which she shows me. No one reads it, she says,
 except ornithologists. She's now writing a manual 
 for editors. When she goes out to the fire 
 I look at her hand-written page
  
 Parts of a publication: sections and paras,
 signposts and transitions, running heads and feet.'
 Any news from home? I ask.
 The singer is failing to get his wife back, she says.
 The ferry man batted him back with an oar.
  
 I prophecy he'll be torn to pieces, she says,
 and offers to cook me some kidney.
 Where are your sisters? she asks.
 I say they're at the motel.
 Well, they won't be getting kidney, she says.
  
 Our New England holiday over, and no other prophecies
 from the Sibyl, we're drive south through the Moonbi Hills 
 and down past the Emirates' horse stud at Murrurrundi
 through bull-dozed mountains the Sibyl says you once went round,
 past the cones of a giant power station and the sign:
  
 Muswellbrook  City of Power. And on to the Newcastle freeway.
 Back in Sydney at the hostel, the girl at the front desk leans forward: 
 Have we heard? About Beck? She's sorry, Beck has been killed 
 in a car accident near Bulahdelah. 
 Automatically I touch my dreads and groan.





[A drunk cadet had hit them]
 

A drunk cadet had hit them on a bad bend near the river,
 two broken necks. On the notice-board there's an A4 page 
 with a blurred digital photo of Beck laughing, leaning 
 into her friends in a nightclub and below that, writing: 
 We Love You Beck  from Kristin, Colette and Mandy.
  
 I sit like an automaton in the big lounge room
 my back teeth snapping against each other,
 rocks in my gut. That night we watch on an iMac 
 a video of Beck, an eight minute film Colette 
 had taken on her phone. 
  
 Two of the men are crying. Kristin and Mandy are numb. 
 I move to the noticeboard, reading anything:
 Live-in nanny required Balmain 5 min from city'
 Experience life on an outback station help mustering
 mobs of 2000 animals on horseback or quadbike'.
  
 Near me two women are whispering. Talking 
 about their first-ever girlfriend. One says,
 Other people are always either versions or not-versions 
 of her. Fourteen, it's an age to break your heart. You know 
 nothing. On the edge of knowing too much.
  
 I lean forward, my head on the foyer koala.
 Voices travel to me from distant realms:
 I hear again the singer's plea for his wife.
 Blurred from too much experience
 I prowl around the leaflet racks, groaning.
  
 Late that night on the vinyl lounges the people remaining 
 are Kristin and me, alone. My eyes are swollen, 
 my ears still buzzing from the headphones at work. 
 We talk over Beck till no more can be said.
 Now Kristin begins to tell her own story 
  
 how her uncle had his boat down the back 
 of their block, and one day  
 he said he wanted to show her something,
 took her down the lantana path to the boat, 
 something she might like, he said 
  
 Kristin was raped at times twice a day 
 or sometimes not for a week 
 and sometimes after it he gave her pocket
 money once a twenty dollar bill which down
 the gully later she tore into thin red strips and buried.
  
 Back at the house her mother 
 bashed her for lying about the uncle,
 who was her brother, and who had loaned them 
 the deposit on the house where Kristin and Odette
 her sister were fortunate enough to live.
  
 When Kristin grew up, her mother apologised to her.
 The uncle was still alive. He had sent her a 
 Christmas card this year. She sat on the lounge, 
 looking down at her runners, her mouth closed.
 Behind her the stereogram and Elvis, a silent witness.
  
 The uncle had said she was a rude girl, she should 
 keep quiet about their secret otherwise 
 he'd give her little sister a taste of the same.
 Kristin was quiet from then on. The reason she was 
 telling me now, her hand on my arm
  
 was that last week she'd had a call from Odette 
 who was living in London.
 The uncle during those primary 
 school years had done the same to her, tricked her
 the same way, used the same words.
  
 I feel the weight of my empty useless arms.
 But later I hold her  hug her goodnight.
 She touches my shoulder. I was convinced, she says, 
 I was saving my sister. 
 My head clatters: Virgin, May I help you?
  
 Back in the Furies' bunk-room it's beauty night, 
 they're whisking egg whites for a face mask 
 After they've done each other they sit me on the bed 
 and paint my face with their fingers
 the egg white sets quickly and they tell me not to smile.
  
 I dream of Alecto's iron tower and bloody clothes 
 then I'm on TV being interviewed: So, the oldest Fury 
 and who is your god? I am asked  I once served Artemis, I say. 
 And before that?  Athena, I say  Anath, Isis. 
 I do not mention Dionysis or the Thracian women.





[I pinch myself hard on the inner arm]
 

I pinch myself hard on the inner arm,
 inwardly smiling yet frightened too  what if 
 I get caught in this far realm, on the underside of the world,
 in these pixelated centuries where humans are exactly
 the same, both kind and radically unkind  
  
 So anyway, I say, her husband has his ships ready
 to go to war, and he's waiting for the wind. 
 He decides to order the sacrifice of their daughter  the wind 
 comes, and they sail off to defend a trading route at Troy.
 Jade says, And this trading route is called "Helen?
  
 Very good. OK, skip ten years.
 When the husband comes back, his wife unrolls a purple carpet
 and his cousin prepares a banquet. His wife says, Darling,
 the slave-girls have run you a bath. He bathes. 
 His wife finds out there's someone at the front door 
  
 from Troy, a woman called Cassandra, holding twins 
 she bore to the husband. Cassandra would like to come in. 
 Maybe this piece of information was the trigger to the murder  
 at any rate, as her husband steps from the tub, she wraps a net 
 around him as if it were a bathrobe, a net she'd made herself 
  
 Wait, are you hungry? Jade says. Come into the kitchen.
 Amid the chicken bones and a potato salad
 she says, All right, go on. 
 You have a very nice mouth, I say.
 Go on, she says, the net, wraps it round him.
  
 OK. So the cousin comes in and takes two swipes 
 with his sword, his two-edged sword,
 then the wife beheads the husband with her double-headed axe
 AHA! Jade says. Yes, I say. 
 Then, splashed with his blood and bearing his head,
  
 she runs to the banqueting room where his followers
 are being slaughtered among the mixing-bowls. 
 She has defended herself and her daughter 
 everything else is gloss at that point. Revenge, 
 though sticky-fingered, is sweet.
  
 More chicken?
 Thanks. Her kids, a son and daughter, were sent away 
 in case they grew up wanting to avenge their father.
 Which of course they do, Jade says.
 Yes.
  
 The surviving girl sends messages to her brother, who's 
 in another country: don't forget: come home 
 when you can, and avenge our father 
 Years pass. Grown up now, the boy goes to Apollo's shrine
 for advice, and the oracle tells him to do just that.
  
 In the end, the boy does come back from exile, and kills 
 his mother. A court case develops about the matricide,
 and this is where we come into it. See, up till now, 
 the punishment for matricide has always been death.
 Lineage has been through the mother.
  
 But this play was written at a particular point in history.
 Or pre-history, Jade says.
 Right. So the court is held at the Shrine of Apollo, 
 and Apollo himself is counsel for the defence. 
 Alecto is given the job of public prosecutor 
  
 Your sister? Jade says.
 Yes. So the Magistrate calls up some citizens, and 
 we hear the case. What were the mitigating factors?
 The son was told to do it.' His father's ghost
 and the oracle of Apollo himself' told him to kill his mother.
  
 They made the rest of their case, 
 mostly spurious, one of Apollo's arguments being
 that it's less bad to kill a woman than a man. 
 We made some good arguments, but
 the vote for the boy to die was fifty-fifty.

 At the deadlock, Athena turned up, Athena!
 her garment having been kissed by many men or what, 
 we don't know, and she in her deciding vote acquitted
 him. For us to lose, in effect, a case of matricide
 meant the balance of power was shifting.
  
 I pour another vodka. What I didn't say to Jade was, 
 it meant we'd be lying low for some time,
 centuries perhaps. I remember the fires of earlier camps. 
 In the distance, border furies, heat furies, storm furies. 
 The sound of the Barking Owl.
  
 And this owl, a real owl, sounds like a woman being murdered 
 Athena, your bird is telling you something!
 But Athena, last we heard, was with her cousin Kate Kyriakou
 on their way back to Greece for the Olympics.
 At the last minute they got a Virgin flight.
  
 It's an irony of fate, I said, that it was a foremost goddess 
 who helped tilt that power. 
 Or not, Jade said, maybe it was simply a pivot-point in storytelling 
 where men must be shown to be in control, and the best 
 way to do that is to get a woman to do the job.
  
 Yes, I said. Let's present it to Athena this way: she's being chosen 
 to give an award in a public ceremony and get her picture 
 in the morning paper, her big chance, as a goddess, 
 to be kind and compassionate. 
 To downplay the warlike.
  
 Mesmerise her with theology  Jade said,
 and perhaps flirt with her at the same time. 
 For whatever reason, I said, Athena  without consenting 
 to matricide  did not give it a high level of punishment. 
 Certainly she didn't exact a death. 
  
 In that sense you have to admit she is a civilising factor, I said.
 Flick your dreads as you may, Jade said. 
 We hounded the son, though, I said. One time we said 
 we'd leave him alone for a while if he promised to do 
 penance at the Temple of Artemis.





from  Totem Poem [In the yellow time of pollen]
 

In the yellow time of pollen, in the blue time of lilacs,
in the green that would balance on the wide green world,
air filled with flux, world-in-a-belly
in the blue lilac weather, she had written a letter:
You came into my life really fast and I liked it.
 
When we let go the basket of the good-luck birds
the sky erupted open in the hail of its libation;
there was a gap and we entered it gladly. Indeed the birds
may have broken the sky and we, soaked, squelched
in the mud of our joy, braided with wet-thighed surrender.
 
In the yellow time of pollen near the blue time of lilacs
there was a gap in things. And here we are.
The sparrows flew away so fast a camera could not catch them.
The monkey swung between our arms and said I am, hooray,
the monkey of all events, the great gibbon of convergences.
 
We were falling towards each other already
and the utter abandon to orbits was delicious.
The falcon rested on the little man's arm and falconry
was the High Path of the World. Whole minutes passed.
We were falling and the jungle fell with us.
 
She said I came, I came to my senses really fast
and you liked it. I was surrounded by the fluttering
of wings, nothing but a whirring in my ears,
and the whole earth tilted and I lost my reason.
For a time falconry was the high path of the world.
 
At night the sky was filled with animals.
Ganesh loomed large among those points of light.
He said Change! and we said Lord we are ready
to bend. Thou art the high exalted most flexible.
He said Then I will enter into your very dreams.
 
And the yellow-tailed black cockatoo, ablaze
in his own musculature, soared all night above the sunlit
fields of whisky grass that stretched inside me
to a river's edge. The great bird cawed its majesty,
a sonic boom; and even I was barely welcome there.
 
There was a gap in things; and all the lilacs bloomed.
Words split in our grasp. We were licking the cream
from the universal ice. Words foundered and cracked.
How the bonnet was warm on your bottom! And the metal
continued tick-ticking though the engine was off.
 
And the evening shuddered, since everything is connected.
I was licking the cream from the universal saucer.
I was all of Cheshire and points between.
You saw the great sky turn blacker, you saw the spray of stars
and your hair got tangled in the windscreen wiper.
 
At the hot ponds we stripped as night closed in.
I secretly admired your underwear, your long
elusive legs. In the spring where we lay side by side
we held hands. Up above the steam the sky. I said
That one is called Sirius or Dog Star, but only here on Earth.
 
And when since the stories foretold it we parted,
those birds were all released again. Such buoyancy.
They go on forever like that. How else to say thank you
in a foreign place? We are ever in the arms of our exile,
forever going one way and the other
 
though sometimes of course on a sphere that is not so bad.
I will meet you on the nape of your neck one day,
on the surface of intention, word becoming act.
We will breathe into each other the high mountain tales,
where the snows come from, where the waters begin.
 
In the yellow time of pollen when the fields were ablaze
we were very near bewildered by beauty.
The sky was a god-bee that hummed. All the air boomed
with that thunder. It was both for the prick
and the nectar we drank that we gave ourselves over.





from  Totem Poem [If every step taken is a step well-lived]
 

And if every step taken is a step well-lived but a foot
towards death, every pilgrimage a circle, every flight-path
the tracing of a sphere: I will give myself over and over.
I have migrated through Carpathians of sorrow
to myself heaped happy in the corner there.
 
Nothing seemed strange in the world, you'll understand--
nothing ever more would. Monkey Boy came to me saying
Look--the moon of the moon. The little one circled the big one.
He crouched in the palm of my hand, tiny, sincere,
pointing at the sky. There was something sad about him.
 
The python was nothing, nothing at all, nothing
but strength shed to suppleness, nothing but will
encased in itself. The python was a muscle of thought.
Coiled and mute, in a place where nothing but rain fell,
the python thought: this is the beginning or end of the world.
 
The python was everywhere, everywhere at once, aware
only too much of that ageless agony: its existence.
I am tired, it said; and the stream burbled by.
I am waiting for the recoil, the uncoil, coil of night,
coil of stars, coil of the coldness of the water.
 
The python said Who are these people?
The whole city sweated, moved like a limb. The air
fitted like a glove two sizes too small and too many
singers sang the banal. The bars roared all night.
The kite hawks grew ashamed. All nature squirmed.
 
In the yellow time of pollen there's a certain slant of light
that devours the afternoon, and you would wait forever
at the Gare de l'Est, if time stood still, if she would come.
She is the leopard then, its silvery speed; where will you
wrestle her, and in what shadows, and on what crumpled sheets?
 
And all those sheets were pampas and savannas, the soft expanses
of all that would be absent forever, all that was
past, and future, and not here. And in a white rose
there were not to be found any secrets, since in its unfolding
there was no centre, nor in its decay. Only the random petals fallen.
 
In the yellow time of poppies when the fields were ablaze
those invisible pollens rained around us.
The days held us lightlocked in golden surrender
and all night long the night shot stars.
When my chest unconstricted at last, did yours?
 
The real issue, of course, was this: atomically, energetically,
everything was wave function. And a wave continues forever into space,
the wavelength never alters, only the intensity lessens, so
in the worst cosmic way everything is connected by vibrations.
And this, as even a dog would know, is no consolation.
 
Ah but the dogs will save us all in the end & even the planet.
Not the superdogs but the household friendlies, always
eager to please, hysterically fond, incessant, carrying in the very
wagging of their tales an unbounded love not even
therapists could imagine; their forgiveness unhinges us.
 
We were reduced to this: this day and night,
primary gold and indigo, the binary profusion
of distances guessed at, heat and cold, colours
logged in the retina and lodged in the spine;
we were dogs who knew the infinite is now,
 
that celandine was buttercup, that buttercup was marigold.
The dog star marked the dog days and the wild rose
was dog rose. The crow's-foot was wild hyacinth.
By day the correspondences were clear.
I walked across the whin land. Speedwell bluer than sky.
 
A practised ear could hear, between two breaths,
deep space wherein the mind collects itself.
Words foundered and cracked. Nearly
never bulled the cow. A shining isomorphousness
rang out. The roussignol sang all night.
 
All colours were shuffled endlessly but never lost.
A practised ear could hear, between two breaths,
the secret blackness of the snow
come flooding in. On summer's lawns
the ice-melt sprayed its figure-eights from sprinklers.
 
And everything stopped working, second time around,
as if it had never happened before. Fans
moved the corpses of fireflies through the rooms,
supplicant, pathetic, pleading in brittle postures.
Everything was magnified by their bug-eyed deaths.
 
We became solemn in that profusion
of dying. Cane toads fattened the asphalt
in the mist and the rain; our headlights caught them
tensed as if listening: they were waiting,
mute, for the imbecility of eternity.
 
The clocks merely pulsed, or rather the days.
Like shotgun spray on the weatherboard, sleep
scattered itself through the blurred heat
and secreted itself in the nooks of delirium.
Sometimes the magpies would wake us, or the phone,
 
mid-afternoon. And we needed nothing, not even hope,
being no different from the dragonflies,
or the cows in their despair. It appeared we lived
on sunlight and chocolate bars. You blossomed
so from not ever reading the newspapers.
 
Things came and went--the years and all the airports.
I was a shade scattering my shade seed
liberally to the winds and weathervanes.
There was not enough absence to go round.
I heard voices, stabat mater, in the whine of jets
 
and in air vents and headphones a stream
trilling over rocks. On tarmacs and in transit
I saw your lips, your nakedness, the trees,
that dappled light. I dreamt of orchards.
The preciseness of the world came flooding in.





from Totem Poem [Abandoned in a field near Yass]
 

Abandoned in a field near Yass a cobwebbed car once kept us warm
and when it rained, though we shivered with sickness,
there came a moment of perfect happiness, faces nestled
in the vinyl, sleep coming on, surrounded by metal
that in upcoming decades would oxidise to flakes.
 
Asleep at last, last of the valium, we came to know
a car too is a flower and pollen its decay.
In the dry air at dawn the cicadas kept still. The space
that mass sat in decided how mass was to move.
We dreamed of valleys of olive trees, silver side out.
 
The lions preened. We shivered with need.
A mechanic showed me once how the spark-paths from spark-plugs
looked, if you looked close enough, like mountain ravines
from the air. The deeper the groove the faster
the current. We shivered, this our habit, this flowing.
 
It takes the breath away. There are gum trees crackling from it
two decades later. I slept so still beneath that mass of dreams
like sediment compressed beneath a lake. I woke and the
tributes and glory were gone and the crops all withered
and money was merely the index of anxiety.
 
When we realised this our hearts swelled in exultation.
Even time would forget there was reason for fear: that decay
seemed to will itself upon us. I was off the air, delirious
with substance. The kite hawks grew ashamed.
All nature squirmed. I was off the air, light-headed with voracity.
 
The theme just kept repeating itself, year in year out,
same demon different bodies. A nurse said When you stay,
when you leave those wet imprints in our airspace,
these sheets smell like formaldehyde, like death. We had merely
reached early, down the end of the river, the leprosarium
 
of feeling, and all things stood for every other thing,
creepers, vines, tendrils, anacondas, inert surrender,
such listlessness, and yes the very rage with which
we chased the very forms of it, the lineaments
of nothingness, the powders of the comatose, the bliss.
 
This was the state of the world. Heading backwards we learned
the flea-fish was the smallest animal before the insect kingdom
began. Forwards, there were only the sudden deaths
of galaxies. And yet when we practised love there seemed
on certain days an awful lot of space; and so much sky.
 
Never had I lain then at Kangaroo Valley so comfortable
in my own body. A virtual flatness and that centrifuge
in the stomach stilled and my spine a spirit-level. The smell
of coffee drifting in brought back to me that lily-white girl and that
sad hour of need. How brittle every bone was then. How
 
could one not be completely bedraggled by time or compulsion or
duplicity? I was all those things and am. I was so tired
with the not-being-here inside of it all that fatigue
was like oxygen, given of all the givens, sensurround
of the gods. But I was gulping and heaving by then.
 
And that is all so long ago. Though when you forget
the last time: most likely it is not the last time.
And when dreams don't come, when mastodons and minotaurs
curdle in the night-reaches and the bulls lie fallow
in dawn-sweats: sleep some more. Wait. Sleep on. And swim.





Love Song: I and Thou
 

Nothing is plumb, level, or square:
      the studs are bowed, the joists
 are shaky by nature, no piece fits
      any other piece without a gap
 or pinch, and bent nails
      dance all over the surfacing
 like maggots. By Christ
      I am no carpenter. I built
 the roof for myself, the walls
      for myself, the floors
 for myself, and got 
      hung up in it myself. I
 danced with a purple thumb
      at this house-warming, drunk
 with my prime whiskey: rage.
      Oh I spat rage's nails
 into the frame-up of my work:
      it held. It settled plumb,
 level, solid, square and true
      for that great moment. Then
 it screamed and went on through,
      skewing as wrong the other way.
 God damned it. This is hell,
      but I planned it. I sawed it,
 I nailed it, and I
      will live in it until it kills me.
 I can nail my left palm
      to the left-hand crosspiece but
 I can't do everything myself.
      I need a hand to nail the right,
 a help, a love, a you, a wife.





Fabrication of Ancestors
 

For old Billy Dugan, shot in the ass in the Civil war, my father said.
The old wound in my ass
 has opened up again, but I 
 am past the prodigies
 of youth's campaigns, and weep
 where I used to laugh
 in war's red humors, half
 in love with silly-assed pains
 and half not feeling them.
 I have to sit up with
 an indoor unsittable itch
 before I go down late
 and weeping to the storm-
 cellar on a dirty night
 and go to bed with the worms.
 So pull dirt up over me
 and make a family joke
 for Old Billy Blue Balls,
 the oldest private in the world
 with two ass-holes and no
 place more to go to for a laugh
 except the last one. Say:
 The North won the Civil War
 without much help from me
 although I wear a proof
 of the war's obscenity.





How We Heard the Name
 

The river brought down
 dead horses, dead men
 and military debris,
 indicative of war
 or official acts upstream,
 but it went by, it all 
 goes by, that is the thing
 about the river. Then 
 a soldier on a log
 went by. He seemed drunk
 and we asked him Why
 had he and this junk
 come down to us so
 from the past upstream.
 "Friends, he said, "the great
 Battle of Granicus
 has just been won
 by all of the Greeks except
 the Lacedaemonians and
 myself: this is a joke
 between me and a man
 named Alexander, whom
 all of you ba bas
 will hear of as a god.





Monologue of a Commercial Fisherman
 

"If you work a body of water and a body of woman
 you can take fish out of one and children out of the other
 for the two kinds of survival. The fishing is good,
 both kinds are adequate in pleasures and yield,
 but the hard work and the miseries are killing;
 it is a good life if life is good. If not, not.
 You are out in the world and in in the world,
 having it both ways: it is sportive and prevenient living
 combined, although you have to think about the weathers
 and the hard work and the miseries are what I said.
 It runs on like water, quickly, under the boat,
 then slowly like the sand dunes under the house.
 You survive by yourself by the one fish for a while
 and then by the other afterward when you run out.
 You run out a hooky life baited with good times,
 and whether the catch is caught or not is a question
 for those who go fishing for men or among them for things.





On Hurricane Jackson
 

Now his nose's bridge is broken, one eye
 will not focus and the other is a stray;
 trainers whisper in his mouth while one ear
 listens to itself, clenched like a fist;
 generally shadowboxing in a smoky room,
 his mind hides like the aching boys
 who lost a contest in the Panhellenic games
 and had to take the back roads home,
 but someone else, his perfect youth,
 laureled in newsprint and dollar bills,
 triumphs forever on the great white way
 to the statistical Sparta of the champs.





Wall, Cave, and Pillar Statements, after Aska
 

In order to perfect all readers
 the statements should be carved 
 on rock walls, on cave walls,
 and on the side of pillars so
 the charm of their instruction can
 affect the mountain climbers near
 the cliffs, the plainsmen near
 the pillars, and the city people near
 the caves they go to on vacations.
  
 The statements should, and in a fair
 script, spell out the right text and gloss
 of the Philosopher's jocular remark. Text:
 "Honesty is the best policy. Gloss:
 "He means not best' but policy,'
 (this is the joke of it) whereas in fact
           Honesty is Honesty, Best
           is Best, and Policy is Policy,
           the three terms being not
           related, but here loosely allied.
 What is more important is that is'
 is, but the rocklike truth of the text
 resides in the the'. The the' is The.
           By this means the amusing sage
           has raised or caused to be raised
           the triple standard in stone:
 the single is too simple for life,
 the double is mere degrading hypocrisy,
 but the third combines the first two
 in a possible way, and contributes
 something unsayable of its own:
 this is the pit, nut, seed, or stone
 of the fruit when the fruit has been 
 digested:
           It is good to do good for the wrong
           reason, better to do good for the good
           reason, and best of all to do good
           good: i.e. when the doer and doee 
           and whatever passes between them
           are beyond all words like grace'
           or anagogic insight,' or definitions like
           particular instance of a hoped-at-law,'
 and which the rocks alone can convey.
 This is the real reason for the rock walls,
 the cave walls and pillars, and not the base
 desires for permanence and display
 that the teacher's conceit suggests.
  
           That is the end of the statements, but,
           in order to go on a way after the end
           so as to make up for having begun 
           after the beginning, and thus to come around
           to it in order to include the whole thing,
 add: "In some places the poignant slogan,
 Morality is a bad joke like everything else,'
 may be written or not, granted that space
 exists for the vulgar remarks, the dates,
 initials and hearts of lovers, and all
 other graffiti of the prisoners of this world.





Endless Streams and Mountains
 

Ch'i Shan Wu Chin
Clearing the mind and sliding in
           to that created space,
 a web of waters steaming over rocks,
 air misty but not raining,
           seeing this land from a boat on a lake
           or a broad slow river,
           coasting by.
  
 The path comes down along a lowland stream
 slips behind boulders and leafy hardwoods,
 reappears in a pine grove,
  
 no farms around, just tidy cottages and shelters,
 gateways, rest stops, roofed but unwalled work space,
           --a warm damp climate;
  
 a trail of climbing stairsteps forks upstream.
 Big ranges lurk behind these rugged little outcrops--
 these spits of low ground rocky uplifts
           layered pinnacles aslant,
 flurries of brushy cliffs receding,
 far back and high above, vague peaks.
 A man hunched over, sitting on a log
           another stands above him, lifts a staff,
 a third, with a roll of mats or a lute, looks on;
 a bit offshore two people in a boat.
  
 The trail goes far inland,
           somewhere back around a bay,
 lost in distant foothill slopes
                    & back again
 at a village on the beach, and someone's fishing.
  
 Rider and walker cross a bridge
 above a frothy braided torrent
 that descends from a flurry of roofs like flowers
           temples tucked between cliffs,
                     a side trail goes there;
  
 a jumble of cliffs above,
 ridge tops edged with bushes,
 valley fog below a hazy canyon.
  
 A man with a shoulder load leans into the grade.
 Another horse and a hiker,
 the trail goes up along cascading streambed
 no bridge in sight--
 comes back through chinquapin or
 liquidambars; another group of travelers.
 Trail's end at the edge of an inlet
 below a heavy set of dark rock hills.
 Two moored boats with basket roofing,
           a boatman in the bow looks
                     lost in thought.
  
                     Hills beyond rivers, willows in a swamp,
                     a gentle valley reaching far inland.
  
                     The watching boat has floated off the page.
  
                     
  
 At the end of the painting the scroll continues on with seals and
 poems. It tells the a further tale:
  
 "--Wang Wen-wei saw this at the mayor's house in Ho-tung
 town, year 1205. Wrote at the end of it,
  
                     The Fashioner of Things
                              has no original intentions
                      Mountains and rivers
                              are spirit, condensed.'
  
                     . . . Who has come up with
                              these miraculous forests and springs?
                     Pale ink
                              on fine white silk.'
  
 Later that month someone named Li Hui added,
  
                     . . . Most people can get along with the noise of dogs
                            and chickens;
                        Everybody cheerful in these peaceful times.
                        But I--why are my tastes so odd?
                        I love the company of streams and boulders.'
  
 T'ien Hsieh of Wei-lo, no date, next wrote,
  
                     . . . The water holds up the mountains,
                                The mountains go down in the water . . .'
  
 In 1332 Chih-shun adds,
  
                     . . . This is truly a painting worth careful keeping.
                     And it has poem-colophons from the Sung and the
                     Chin dynasties. That it survived dangers of fire and
                     war makes it even rarer.'
                       
 In the mid-seventeenth century one Wang To had a look at it:
  
           My brother's relative by marriage, Wn-sun, is learned and
           has good taste. He writes good prose and poetry. My broth-
           er brought over this painting of his to show me . . .'
  
 The great Ch'ing dynasty collector Liang Ch'ing-piao owned it,
 but didn't write on it or cover it with seals. From him it went into
 the Imperial collection down to the early twentieth century. Chang
 Ta-ch'ien sold it in 1949. Now it's at the Cleveland Art Museum,
 which sits on a rise that looks out toward the waters of Lake Erie.
  
                     
  
                     Step back and gaze again at the land:
                                               it rises and subsides--
  
                     ravines and cliffs like waves of blowing leaves--
                               stamp the foot, walk with it, clap! turn,
                               the creeks come in, ah!
                               strained through boulders,
                               mountains walking on the water,
                               water ripples every hill.
  
 --I walk out of the museum--low gray clouds over the lake--
 chill March breeze.
  
                     
  
                     Old ghost ranges, sunken rivers, come again
                              stand by the wall and tell their tale,
                      walk the path, sit the rains,
                      grind the ink, wet the brushes, unroll the
                               broad white space:
  
                      lead out and tip
                      the moist black line.
  
                      Walking on walking,
                                               under foot          earth turns.
  
                      Streams and mountains never stay the same.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 Note: A hand scroll by this name showed up in Shansi province, central China, in 
 the thirteenth century. Even then the painter was unknown, "a person of the Sung
 Dynasty. Now it's on Turtle Island. Unroll the scroll to the left, a section at a time, as
 you let the right side roll back in. Place by place unfurls.





Old Bones
 

Out there walking round, looking out for food,
 a rootstock, a birdcall, a seed that you can crack
 plucking, digging, snaring, snagging,
          barely getting by,
  
 no food out there on dusty slopes of scree--
 carry some--look for some,
 go for a hungry dream.
 Deer bone, Dall sheep,
          bones hunger home.
  
 Out there somewhere
 a shrine for the old ones,
 the dust of the old bones,
          old songs and tales.
  
 What we ate--who ate what--
          how we all prevailed.





Night Song of the Los Angeles Basin
 

                                   Owl
                         calls, 
                         pollen dust blows
                Swirl of light strokes writhing
                knot-tying light paths,
  
                calligraphy of cars.
  
 Los Angeles basin and hill slopes
 Checkered with streetways. Floral loops
 Of the freeway express and exchange.
  
                   Dragons of light in the dark
                   sweep going both ways
                   in the night city belly.
                   The passage of light end to end and rebound,
                   --ride drivers all heading somewhere--
                   etch in their traces to night's eye-mind
  
                   calligraphy of cars.
  
 Vole paths. Mouse trails worn in
 On meadow grass;
 Winding pocket-gopher tunnels,
 Marmot lookout rocks.
 Houses with green watered gardens
 Slip under the ghost of the dry chaparral,
  
                   Ghost
                   shrine to the L. A. River
                   The jinja that never was there
                   is there.
                   Where the river debouches
                   the place of the moment
                   of trembling and gathering and giving
                   so that lizards clap hands there
                   --just lizards
                   come pray, saying
                   "please give us health and long life.
  
                             A hawk,
                             a mouse.
  
 Slash of calligraphy of freeways of cars.
  
                   Into the pools of the channelized river
                   the Goddess in tall rain dress
                   tosses a handful of meal.
  
                   Gold bellies roil
                   mouth-bubbles, frenzy of feeding,
                   the common ones, the bright-colored rare ones
                   show up, they tangle and tumble,
                   godlings ride by in Rolls Royce
                   wide-eyed in brokers' halls
                   lifted in hotels
                   being presented to, platters
                   of tidbit and wine,
                   snatch of fame,
  
                            churn and roil,
  
                   meal gone   the water subsides.
  
                            A mouse,
                            a hawk.
  
 The calligraphy of lights on the night
                    freeways of Los Angeles
  
                    will long be remembered.
  
                            Owl
                    calls;
                             late-rising moon.





The Dance
 

"Against its will, energy is doing something productive, like the devil in medieval history. The principle is that nature does something against its own will and, by self-entanglement, produces beauty.

 gave birth to rocks, trees, rivers, mountains, grass
 and last, a blazing child
           so burned she died.
  
           In the land of darkness
           a mass of pollution.
  
           Ah wash her clear stream
  
           --skinny  little  girl   with   big ears
           we have passed through
                     passed through,     flesh out of flesh.
  
           
  
 "Shining Heavens, Goddess of the Sun,
          her brother flung
                    mud and shit and a half-skinned pony through
                    the palace,
 so she entered a cave--shut it up with a rock--
          made the world dark.
  
         
  
 Ame-no-uzume, "Outrageous Heavenly Woman, wrapped
 the numinous club-moss of Mr. Kagu round her hips, made
 a headband from the leaves of nishikigi, bound bamboo
 grass for her wristlets, and put a sounding-board down
 before the cave where the Sun Goddess stayed.
      She danced and she stamped til it echoed around, she
 danced like a goddess possessed, pulled out her nipples,
 pushed her sash down til she showed herself down below,
 and the Plain of High Heaven shook with the laughs and
 the cheers and the whistles of thousands of gods who were
 gathered to watch.
                                                                             Jean Herbert
  
          

         The whole river. Clear back to each creeklet
          rock-rimmed,
                   all one basin drawing in the threads
          pacing down dry riverbeds the dance,
                mai, stomping, stepping on the gravelly bar
          step, stop, stamp of the foot. Glide and turn,
  
                   headwaters, mountains,
                            breathing icy bliss
  
          diamond-glittered bitty snowcreek
          eating the inorganic granite down.
  
          Trees once cooled the air, and clouds, ah, ghost of
                    water
                    springs gone dry. Hills of Yugoslavia clearcut

          gether bundles of sasa leaves to hold in her hands, and
          overturning a bucket before the heavenly rock-cave
          door, stamped resoundingly upon it. Then she became
          divinely possessed, exposed her breasts, and pushed
          her skirt-band down to her genitals.

Finding the Space in the Heart
 

I first saw it in the sixties,
 driving a Volkswagen camper
 with a fierce gay poet and a
 lovely but dangerous girl with a husky voice,
  
 we came down from Canada
 on the dry east side of the ranges. Grand Coulee, Blue
 Mountains, lava flow caves,
 the Alvord desert--pronghorn ranges--
 and the glittering obsidian-paved
 dirt track toward Vya,
 seldom-seen roads late September and
 thick frost at dawn; then
 follow a canyon and suddenly open to
           silvery flats that curved over the edge
  
           O, ah! The
           awareness of emptiness
           brings forth a heart of compassion!
  
 We followed the rim of the playa
 to a bar where the roads end
 and over a pass into Pyramid Lake
 from the Smoke Creek side,
 by the ranches of wizards
 who follow the tipi path.
 The next day we reached San Francisco
 in a time when it seemed
 the world might head a new way.
  
 And again, in the seventies, back from
 Montana, I recklessly pulled off the highway
 took a dirt track onto the flats,
 got stuck--scared the kids--slept the night,
 and the next day sucked free and went on.
  
 Fifteen years passed. In the eighties
 With my lover I went where the roads end.
 Walked the hills for a day,
 looked out where it all drops away,
 discovered a path
 of carved stone inscriptions tucked into the sagebrush
  
           "Stomp out greed
           "The best things in life are not things
  
 words placed by an old desert sage.
  
 Faint shorelines seen high on these slopes,
 long gone Lake Lahontan,
 cutthroat trout spirit in silt--
 Columbian Mammoth bones
 four hundred feet up on the wave-etched
           beach ledge; curly-horned
                     desert sheep outlines pecked into the rock,
  
 and turned the truck onto the playa
 heading for know-not,
 bone-gray dust boiling and billowing,
 mile after mile, trackless and featureless,
 let the car coast to a halt
 on the crazed cracked
 flat hard face where
 winter snow spirals, and
 summer sun bakes like a kiln.
 Off nowhere, to be or not be,
  
           all equal, far reaches, no bounds.
           Sound swallowed away         
           no waters, no mountains, no
           bush no grass and
                     because no grass
           no shade but your shadow.
           No flatness because no not-flatness.
           No loss, no gain. So--
           nothing in the way!
           --the ground is the sky
           the sky is the ground,
           no place between, just
  
           wind-whip breeze,
           tent-mouth leeward,
           time being here.
           We meet heart to heart,
           leg hard-twined to leg,
                     with a kiss that goes to the bone.
           Dawn sun comes straight in the eye. The tooth
           of a far peak called King Lear.
  
 Now in the nineties desert night
           --my lover's my wife--
 old friends, old trucks, drawn around;
 great arcs of kids on bikes out there in darkness
           no lights--just planet Venus glinting
 by the calyx crescent moon,
 and tasting grasshoppers roasted in a pan.
  
           They all somehow swarm down here--
           sons and daughters in the circle
           eating grasshoppers grimacing,
  
 singing stras for the insects in the wilderness,
  
 --the wideness, the
 foolish loving spaces
  
 full of heart.
  
           Walking on walking,
                     under foot   earth turns
  
           Streams and mountains never stay the same.
  
  
  
  
                               The space goes on.
                               But the wet black brush
                               tip drawn to a point,
                                        lifts away.
  
  
  
  
                                                             Marin-an 1956--Kitkitdizze 1996





reading
 

          
          there were so many books. she had to separate them to avoid being overwhelmed by the excessive implications of their words. she kept hundreds in a series of boxes inside a wire cage in a warehouse. and hundreds more on the shelves of her various rooms. when she changed houses she would pack some of the books into the boxes and exchange them for others that had been hibernating. these resurrected books were precious to her for a while. they had assumed the patinas of dusty chthonic wisdoms. and thus she would let them sit on the shelves admiring them from a distance. gathering time and air. she did not want to be intimate with their insides. the atmospherics suggested by the titles were enough. sometimes she would increase the psychic proximities between herself and the books and place a pile of them on the floor next to her bed. and quite possibly she absorbed their intentions while she slept.               if she intended travelling beyond a few hours she would occasionally remove a book from the shelves and place it in her bag. she carried the poetics of space' round india for three months and it returned to her shelves undamaged at the completion of the journey. every day of those three months she touched it and read some of the titles of its chapters to make sure it was there. and real. chapters called house and universe, nests, shells, intimate immensity, miniatures and, the significance of the hut. she had kept it in a pocket of her bag together with a coloured whistle and an acorn. she now kept this book in the darkness of her reference shelf. and she knew that one day she would have to admit to herself that this was the only book she had need of, that this was the book she would enter the pages of, that this was the book she was going to read
        




the library of t-shirts
 

          
          in order to upgrade the community's appreciation of poetry during the international year of cultural enrichment stage 2, members of the state's library progress committee decided to establish a small library of t-shirts on which would be printed quality verse in vivid, bold colours and lettering. the poems would be selected on the basis of one of three qualities: is the poem poignant, perspicacious, or pithy.   given the respectably researched fact that the wearing of words on t-shirts expresses a deep psychic desire for an intimate union of word and flesh, (and bear in mind the way "logo nudges towards "logos) it is not surprising that this library of t-shirts has been a great success. no one seems to mind borrowing pre-worn clothing. of course the library's washing and ironing staff maintain the t-shirts in excellent condition. even after ten borrowings the shirts look brand new. and considering the phenomenal success of andrew lloyd webber's "cats it is no shock revelation that t.s. eliot's "hollow men has proved to be the library's most popular t-shirt so far. in fact there are now eight copies of this shirt on loan, most in metallic or fluoro colours.   a couple of the more entrepreneurial of the library's progress committee members are leading the push for diversification of the library's poetry program, into neck to knee anti-uv swimwear, with maybe slessor, shelly and stevie smith prints for starters; and into underpants, with their multiple attractions.   while the committee feels both these garments could increase poetry's appeal, they are worried about the practicability of adding these garments to the t-shirt poetry collection. would many members want to borrow preworn underpants, however compelling the poems' cadences and metaphors; while the wear and tear on the swimming costume fabric via chlorine and salt water would perhaps be too great. however they are interested in marketing and selling these articles from a stall in the library's foyer. the only committee member unenthusiastic regarding this proposal is an optometrist who has raised the issue of eye damage if the typeface of the lines of verse on the underpants were too small. a solution in the form of large print haikus is being considered.

          from our deep cool verandah we spy on the world passing by. we both wear glasses in order to pick out the details. even as children we noticed all. people would say dont like those twins they look at you funny. we were reassured. our powers had been confirmed. but that was a long while ago. now we are 60. we have lived in this ground floor flat on the main road for 20 years. it is a very suitable dwelling, and we have a satisfactory relationship with the landlord. we think he is pleased we notice his transparency. we have been here since we left our husbands who got in the way of our observations.   after our evening meal we talk quietly of what we have seen. we believe in sharing our observations in case one of us has missed something. for our eyesight isnt as sharp as it was ten years ago. though we do clean our glasses each hour and keep our hair tied firmly back in small grey buns so nothing can distract our focus. we are small women. many people do not notice us, while we are noticing them. we keep to ourselves. mother used to say to us never get too friendly with strangers they can harm you. even if they smile and offer you an hour of their lives dont tell them nothing. mother knew a lot. she always kept the bible and a cloth to clean her hands on the kitchen table within reach.   at night we take turns to sit at the window and watch. we set the alarm at 2 and 6. this way we both get some sleep. theres always something to see along this road. even at 3 in the morning. last night we saw a woman in a torn fur coat, gum boots and a beanie blow up balloons, tie them on her arms as if they were wings. she climbed up a tree, spread her arms and jumped. we think she might have injured herself. she screamed for quite a while until one of the passing motorists stopped and rang for an ambulance. we didnt want to get involved. our slippers might have gotten wet. it had been raining quite heavily.   another night one of the local drunks fell asleep on our verandah. he smelt wretched but we were pleased to be able to get a closer look at him. for several weeks we had been trying to work out a few things about him. at least we were able to see how thick and long the scar on his bald head was. we were able to read the words on his tattoos, dearest jean' and sailor boy'. we also saw a thin line thru the word jean' as if he had tried to cut the word out. very interesting. we scrubbed the verandah with disinfectant the next morning. it didnt take long.   we keep records of our observations in a private code in large journals. we are saving them up for the day when our memories fail us. then we can read them thru to recall the details. they are an assurance that our days have been full and busy. we put black velvet covers on these books. they are so soft to stroke. just like the backs of our 8 black cats who often sleep like guardians in front of the cupboard as if they recognised the importance of its contents.   there are many folks with bad legs along this road. they hobble ever so slowly up and down all day as if they had all the time in the world. they bandage their legs in different ways. some of the bandages are rather grubby. you'd think theyd wash them. there are plenty of laundromats around here. every pension day they could wash them. they could share a machine. you can fit a good deal in one of these contraptions  at least ten bandages. dear me. if theyd looked where they were going instead of expecting life to do everything for them, they wouldnt be in this predicament. we're so pleased we're not handicapped. we have only ourselves to thank. and of course mother.   pension morning is always busy. we always make sure the teapot is full by 9.30. the crowd gathers outside the bank. for at least  half an hour. theres no time to get up and put the jug on for some time. they clutter the footpath. so many of them. it takes a while for us to sort out who's there. we sometimes use the journal if we cant quite locate every face. often its the only way to really know who died before the postman called. on our deep cool verandah we sit. the twins. there are no mirrors in our hallway.
        




Two Gates
 

I look through glass and see a young woman 
of twenty, washing dishes, and the window 
turns into a painting. She is myself thirty years ago. 
She holds the same blue bowls and brass teapot 
I still own. I see her outline against lamplight; 
she knows only her side of the pane. The porch 
where I stand is empty. Sunlight fades. I hear 
water run in the sink as she lowers her head, 
blind to the future. She does not imagine I exist.
 
I step forward for a better look and she dissolves 
into lumber and paint. A gate I passed through 
to the next life loses shape. Once more I stand 
squared into the present, among maple trees
and scissor-tailed birds, in a garden, almost 
a mother to that faint, distant woman.





Mirrors at 4 a.m.
 

You must come to them sideways
 In rooms webbed in shadow, 
 Sneak a view of their emptiness
 Without them catching
 A glimpse of you in return.
  
 The secret is, 
 Even the empty bed is a burden to them,
 A pretense. 
 They are more themselves keeping
 The company of a blank wall,
 The company of time and eternity
  
 Which, begging your pardon,
 Cast no image
 As they admire themselves in the mirror,
 While you stand to the side
 Pulling a hanky out
 To wipe your brow surreptitiously.





The Friends of Heraclitus
 

Your friend has died, with whom
You roamed the streets, 
At all hours, talking philosophy. 
So, today you went alone,
Stopping often to change places
With your imaginary companion,
And argue back against yourself
On the subject of appearances:
The world we see in our heads
And the world we see daily, 
So difficult to tell apart
When grief and sorrow bow us over.  

You two often got so carried away
You found yourselves in strange neighborhoods
Lost among unfriendly folk,
Having to ask for directions
While on the verge of a supreme insight,
Repeating your question
To an old woman or a child
Both of whom may have been deaf and dumb.

What was that fragment of Heraclitus
You were trying to remember
As you stepped on the butcher's cat?
Meantime, you yourself were lost
Between someone's new black shoe
Left on the sidewalk
And the sudden terror and exhilaration
At the sight of a girl
Dressed up for a night of dancing
Speeding by on roller skates.





The White Room
 

The obvious is difficult
To prove. Many prefer
The hidden. I did, too.
I listened to the trees.

They had a secret
Which they were about to
Make known to me,
And then didn't.

Summer came. Each tree
On my street had its own
Scheherazade. My nights
Were a part of their wild

Storytelling. We were
Entering dark houses,
More and more dark houses
Hushed and abandoned.

There was someone with eyes closed
On the upper floors.
The thought of it, and the wonder,
Kept me sleepless.

The truth is bald and cold,
Said the woman
Who always wore white.
She didn't leave her room much.

The sun pointed to one or two
Things that had survived
The long night intact,
The simplest things,

Difficult in their obviousness.
They made no noise.
It was the kind of day
People describe as "perfect.

Gods disguising themselves
As black hairpins? A hand-mirror?
A comb with a tooth missing?
No! That wasn't it.

Just things as they are,
Unblinking, lying mute
In that bright light,
And the trees waiting for the night.





In a Station of the Metro
 

Peace fell on the dim lands a sort of abstraction
The metronome counted one petal after another
So the petals fell as or in some music
This song needs no breath just an apparition
With a mouth open and eyes and eyes
The wet smear of eyes beneath pink 
Petals in excess of the window frame's bright 
Yellow square and yes spring gathers right now
The moisture from my breath up into clouds 
Whose downpour makes of the plum tree in blossom
A diminishing crowd for which the natural symbol
Refuses to exist a plain blue gem on a pin
Faces glowing within the stone like flowers 
Within the stone like flaws the mind turns inward
Turns inward its tangle of wet black boughs
A knot pulled tight so tight it ceases to be 

A knot yes I'll say it a knot that becomes angelic
Another example everywhere seen of the angelic
Gears toothless and without cogs a sort of mist
That turns the other gear by drifting through it
As just now through my eye drifts that storm
Battered tree whose broken-petal pocked bark
Asks of me a question my mouth can't speak 
Like a river that dives underground just there
There where the animals thirst the most
A desert fox say or say a toad or let's speak more simply
About a plum which bursts through its own explosion
Into being and hangs there so ponderously
As if as if not concerned with innocence or
Gravity or other acute angles as they evaporate
Into this poem O no am I speaking again again about
dim lands these dim dim lands of of peace






From the First, the Body Was Dirt
 

For T.S.
Whose hands touched, first, the head
of the penis, the shaft?

And was it soft
                          or shale?  More rock
than clay.

And who pinched first
into their place the small cups 
at the base of the ass? 

                                        Who was it
got down there, on whose knees,
and blew--
                         and was that passion
or panic, the machine that drove
those exhalations?
                                        --and how
could we rate the power of that
breath--breeze or gale or a whisper
like the song the little boy sings
to the beetle, 
                         whose small legs moved in tune 
like his legs, the legs on that first body, must have
moved, if they did move, when 
                                                       the dust settled.

In my mind everything's become enormous.

But was it ever small like that, the first body?

Did it ever sit close to the ants and their piles
of dirt from which that body had come?
You were a small boy once, I suppose.

You were dirty from the start.  

You showed me how to use a cock ring,
and why. 
                         How, without ever paying 
for a room, to spend two weeks in any city.
How two men could fuck 
and continue to face each other
directly
             --took my body and showed me,
my back on a table, my knees by my head.  
Stretched me 
                         into seeing you were more than a dog.

You must be dead by now, though I don't know
whose hands prepared you. 

                                                      Whose fingers
fingered, for the final time,
all that dark and kinky hair?

If the first body was made of dirt,
in order to plumb the hollow 
of that first throat, whose thumb 
first lodged inside the hinge
of that first mouth to force it open?

To make the tongue, so it could work,
who shoved inside that mouth
the shit of a hundred thousand worms?





Flatirons
 


                                           I
From the false summit, coxcomb-cum-arte,
cool thermals underscore our frailties,
past edges where our wingless feet are set 
and the long look down dilutes the evergreens.
As sandstone ends, the world of ghosts begins--
they sometimes rise up still in dreams, my love.
With one hand firm, I step onto the skin
of the abyss, embracing what's above
and severing spent ties to the scree below. 
The filtered light turns lichen eerie green,
ushering in a world we hardly know,
at least not one we're sure we've ever seen
just so, each climber brand new in his skin,
no longer mired in waiting to begin.


                                           ii
 
The whisper clings beside you as you rise
along the ice melt, following the chalk.
Its cadence is the thrum behind your eyes;
your trembling, the music of its talk.
No longer trust your arms; they're paid with fear.
Along the rock, the grip that's hidden there,
invisible but sure, will not appear
until you trade your fast-hold for the air,
and, as you reach, it ripples like a pool
in which your newfound safety now reflects:
the diastole of breath becomes the rule
for governing what atmosphere elects--
to claim this height as owed to us in spirit,
although we risk ourselves to answer it.

                                           iii
 
Free solo: dearest, I am losing you,
not now (one hopes!) but slowly, over time.
Admit that there is nothing left to do
but re-devote our efforts to the climb,
remembering that the second side is less
than a reprieve--more sheer and far from kind--
before the gentle, sloping wilderness
enwraps us and we let go of the sky.
Your living hand guides home my dangled foot.
At gravity's unlikely slant, we smear
across the arkose, knowing that the root
has taken hold deep in the layers. Here,
a thrust fault pushed up rock, and, as it rose,
it found its altitude in its repose.


                                           iv
 
Pinned to the face, you close the aperture--
no way looks right, and there is no way down
but keeping on--returning's hot allure
hissing its false promises, the sound
of the last support beam loudly giving way.
What is it that wipes the rock free of direction?
The crystal ceiling that began the day
goes black, almost it seems without detection.
The open door blows shut; the empty glass
brims over and, when raised, is dry again:
time's bait-and-switch. An hour from the pass,
wind drags high clouds across the peak; just then 
the air grows cold. Our backs turn to the weather,
as a way comes clear, ascending with no tether.

                                           v
 
It's when we're most engaged with other things
that the angel enters, a twist in temperature,
a lightness in the chest that we call wings. 
Giddy with sacrament and the impure
gluttony of blood and air and skin,
we look with panoramic eyes to where
the earth curls under and the sky begins,
though we ourselves are of this light-shot air,
senses extending without obstacle,
reaching past by rooting down through rock--
obdurate kindness, heaven's windowsill.
We are as useless as an open lock,
more insubstantial than a drinking song,
and marked by sandstone long after we're gone.





Whereof the Gift Is Small
 

Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey
And short the season, first rubythroat
in the fading lilacs, alyssum in bloom,
a honeybee bumbling in the bleeding heart
on my gelding's grave while beetles swarm 
him underground. Wet feet, wet cuffs,
little flecks of buttercup on my sneaker toes,
bluets, violets crowding out the tufts
of rich new grass the horses nose
and nibble like sleepwalkers held fast--
brittle beauty--might this be the last?





Calligraphy Accompanied by the Mood of a Calm but Definitive Sauce
 

Make your strokes thus: the horizontal:
as a cloud that slowly drifts across the horizon;
the vertical: as an ancient but strong vine stem;
the dot: a falling rock;
and learn to master the sheep leg, the tiger's claw,
an apricot kernel, a dewdrop, the new moon,
the wave rising and falling. Do these
while holding your arm out above the paper
like the outstretched leg of a crane.
The strength of your hand
will give the stroke its bone.
But for real accomplishment, it would be well
if you would go to live solitary in a forest silence,
or beside a river flowing serenely.
It might also be useful
to look down a lonesome road,
and for the future
to stare into the gray static of a television screen,
or when lost in a video game
to accept you may never reach the final level,
where the dragon awaits, guarding the pot of gold,
and that you've left no footprints, not a single one,
despite all your adventures,
anyone following you could ever follow.






You May Leave a Memory, Or You Can be Feted by Crows
 

Three years, Huang Gongwang 
worked on his famous handscroll,
Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains.

As he put successive applications of ink to paper
over the "one burst of creation, his original design,
it is said he often sang like a tree frog
and danced on his old bare feet.

One day, he adds one hemp fiber stroke,
the next a moss dot.

What patience he had,
like a cat who comes back season after season to a mole's tunnel.

Honors may go to others.
Riches may go to others.
Huang Gongwang has one great job to do.

And he sings like a tree frog,
and he dances on old bare feet.






Almost Nowhere in the World, as Far as Anyone Can Tell
 

It is pleasant, very pleasant, to sit at a wooden booth
surrounded by parrots, wheels, right-turning conch shells,
the victory banner and the endless knot,
the lotus, the treasure vase, the golden fishes--
is this not so? Is it not pleasant
to sip Tsingtao beer, or Zhujiang, or Yanjing,
and tap your fingers on the bamboo mats?
After we've drunk enough, there will be Buddhist Delight,
Mongolian beef side dishes, a whole host of sauces,
even some pizza and chicken wings if children are present,
as well as the small ice-cream machine, lotus paste, pears,
smiles and bows all around. It is pleasant, is it not,
to linger outside the door that opens to the parking lot
of this small strip mall beside this secondary road
and look upon the scattered cars all come to rest here
like boats in China, floating on a quiet evening tide.






With Drizzled Warm Butter, Intensely Rendered
 

What every painter knows, but most others forget
is how bright colors dim in artificial light

and lobster tastes most fresh
the nearer to death
you set your teeth into the lobster's flesh.








Developers
 

Greed got in the way. We built a fake estate.
Levinas said to see ourselves we need each other yet

doorbells, rows of them, glow in the night village
a string of lit invitations no elbow has leaned into

(both arms embracing messages). Unanswered
the doors are rotting from the bottom up.

It's another perplexing pothole in our road, loves.
Hard core from the quarry might make it level,

hard core and cunning speculation into matters
concerning love and doubt, concerning want and plenty.

O the places where pavement runs out and ragwort
springs up, where Lindenwood ends but doesn't abut

anywhere neatly, a petered-out plot of Tayto 
tumbleweeds, bin bags, rebar, roof slates, offcuts,

guttering, drain grilles, doodads, infill, gravel!
A not-as-yet nice establishment, possessing potential

where we have no authorized voice but are oddly fitted
out for the pain it takes to build bit by bit.

When the last contractions brought us to the brink
of our new predicament, we became developers.






The Boom and After the Boom
 

The Shannon when it washes
the shoreline in the wake
of a cruiser susurruses
exactly like the Polish
language you hear in lidl
on Friday evenings, 7 pm
payday. That's what
Gerry says.

                           

The river surface offers
space to the song:
hammer taps of Latvians
and Poles nailing planks
of a deck.        The place
between water and sky
holding sound. It is under-
loved and an amphitheater.

                           

Latvians and Lithuanians
are nailing planks
of grooved decking.
It will be a nice feature
of that riverside property.
        Their tap-tapping
underscores the distance
between this side and that.

Reverse Emigration
 

When I boarded the plane, everyone looked like Uncle Tom
ruddy, some were empurpled
gray hair or auburn in terrier thatches
pale blue of eye
a smidgen of resignation:

I thought holy god
the airline upholstery
was Yeats, Kavanagh and Heaney
handwriting. I thought
holy shit, this is the maw.
The maw.

                  silent Nehru jacket, holy Nehru jacket.

Hija for Emersons Birthday
 

I'm honored to shake the hand of a brave Iraqi citizen who had his hand cut off by Saddam Hussein.     --President George W. Bush, Washington DC, May 25, 2004
"Just ask yourself, we said back in those days,
"Is this world better off without Saddam Hussein?
Now that's a simple question. Just ask yourself.

It turned up starkly, undeniably
As that left hand inside the trench Marines were digging
At the prison turned "facility. 

That was one day's headlined excavation.
Meanwhile, the relics from the tell near Nasiriyah
Were looted from the National Museum.

Is our world better off without Saddam 
Hussein, who had cut off so many other hands?
Our own president had grateful thousands

On hand to honor him, give him a hand 
In DC on the birthday of the Sage of Concord.
In other words, though, is this world better off

Without those who have made it better off?
It's a bit of a riddle, really, how to tell,
But each old hand among us has a hunch.

Is our world better off without Bobby E. Beasely?
Michael Yury Tarlavsky? Craig W. Cherry?
Yadir G. Reynoso? Joshua I. Bunch?

These soldiers' names graced the obituary
Page that day in the LA Times. It's archived. Check it.
But what can we tell from a name? Or measly

Obit? Ask yourself. --Well, more than a bit
Of obit is in the name Tobit, but just what
Tobit of Nineveh--praised for preparing

For righteous burial the Judahites 
Who fell in war against Assyria,
And blessed with a devoted son who saved him--

What Tobit could now have to do with us,
Not even our extravagant friend Emerson
--Though wait! Emer? Cuchulain's perfect mate, 

Worked hand in hand with him, possessor of 
The six great gifts of womanhood, from needlework
Through chastity to sweet words and gentle speech?

--Perhaps not even Emerson could tell, 
Who lauded nature's "rounds and scorned the divisive "line,
Its "bounds of good and ill, and praised perverse

Returns ("Evil will bless, and ice will burn),
And who would have turned 199
That day in the merry month of Jumada al-awwal

When Bush addressed that brave unnamed Baghdadi.
--Raymond J. Faulstich, Jr., Kane M. Funke.
--What names people have! Stephen I. Yenser!

What monikers, what handles for their children.
--Daniel Lee Galvan...Anyway, without them, mind you,
We'd still have that butcher Saddam Hussein.
--Wait! With them, you mean, we'd still have Saddam?
--Well, it can be perplexing when it's put like that.
--Bemusing. Like the sound of one hand clapping.

--Or one hand washing itself. Is our world better
Off without Roberto Abad? --Abad, Roberto:
What kind of name is that, in any case? 

Middle Eastern? And where's the middle initial?
To tell him from his father, of course. A typo? For Bad,
Roberto A.? "Good is a good doctor,

But Bad is sometimes better (Emerson)?
Or W, where Emerson and Bush dovetail?
--It seems Roberto got his girlfriend pregnant

In spite of the "Campaign for Children and Families
Between Iraqi tours in case he didn't come back
From his second, which of course he didn't,

Not for a second, even, to glimpse his son,
Whose name we are not told. Hussein, perhaps--or George.
Or Herbert. George Herbert! (Such embranglement!

"I was entangled in a world of strife!)
Not that we always want "to know what we don't know
(Donald H. Rumsfeld). We're better off, long run,

If the right hand doesn't know just what
The left has done, right? This world war's better, for sure,
And to make the war's world better too,

Someone has to sacrifice. And ask
Yourself, just who would make the better sacrifice?
--Make: what exactly does that mean?
--The ones who wear elaborate tattoos
(Needlework patient, painful, eldritch, intricate,
Wayward as jazz played on the parlor boom box,

Raddled with fractals like our savaged delta),
Obscurely traceable to a secret Inca rite, 
Ink indelible as gang connections

That they could nonetheless obliterate
There by the Tigris, on Boulevard Abu Nawas
(Abu Nawas: the Holy Dissolute,

Master of the wine song and of satire,
First Arab poet to applaud Sayiddah Palm).
The idle hands who'd just have died at home

In drive-bys, done in by their neighbors? Druggies,
Who'd get as high as some pol's daughter and go awol
(lol) at their first chance? The born

Again, who needn't fear their death? The un-
reborn, spirits aborted by their own vile hands?
The Muslim Americans who had their doubts?

The ones who had no doubts? Just ask yourself. 
--Or: how many are we better off without?
Is this where quantity turns quality?

--The world might well be better off without 
Others better offed in the right course of things.
Without those looters, for instance, who vandalized

The earliest stringed instrument we'd had,
The Golden Bull's Head Lyre of Ur (in Genesis,
The Ur of Abraham whose sacrifice
Of his son Isaac God's hand itself prevented).
Without Hussein's own sons, and theirs, their sons, we mean,
And then which other ones? The Sunnis? The Shias?

The Ba'athist Sunnis and extremist Shias?
Or the Kurds? Which ones? The large Kurds? The older, hairy 
Ones, whose lives were mostly lived?

Or the small Kurds, who had no lives or hair
To speak of? The cottage Kurds? The urban Kurds? The turbaned
Kurds--those darker ones? The whey-faced ones? 

The anti-American ones? The Jewish ones?
The anti-Ku-Klux-Klan-and-anti-nra ones? 
The ones who "hate our freedom--and our baseball?

The atheists? And there are some among them,
Not fit to enter any god's Green Zone, perforce
Denied the houris, halos, hemp, and harps.

Or the Yazidis? Yes, that would make some sense,
Since they refuse to wear the colors green and blue,
And since they are so primitive they think,

In the beginning, God made the world a pearl,
And since they are so ancient, weak, impure, muddling
As they do trace elements of Islam,

Christianity, and Mithraism with some
Oddball Sufism and stray Persian superstitions.
Are there Iraqi Buddhists? No, really:

Are there? If you can't say, will they be missed?
--Well, shame on you, if that is not the old epist-
emological enigma wrapped
In a conundrum!--Or a condomrun, 
As Bush might say on an off day. Just ask yourself:
Is our world better off today? Without

David L. Potter? For whom, exactly? The Potters?
At least if the "remains go off to Arlington?
To Arlington we'll bring our "idle flowers,

Then--though "Every aster in my hand
Goes home loaded with a thought, to cadge from Emerson.
Loaded? And what do we mean by remains?

We used to mean: to continue to belong to.
It's doubtful that that definition still remains.
Is our "left hand an instance of remains? 

What about the Golden Lyre's pillar, 
Neck, and scroll, stripped of their gold and lapis inlay?
What about its shattered shell and limestone?

And what to make of this morning's "Missing Remains?
And "Remains Missing? Six years after Bush's offhand
Remark, new headlines from old headstones spring: 

"Thousands of Graves Are Misidentified
Or Unmarked at National Cemetery--the names 
Broken off like handles from their vessels-- 

Where also mud-caked markers line the banks
Of a purling stream (unnamed) and lie deep in its bed.
"Were they used as riprap to prevent 

The stream's erosion? our good reporter asks.
"Were they engraved incorrectly, hence
Discarded? Engraved. Incorrectly. Discarded.
Is Arlington our potter's field today?
And if so, as Abu Nawas's student asked, 
"Who is the Potter, pray, and who the Pot?

"How gladly with proper words the soldier dies,
Stevens's verse assures us. But on the other hand,
What are the proper words? Is that word proper?

And shouldn't that have been "the soil's erosion?
Erosion. So how would Eros figure here? Just ask
Yourself. --Of course he wouldn't! Be rational.

--And so we must mean Cupid. Cupidity 
Is one thing we'd associate with "the soil's erosion.
Or should that be "the oil's erosion? "The soul's?

Are we better off without our soldiers,
Not to mention their daughters, inconceivable,
Who might have married deep-rigged princes' sons

(As the First Daughters--light sweet crude rare--must have 
Might have done)? Without the so-called martyrs' sisters, 
Paradisical virgins, immaculately 

Pregnant with bombs beneath matte black abayas?
Bush's brave Baghdadi's daughter's better off, we're sure.
(And he was not a southpaw anyway.)

Or is it the rebellious, the disobedient,
Whose sisters' brothers died on our side near Samarra, 
Without whom our world's (mostly) better off?

It's hard to tell, when they have veils. It's hard
To tell, when phantom limbs report again tomorrow,
Just whom we're better off without. Yet ask
Yourself: can we contemn "the vanity
Of false distinctions in light of presidential Scripture?
"If thy right hand offend...--We must cut Matthew

Off quick as RFK, alas, in order
To go now to commercial. We're sorry. We're in the hands
Of the commercial. We leave you with this question:

Would our world be better off without Iraq 
Itself? Or what about your simple self?
--A little better, you must mean, or worse? 

--And what about our own bull-headed liars,
As Emerson might say? And the Milky Way--
Better off without this blue-green pearl of Earth? 

Yet who could tell? And if no one could tell...
What can we mean by tell? Now that's a simple question.





Footsteps
 

I have never arrived
into a new life yet.

Have you?

Do you find the squeak
of boots on snow

excruciating?

Have you heard people
say, It wasn't me,

when they accomplished
a great feat?

I have, often.
But rarely. 

                         
      
Possibility
is one of the elements.
It keeps things going.

The ferry
with its ratty engine
and exactitude at chugging
into blocks and chains.

Returning as ever
to mother's house
under a salty rain.

Slave up, slave down. 






Everything
 

Infinite nesting
pushes all matter
towards emptiness:
child-nodes,
tree-droppings
with a root element of null.
None is always included
in every cluster
of children.

Nothing in nothing
prepares us.

Yet a fresh light was shed 
on immortality
for me climbing the stairs
firm foot first.

Everything was in the banister:
crows on branches, crickets,
architects, handsaws and democrats.
Red moon at 3 am. 






The Cenotaph
 

I want to leave this place
unremembered.
The gas stove is leaking
and the door of the refrigerator
stained with rust.
The mugs are ugly
and there are only two forks.
The walls are black
and soft, the bed a balloon
of night-clothing.
The stairwell sloped
to a dragger's pace.

There are big windows
with blind-slats dusty
and gray. Street life 
goes all night and at dawn
freedmen shout and 
laugh outside the kitchen.

Where does life begin and end?
In the lamb or the cotton?
My pillow is my friend.






To the Angelbeast
 

For Arthur Russell
All that glitters isn't music.

Once, hidden in tall grass, 
I tossed fistfuls of dirt into the air:
doe after doe of leaping. 

You said it was nothing 
but a trick of the light. Gold 
curves. Gold scarves. 

Am I not your animal?

You'd wait in the orchard for hours 
to watch a deer
break from the shadows.

You said it was like lifting a cello 
out of its black case. 






To Robert Hayden
 

Less lonely, less . . .
I gave you 
a tiny box. 
You lifted the lid, 
praised 
the usefulness 
of my gift: 
a silver pin shaped 
like an amper-
sand. As you fastened it 
to your lapel, 
I thought again of 
that motel 
outside of Chicago. 
Te acuerdas?
I sat on the edge 
of a bench, 
untied my shoes. 
Face down, eyes shut, 
you breathed in
the aroma 
of sweat & allspice 
coming off 
the sheets. I tossed 
my ring--gold, 
inscribed--toward a pile 
of clothes. 
But the ring 
dropped in the small 
of your back 
where it rattled 
& rattled like a coin 
in a beggar's 
cup.





How She Bowed to her Brother
 

The story of how she bowed to her brother.
Who has whom as his.
Did she bow to her brother. When she saw him.
Any long story. Of how she bowed to her brother.
Sometimes not.
She bowed to her brother. Accidentally. When she saw him.
Often as well. As not.
She did not. Bow to her brother. When she. Saw him.
This could happen. Without. Him.
Everybody finds in it a sentence that pleases them.
This is the story included in. How she bowed to her brother.
Could another brother have a grand daughter.
No. But. He could have a grandson.
This has nothing to do with the other brother of whom it is said that we read she bowed to her brother.
There could be a union between reading and learning.
And now everybody. Reads. She bowed. To her brother.
And no one. Thinks.
Thinks that it is clearly. Startling.
She started. By not bowing. To her brother.
And this was not the beginning.
She has forgotten.
How she bowed. To her brother.
And. In mentioning. She did mention. That this was. A recollection.
For fortunately. In detail. Details were given.
Made an expression. Of recollection.
Does whether. They gather. That they heard. Whether. They bowed. To each other. Or not.
If in. They made it. Doubtful. Or double. Of their holding it. A momentary after. That she was never. Readily made rather. That they were. Whether. She asked her. Was she doing anything. Either.
In all this there lay. No description. And so. Whether. They could come to be nearly. More. Than more. Or rather. Did she. Bow to her brother. 
 
 
PART II
They were a few. And they knew. Not that. She had bowed. To her brother. There were
not. A few. Who knew. That she. Had. Bowed to her brother. Because if they knew.
They would say. That a few. Knew. That she. Had bowed to her brother. But
necessarily. Not a few. Knew. They did. Not know. Because they. Were not there. There
are not a few. Who are there. Because. Nobody. Was there. Nor did. She know. That
she was there. To help to share. And they can. Be there. To tell. Them. So. That. They
know. She bowed. To her brother. More. There. Than. There.

Which. She easily pointed out. Which. She bowed to her brother. And. Which.
If she had been likely to restate that doors which relate an advantage to their advancing. And not at all. As a coincidence.
She bowed to her brother. This was a chance. That might have happened. Minutely.
To interrupt a white dog. Who can occasionally.
In instance
No once counts alike
She bowed to her brother. For. And. Counts alike.
She bowed. To her brother. Could be lost. By their leaving. It as lost. By. The time. In which. They feel. They will. It is. Indebted. That able. Presence. As very much. And idle. If she were walking along. She would be. She would not. Bow to her brother. If she were  riding. Along. She would. Be. She would. Be. Not as bowing. To her. Brother.
As she rode along. Easily. By driving. As she rode. Along. She. Bowed. To her brother.
It is. True. As. She drove. Along. She. Bowed. To her brother.
Just like that.
She bowed. To her brother.
They were. There. That is to say. They were. Passing there. They were passing there. But not. On that day. And with this. To say. It was said. She bowed. To her brother. Which was. A fact.
If she bowed. To her brother. Which was. A fact. That is. If she bowed. Which. If she bowed. Which she did. She bowed to her brother.
Which she did. She bowed to her brother. Or rather. Which she did. She bowed to her brother. Or rather which she did she bowed to her brother.
She could think. Of how she was. Not better. Than when. They could say. Not. How do you do. To-day. Because. It is an accident. In suddenness. When there is. No stress. On their. Address. They do not address you. By saying. Rather. That they went by. And came again. Not. As. Or. Why.
It is. What is. Even. Not always occurred. Just by the time. That it. Can happen. To be curious. She bowed. To her brother. And why. Again. In there. Should have been. Not more. Than. That. Which. She bowed. To her brother.

Idem the Same: A Valentine to Sherwood Anderson
 

        I knew too that through them I knew too that he was through, I knew too that he threw them. I knew too that they were through, I knew too I knew too, I knew I knew them.
        I knew to them.
        If they tear a hunter through, if they tear through a hunter, if they tear through a hunt and a hunter, if they tear through different sizes of the six, the different sizes of the six which are these, a woman with a white package under one arm and a black package under the other arm and dressed in brown with a white blouse, the second Saint Joseph the third a hunter in a blue coat and black garters and a plaid cap, a fourth a knife grinder who is full faced and a very little woman with black hair and a yellow hat and an excellently smiling appropriate soldier. All these as you please.
        In the meantime examples of the same lily. In this way please have you rung.  
WHAT DO I SEE?
        A very little snail.
        A medium sized turkey.
        A small band of sheep.
        A fair orange tree.
        All nice wives are like that.
        Listen to them from here.
        Oh.
        You did not have an answer.
        Here.
        Yes.

        Very fine and very mine.
        Very mine is my valentine very mine and very fine.
        Very fine is my valentine and mine, very fine very mine and mine is my valentine.  
WHY DO YOU FEEL DIFFERENTLY.
        Why do you feel differently about a very little snail and a big one.
        Why do you feel differently about a medium sized turkey and a very large one.
        Why do you feel differently about a small band of sheep and several sheep that are riding.
        Why do you feel differently about a fair orange tree and one that has blossoms as well.
        Oh very well.
        All nice wives are like that.      
        To Be
        No Please.

KNEELING
        One two three four five six seven eight nine and ten.
        The tenth is a little one kneeling and giving away a rooster with this feeling.
        I have mentioned one, four five seven eight and nine.
        Two is also giving away an animal.
        Three is changed as to disposition.
        Six is in question if we mean mother and daughter, black and black caught her, and she offers to be three she offers it to me.
        That is very right and should come out below and just so.  
BUNDLES FOR THEM.
A HISTORY OF GIVING BUNDLES.
        We are able to notice that each one in a way carried a bundle, they were not a trouble to them nor were they all bundles as some of them were chickens some of them pheasants some of them sheep and some of them bundles, they were not a trouble to them and then indeed we learned that it was the principal recreation and they were so arranged that they were not given away, and to-day they were given away.
        I will not look at them again.
        They will not look for them again.
        They have not seen them here again.
        They are in there and we hear them again.
        In which way are stars brighter than they are. When we have come to this decision. We mention many thousands of buds. And when I close my eyes I see them.  
        If you hear her snore
        It is not before you love her
        You love her so that to be her beau is very lovely
        She is sweetly there and her curly hair is very lovely
        She is sweetly here and I am very near and that is very lovely.
        She is my tender sweet and her little feet are stretched out well which is a treat and very lovely
        Her little tender nose is between her little eyes which close and are very lovely.
        She is very lovely and mine which is very lovely.  
ON HER WAY.
        If you can see why she feel that she kneels if you can see why he knows that he shows what he bestows, if you can see why they share what they share, need we question that there is no doubt that by this time if they had intended to come they would have sent some notice of such intention. She and they and indeed the decision itself is not early dissatisfaction.  
IN THIS WAY.
        Keys please, it is useless to alarm any one it is useless to alarm some one it is useless to be alarming and to get fertility in gardens in salads in heliotrope and in dishes. Dishes and wishes are mentioned and dishes and wishes are not capable of darkness. We like sheep. And so does he.   
                                                                  LET US DESCRIBE.         Let us describe how they went. It was a very windy night and the road although in excellent condition and extremely well graded has many turnings and although the curves are not sharp the rise is considerable. It was a very windy night and some of the larger vehicles found it more prudent not to venture. In consequence some of those who had planned to go were unable to do so. Many others did go and there was a sacrifice, of what shall we, a sheep, a hen, a cock, a village, a ruin, and all that and then that having been blessed let us bless it.





Matisse
 

 
   One was quite certain that for a long part of his being one being living he had been trying to be certain that he was wrong in doing what he was doing and then when he could not come to be certain that he had been wrong in doing what he had been doing, when he had completely convinced himself that he would not come to be certain that he had been wrong in doing what he had been doing he was really certain then that he was a great one and he certainly was a great one. Certainly every one could be certain of this thing that this one is a great one.
   Some said of him, when anybody believed in him they did not then believe in any other one. Certainly some said this of him.
   He certainly very clearly expressed something. Some said that he did not clearly express anything. Some were certain that he expressed something very clearly and some of such of them said that he would have been a greater one if he had not been one so clearly expressing what he was expressing. Some said he was not clearly expressing what he was expressing and some of such of them said that the greatness of struggling which was not clear expression made of him one being a completely great one.
   Some said of him that he was greatly expressing something struggling. Some said of him that he was not greatly expressing something struggling.
   He certainly was clearly expressing something, certainly sometime any one might come to know that of him. Very many did come to know it of him that he was clearly expressing what he was expressing. He was a great one. Any one might come to know that of him. Very many did some to know that of him. Some who came to know that of him, that he was a great one, that he was clearly expressing something, came then to be certain that he was not greatly expressing something being struggling. Certainly he was expressing something being struggling. Any one could be certain that he was expressing something being struggling. Some were certain that he was greatly expressing this thing. Some were certain that he was not greatly expressing this thing. Every one could come to be certain that he was a great man. Any one could come to be certain that he was clearly expressing something.
   Some certainly were wanting to be needing to be doing what he was doing, that is clearly expressing something. Certainly they were willing to be wanting to be a great one. They were, that is some of them, were not wanting to be needing expressing anything being struggling. And certainly he was one not greatly expressing something being struggling, he was a great one, he was clearly expressing something. Some were wanting to be doing what he was doing that is clearly expressing something. Very many were doing what he was doing, not greatly expressing something being struggling. Very many were wanting to be doing what he was doing were not wanting to be expressing anything being struggling.
   There were very many wanting to be doing what he was doing that is to be one clearly expressing something. He was certainly a great man, any one could be really certain of this thing, every one could be certain of this thing. There were very many who were wanting to be ones doing what he was doing that is to be ones clearly expressing something and then very many of them were not wanting to be being ones doing that thing, that is clearly expressing something, they wanted to be ones expressing something being struggling, something being going to be some other thing, something being going to be something some one sometime would be clearly expressing and that would be something that would be a thing then that would then be greatly expressing some other thing than that thing, certainly very many were then not wanting to be doing what this one was doing clearly expressing something and some of them had been ones wanting to be doing that thing wanting to be ones clearly expressing something. Some were wanting to be ones doing what this one was doing wanted to be ones clearly expressing something. Some of such of them were ones certainly clearly expressing something, that was in them a thing not really interesting then any other one. Some of such of them went on being all their living ones wanting to be clearly expressing something and some of them were clearly expressing something.
   This one was one very many were knowing some and very many were glad to meet him, very many sometimes listened to him, some listened to him very often, there were some who listened to him, and he talked then and he told them then that certainly he had been one suffering and he was then being one trying to be certain that he was wrong in doing what he was doing and he had come then to be certain that he never would be certain that he was doing what it was wrong for him to be doing then and he was suffering then and he was certain that he would be one doing what he was doing and he was certain that he should be one doing what he was doing and he was certain that he would always be one suffering and this then made him certain this, that he would always be one being suffering, this made him certain that he was expressing something being struggling and certainly very many were quite certain that he was greatly expressing something being struggling. This one was one knowing some who were listening to him and he was telling very often about being one suffering and this was not a dreary thing to any one hearing that then, it was not a saddening thing to any one hearing it again and again, to some it was quite an interesting thing hearing it again and again, to some it was an exciting thing hearing it again and again, some knowing this one and being certain that this one was a great man and was one clearly expressing something were ones hearing this one telling about being one being living were hearing this one telling this thing again and again. Some who were ones knowing this one and were ones certain that this one was one who was clearly telling something, was a great man, were not listening very often to this one telling again and again about being one being living. Certainly some who were certain that this one was a great man and one clearly expressing something and greatly expressing something being struggling were listening to this one telling about being living telling about this again and again and again. Certainly very many knowing this one and being certain that this one was a great man and that this one was clearly telling something were not listening to this one telling about being living, were not listening to this one telling this again and again.
   This one was certainly a great man, this one was certainly clearly expressing something. Some were certain that this one was clearly expressing something being struggling, some were certain that this one was not greatly expressing something being struggling.
   Very many were not listening again and again to this one telling about being one being living.  Some were listening again and again to this one telling about this one being one being in living.
   Some were certainly wanting to be doing what this one was doing that is were wanting to be ones clearly expressing something. Some of such of them did not go on in being ones wanting to be doing what this one was doing that is in being ones clearly expressing something. Some went on being ones wanting to be doing what this one was doing that is, being ones clearly expressing something. Certainly this one was one who was a great man. Any one could be certain of this thing. Every one would come to be certain of this thing. This one was one, some were quite certain, one greatly expressing something being struggling. This one was one, some were quite certain, one not greatly expressing something being struggling.

Shepherd Road
 

Eventually, I grab the back-door key
from the cup-holder, slip a folded list
into my pocket. Inside, I dig through closets

to find the lincoln logs, the cardinal statue,
the clock shaped like an elephant, a kettle--

but the whole time I half expect to hear her:
the careful shuffle of her slow, flat feet;
her walker's unpredictable clap; her voice

trembling with evangelical vibrato.
Beside the bed, I find a King James Bible,

her careful marginalia penciled in:
Glory! Glory! Amen! I set it down.
I shouldn't want it just because it's hers.





Off A Side Road Near Staunton
 

Some nothing afternoon, no one anywhere, 
an early autumn stillness in the air, 
the kind of empty day you fill by taking in 
the full size of the valley and its layers leading 
slowly to the Blue Ridge, the quality of country, 
if you stand here long enough, you could stay 
for, step into, the way a landscape, even on a wall, 
pulls you in, one field at a time, pasture and fall 
meadow, high above the harvest, perfect
to the tree line, then spirit clouds and intermittent 
sunlit smoky rain riding the tops of the mountains, 
though you could walk until it's dark and not reach those rains-- 
you could walk the rest of the day into the picture 
and not know why, at any given moment, you're there.





After Disappointment
 

To lie in your child's bed when she is gone 
Is calming as anything I know. To fall 
Asleep, her books arranged above your head, 
Is to admit that you have never been
So tired, so enchanted by the spell 
Of your grown body. To feel small instead 
Of blocking out the light, to feel alone, 
Not knowing what you should or shouldn't feel, 
Is to find out, no matter what you've said 
About the cramped escapes and obstacles 
You plan and face and have to call the world, 
That there remain these places, occupied 
By children, yours if lucky, like the girl 
Who finds you here and lies down by your side.

In Love, His Grammar Grew
 

In love, his grammar grew 
rich with intensifiers, and adverbs fell
madly from the sky like pheasants 
for the peasantry, and he, as sated
as they were, lolled under shade trees
until roused by moonlight 
and the beautiful fraternal twins 
and and but. Oh that was when
he knew he couldn't resist
a conjunction of any kind.
One said accumulate, the other
was a doubter who loved the wind
and the mind that cleans up after it.
                                           For love
he wanted to break all the rules, 
light a candle behind a sentence
named Sheila, always running on
and wishing to be stopped
by the hard button of a period. 
Sometimes, in desperation, he'd look
toward a mannequin or a window dresser
with a penchant for parsing.
But mostly he wanted you, Sheila,
and the adjectives that could precede
and change you: bluesy, fly-by-night,
queen of all that is and might be.





Queen, you are fathomed
 

Exalted life
                         this

not because you know
slavish attention 
                                     or sit

bathed in the royal jellies
     and rarer distillates

nor because it commences
             backlit all 

by droning buzz and the mellow

                scent of lilac


                       but for your ignorance of desire

                       for your cloistering, Liege

Never wondering
               what tastes abound 
           in distant clusters

                                               so rich is your interior
                                                           your fecundity

                          your multiple dark imaginings

Never saying
                          as I do
            Why         and again                 Why

Never saying
                          as I do
                          to the world of surrounding combs

          Do you think I may someday escape





Among the Gorgons
 

For Eleanor
For seventeen years I was caught in the surf.
Drubbed and scoured, I'd snatch a breath
and be jerked down again, dragged across 
broken shells and shingle. I loved it,
mostly, the need, how I fed the frantic.

I'd skipped into that sea. Certainly not
a girl, but I could still turn a head as I took
the foam between my thighs. 
Then it was over.

                                Hiss of a match 
snuffed with spit. The sea had trotted off.
I stood in the stink of flapping fish.
At first it stung. A galaxy of dimes 
eyed my sag and crinkles and dismissed 
me like a canceled stamp,

but something tugged at me, silver braids
weaving and unweaving themselves
and either the path was shrinking
or I was getting bigger, for soon the way
was just a hair, the extra bit of wit

a grandma leaves on her chin
to scare the boys, and it led me 
into a cave crackling like a woodstove
with laughter. 

                            A landslide opened 
a seam of rubies and we stepped inside.





Death Gets into the Suburbs
 

It sweats into the tongue and groove
of redwood decks with a Tahoe view.
It slides under the truck where some knuckles

are getting banged up on a stuck nut.
It whirls in the egg whites. Among blacks
and whites spread evenly. Inside the chicken

factory, the Falcon 7x, and under the bridge.

There's death by taxi, by blood clot, by slippery rug.
Death by oops and flood, by drone and gun.

Death with honor derides death without. 
Realpolitik and offshore accounts
are erased like a thumb drive lost in a fire.

And the friendly crow sets out walnuts to pop under tires.

So let's walk the ruins, let's walk along the ocean
and listen to death's undying devotion.





Coffee Lips
 

The guest who came in to the street people's suppers last night,
An elderly man with a lost smart little boy's face and a look

As if he might turn against you anytime soon,
As if he'd just come into this world and he was extremely 

Wary about what the world was going to be, and he said, 
"If I ask you a question will you give me a truthful answer? 

And I said, "That depends on what the question is, 
Thinking the little elderly boy looked sophisticated and

As if he'd in fact been a long time in the world 
And would get the tone right, and maybe he did, or maybe he didn't;

At any rate he went on to ask the question,
"When I come into places like this and there are people holding

Coffee cups to their lips and they look at me,
Are they about to drink the coffee or not to drink the coffee?

He was balancing the world on the tip of his witty unknowing nose.
I felt like I was falling down someplace else than anywhere there.





Incubus
 

At the supper for street people
The young man who goes about all muffled up from harm,
With whatever he has found, newspaper pages
Carefully folded to make a weirdly festive 
Hat or hood, down almost over his eyes.
Everything carefully arranged to make him other.
The paper-covered razor blade in his mouth, 
Or the bit of wood, like carrying a message.

A fantasy so clever, outwitting itself, 
That it became what it was he was, and so 
He was what it was. The long loose shirt too big 
For him, the pantaloons too big for him 
Loose like the pantaloons of the circus clown,
Some kind of jacket too big, he got it somewhere.
His burden slept dreaming everywhere upon him.
As if his whole body and the clothes he wore dreamed
Of his condition and the dream came true.

His clothes slept on him as if they were his lover.







Ancestral Lines
 

It's as when following the others' lines,
Which are the tracks of somebody gone before,
Leaving me mischievous clues, telling me who

They were and who it was they weren't,
And who it is I am because of them,
Or, just for the moment, reading them, I am,

Although the next moment I'm back in myself, and lost.
My father at the piano saying to me, 
"Listen to this, he called the piece Warum?

And the nearest my father could come to saying what
He made of that was lamely to say he didn't,
Schumann didn't, my father didn't, know why.

"What's in a dog's heart? I once asked in a poem,
And Christopher Ricks when he read it said, "Search me.
He wasn't just being funny, he was right.

You can't tell anything much about who you are
By exercising on the Romantic bars.
What are the wild waves saying? I don't know.

And Shelley didn't know, and knew he didn't.
In his great poem, "Ode to the West Wind, he
Said that the leaves of his pages were blowing away,

Dead leaves, like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing.





Catullus I
 

To Cornelius Nepos
Who is it I should give my little book to,
So pretty in its pumice-polished covers?

Cornelius, I'll give my book to you:
Because you used to think my nothings somethings,

At the time when you were the first in Italy
To dare to write our whole long history,

Three volumes, under the sign of Jupiter,
Heroically achieved; so take this little

Book of mine for what it's worth; whatever;
And oh, patroness Virgin, grant that it shall

Live and survive beyond the century.







Virgil, Aeneid, II, ii. 250267
 


And now the heavens shift and the night comes in,
And covers with its darkness earth and sky 
And the tricks of the Myrmidons. Throughout the city 
The Trojans, wearied by joy, lie fast asleep.
And now the Greeks set out from Tenedos, 
Their ships proceeding in an ordered line, 
Under the friendly light of the silent moon, 
Making their way toward the shore they know so well,
And when the royal galley's beacon light 
Is lighted, Sinon sees it, and quietly goes,
Protected by malign complicit fates,
And furtively opens up the Horse's flank
And frees the Argive warriors from its womb.
The Horse releases them to the open air
And joyfully they come out: first come the captains
Thessander, and Sthenelus, and dire Ulysses, 
Lowering themselves to the ground by means of a rope,
And Acamas and Thoas, and Pyrrhus, Achilles' son,
And Machaon the prince, and Menelaus, 
And Epeus, he, who contrived the Wooden Horse 
That fooled us so. And then they enter the city,
That's deep submerged in wine and unknowing sleep;
They surprise and kill the watch, and open the gates
To welcome in their comrades from the fleet,
Letting them in for what they are going to do.







Martial 1.101
 

He, who had been the one to whom I had
Recited my poems and then he wrote them down
With his faithful scribal hand for which already
He was well known and had been justly praised,
Demetrius has died. He lived to be
Fifteen years old, and after that four summers.
Even the Caesars had heard how good he was.

When he fell sick and I knew he was going to die,
I didn't want him to descend to where
The Stygian shades are, still a slave, and so
I relinquished my ownership of him to his sickness.
Deserving by my deed to have gotten well,
He knew what I had done and was grateful for it,
Calling me his patron, falling free,

Down to those waters that are waiting there.







C.P. Cavafy, Thermopylae
 

Honor is due to those who are keeping watch,
Sentinels guarding their own Thermopylae;
Never distracted from what is right to do,
And right to be; in all things virtuous,
But never so hardened by virtue as not to be
     
Compassionate, available to pity;
Generous if they're rich, but generous too,
Doing whatever they can, if they are poor;
Always true to the truth, no matter what,
But never scornful of those who have to lie.

Even more honor is due when, keeping watch,
They see that the time will come when Ephialtes 
Will tell the secret to the Medes and they
Will know the way to get in through the goat-path.







Dear Drought
 

Offer your usual posy of goatheads. Proffer
sharp garlands of thistle & Incas' thin down;
of squash bugs strung on blighted stems; send

back necklaced every reeking pearl I crushed, 

each egg cluster that I scraped away with knife
or twig or thumbnail. Wake me sweat-laced
from a dream of hidden stables: the gentle foals 

atremble, stem-legged, long-neglected. Dear
drought our summer's corn was overrun again
with weed & cheat; the bitter zinnias fell to bits.

Dear yearlings our harvest is lattice & husk.





Lithium Dreams (White Sea)
 

The Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia holds the world's largest lithium reserves. "As remote and unlikely a place as can be imagined for the world to seek its salvation.--Matthew Power
Once, volcanoes walked & talked like humans. Married.
           Quarreled & gave birth. When the beautiful Tunupa's 

husband ran away & took their only child she mourned: 

she cried & stormed, her full breasts spilled until she made
              this sunken bed, a dry & ragged ice-white sea. Tears

& milk. Salt. Silver liquor of the spirits, the winter tuber's pulp.

                                                            

Buzz Aldrin spied a plain from space: twice Rhode Island-sized,

not a glacier but this vast evaporation, a place so flat we use its plane 
to calibrate the altitude of satellites, measure the retreat of polar ice.

A dry lagoon of element. Energy. Winking like a coin in a well. 

                                                           

In bare Salar the tourists bottle sand & salt: mug & pirouette
across this lithic sink of drought, empty leagues of sky & light,

slight mist of silt. We dream our dreams of clean--or cleaner--
means to drive and speak--o Li, atomic number three, be 

our Miracle element!
                                        Prehistoric smelt, simmered & distilled

in Altiplano climes, your samite matter known to quiet, after all, 
the manic brain, the urge to suicide; proven to dispel the voice

that whispers fire from the gods is never free--
                                                                            Lithium chloride 
& plain table salt under ancient ocean crust; fossils & algae;

a bird so bright & blackly drowned, pickled in the salt brine pool:
the desert is generous. 
                                         The desert is a pot boiled dry. This road 

will turn to dirt and then to salt, to the workers in jumpsuits, 
veiled & covered from the brutal sun; but we're not here, not here--

what matters are the distant cities: Chongquing, Phoenix, Quebec,
Lagos, far & star-chalked: splitting at the seams. Now

                                                           

the shrouded workers wait for sunset. The desert is patient.
They see the bed plowed under: slapdash trenches in the legend, 

in the hasty furrows raked. With eyes narrowed from the endless
light. See Litio. Wages in the veins laid open; see paid the lush

reduction of her ditches' spill. This new abyss to feed our traffic.





Hard Times
 

The lousy job my father lands
I'm tickled pink to celebrate.
My mother's rosary-pinching hands
stack pigs in blankets on a plate.

Teeny uncircumcised Buddha penises
(cocktail hot dogs in strips of dough):
I gobble these puffed-up weenie geniuses
as if they'd tell me what I need to know

to get the fuck out of here.
They don't only stink of fear.
They're doom and shame and dumb pig fate.
I tell my mom I think they're great.

Dad chews his slowly with a pint of gin,
and says he eats a whole shit deal
because of us. My mom's in tears again.
I don't know who to hate or how to feel.





Epic Simile
 

For Rachel
Right shoulder aching with day-long butchery,
Left shoulder numb with dints clanged on the shield,
The hero is fouled with blood, his own and others',
First slick, then sticky, then caked, starting to mat
His beard--the armor deadweight all around him;
His teeth grit and rattle with every jolt
Of bronze-rimmed wheels behind the shit-flecked horses.
But when he glimpses the mountains, the distant snow,
A blankness swoons upon him, and he hears
Nothing but the white vowels of the wind
Brushing through stands of spears like conifers
While a banner slips its staff and hangs in the blue
Like a kestrel or a contrail. The hero's death,
The prize, elusive quarry of his life,
Stands stock-still in her cloven tracks in snow
And turns, one ear tuned to the creek's far bank,
One dished towards him. Her unstartled gaze
Beads on him like a sniper's sights, until
At the clean report of a cracking poplar branch,
She leaps away like luck, over rapid water,
And snowfall scrims the scene like a mist of tears,
Like a migraine, like sweat or blood streaming into your eyes.





After a Greek Proverb
 

   
We're here for the time being, I answer to the query--
Just for a couple of years, we said, a dozen years back.
Nothing is more permanent than the temporary.

We dine sitting on folding chairs--they were cheap but cheery.
We've taped the broken window pane. tv's still out of whack.
We're here for the time being, I answer to the query.

When we crossed the water, we only brought what we could carry,
But there are always boxes that you never do unpack.
Nothing is more permanent than the temporary.

Sometimes when I'm feeling weepy, you propose a theory:
Nostalgia and tear gas have the same acrid smack.
We're here for the time being, I answer to the query--

We stash bones in the closet when we don't have time to bury,
Stuff receipts in envelopes, file papers in a stack.
Nothing is more permanent than the temporary.

Twelve years now and we're still eating off the ordinary:
We left our wedding china behind, afraid that it might crack.
We're here for the time being, we answer to the query,
But nothing is more permanent than the temporary.







Lost to View
 

A range of clouds banked up behind the peak
Of that apocryphal
Blue mountain, with a wide, oblique
Burst of late sun
Projecting at the east's receding wall

A film of what the day so far has done:
A wind that tries to scrape
The breaking waves up as they run
Across the bay
And shatter at the foot of Fluted Cape

In tern and gannet-printed veils of spray;
And trees the wind has caught,
Which seem too self-contained to sway
When they are blown,
And only move as a pleasing afterthought.

No one. No human presence has been known,
Surely, to venture here.
It takes one blackbird to disown
That vagary
And, whistling just a few feet from his ear,

To call him back again and make him be
The subject in this scene,
The one who is required to see.
Another day,
No blackbird with its song will intervene.

The spray will hang its veils and the trees sway.





A Summer Garden
 


1
Several weeks ago I discovered a photograph of my mother
sitting in the sun, her face flushed as with achievement or triumph.
The sun was shining. The dogs
were sleeping at her feet where time was also sleeping,
calm and unmoving as in all photographs.

I wiped the dust from my mother's face.
Indeed, dust covered everything; it seemed to me the persistent
haze of nostalgia that protects all relics of childhood.
In the background, an assortment of park furniture, trees and shrubbery.

The sun moved lower in the sky, the shadows lengthened and darkened.
The more dust I removed, the more these shadows grew.
Summer arrived. The children
leaned over the rose border, their shadows
merging with the shadows of the roses.

A word came into my head, referring
to this shifting and changing, these erasures
that were now obvious--

it appeared, and as quickly vanished.
Was it blindness or darkness, peril, confusion?

Summer arrived, then autumn. The leaves turning,
the children bright spots in a mash of bronze and sienna.


                                                         2

When I had recovered somewhat from these events,
I replaced the photograph as I had found it
between the pages of an ancient paperback,
many parts of which had been
annotated in the margins, sometimes in words but more often
in spirited questions and exclamations
meaning "I agree or "I'm unsure, puzzled--

The ink was faded. Here and there I couldn't tell
what thoughts occurred to the reader
but through the bruise-like blotches I could sense
urgency, as though tears had fallen.

I held the book awhile.
It was Death in Venice (in translation);
I had noted the page in case, as Freud believed,
nothing is an accident.

Thus the little photograph
was buried again, as the past is buried in the future.
In the margin there were two words,
linked by an arrow: "sterility and, down the page, "oblivion--

"And it seemed to him the pale and lovely
summoner out there smiled at him and beckoned...


                                                         3

How quiet the garden is;
no breeze ruffles the Cornelian cherry.
Summer has come.

How quiet it is
now that life has triumphed. The rough

pillars of the sycamores
support the immobile
shelves of the foliage,

the lawn beneath
lush, iridescent--

And in the middle of the sky,
the immodest god.

Things are, he says. They are, they do not change;
response does not change.

How hushed it is, the stage
as well as the audience; it seems
breathing is an intrusion.

He must be very close,
the grass is shadowless.

How quiet it is, how silent,
like an afternoon in Pompeii.


                                                         4 

Beatrice took the children to the park in Cedarhurst.
The sun was shining. Airplanes
passed back and forth overhead, peaceful because the war was over.

It was the world of her imagination:
true and false were of no importance.

Freshly polished and glittering--
that was the world. Dust
had not yet erupted on the surface of things.

The planes passed back and forth, bound
for Rome and Paris--you couldn't get there
unless you flew over the park. Everything
must pass through, nothing can stop--

The children held hands, leaning
to smell the roses.
They were five and seven.

Infinite, infinite--that
was her perception of time.

She sat on a bench, somewhat hidden by oak trees.
Far away, fear approached and departed;
from the train station came the sound it made.

The sky was pink and orange, older because the day was over.

There was no wind. The summer day
cast oak-shaped shadows on the green grass.





Afterword
 

Reading what I have just written, I now believe
I stopped precipitously, so that my story seems to have been
slightly distorted, ending, as it did, not abruptly
but in a kind of artificial mist of the sort
sprayed onto stages to allow for difficult set changes.

Why did I stop? Did some instinct
discern a shape, the artist in me
intervening to stop traffic, as it were?

A shape. Or fate, as the poets say,
intuited in those few long ago hours--

I must have thought so once.
And yet I dislike the term
which seems to me a crutch, a phase,
the adolescence of the mind, perhaps--

Still, it was a term I used myself,
frequently to explain my failures.
Fate, destiny, whose designs and warnings
now seem to me simply
local symmetries, metonymic
baubles within immense confusion--

Chaos was what I saw.
My brush froze--I could not paint it.

Darkness, silence: that was the feeling.

What did we call it then?
A "crisis of vision corresponding, I believed,
to the tree that confronted my parents,

but whereas they were forced
forward into the obstacle,
I retreated or fled--

Mist covered the stage (my life).
Characters came and went, costumes were changed,
my brush hand moved side to side
far from the canvas,
side to side, like a windshield wiper.

Surely this was the desert, the dark night.
(In reality, a crowded street in London,
the tourists waving their colored maps.)

One speaks a word: I.
Out of this stream
the great forms--

I took a deep breath. And it came to me
the person who drew that breath
was not the person in my story, his childish hand
confidently wielding the crayon--

Had I been that person? A child but also
an explorer to whom the path is suddenly clear, for whom
the vegetation parts--

And beyond, no longer screened from view, that exalted
solitude Kant perhaps experienced
on his way to the bridges--
(We share a birthday.)

Outside, the festive streets
were strung, in late January, with exhausted Christmas lights.
A woman leaned against her lover's shoulder
singing Jacques Brel in her thin soprano--

Bravo! the door is shut.
Now nothing escapes, nothing enters--

I hadn't moved. I felt the desert
stretching ahead, stretching (it now seems)
on all sides, shifting as I speak,

so that I was constantly
face to face with blankness, that
stepchild of the sublime,

which, it turns out,
has been both my subject and my medium.

What would my twin have said, had my thoughts
reached him?

Perhaps he would have said
in my case there was no obstacle (for the sake of argument)
after which I would have been
referred to religion, the cemetery where
questions of faith are answered.

The mist had cleared. The empty canvases
were turned inward against the wall.

The little cat is dead (so the song went).

Shall I be raised from death, the spirit asks.
And the sun says yes.
And the desert answers
your voice is sand scattered in wind.





Convinced, 1957
 

          
          At last I was convinced that giving in to their thinking represented a huge error in the evolution of my family affairs. Riven with a savage melancholy, not permitted out of the house without two minders--one armed with needle sedative, the other armed with arms--I armed myself with myself and threw off the vulgar superstition and reactionary domination that had up to then poisoned my mental library, imprisoning me, making me believe, with them, that I must have children when I knew that I must not, would not.    And I did not.
        




The Art of Being
 

The fern in the rain breathes the silver message. 
Stay, lie low. Play your dark reeds 
and relearn the beauty of absorption. 
There is nothing beyond the rotten log
covered with leaves and needles. 
Forget the light emerging with its golden wick. 
Raise your face to the water-laden frond. 
A thousand blossoms will fall into your arms.





Sometimes, When the Light
 

Sometimes, when the light strikes at odd angles 
and pulls you back into childhood
 
and you are passing a crumbling mansion 
completely hidden behind old willows
 
or an empty convent guarded by hemlocks 
and giant firs standing hip to hip,
 
you know again that behind that wall, 
under the uncut hair of the willows
 
something secret is going on, 
so marvelous and dangerous
 
that if you crawled through and saw, 
you would die, or be happy forever.





Petition
 

What god will catch me
 when I'm down, when I've taken
 sufficient drink to reveal
 myself, when my words are little
 more than a blurring
 of consonant and vowel?
  
 I'm drunk on spring:
 branches of waxy leaves that
 greet me at my driveway,
 a family clutching
 trays of sweets.
 How can I sing of this?
  
 If I cannot sing, then
 make me mute. Or lend me
 words, send me
 the taste of another's prayer,
 cool as a coin
 newly minted on the tongue.





New Year
 

Last night something
             tunneled through the elms.
  
 But at sunrise,
             I found just white light
  
 biting my eyelids, salt
             rubbed on a wound.
  
 Batons of ice
             fell from power lines,
             
 soundless but still emphatic.
             Then the rain
  
 churned the snow to soap
             scum, waxing cars with
  
 winter's lichen, patchy
             in the strange
  
 uneven fur of newborns.
             And still, I was childless.
  
 One cardinal
             lodged on a branch:
  
 a blood-drop
             striking water
  
 before the slow dispersion.





Seeding an Alphabet
 

To invent the alef-beit,
 decipher the grammar of crows,
 read a tangle of bare branches
 with vowels of the last leaves
 scrawling their jittery speech
 on the sky's pale page.
  
 Choose a beginning.
 See what God yields and dirt cedes
 when tines disturb fescue, vetch, and sage,
 when your hand dips grain from a sack,
 scattering it among engraved furrows.
  
 Beyond the hill, a plume of dust
 where oxen track the hours.
 Does God lead or follow or scout?
 To answer, count to one again and again:
 a red maple leaf and a yellow maple leaf
 that wind rifles and rain shines until they let go,
 blazing their scripted nothingness on air.





The Vanishing Point
 

          
          You slow down to watch cumulus clouds stream across the sky. You choose a more circuitous route home and pass a tree with white bags tied around random apples. The apples remind you of clouds, how each hangs in the sky, singular yet part of a flock. Each item in the flock is a coordinate of earth and sky, enumerating space. The flocks of apples and clouds are actual infinities, an endless collection of discrete items that one can conceivably count to the end. This is different from potential infinity, which is the entirety of infinity, an immeasurable continuum that is greater than the sum of its parts. After your first glimpse, you are lonely for more contraction of space around the light of your mind contemplating what cannot be conceived. What cannot be  conceived this morning? The Army has found the larynx of an Iraqi man that American soldiers slowly strangled to death. His ribs, additional evidence for the trial, are still missing. They are in a refrigerator in Washington, D.C. These are discrete items; whereas how the passage of time felt as the soldiers strangled him is a continuum of infinite pain. And his words and songs and prayers and curses he will never speak are an empty set.
        




The Tabernacle
 

Hope fills me this morning as I fashion letters
 into a tree that sighs, that stays put yet moves,
 reaching to its limits, swaying and settling,
 a compass pointing to its place on earth
 where every morning it blocks the sun
 for me, at work in my studio,
 where I scratch and scrawl and loop
 letters into shapes so I can enter the Tabernacle
 of their bodies and hear each foot, each syllable
 sending its roots to a depth as great as that tree's,
 which has been standing and rooting and swaying
 long before I came to memorize its plain mystery,
 its wide-bodied hull open to stars at night,
 each a point that I lengthen into a letter
 and each letter into a word, and with the words
 build a Tabernacle for the ten most broken
 and the ten most resonant words. I will place them
 in an inner sanctum enclosed by hanging carpets,
 and outside it, another space enclosed by carpets,
 and outside it, another, so that those who wish
 to read the words, to say them out loud,
 must first pull one curtain back and step inside,
 and then another, and another until they arrive
 in a hushed space, a soundproofed, heavy quiet
 where they come to know that which makes all things
                                                                      day after day,
 and out of which the earth was made.
 Stepping behind each curtain they learn
 that the mystery of making is not a secret hidden within
 but a series of moves, a sequence of steps,
 outlined on a blueprint with notes and call-outs,
 white on black, constellations in the night sky,
 the primordial living Torah, circulating in the letters
 as trees circulate light, capturing it with their leaves,
 caching it within the soil, then drawing it back up,
 watering the tallest branches with the radiant dark.





[You who want]
 

You who want
 knowledge,
 seek the Oneness
 within
  
 There you
 will find
 the clear mirror
 already waiting





[I was passionate]
 

I was passionate,
 filled with longing,
 I searched
 far and wide.
  
 But the day
 that the Truthful One
 found me, 
 I was at home.





[Of all that God has shown me]
 

Of all that God has shown me
 I can speak just the smallest word,
 Nor more than a honey bee
 Takes on his foot
 From an overspilling jar.





[O my Lord]
 

O my Lord,
  
 if I worship you
 from fear of hell, burn me in hell.
  
 If I worship you
 from hope of Paradise, bar me from its gates.
  
 But if I worship you
 for yourself alone, grant me then the beauty of your Face.

Dan Emmett Writes "Dixie, 1859
 

He started with the tune his mother had hummed
 in Ohio, nostalgia he'd carried for years,
 and by Sunday afternoon he had the words.
 A triumph, already; he whistled the banjo's part.
  
 (Himself a sympathizer from the North,
 called copperhead, called traitor by his own kin.)
  
 Something lively, some git-up-and-git they'd wanted
 and didn't he deliver--
 Miss Susan got seven encores the first night.
 That gave them their tune, their Negro walk-around--
  
 Look away, look away, look away, they sang.
 Vipers, that spring, spread thick on the ground.





My Grandmother Plays Emily in Our Town
 

I
   
 I am asking something gone
 return: at least one night, her face
  
 a girl's, just twenty, and
 to be married in a month,
  
 holding the dress's hem to her lips
 as places are called. And I,
  
 come along too late to know her
 trembling, parting the curtain--
  
 let me hear her now
 perched on the ladder, recite
  
 "But Mama, . . .
 am I pretty enough . . . ?

  
 II
  
 When Emily marries, ladies in hats
 drown out the proper vows
  
 --it's what the play requires;
 the everyday over the sacred. Even the set
  
 is made of items found in the actors' garages
 so we always see back to the bones.
  
 Here my grandmother stands at the altar
 with her fictional George
  
 and gossip swells in the pews
 which are rows of folding chairs.
  
  
 III
   
 Among the murmuring departed,
 in the cemetery,
  
 my grandmother takes
 her place at the empty plot.
  
 She's the newcomer
 who can't believe she's dead
  
 if the living roam
 just on the crest of this hill.
  
 My grandmother in white
 poplin dress and hair ribbon
  
 lifts her arms in despair--
 Emily, untouched by the rain.
  
  
 IV
   
 Tomorrow her face will glow
 on the cover of The Shreveport Times--
  
 a gorgeous girl demanding her life.
 "But oh! she cries in Emily's voice,
  
 "I can go back there
 and live all those days over again . . .
  
  
 V
   
 So Emily steps back
 into childhood
  
 though the wiser dead
 have told her don't--
  
 into her mother's kitchen,
 her twelfth birthday, a moment
  
 she thought she was happy.
 She watches now
  
 that life: mother speaking
 gruffly, father late to work.
  
 Dead Emily kisses the cheek
 of the classmate playing her mother--
  
 understanding, in that kitchen,
 they'd all been blind:
  
 they never knew those people
 they said they loved.
  
  
 VI
   
 My grandmother maintains
 her grace to the end.
  
 She is the queen of the theater;
 all of Shreveport melts for her smile.
  
 She holds her palms out
 to feel the heavy drops as the curtains close,
  
 though she knows this rain
 is only the sound of rain.





Audubon at Oakley Plantation
 

I need them true to life
 and so I shoot them,
 as many as fill the field at dawn,
 and then fix wires
 to prop them as if feeding their young
 or bending to the river.
  
 Why make a little book
 when they exist life-sized,
 can be etched to stand high as my hip?
 Often have I wished
 I had eight pairs of hands to hold them,
 and another body for the gun.





First Miracle
 

Her body like a pomegranate torn
Wide open, somehow bears what must be born,

The irony where a stranger small enough
To bed down in the ox-tongue-polished trough

Erupts into the world and breaks the spell
Of the ancient, numbered hours with his yell.

Now her breasts ache and weep and soak her shirt
Whenever she hears his hunger or his hurt;

She can't change water into wine; instead
She fashions sweet milk out of her own blood.





slaveships
 

loaded like spoons

 where we lay for weeks for months
 in the sweat and stink

 chained to the heart of the Angel

 as our bloody ankles

 onto a heathen country

Frank OHara
 

Winter in the country, Southampton, pale horse
 as the soot rises, then settles, over the pictures
 The birds that were singing this morning have shut up
 I thought I saw a couple kissing, but Larry said no
 It's a strange bird. He should know. & I think now
 "Grandmother divided by monkey equals outer space. Ron
 put me in that picture. In another picture, a good-
 looking poet is thinking it over, nevertheless, he will
 never speak of that it. But, his face is open, his eyes
 are clear, and, leaning lightly on an elbow, fist below
 his ear, he will never be less than perfectly frank,
 listening, completely interested in whatever there may 
be to hear. Attentive to me alone here. Between friends,
 nothing would seem stranger to me than true intimacy.
 What seems genuine, truly real, is thinking of you, how
 that makes me feel. You are dead. And you'll never
 write again about the country, that's true.
 But the people in the sky really love
 to have dinner & to take a walk with you.





[Ladies, who of my lord would fain be told]
 

Ladies, who of my lord would fain be told,
Picture a gentle knight, full sweet to see,
Though young in years, in wisdom passing old,
Model of glory and of valiancy;
Fair-haired, bright colour glowing in his face,
Tall and well-set, broad-shouldered, finally,
In all his parts a paragon of grace
Except in loving wantonly, ah me!
   Who'd know myself, picture a woman wrought
In passion and in presence after pain's
And death's own bitter images, a port
Of safety where untroubled rest remains;
One who with neither tears, nor sighs, nor zest
Wakes pity in her cruel lover's breast.





Ode to Himself ["Come leave the loathd stage]
 

Come leave the loathd stage,
          And the more loathsome age,
 Where pride and impudence in faction knit
          Usurp the chair of wit, 
 Indicting and arraigning, every day,
          Something they call a play. 
      Let their fastidious, vain
      Commission of the brain
 Run on, and rage, sweat, censure, and condemn:
 They were not made for thee, less thou for them.
  
          Say that thou pour'st 'em wheat,
          And they would acorns eat;
 Twere simple fury, still thyself to waste
          On such as have no taste;
 To offer them a surfeit of pure bread,
          Whose appetites are dead;
      No, give them grains their fill,
      Husks, draff to drink, and swill;
 If they love lees, and leave the lusty wine,
 Envy them not, their palate's with the swine.
  
          No doubt a moldy tale,
          Like Pericles, and stale
 As the shrive's crusts, and nasty as his fish,
          Scraps out of every dish
 Thrown forth, and raked into the common tub,
          May keep up the Play Club.
      Broome's sweepings do as well
      There as his master's meal;
 For who the relish of these guests will fit
 Needs set them but the alms-basket of wit.
  
          And much good do't ye then,
          Brave plush and velvet men
 Can feed on orts, and safe in your scene clothes,
          Dare quit upon your oaths
 The stagers, and the stage-wrights too (your peers)
          Of stuffing your large ears
      With rage of comic socks, 
      Wrought upon twenty blocks;
 Which, if they're torn, and foul, and patched enough,
 The gamesters share your guilt, and you their stuff.
  
          Leave things so prostitute,
          And take th'Alcaic lute;
 Or thine own Horace, or Anacreon's lyre;
          Warm thee by Pindar's fire;
 And though thy nerves be shrunk, and blood be cold,
          Ere years have made thee old,
      Strike that disdainful heat
      Throughout, to their defeat;
 As curious fools, and envious of thy stain,
 May, blushing, swear no palsy's in thy brain.
  
          But when they hear thee sing
          The glories of thy King,
 His zeal to God, and his just awe of men,
          They may be blood-shaken, then
 Feel such a flesh-quake to possess their powers,
          That no tuned harp like ours,
      In sound of peace or wars,
      Shall truly hit the stars
 When they shall read the acts of Charles his reign,
 And see his chariot triumph 'bove his wain.





Sonnets Uncorseted

 She was twenty-two. He was fifty-three,
 a duke, a widower with ten children.
  
 They met in Paris, each in exile from
 the English Civil War. Virginal
  
 and terrified, still she agreed
 to marry him. Though women were mere chattel
  
 spinsterhood made you invisible
 in the sixteen hundreds. Marriage was arranged
  
 --hers a rare exception. Despite a dowry
 a woman never could own property.
  
 Your womb was just for rent. Birth control
 contrivances--a paste of ants, cow dung
  
 mashed with honey, tree bark with pennyroyal--
 all too often failed the applicant.
  
  
                                     2
  
 If anything went wrong you bled to death.
 You bore & bore & bore as you were taught
 screaming sometimes for days in childbirth.
 To bring forth was a woman's fate
  
 but not for Margaret Cavendish, childless
 Duchess of Newcastle. After the head
 of Charles the First had been detached
 and the Restoration seated a new monarch,
  
 she and the duke returned to his estate
 where nothing discomposed their paradise.
 How rare, two lovers scribbling away,
 admiring each other's words in privacy.
 He: polymath, equestrian, playwright.
 She: philosopher, fantasist, poet.
  
  
                                     3
  
 His the first book on the art of dressage,
 till then an untried humane approach
 to teaching classic paces in the mange,
 the grace of the levade and the piaffe.
  
 Hers the goofy utopian fantasy,
 The Blazing-World. The heroine is adrift
 with her kidnapper in a wooden skiff.
 A storm comes up conveniently, and they 
 are blown to the North Pole. He freezes to death
 but she is carried to a contiguous
 North Pole, a new world where the emperor
 falls in love with her, makes her his empress
  
 and cedes her all his powers over
 clans of wildly invented creatures.
  
  
                                     4
  
 Poems, plays, philosophical
 discourses on Platonick love, 
 a chapter on her Birth, Breeding, and Life
 and an Apology for Writing so Much
 Upon this Book about herself,
 even some inquiries into science
 years in chosen isolation the Duchess
 filled with words, and the Duke with reassurance.
  
 Even this outburst did not discomfit him:
 Men are so unconscionable and cruel
 they would fain Bury us in their...beds as in
 a grave[T]he truth is, we live like Bats or Owls,
 Labour like Beasts, and die like Worms. Pepys 
 called her mad, conceited, and ridiculous.

 Virginia Woolf, in 1928,
 found her Quixotic and high-spirited
 as well as somewhat crack-brained and bird witted
 but went on to see in her a vein
 of authentic fire. Eighty-odd years on,
 flamboyant, eccentric, admittedly vain,
  
 now she's a respected foremother among
 women of letters. Founded in 1997,
 the Margaret Cavendish Society
 -- "international, established to provide
 communication between scholars worldwide--
 is plumped with learned papers, confabs, dues.
 She's an aristocrat who advocates
 --words worn across centuries--for women's rights.

 I went to college in the nineteen forties
 read Gogol, Stendhal, Zola, Flaubert.
 Read Pushkin, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky
 and wrote exams that asked: contrast and compare.
  
 Male novelists, male profs, male tutors, not 
 a single woman on the faculty
 nor was there leaven found among the poets
 I read and loved: G.M. Hopkins, A.E.
 Housman, Auden, Yeats, only Emily
 (not quite decoded or yet in the canon).
 Ten years later, I struggled to break in 
 the almost all-male enclave of poetry.
  
 Here's a small glimpse in the the hierarchy:
 famed Robert Lowell praising Marianne
  
  
  
                                     7
  
 as the best woman poet in America, put down
 by Langston Hughes, bless his egalitarian
 soul, who rose at the dinner to pronounce 
 her the best Negro woman poet in the nation.
  
 Terrified of writing domestic poems, 
 poems pungent with motherhood, anathema
 to the prevailing clique of male pooh-bahs,
 somehow I balanced teaching freshman comp
 half-time with kids, meals, pets, errands, spouse.
 I wrote in secret, read drafts on the phone
 with another restless mother, Anne Sexton,
 and poco a poco our poems filled up the house.
  
 Then one of us sold a poem to The New Yorker.
 A week later, the other was welcomed in Harper's.
  
  
                                     8
  
 But even  as we published our first books
 the visiting male bards required care.
 We drove them to their readings far and near,
  
 thence to the airport just in time to make
 their flight to the next gig. You drive like a man,
 they said by way of praise, and if a poem
  
 of ours seemed worthy they said, you write like a man.
 When asked what woman poet they read, with one
 voice they declaimed, Emily Dickinson.
  
 Saintly Emily safely dead. Modern
 women poets were dismissed as immature,
 their poems pink with the glisten of female organs.
  
 The virus of their disdain hung in the air
 but women were now infected with ambition.

 
 
                                     9
  
 We didn't merely saunter decade by decade.
 We swept on past de Beauvoir and Friedan,
 and took courage from Carolyn Kizer's knife-blade
 Pro Femina: I will speak about women
 of letters for I'm in the racket, urging,
 Stand up and be hated, and swear not to sleep with editors.
  
 If a woman is to write, Virginia Woolf
 has Mary Beton declare, she has to have
 five hundred a year and a room with a lock on the door,
 a sacred space where Shakespeare's sister Judith
 might have equaled his prodigious gift
 or not. She might have simply floated there, 
 set loose in the privilege of privacy, her self
 unwritten, under no one else's eyes
  
  
                                     10
  
 Oh, Duchess, come hurdle five centuries
 to a land of MFA's in poetry,
 of journals in print and even more online,
 small presses popping up like grapes on vines,
 reading staking place in every cranny,
 prizes for first books, some with money.
  
 Come to this apex of tenured women professors
 where sessions on gender and race fill whole semesters
 and students immerse themselves in women's studies.
 Meet famous poets who are also unabashed mothers
 or singletons by choice or same-sex partners--
 black, Latina, Asian, native American, 
 white , Christian, Muslim, Jew and atheist--
 come join us, Duchess Margaret Cavendish.
  





I Was Never Able To Pray
 

Wheel me down to the shore 
where the lighthouse was abandoned 
and the moon tolls in the rafters.

Let me hear the wind paging through the trees
and see the stars flaring out, one by one, 
like the forgotten faces of the dead.

I was never able to pray, 
but let me inscribe my name 
in the book of waves

and then stare into the dome 
of a sky that never ends 
and see my voice sail into the night.





Mutation
 

They talk of short-lived pleasurebe it so
   Pain dies as quickly: stern, hard-featured pain 
Expires, and lets her weary prisoner go.
   The fiercest agonies have shortest reign;
   And after dreams of horror, comes again 
The welcome morning with its rays of peace.
   Oblivion, softly wiping out the stain,
Makes the strong secret pangs of shame to cease:
Remorse is virtue's root; its fair increase
   Are fruits of innocence and blessedness:
Thus joy, o'erborne and bound, doth still release
   His young limbs from the chains that round him press. 
Weep not that the world changesdid it keep
A stable, changeless state, 'twere cause indeed to weep.





The Snow-Shower
 

Stand here by my side and turn, I pray, 
   On the lake below, thy gentle eyes;
The clouds hang over it, heavy and gray, 
   And dark and silent the water lies;
And out of that frozen mist the snow 
In wavering flakes begins to flow;
                            Flake after flake 
They sink in the dark and silent lake.

See how in a living swarm they come 
   From the chambers beyond that misty veil;
Some hover awhile in air, and some 
   Rush prone from the sky like summer hail.
All, dropping swiftly or settling slow, 
Meet, and are still in the depths below;
                            Flake after flake 
Dissolved in the dark and silent lake.

Here delicate snow-stars, out of the cloud, 
   Come floating downward in airy play,
Like spangles dropped from the glistening crowd 
   That whiten by night the milky way;
There broader and burlier masses fall; 
The sullen water buries them all
                            Flake after flake
All drowned in the dark and silent lake.

And some, as on tender wings they glide 
   From their chilly birth-cloud, dim and gray,
Are joined in their fall, and, side by side, 
   Come clinging along their unsteady way;
As friend with friend, or husband with wife, 
Makes hand in hand the passage of life;
                            Each mated flake 
Soon sinks in the dark and silent lake.

Lo! while we are gazing, in swifter haste 
   Stream down the snows, till the air is white,
As, myriads by myriads madly chased, 
They fling themselves from their shadowy height.
   The fair, frail creatures of middle sky, 
What speed they make, with their grave so nigh;
                            Flake after flake, 
To lie in the dark and silent lake!

I see in thy gentle eyes a tear; 
   They turn to me in sorrowful thought;
Thou thinkest of friends, the good and dear, 
   Who were for a time, and now are not;
Like these fair children of cloud and frost, 
That glisten a moment and then are lost,
                            Flake after flake
All lost in the dark and silent lake.

Yet look again, for the clouds divide; 
   A gleam of blue on the water lies;
And far away, on the mountain-side, 
   A sunbeam falls from the opening skies,
But the hurrying host that flew between 
The cloud and the water, no more is seen;
                            Flake after flake, 
At rest in the dark and silent lake.





Summer Wind
 

It is a sultry day; the sun has drunk
The dew that lay upon the morning grass;
There is no rustling in the lofty elm
That canopies my dwelling, and its shade
Scarce cools me. All is silent, save the faint
And interrupted murmur of the bee,
Settling on the sick flowers, and then again
Instantly on the wing. The plants around
Feel the too potent fervors: the tall maize
Rolls up its long green leaves; the clover droops
Its tender foliage, and declines its blooms.
But far in the fierce sunshine tower the hills,
With all their growth of woods, silent and stern,
As if the scorching heat and dazzling light
Were but an element they loved. Bright clouds,
Motionless pillars of the brazen heaven
Their bases on the mountainstheir white tops
Shining in the far etherfire the air
With a reflected radiance, and make turn
The gazer's eye away. For me, I lie
Languidly in the shade, where the thick turf,
Yet virgin from the kisses of the sun,
Retains some freshness, and I woo the wind
That still delays his coming. Why so slow,
Gentle and voluble spirit of the air?
Oh, come and breathe upon the fainting earth
Coolness and life! Is it that in his caves
He hears me? See, on yonder woody ridge,
The pine is bending his proud top, and now
Among the nearer groves, chestnut and oak
Are tossing their green boughs about. He comes;
Lo, where the grassy meadow runs in waves!
The deep distressful silence of the scene
Breaks up with mingling of unnumbered sounds
And universal motion. He is come,
Shaking a shower of blossoms from the shrubs,
And bearing on their fragrance; and he brings
Music of birds, and rustling of young boughs,
And sound of swaying branches, and the voice
Of distant waterfalls. All the green herbs
Are stirring in his breath; a thousand flowers,
By the road-side and the borders of the brook,
Nod gayly to each other; glossy leaves
Are twinkling in the sun, as if the dew
Were on them yet, and silver waters break
Into small waves and sparkle as he comes.





"I Broke the Spell That Held Me Long
 

I broke the spell that held me long,
The dear, dear witchery of song.
I said, the poet's idle lore
Shall waste my prime of years no more,
For Poetry, though heavenly born,
Consorts with poverty and scorn.

I broke the spellnor deemed its power
Could fetter me another hour.
Ah, thoughtless! how could I forget
Its causes were around me yet?
For wheresoe'er I looked, the while,
Was Nature's everlasting smile.

Still came and lingered on my sight
Of flowers and streams the bloom and light,
And glory of the stars and sun; 
And these and poetry are one.
They, ere the world had held me long,
Recalled me to the love of song.





Momentary
 

I never glimpse her but she goes
Who had been basking in the sun,
Her links of chain mail one by one
Aglint with pewter, bronze and rose.

I never see her lying coiled
Atop the garden step, or under
A dark leaf, unless I blunder
And by some motion she is foiled.

Too late I notice as she passes
Zither of chromatic scale--
I only ever see her tail
Quicksilver into tall grasses.

I know her only by her flowing,
By her glamour disappearing
Into shadow as I'm nearing--
I only recognize her going.





Dare
 

Not, this time, to infer
but to wait you out
between regret and parking lot
somewhere in the day 
like a dare

Salt grime and the foodcarts'
rising steam, at Prospect St. a goshawk
huge and aloof, picking at something,
nested in twigs and police tape
for a while we all
held our phones up

It is relentless, the suddenness
of every other 
song, creature, neighbor
as though this life 
would prove you
only by turning into itself





How to Get There
 

Turn left off Henry onto Middagh Street 
     to see our famous firehouse, home
          of Engine 205 and

Hook & Ladder 118 and home also to
     the mythic painting "Fire under
          the Bridge decorating

the corrugated sliding door. The painting
     depicts a giant American flag
          wrinkled by wind   

and dwarfing the famous Brooklyn Bridge
     as it stretches as best it can 
          to get a purchase

on Manhattan. In the distance a few dismal
     towers and beyond the towers
          still another river.
          
A little deal table holds a tiny American
     flag--like the one Foreman held
          as he bowed to

receive gold at the '68 Olympics in Mexico
     City--; this actual flag is rooted in
          a can of hothouse

roses going brown at the edges and beginning 
     to shed. There's a metal collection
          box bearing the 

names of those lost during the recent burnings.
     Should you stop to shake the box--
          which is none

of your business--you'll hear only a whisper.
     Perhaps the donations are all
          hush money,

ones, fives, tens, twenties, or more likely
     there are IOUs and the heart
          of Brooklyn 

has gone cold from so much asking.
     Down the block and across
          the street, a man

sleeps on the sidewalk, an ordinary
     man, somehow utterly spent,
          he sleeps through 

all the usual sounds of a Brooklyn noon.
     Beside him a dog, a terrier,
          its muzzle resting

on crossed paws, its brown eyes wide
     and intelligent. Between man
          and dog sits

a take-out coffee cup meant to receive,
     next to it a picture of Jesus--
          actually
    
a digital, color photograph of the Lord 
     in his prime, robed and 
          though bearded
    
impossibly young and athletic, and--
     as always--alone. "Give 
          what you can,  

says a hand-lettered cardboard sign 
     to all who pass. If you stand
          there long enough

without giving or receiving the shabby,
     little terrier will close his eyes.
          If you stand

there long enough the air will thicken 
     with dusk and dust and exhaust
          and finally with

a starless dark. The day will become something
     it's never been before, something for
          which I have no name.





Sunflowers
 

No pitying/"Ah for this one --Alan Shapiro
No, nor a fierce hurrah
for what it does without choice,
for following the light
for the same reason the light follows it.

Just a thing rough to the touch, a face
like a thousand ticks turning their backs,
suckling at something you can't see,
and a body like a tag off the earth

so that my child hands couldn't tear it out
from the overgrown lot next door.
                           My palms raw with the shock
of quills and spines. Its hold like spite, and ugly

except when seen from a distance--
a whole field of them by the highway,
an 80-mile-per-hour view
                           like a camera's flash.
All of them like halos
without saints to weigh them down.





Psalm to Be Read with Closed Eyes
 

Ignorance will carry me through the last days,
the blistering cities, over briny rivers
swarming with jellyfish, as once my father
carried me from the car up the tacked carpet
to the white bed, and if I woke, I never knew it.





Creole
 

I'm tired of the gods, I'm pious about the ancestors: afloat
In the wake widening behind me in time, the restive devisers.

My father had one job from high school till he got fired at thirty. 
The year was 1947 and his boss, planning to run for mayor, 

Wanted to hire an Italian veteran, he explained, putting it
In plain English. I was seven years old, my sister was two. 

The barbarian tribes in the woods were so savage the Empire 
Had to conquer them to protect and clear its perimeter.

So into the woods Rome sent out missions of civilizing 
Governors and invaders to establish schools, courts, garrisons:

Soldiers, clerks, officials, citizens with their household slaves.
Years or decades or entire lives were spent out in the hinterlands--

Which might be good places to retire on a government pension,
Especially if in those work-years you had acquired a native wife.

Often I get these things wrong or at best mixed up but I do
Feel piety toward those persistent mixed families in Gaul,

Britain, Thrace. When I die may I take my place in the wedge
Widening and churning in the mortal ocean of years of souls.

As I get it, the Roman colonizing and mixing, the intricate Imperial
Processes of enslaving and freeing, involved not just the inevitable

Fucking in all senses of the word, but also marriages and births
As developers and barbers, scribes and thugs mingled and coupled

With the native people and peoples. Begetting and trading, they
Needed to swap, blend and improvise languages--couples

Especially needed to invent French, Spanish, German: and I confess-- 
Roman, barbarian--I find that Creole work more glorious than God.

The way it happened, the school sent around a notice: anybody
Interested in becoming an apprentice optician, raise your hand.

It was the Great Depression, anything about a job sounded good to
Milford Pinsky, who told me he thought it meant a kind of dentistry.

Anyway, he was bored sitting in study hall, so he raised his hand,
And he got the job as was his destiny--full-time, once he graduated.

Joe Schiavone was the veteran who took the job, not a bad guy,
Dr. Vineburg did get elected mayor, Joe worked for him for years.

At the bank an Episcopalian named John Smock, whose family owned
A piece of the bank, had played sports with Milford. He gave him a small

Loan with no collateral, so he opened his own shop, grinding lenses
And selling glasses: as his mother-in-law said, "almost a Professional.

Optician comes from a Greek word that has to do with seeing. 
Banker comes from an Italian word for a bench, where people sat,

I imagine, and made loans or change. Pinsky like "Tex or "Brooklyn 
Is a name nobody would have if they were still in that same place: 

Those names all signify someone who's been away from home a while. 
Schiavone means "a Slav. Milford is a variant on the names of poets--

Milton, Herbert, Sidney--certain immigrants gave their offspring. 
Creole comes from a word meaning to breed or to create, in a place.





"The Altar by George Herbert
 

Tulips panted against the wall. So much need to feed
 a crisp stem, I thought, as we put our fingers 
in the bullet holes above the bed. Typed captions translated
photos of Rivera, Kahlo, Trotsky and his wife 

in her boxy suit, devoted smile, that hopeful hat
with bent feather below an image of the assassin 
who would get her husband in the end. George Herbert was 
what I translated, The Temple, the only book I brought, 

where he says the heart must be a stone on which 
to build God's altar--no love without affliction:
my hard heart meets in this frame. In those days, 
I loved the jungle, spread like wool below 

an unsteady sky and the crumbling pyramid's altar top 
flocked with moonlight. I loved the monkeys 
throwing sticks and rinds at tourists from their nests 
in the trees. The noise at night, the hysterical crush 

of insect limbs rubbing, animal want, all night banged 
against the window, each with an urgent song of me me me. 
How loud the fecund world can be. Mi corazon duro, 
I wrote, bored, and smoke rose from other tables, 

from the wheels of the cars on the cobbled roads, 
and once I saw a mouse, suicidal, enter the frantic 
crowd. I cried out at the park in Mexico City 
where Indians, ropes on their ankles, dove like 

fatal birds to the ground while a Hassid, in his 19th-century 
cloak kept after me, Speak English? English? He said, 
We've all become vegetarians. There isn't a butcher 
for miles. I watched his black hat disappear 

into the swarm of vendors, masked dancers. Was that it, 
devotion? Young and gorgeous for it, I crept away 
one night, met a German hippie and he pulled my swimsuit 
aside in the volcanic lake. The fat Costa Rican's coffee plantation 

unfolded below, the ranging packs of filthy dogs, the water 
so hot and sulfured I gleamed like something ephemeral. 
Sometimes I saw movies, cheap Hong Kong action films 
dubbed into Spanish with Mandarin subtitles. But that started 

to get difficult, the young men dying with extravagance, 
the improbable ballet of whizzing swords, gun fights 
in teahouses filled with caged birds. Herbert, 
consumptive and small country parish-bound, 

wrote that struggle must be the same as resolution, 
as faith itself, while he suffocated in his sad minister's bed, 
for years arguing with God and himself. It's the uglier 
business, willing yourself from despair to belief. 

In those days, I thought the saints, robes heavy with must, 
with ancient, gnarled hands, deserved the nothing 
they felt their way toward. In those days, my favorite saints 
were the ones who burned away young--I admired them 

in the cathedral paintings, hooded eyes, the brutal 
wings of their ribs, gilt halos, baroque frames. What does it mean, 
devotion? Mothers weep in the corners of those paintings
while a man, each morning, sweeps the church floor.





Consciousness
 

How it is fickle, leaving one alone to wander

the halls of the skull with the fluorescents
softly flickering. It rests on the head

like a bird nest, woven of twigs and tinsel
and awkward as soon as one stops to look.
That pile of fallen leaves drifting from

the brain to the fingertip burned on the stove, 

to the grooves in that man's voice 
as he coos to his dog, blowing into the leaves 

of books with moonlit opossums
and Chevrolets easing down the roads 
of one's bones. And now it plucks a single 

tulip from the pixelated blizzard: yet 

itself is a swarm, a pulse with no
indigenous form, the brain's lunar halo. 

Our compacted galaxy, its constellations 
trembling like flies caught in a spider web, 
until we die, and then the flies

buzz away--while another accidental 

coherence counts to three to pass the time 
or notes the berries on the bittersweet vine

strewn in the spruces, red pebbles dropped
in the brain's gray pool. How it folds itself 
like a map to fit in a pocket, how it unfolds 

a fraying map from the pocket of the day.





Spring Reign
 

Thank you whoever tuned the radio
to rain, thank you who spilled
the strong-willed wine for not
being me so I'm not to blame. I'm glad

I'm not that broken tree although
it looks sublime. And glad I'm not 
taking a test and running out of time.
What's a tetrahedron anyway? What's

the sublime, 3,483 divided by 9,
the tenth amendment, the ferryman's name
on the River Styx? We're all missing
more and more tricks, losing our grips,

guilty of crimes we didn't commit.
The horse rears and races then moves no more,
the sports coupe grinds to a stop, beginning
a new life as rot, beaten to shit, Whitman

grass stain, consciousness swamp gas,
the bones and brain, protoplasm and liver,
ground down like stones in a river. Or does
the heart's cinder wash up as delta froth

out of which hops frog spawn, dog song,
the next rhyming grind, next kid literati?
Maybe the world's just a bubble, all 
philosophy ants in a muddle,

an engine inside an elk's skull on a pole.
Maybe an angel's long overdue and we're
all in trouble. Meanwhile thanks whoever
for the dial turned to green downpour, thanks

for feathery conniptions at the seashore
and moth-minded, match-flash breath.
Thank you for whatever's left.





Compline
 

That we await a blessed hope, & that we will be struck
With great fear, like a baby taken into the night, that every boot,

Every improvised explosive, Talon & Hornet, Molotov 
& rubber-coated bullet, every unexploded cluster bomblet, 

Every Kevlar & suicide vest & unpiloted drone raining fire 
On wedding parties will be burned as fuel in the dark season. 

That we will learn the awful hunger of God, the nerve-fraying 
Cry of God, the curdy vomit of God, the soiled swaddle of God, 

The constant wakefulness of God, alongside the sweet scalp 
Of God, the contented murmur of God, the limb-twitched dream-

Reaching of God. We're dizzy in every departure, limb-lost. 
We cannot sleep in the wake of God, & God will not sleep 

The infant dream for long. We lift the blinds, look out into ink
For light. My God, my God, open the spine binding our sight.





Imaginary Number
 

The mountain that remains when the universe is destroyed
is not big and is not small.
Big and small are

comparative categories, and to what
could the mountain that remains when the universe is destroyed 
be compared?

Consciousness observes and is appeased.
The soul scrambles across the screes.
The soul,

like the square root of minus 1,
is an impossibility that has its uses.





Keatss Phrase
 

My father's been dead for thirty years
but when he appears behind my shoulder
offering advice, or condemnation, or a quiet pride
in something I've done that isn't even thistledown
or tiny shavings of balsa wood in the eyes of the world
--"Albie, grip in the middle and turn
with a steady pressure--it's measurable,
if not the way the wind is in a sock,
or ohms, or net-and-gross, it registers the way
an absence sometimes does, and I listen to him
with a care I never exhibited when he was a presence,
alive, in his undershirt, chewing his tiny licorice pellets
and radiating a rough-hewn love. "Negative
capability--the phrase of course is Keats's,

from his letters, but we make it ours a hundred times
a day. A hundred times we do our own pedestrian
version of early maritime cartography: the known world
stops, and over its edge the fuddled mapmaker writes
Here There Be Monsters and then illustrates 
their non-existing coiled lengths and hell-breath
with a color-splotched vivacity he wouldn't waste
on inhabited shores. Or: "Don't think
of a polar bear!...the game one plays
with a child. But I say with adult certainty that
when Eddie's wife Fiona went back to stripping
he couldn't stand to be at the club and see, and yet
those empty hours in his mind were populated just
as unbearably--and indeed, yes, there

were monsters in that void, and the vigilant bears
of insecurity and jealousy padded hungrily behind
his eyes each night until her return. For Keats,
however, the force that emptiness makes kinetic is
a positive one, the way that the invisible, unknowable
"dark energy is seminal, a kind of funding agency
or sugar daddy powering the universe in all
its spangled beauty and veiled mystery
from behind the scenes. Last night, a woozy few of us
were mourning the demise of The Dusty Bookshelf.
"Well I tried to support it, I said, "by stopping in from time
to time. And B, the king of local kleptobibliomania, with
his nimble touch and expando-capacious overalls, said
"I tried to support it by not going in.





What the Dove Sings
 

The mourning dove
wearing noon's aureole
coos from the rhododendron,
oo-waoh, shadow o- 
ver what to do. Oh.
And the sad rhetoric spreads
through suburb and wood.
Those who hear 
dove moan love no 
querulous warbling more--
the going hence 
about which is there no- 
thing to do? 
From no small rip in fate
the you you never shall be
more will be extracted.
Dove knows the rubric
and starts in, who, 
who is next and soon?





Flowers
 

for my mother
They are fleeting.
They are fragile.
They require

little water.
They'll surprise you.
They'll remind you

that they aren't
and they are you.





Youre arrowing out toward what.
 

The sunlight almost unfaceable, and weightless,
and the gravities, wind-flickers, shadows, the ripped
black places crows make on the phone poles--

how to keep your own counsel,
even against the little stabs, the winds and chromes--

                                              

Various flashes, the office door, a supper glass, a last
smear of streetlight on the bedsheets.

Nothing. On into the soaring, black release.

                                               

The messages say syllabus and vetting that
and will be absent. Nothing.
On into the what? the air you're gliding on
or falling from,
                              the wind of it making
ahs and salves in the hollow of your chest,
Celina of a bodily sibilance like willows, 
of the shimmering, midsummer glance.

You would allow yourself a message.
How to make it low-key. How to keep it to a few lines.

                                               

On into the wind of whatever is happening.
What leashes you seems to have come undone.

You lean down into the white heap of black words.
You pad out toward the water fountain
into someone's eyeshadowed look, the lush backwash of her skirt.

You weigh maybe three or four
ounces, swirling down the stairwell

in whichever wind this is, your ribs
aching with what they
sing so shamelessly.





Sick to death of the hardpan shoulder,
 

the froth of noise
the undersides of the cedars make,

the windblown dark that hints
and fails for hours at effacement--
maybe I could claim it isn't

praying, but it's asking,
at the least, begging
that these lungfuls of this blackness

eat whatever keeps on swelling
and collapsing in my chest, and be done
with it, no more noise

left hanging in the spaces
between brake lights than a smothered rush
that sounds like suffering

and is nothing. Instead a sobbing isn't
so much easing from my throat
as shining like black light from my torso,

veining the leaves of weeds, stoning
the whole roadside in a halo--I can feel
the heat of truck lights on my back,

I'm inside that brilliant gravity,
I think of time, I'm in the driver's
nightmare and it shudders by--





In Whose Unctions
 

After Stevens
By now the snow is easing
the live nerves of the wire fence
and the firs,
                              softening the distances it falls through,
laying down a rightness, 
as in the spackled whites,
the woodgrains of a room's hush
                                                                  before music,
before a lush legato in whose unctions
the excruciations ease,
                                            as in the first
thick arrhythmics from the hardwoods
                                                                        of the late quartets,
whose dense snow of emotion,
                                                         downdrifting,
formal,
                 whose violins and cellos,
desiring the exhilarations of changes,
                                                                          turn loose an infusion
of wintry music, all sideslip and immense descent,
repetitions, evolutions
salving down into the still air,
                                                         the wound,
the listening.





"You could lighten
 

up a little, he says,
shutting the rusted tailgate,
"maybe at least lean
down from your high horse 
and look busy, picking up
his work gloves and his spade.

"You're not the only
hick on the clock
with an education, he says, half-
laughing, half-wheezing,
and spits, his bottom lip bulging
with a load of Skoal,"even 
if you do think pretty highly
of your poetry.





From "Coleshill
 

The deer racing across a field
of the same clay and tallow
color they are--if they are:
or are they tricks of the light?--
must feel themselves being poured
and pouring through life. We're not built

but become: trembling columns
of apprehension that ripple
and pass those ripples to and fro
with the world that shakes around us--
it too is something poured
and ceaselessly pouring itself. 

February shakes the fields
and trembles in each yellow willow.

                                

The violin's back is not veneer--
the strummed wood shudders together.
Undivided by caution
each note is its own first thought.

My first thought's a kind of prayer
that I might resonate entire--
sometimes it's such a meager portion
shaking a little, as if it ought...

Every day, the same desire
to push myself through the door
that leads to some bright place,

brighter than the concert platform,
where the whole self echoes together--
the outer to the inner pleasure.
                                
                                

Everything runs together--
the light smells of spring,
the unreasonable brightness
of this peg, this sheet, this line tethering

linen between sky and mud 
as if the garden marked a pause
in that eternal return
whose looping trace is the blood

hissing through the ventricles.
What gives you life's the thing that kills.
Until you spill the lip
trembling on its bright liquid

all you need's this play of surface--
all that you need. All you have.





Room
 

After it came in like a dark bird
Out of the snow, barely whistling
The notes father, mother, child,
It was hard to say what made us happiest.
 
Seeing the branches where it had learned
To stir the air? The air that opened
Without fear? Just the branches
And us in a room of wild things?
 
Like a shapeless flame, it flew
A dozen times around the room.
And, in a wink, a dozen more.
Into the wall, the window, the door.
 
You said the world turns to parts.
You said the parts are cunning spheres.
You said you always love the face of sin.
You said it's here, the lips and eyes and skin.
 
Outside the snow deepened
With heaves of discontent.
Inside, the tremor of our life
Flew in and in and in.





Poems
 

ithou hast made me known to friends whom I knew not. Thou hast given me seats in homes not my own. Thou hast brought the distant near and made a brother of the stranger. I am uneasy at heart when I have to leave my accustomed shelter; I forgot that there abides the old in the new, and that there also thou abidest.  Through birth and death, in this world or in others, wherever thou leadest me it is thou, the same, the one companion of my endless life who ever linkest my heart with bonds of joy to the unfamiliar. When one knows thee, then alien there is none, then no door is shut. Oh, grant me my prayer that I may never lose the bliss of the touch of the One in the play of the many. iiNo more noisy, loud words from me, such is my master's will. Hence-forth I deal in whispers. The speech of my heart will be carried on in murmurings of a song.  Men hasten to the King's market. All the buyers and sellers are there. But I have my untimely leave in the middle of the day, in the thick of work.Let then the flowers come out in my garden, though it is not their time, and let the midday bees strike up their lazy hum.Full many an hour have I spent in the strife of the good and the evil, but now it is the pleasure of my playmate of the empty days to draw my heart on to him, and I know not why is this sudden call to what useless inconsequence! iiiOn the day when the lotus bloomed, alas, my mind was straying, and I knew it not. My basket was empty and the flower remained unheeded. Only now and again a sadness fell upon me, and I started up from my dream and felt a sweet trace of a strange smell in the south wind.That vague fragrance made my heart ache with longing, and it seemed to me that it was the eager breath of the summer seeking for its completion.I knew not then that it was so near, that it was mine, and this perfect sweetness had blossomed in the depth of my own heart. iv By all means they try to hold me secure who love me in this world. But it is otherwise with thy love, which is greater than theirs, and thou keepest me free. Lest I forget them they never venture to leave me alone. But day passes by after day and thou are not seen. If I call not thee in my prayers, if I keep not thee in my heart--thy love for me still waits for my love. v I was not aware of the moment when I first crossed the threshold of this life. What was the power that made me open out into this vast mystery like a bud in the forest at midnight? When in the morning I looked upon the light I felt in a moment that I was no stranger in this world, that the inscrutable without name and form had taken me in its arms in the form of my own mother. Even so, in death the same unknown will appear as ever known to me. And because I love this life, I know I shall love death as well. The child cries out when from the right breast the mother takes it away to find in the very next moment its consolation in the left one. viThou art the sky and thou art the nest as well. Oh, thou beautiful, there in the nest it is thy love that encloses the soul with colors and sounds and odors. There comes the morning with the golden basket in her right hand bearing the wreath of beauty, silently to crown the earth. And there comes the evening over the lonely meadows deserted by herds, through trackless paths, carrying cool draughts of peace in her golden pitcher from the western ocean of rest.  But there, where spreads the infinite sky for the soul to take her flight in, reigns the stainless white radiance. There is no day nor night, nor form nor color, and never never a word.

Small Prayer
 

Change, move, dead clock, that this fresh day
May break with dazzling light to these sick eyes.
Burn, glare, old sun, so long unseen,
That time may find its sound again, and cleanse
Whatever it is that a wound remembers
After the healing ends.


Originally appeared in the October 1947 issue of Poetry magazine.






A Prayer for Rain
 

Let it come down: these thicknesses of air
have long enough walled love away from love;
stillness has hardened until words despair
of their high leaps and kisses shut themselves
back into wishing. Crippled lovers lie
against a weather which holds out on them,
waiting, awaiting some shrill sign, some cry,
some screaming cat that smells a sacrifice
and spells them thunder. Start the mumbling lips,
syllable by monotonous syllable,
that wash away the sullen griefs of love
and drown out knowledge of an ancient war--
o, ill-willed dark, give with the sound of rain,
let love be brought to ignorance again.

A Lullaby
 


Lullee, lullay,
I could not love thee more
If thou wast Christ the King.
Now tell me, how did Mary know
That in her womb should sleep and grow
The Lord of everything?

Lullee, lullay,
An angel stood with her
Who said: "That which doth stir
Like summer in thy side
Shall save the world from sin.
Then stable, hall, and inn
Shall cherish Christmas-tide.

Lullee, lullay,
And so it was that Day.
And did she love Him more
Because an angel came
To prophesy His name?
Ah no, not so,
She could not love Him more,
But loved Him just the same.
Lullee, lullay.

Mothers Blessing
 

This timeless blood was here before begat.
     Infinity runs in your veins--
        Not mine, nor yours,
             Nor Eve's, not Adam's--
                  Gat of God,
                       And spinning like taffy Godwards back again.
Sapped through the centuries to us--
     Grafting a limb there for the Jesse tree--
        Remultiplied infinitely,
             From heart to heart tick-pulsed,
                  Ill clad, ill fed, ill fit--
                       Here, child, do what you can with it.

Not All There
 

I turned to speak to God,
About the world's despair; 
But to make bad matters worse, 
I found God wasn't there.

God turned to speak to me
(Don't anybody laugh)
God found I wasn't there--
At least not over half.


Originally appeared in the April 1936 issue of Poetry magazine.






God
 

I am God--
Without one friend,
Alone in my purity
World without end.

Below me young lovers
Tread the sweet ground--
But I am God--
I cannot come down.

Spring!
Life is love!
Love is life only!
Better to be human
Than God--and lonely.


Originally appeared in the October 1931 issue of Poetry magazine.






A Prayer
 

Bless
something small
but infinite
and quiet.

There are senses
make an object
in their simple
feeling for one.

Hypostasis & New Year
 

For why am I afraid to sing
the fundamental shape of awe
should I now begin to sing the silvered back of
       the winter willow spear
the sparkling agate blue
would this blade and this sky free me to speak
      intransitive lack 
 
the vowels themselves free
 
Of what am I afraid
of what lies in back of me of day
these stars scattered as far as the I
what world and wherefore
will it shake free
why now in the mind of an afternoon is a daisy
      for a while
flagrant and alive
 
Then what of night
of hours' unpredicated bad luck and the rot
       it clings to
fathomless on the far side in winter dark
 
Hey shadow world when a thing comes back
comes back unseen but felt and no longer itself
       what then
what silver world mirrors tarnished lenses
what fortune what fate
and the forms not themselves but only itself the sky
by water and wind shaken
I am born in silvered dark
 
Of what am I to see these things between myself
       and nothing
between the curtain and the stain
between the hypostatic scenes of breathing
and becoming the thing I see
are they not the same
 
Things don't look good on the street today
beside a tower in a rusting lot
one is a condition the other mystery
even this afternoon light so kind and nourishing
a towering absence vibrating air
 
Shake and I see pots from old shake
       and I see cities anew
I see robes shake I see desert
I see the farthing in us all the ghost of day
the day inside night as tones decay
       and border air
it is the old songs and the present wind I sing
and say I love the unknown sound in a word
 
Mother where from did you leave me on the sleeve
       of a dying word
of impish laughter in the midst my joy
I compel and confess open form
my cracked hinged picture doubled
 
I can't remember now if I made a pact with the devil
       when I was young
when I was high
on a sidewalk I hear "buy a sweatshirt? and think
buy a shirt from the sweat of children
       hell
I'm just taking a walk in the sun in a poem
      and this sound
caught in the most recent coup





True Discourse on Power
 

When I say the ghost has begun
you understand what is being said.
That time is not how we keep it
       or measure
first there was then wasn't . . .
It twitters and swerves like
       the evening news.
Now outside is 3D. Inside non-
       representational space.
Every law has an outside
      and inside
I have witnessed cruelty
break and gulp and sweat then
       punch out a smile.
To be awake. This talking in space.
To be absorbed in the ongoing.
Belief's a shadow to be looked into
       and into
until relief is gone. The dark
triangle settled in the midst of
       traffic is on us.
Time comes in adverbial bursts,
a glass of beer, a smoke . . .
The evening air refreshes, startles,
and the questions grow deeper like
        shadows across storefronts.
A forsythia ticking against
       the dirty pane.
This was time. Up. Down. Up.
And you were a part of it.
If I say it can you feel it now?
Imagine. Lightning strikes. Rain
       falls and drives.
Clouds pass. Night clarified. Stars.
In silent pictures the tree falls
       in the optic nerve.
The sound is chemistry.
There's no getting to it or if
       getting to it
feels like the actual sound
       is that silence?
Alone here with my shadows
       drawn . . .
So what's this about?
A horse and a castle, a tree
       and its leaving?
What's this about in solitary
       splendor?
The undertow and its threshold,
a door and the opening sky?
Or because a play of reflection
       lit up my bumper
and caught my eyes
I saw the shadow of a falcon.
Because a sound a poor man
       uttered
reached my ear I fell into song.
If the syntax of loyalty is not tragic
       then what is the wager?
If there were time, would it be ours?





Song
 

from "Elegy for the First Century
Bells on our eyelashes
and the death throes of words,
and I among fields of speech,
a knight on a horse made of dirt.
My lungs are my poetry, my eyes a book,
and I, under the skin of words,
on the beaming banks of foam,
a poet who sang  and died
leaving this singed elegy
before the faces of poets,
for birds at the edge of sky.





The Wound
 

1.
The leaves asleep under the wind
are the wounds' ship,
and the ages collapsed on top of each other
are the wound's glory,
and the trees rising out of our eyelashes
are the wound's lake.
The wound is to be found on bridges
where the grave lengthens
and patience goes on to no end
between the shores of our love and death.
The wound is a sign,
and the wound is a crossing too.
 
 
2.
To the language choked by tolling bells
I offer the voice of the wound.
To the stone coming from afar
to the dried-up world crumbling to dust
to the time ferried on creaky sleighs
I light up the fire of the wound.
And when history burns inside my clothes
and when blue nails grow inside my books,
I cry out to the day,
"Who are you, who tosses you
into my virgin land?
And inside my book and on my virgin land
I stare into a pair of eyes made of dust.
I hear someone saying,
"I am the wound that is born
and grows as your history grows.
 
 
3.
I named you cloud,
wound of the parting dove.
I named you book and quill
and here I begin the dialogue
between me and the ancient tongue
in the island of tomes
in the archipelago of the ancient fall.
And here I teach these words
to the wind and the palms,
O wound of the parting dove.
 
 
4.
If I had a harbor in the land
of dreams and mirrors, if I had a ship,
if I had the remains
of a city, if I had a city
in the land of children and weeping,
I would have written all this down for the wound's sake,
a song like a spear
that penetrates trees, stone, and sky,
soft like water
unbridled, startling like conquest.
 
 
5.
Rain down on our desert
O world adorned with dream and longing.
Pour down, and shake us, we, the palms of the wound,
tear out branches from trees that love the silence of the wound,
that lie awake staring at its pointed eyelashes and soft hands.
 
World adorned with dream and longing
world that falls on my brow
like the lash of a wound,
don't come close--the wound is closer--
don't tempt me--the wound is more beautiful.
That magic that your eyes had flung
on the last kingdoms--
the wound has passed over it,
passed and did not leave a single sail
to tempt toward salvation, did not leave
a single island behind.





The Beginning of Speech
 

The child I was came to me
once,
a strange face
                He said nothing              We walked
each of us glancing at the other in silence, our steps
a strange river running in between
 
We were brought together by good manners
and these sheets now flying in the wind
then we split,
a forest written by earth
watered by the seasons' change.
 
Child who once was, come forth--
What brings us together now,
and what do we have to say?





Desert
 

The cities dissolve, and the earth is a cart loaded with dust
Only poetry knows how to pair itself to this space.
 
No road to this house, a siege,
and his house is graveyard.
               From a distance, above his house
               a perplexed moon dangles
               from threads of dust.
 
I said: this is the way home, he said: No
               you can't pass, and aimed his bullet at me.
Very well then, friends and their homes
                in all of Beirut's are my companions.
 
Road for blood now--
               Blood about which a boy talked
               whispered to his friends:
                              nothing remains in the sky now
                              except holes called "stars.
 
The city's voice was too tender, even the winds
would not tune its strings--
The city's face beamed
like a child arranging his dreams for nightfall
bidding the morning to sit beside him on his chair.
 
 
They found people in bags:
              a person                                                 without a head 
              a person                                                 without hands, or tongue
              a person                                                 choked to death
              and the rest had no shapes and no names.
                             --Are you mad? Please
                                                             don't write about these things.
A page in a book
              bombs mirror themselves inside of it
              prophecies and dust-proverbs mirror themselves inside of it 
              cloisters mirror themselves inside of it, a carpet made of the alphabet
                             disentangles thread by thread
falls on the face of the city, slipping out of the needles of memory.
A murderer in the city's air, swimming through its wound--
its wound is a fall
that trembled to its name--to the hemorrhage of its name
and all that surrounds us--
houses left their walls behind
                                               and I am no longer I.
 
Maybe there will come a time in which you'll accept     
to live deaf and mute, maybe
they'll allow you to mumble: death
                                                and life
                                                resurrection
                                                and peace unto you.
 
From the wine of the palms to the quiet of the desert . . . et cetera
from a morning that smuggles its own intestines
               and sleeps on the corpses of the rebels . . . et cetera
from streets, to trucks
               from soldiers, armies . . . et cetera
from the shadows of men and women . . . et cetera
from bombs hidden in the prayers of monotheists and infidels . . . et cetera
from iron that oozes iron and bleeds flesh . . . et cetera
from fields that long for wheat, and grass and working hands . . . et cetera
from forts that wall our bodies
               and heap darkness upon us . . . et cetera
from legends of the dead who pronounce life, who steer our life . . . et cetera
from talk that is slaughter           and slaughter         and slitters of throats . . . et cetera
from darkness to darkness to darkness
I breathe, touch my body, search for myself
               and for you, and for him, and for the others
 
and I hang my death
between my face and this hemorrhage of talk . . . et cetera
 
 
You will see--
                say his name
                say you drew his face
                reach out your hand toward him
                or smile
                or say I was happy once
                or say I was sad once
                you will see:
                                 there is no country there.
 
 
Murder has changed the city's shape--this stone
                                                                 is a child's head--
and this smoke is exhaled from human lungs.
Each thing recites its exile . . .                a sea
                                              of blood--and what
do you expect on these mornings except their arteries set to sail
into the darkness, into the tidal wave of slaughter?
 
 
Stay up with her, don't let up--
she sits death in her embrace
and turns over her days
                                              tattered sheets of paper.
Guard the last pictures
of her topography--
she is tossing and turning in the sand
in an ocean of sparks--
on her bodies
are the spots of human moans.
 
Seed after seed are cast into our earth--
fields feeding on our legends,
guard the secret of these bloods.
                               I am talking about a flavor to the seasons
                               and a flash of lightning in the sky.

Celebrating Childhood
 

Even the wind wants
to become a cart
pulled by butterflies.
 
I remember madness
leaning for the first time
on the mind's pillow.
I was talking to my body then
and my body was an idea
I wrote in red.
 
Red is the sun's most beautiful throne
and all the other colors
worship on red rugs.
 
Night is another candle.
In every branch, an arm,
a message carried in space
echoed by the body of the wind.
 
The sun insists on dressing itself in fog
when it meets me:
Am I being scolded by the light?
 
Oh, my past days--
they used to walk in their sleep
and I used to lean on them.
 
Love and dreams are two parentheses.
Between them I place my body
and discover the world.
 
Many times
I saw the air fly with two grass feet
and the road dance with feet made of air.
 
My wishes are flowers
staining my days.
 
I was wounded early,
and early I learned
that wounds made me.
 
I still follow the child
who still walks inside me.
 
Now he stands at a staircase made of light
searching for a corner to rest in
and to read the face of night again.
 
If the moon were a house,
my feet would refuse to touch its doorstep.
 
They are taken by dust
carrying me to the air of seasons.
 
I walk,
one hand in the air,
the other caressing tresses
that I imagine.
 
A star is also
a pebble in the field of space.
 
He alone
who is joined to the horizon
can build new roads.
 
A moon, an old man,
his seat is night
and light is his walking stick.
 
What shall I say to the body I abandoned
in the rubble of the house
in which I was born?
No one can narrate my childhood
except those stars that flicker above it
and that leave footprints
on the evening's path.
 
My childhood is still
being born in the palms of a light
whose name I do not know
and who names me.
 
Out of that river he made a mirror
and asked it about his sorrow.
He made rain out of his grief
and imitated the clouds.
 
Your childhood is a village.
You will never cross its boundaries
no matter how far you go.
 
His days are lakes,
his memories floating bodies.
 
You who are descending
from the mountains of the past,
how can you climb them again,
and why?
 
Time is a door
I cannot open.
My magic is worn,
my chants asleep.
 
I was born in a village,
small and secretive like a womb.
I never left it.
I love the ocean not the shores.





Elizabethan
 

Some gentler passion slide into my mind, For I am soft and made of melting snow --Queen Elizabeth I
 
Her sex sent her mother
to the tower,
made her father profligate
with arrogant desires,
 
but she was made of flint
and backbone.
 
Think of a young girl
in a blue velvet bodice,
a white collar and lace,
the very prototype
of virginal.
 
Think of a woman, her court
enlivened by suitors and lovers
in doublets, in brocaded cloaks,
despite suspicions of their motives
staining the sheets,
 
the way cups of spicy,
flowery mead were sipped
despite the possibility
of poison.
 
Even the crown of the sun
must go down each night.
 
Could she have stood at the prow
of a ship in that great Armada she ordered,
instead of at a window, waiting
for urgent results?
 
Could she have guessed that the words
of a man she inspired, carved
into the marble of ages,
had a muscular beauty
more than equal
to her own worldly triumphs?
 
Daughter, Queen, Ruler
of roiling seas, of meandering
rivers and meadows,
of armies of soldiers, their swords
and armor glittering
like planets to her sun.
 
Namesake to an age.
 
And Poet?
When she turned
to the empty parchment
(or once to a windowpane,
a diamond for quill)
everything
must have gone quiet.
 
Even a queen is naked
before the naked page, awaiting
not the generous spoils owed to a victor
but the gifts freely given
of a besotted muse.





Lines Composed on the Body Politic: An Accounting
 

Elizabeth, The Lodge at Woodstock, 1554
 
Less than the charting of each dawn's resolutions,
less than each evening's trickle of doubt,
less than a crown's weight in silver, a diamond's                  
scratch against glass, less than the touted
 
ill luck of my rich beginnings--and yet
more than Eve's silence, my mute ingratitude.
More than music's safe passage, its rapturous net,
more than this stockpile of words, their liquid solicitude; 
         
more desired than praise (the least-prized of my dreams),
less real than dreaming (castle keep for my sins),
more than no more, which seems
much less than hoped-for, again--
 
one mutiny, quelled; one wish lost, a forgotten treasure:
to live without scrutiny, beyond constant measure.





The Farmers Bride
 

    
     Three summers since I chose a maid,
     Too young maybe--but more's to do
     At harvest-time than bide and woo.
              When us was wed she turned afraid
     Of love and me and all things human;
     Like the shut of a winter's day
     Her smile went out, and 'twadn't a woman--
            More like a little frightened fay.
                    One night, in the Fall, she runned away.
 
     "Out 'mong the sheep, her be, they said,
     'Should properly have been abed;
     But sure enough she wadn't there
     Lying awake with her wide brown stare.
So over seven-acre field and up-along across the down
     We chased her, flying like a hare
     Before out lanterns. To Church-Town
              All in a shiver and a scare
     We caught her, fetched her home at last
              And turned the key upon her, fast.
 
     She does the work about the house
     As well as most, but like a mouse:
              Happy enough to chat and play
              With birds and rabbits and such as they,
              So long as men-folk keep away.
     "Not near, not near! her eyes beseech
     When one of us comes within reach.
              The women say that beasts in stall
              Look round like children at her call.
              I've hardly heard her speak at all.
 
     Shy as a leveret, swift as he,
     Straight and slight as a young larch tree,
     Sweet as the first wild violets, she,
     To her wild self. But what to me?
 
     The short days shorten and the oaks are brown,
              The blue smoke rises to the low grey sky,
     One leaf in the still air falls slowly down,
              A magpie's spotted feathers lie
     On the black earth spread white with rime,
     The berries redden up to Christmas-time.
              What's Christmas-time without there be
              Some other in the house than we!
 
              She sleeps up in the attic there
              Alone, poor maid. 'Tis but a stair
     Betwixt us. Oh! my God! the down,
     The soft young down of her, the brown,
The brown of her--her eyes, her hair, her hair!





Saturday Market
 

Bury your heart in some deep green hollow
     Or hide it up in a kind old tree;
Better still, give it the swallow
     When she goes over the sea.
 
In Saturday's Market there's eggs a 'plenty
     And dead-alive ducks with their legs tied down,
Grey old gaffers and boys of twenty--
     Girls and the women of the town--
Pitchers and sugar-sticks, ribbons and laces,
     Poises and whips and dicky-birds' seed,
Silver pieces and smiling faces,
     In Saturday Market they've all they need.
 
What were you showing in Saturday Market
     That set it grinning from end to end
Girls and gaffers and boys of twenty--?
     Cover it close with your shawl, my friend--
Hasten you home with the laugh behind you,
     Over the down--, out of sight,
Fasten your door, though no one will find you,
     No one will look on a Market night.
 
See, you, the shawl is wet, take out from under
     The red dead thing--. In the white of the moon
On the flags does it stir again? Well, and no wonder!
     Best make an end of it; bury it soon.
If there is blood on the hearth who'll know it?
     Or blood on the stairs,
When a murder is over and done why show it?
     In Saturday Market nobody cares.
      
Then lie you straight on your bed for a short, short weeping
     And still, for a long, long rest,
There's never a one in the town so sure of sleeping
     As you, in the house on the down with a hole in your breast.
 
              Think no more of the swallow,
                     Forget, you, the sea,
     Never again remember the deep green hollow
                     Or the top of the kind old tree!





Rooms
 

I remember rooms that have had their part
     In the steady slowing down of the heart.
The room in Paris, the room at Geneva,
The little damp room with the seaweed smell,
And that ceaseless maddening sound of the tide--
     Rooms where for good or for ill--things died.
But there is the room where we (two) lie dead,
Though every morning we seem to wake and might just as well seem to sleep again
     As we shall somewhere in the other quieter, dustier bed
     Out there in the sun--in the rain.





From a Window
 

                  Up here, with June, the sycamore throws
                      Across the window a whispering screen;
        I shall miss the sycamore more, I suppose,
Than anything else on this earth that is out in green.
             But I mean to go through the door without fear,
             Not caring much what happens here
                           When I'm away:--
How green the screen is across the panes
              Or who goes laughing along the lanes
        With my old lover all summer day. 





Not for That City
 

Not for that city of the level sun,
     Its golden streets and glittering gates ablaze--
     The shadeless, sleepless city of white days,
White nights, or nights and days that are as one--
We weary, when all is said , all thought, all done.
     We strain our eyes beyond this dusk to see
     What, from the threshold of eternity
We shall step into. No, I think we shun
The splendour of that everlasting glare,
   The clamour of that never-ending song.
   And if for anything we greatly long,
It is for some remote and quiet stair
     Which winds to silence and a space for sleep
     Too sound for waking and for dreams too deep.





Fin de Fte
 

Sweetheart, for such a day
     One mustn't grudge the score;
Here, then, it's all to pay,
     It's Good-night at the door.
 
Good-night and good dreams to you,--
     Do you remember the picture-book thieves
Who left two children sleeping in a wood the long night through,
     And how the birds came down and covered them with leaves?
 
So you and I should have slept,--But now,
     Oh, what a lonely head!
With just the shadow of a waving bough
     In the moonlight over your bed.





Madeleine in Church
 

Here, in the darkness, where this plaster saint
       Stands nearer than God stands to our distress,
And one small candle shines, but not so faint
     As the far lights of everlastingness,
I'd rather kneel than over there, in open day
     Where Christ is hanging, rather pray
         To something more like my own clay,
                     Not too divine;
         For, once, perhaps my little saint
         Before he got his niche and crown,
     Had one short stroll about the town;
     It brings him closer, just that taint--
            And anyone can wash the paint
     Off our poor faces, his and mine!
 
Is that why I see Monty now? equal to any saint, poor boy, as good as gold,
But still, with just the proper trace
Of earthliness on his shining wedding face;
And then gone suddenly blank and old
The hateful day of the divorce:
Stuart got his, hands down, of course
Crowing like twenty cocks and grinning like a horse:
But Monty took it hard. All said and done I liked him best,--
He was the first, he stands out clearer than the rest.
                             It seems too funny all we other rips
       Should have immortal souls; Monty and Redge quite damnably
       Keep theirs afloat while we go down like scuttled ships.--
                            It's funny too, how easily we sink,
                            One might put up a monument, I think
               To half the world and cut across it "Lost at Sea!
I should drown Jim, poor little sparrow, if I netted him to-night--
                         No, it's no use this penny light--
                Or my poor saint with his tin-pot crown--
                The trees of Calvary are where they were,
                       When we are sure that we can spare
                   The tallest, let us go and strike it down
                And leave the other two still standing there.
                                         I, too, would ask Him to remember me
         If there were any Paradise beyond this earth that I could see.                          
                             Oh! quiet Christ who never knew
                     The poisonous fangs that bite us through
                              And make us do the things we do,
                     See how we suffer and fight and die,
                              How helpless and how low we lie,
                     God holds You, and You hang so high,
                     Though no one looking long at You,
                              Can think You do not suffer too,
But, up there, from your still, star-lighted tree
        What can You know, what can You really see
                Of this dark ditch, the soul of me!
 
                We are what we are: when I was half a child I could not sit
Watching black shadows on green lawns and red carnations burning in the sun,
                                                   Without paying so heavily for it
                That joy and pain, like any mother and her unborn child were almost one.
                                                         I could hardly bear
                                 The dreams upon the eyes of white geraniums in the dusk,
                                                 The thick, close voice of musk,
                                        The jessamine music on the thin night air,
                                  Or, sometimes, my own hands about me anywhere --
   The sight of my own face (for it was lovely then) even the scent of my own hair,
            Oh! there was nothing, nothing that did not sweep to the high seat
                     Of laughing gods, and then blow down and beat
   My soul into the highway dust, as hoofs do the dropped roses of the street.
                                            I think my body was my soul,
                                           And when we are made thus
                                                   Who shall control
                           Our hands, our eyes, the wandering passion of our feet,
                                           Who shall teach us
   To thrust the world out of our heart: to say, till perhaps in death,
                                                  When the race is run,
           And it is forced from us with our last breath
                                                  "Thy will be done?
If it is Your will that we should be content with the tame, bloodless things.
                As pale as angels smirking by, with folded wings--
                        Oh! I know Virtue, and the peace it brings!
                                                   The temperate, well-worn smile
                The one man gives you, when you are evermore his own:
                    And afterwards the child's, for a little while,
                                                 With its unknowing and all-seeing eyes
          So soon to change, and make you feel how quick
       The clock goes round. If one had learned the trick--
                                                            (How does one though?) quite early on,
                          Of long green pastures under placid skies,
                          One might be walking now with patient truth.
          What did we ever care for it, who have asked for youth,
                          When, oh! my God! this is going or has gone?
 
                              There is a portrait of my mother, at nineteen,
                     With the black spaniel, standing by the garden seat,
                     The dainty head held high against the painted green
And throwing out the youngest smile, shy, but half haughty and half sweet.
                     Her picture then: but simply Youth, or simply Spring
                                  To me to-day: a radiance on the wall,
                                  So exquisite, so heart-breaking a thing
                     Beside the mask that I remember, shrunk and small,
                                     Sapless and lined like a dead leaf,
All that was left of oh! the loveliest face, by time and grief!
 
    And in the glass, last night, I saw a ghost behind my chair--
    Yet why remember it, when one can still go moderately gay--?
                Or could--with any one of the old crew,
                        But oh! these boys! the solemn way
                They take you and the things they say--
                This "I have only as long as you
    When you remind them you are not precisely twenty-two--
                Although at heart perhaps--God! if it were
                                Only the face, only the hair!
                        If Jim had written to me as he did to-day
                        A year ago--and now it leaves me cold--
                                 I know what this means, old, old, old:
                        Et avec a--mais on a vcu, tout se paie. 
 
That is not always true: there was my Mother (well at least the dead are free!) 
                Yoked to the man that Father was; yoked to the woman I am, Monty too;
                The little portress at the Convent School, stewing in hell so patiently;
The poor, fair boy who shot himself at Aix. And what of me--and what of me ?
                But I, I paid for what I had, and they for nothing. No, one cannot see
                           How it shall be made up to them in some serene eternity.
If there were fifty heavens God could not give us back the child who went or never came;
                 Here, on our little patch of this great earth, the sun of any darkened day.
              Not one of all the starry buds hung on the hawthorn trees of last year's May,
                              No shadow from the sloping fields of yesterday;
                 For every hour they slant across the hedge a different way,
                                 The shadows are never the same.
 
                     "Find rest in Him One knows the parsons' tags--
                 Back to the fold, across the evening fields, like any flock of baa-ing sheep:
Yes, it may be, when He has shorn, led us to slaughter, torn the bleating soul in us to rags,
                                 For so He giveth His belovd sleep.
                             Oh! He will take us stripped and done,
                             Driven into His heart. So we are won:
                  Then safe, safe are we? in the shelter of His everlasting wings--
                  I do not envy Him his victories, His arms are full of broken things.
 
                         But I shall not be in them. Let Him take
                                 The finer ones, the easier to break.
And they are not gone, yet, for me, the lights, the colours, the perfumes,
                         Though now they speak rather in sumptuous rooms.
                                          In silks and in gemlike wines;
                  Here, even, in this corner where my little candle shines
                                          And overhead the lancet-window glows
                         With golds and crimsons you could almost drink 
To know how jewels taste, just as I used to think
There was the scent in every red and yellow rose
                                Of all the sunsets. But this place is grey,
                                       And much too quiet. No one here,
                                       Why, this is awful, this is fear!
                                                  Nothing to see, no face.
                         Nothing to hear except your heart beating in space
                                        As if the world was ended. Dead at last!
                                        Dead soul, dead body, tied together fast.
                         These to go on with and alone, to the slow end:
                 No one to sit with, really, or to speak to, friend to friend:
                         Out of the long procession, black or white or red
Not one left now to say "Still I am here, then see you, dear, lay here your head.
                         Only the doll's house looking on the Park
                 To-night, all nights, I know, when the man puts the lights out, very dark.
With, upstairs, in the blue and gold box of a room, just the maids' footsteps overhead,
Then utter silence and the empty world--the room--the bed--
                                         The corpse! No, not quite dead, while this cries out in me.
                                                          But nearly: very soon to be
                                                          A handful of forgotten dust--
                                        There must be someone. Christ! there must,
                                             Tell me there will be someone. Who?
                                        If there were no one else, could it be You?
 
                                        How old was Mary out of whom you cast
                 So many devils? Was she young or perhaps for years
She had sat staring, with dry eyes, at this and that man going past
                 Till suddenly she saw You on the steps of Simon's house
                                        And stood and looked at You through tears.
                                                     I think she must have known by those
                                        The thing, for what it was that had come to her.
                                        For some of us there is a passion, I suppose,
                                        So far from earthly cares and earthly fears
                                        That in its stillness you can hardly stir
                                                     Or in its nearness, lift your hand,
                                        So great that you have simply got to stand
                                        Looking at it through tears, through tears.
                                        Then straight from these there broke the kiss,
                                                    I think You must have known by this
                                        The thing, for what it was, that had come to You:
                                                    She did not love You like the rest,
                                         It was in her own way, but at the worst, the best,
                                                    She gave You something altogether new.
                                         And through it all, from her, no word,
                                                    She scarcely saw You, scarcely heard:
                                         Surely You knew when she so touched You with her hair,
                                                    Or by the wet cheek lying there,
And while her perfume clung to You from head to feet all through the day
                                         That You can change the things for which we care,
                                         But even You, unless You kill us, not the way.
 
                                         This, then was peace for her, but passion too.        
                                         I wonder was it like a kiss that once I knew,
                                              The only one that I would care to take
       Into the grave with me, to which if there were afterwards, to wake.
                                              Almost as happy as the carven dead
                                         In some dim chancel lying head by head
       We slept with it, but face to face, the whole night through--
One breath, one throbbing quietness, as if the thing behind our lips was endless life,
       Lost, as I woke, to hear in the strange earthly dawn, his "Are you there?
                                   And lie still, listening to the wind outside, among the firs.
 
       So Mary chose the dream of Him for what was left to her of night and day,
It is the only truth: it is the dream in us that neither life nor death nor any other
                               thing can take away:
       But if she had not touched Him in the doorway of the dream could she have
                               cared so much ?
       She was a sinner, we are what we are: the spirit afterwards, but first the touch.
 
And He has never shared with me my haunted house beneath the trees
Of Eden and Calvary, with its ghosts that have not any eyes for tears,
And the happier guests who would not see, or if they did, remember these,
                                                      Though they lived there a thousand years.
                                       Outside, too gravely looking at me. He seems to stand,
                                                    And looking at Him, if my forgotten spirit came
                                                            Unwillingly back, what could it claim
                                                            Of those calm eyes, that quiet speech,
                                                    Breaking like a slow tide upon the beach,
                                                            The scarred, not quite human hand ?--
                                       Unwillingly back to the burden of old imaginings
                                       When it has learned so long not to think, not to be,
              Again, again it would speak as it has spoken to me of things
                                                             That I shall not see!
 
              I cannot bear to look at this divinely bent and gracious head:
                     When I was small I never quite believed that He was dead:
                         And at the Convent school I used to lie awake in bed
              Thinking about His hands. It did not matter what they said,
     He was alive to me, so hurt, so hurt! And most of all in Holy Week
                                      When there was no one else to see
                              I used to think it would not hurt me too, so terribly,
                                               If He had ever seemed to notice me
                                               Or, if, for once, He would only speak.





Ken
 

The town is old and very steep
    A place of bells and cloisters and grey towers,
And black-clad people walking in their sleep--
     A nun, a priest, a woman taking flowers
     To her new grave; and watched from end to end
     By the great Church above, through the still hours:
         But in the morning and the early dark
The children wake to dart from doors and call
Down the wide, crooked street, where, at the bend,
         Before it climbs up to the park,
Ken's is in the gabled house facing the Castle wall.
 
When first I came upon him there
Suddenly, on the half-lit stair,
I think I hardly found a trace
Of likeness to a human face
     In his. And I said then
If in His image God made men,
Some other must have made poor Ken--
But for his eyes which looked at you
As two red, wounded stars might do.
 
He scarcely spoke, you scarcely heard,
His voice broke off in little jars
To tears sometimes. An uncouth bird
     He seemed as he ploughed up the street,
Groping, with knarred, high-lifted feet
     And arms thrust out as if to beat
          Always against a threat of bars.
 
     And oftener than not there'd be
     A child just higher than his knee
Trotting beside him. Through his dim
     Long twilight this, at least, shone clear,
     That all the children and the deer,
        Whom every day he went to see
Out in the park, belonged to him.
 
         "God help the folk that next him sits
         He fidgets so, with his poor wits,
The neighbours said on Sunday nights
When he would go to Church to "see the lights!
     Although for these he used to fix                                                          
     His eyes upon a crucifix
     In a dark corner, staring on
    Till everybody else had gone.
    And sometimes, in his evil fits,
You could not move him from his chair--
You did not look at him as he sat there,
     Biting his rosary to bits.
While pointing to the Christ he tried to say,
    "Take it away.
 
     Nothing was dead:
He said "a bird if he picked up a broken wing,
     A perished leaf or any such thing
     Was just "a rose; and once when I had said
  He must not stand and knock there any more,
  He left a twig on the mat outside my door.
 
     Not long ago
The last thrush stiffened in the snow,
    While black against a sullen sky
       The sighing pines stood by.
But now the wind has left our rattled pane
To flutter the hedge-sparrow's wing,
The birches in the wood are red again
       And only yesterday
The larks went up a little way to sing
       What lovers say
   Who loiter in the lanes to-day;
   The buds begin to talk of May
   With learned rooks on city trees,
        And if God please
       With all of these
We, too, shall see another Spring.
 
But in that red brick barn upon the hill
    I wonder--can one own the deer,
And does one walk with children still
        As one did here?
        Do roses grow
Beneath those twenty windows in a row--
        And if some night
When you have not seen any light
They cannot move you from your chair
        What happens there?
         I do not know.
 
       So, when they took
Ken to that place, I did not look
After he called and turned on me
His eyes. These I shall see--





The Fte
 

To-night again the moon's white mat
       Stretches across the dormitory floor
While outside, like an evil cat
       The pion prowls down the dark corridor,
       Planning, I know, to pounce on me, in spite
For getting leave to sleep in town last night.
But it was none of us who made that noise,
       Only the old brown owl that hoots and flies
Out of the ivy--he will say it was us boys--
       Seigneur mon Dieu: the sacr soul of spies!
       He would like to catch each dream that lies
           Hidden behind our sleepy eyes:
Their dream? But mine--it is the moon and the wood that sees;
All my long life how I shall hate the trees!
 
In the Place d'Armes the dusty planes, all Summer through,
Dozed with the market women in the sun and scarcely stirred
       To see the quiet things that crossed the Square--,
A tiny funeral, the flying shadow of a bird,
       The hump-backed barber Clestin Lemaire,
       Old Madame Michel in her three-wheeled chair,
              And filing past to Vespers, two and two,
              The demoiselles of the pensionnat
Towed like a ship through the harbour bar,
       Safe into port, where le petit Jsus 
Perhaps makes nothing of the look they shot at you:
       Si, c'est dfendu, mais que voulez-vous? 
It was the sun. The sunshine weaves
A pattern on dull stones: the sunshine leaves
       The portraiture of dreams upon the eyes
              Before it dies:
       All Summer through
The dust hung white upon the drowsy planes
Till suddenly they woke with the Autumn rains.
 
       It is not only the little boys
      Who have hardly got away from toys,
But I, who am seventeen next year,
Some nights, in bed, have grown cold to hear
      That lonely passion of the rain
Which makes you think of being dead,
And of somewhere living to lay your head
       As if you were a child again,
Crying for one thing, known and near
Your empty heart, to still the hunger and the fear
    That pelts and beats with it against the pane.
 
              But I remember smiling too
At all the sun's soft tricks and those Autumn dreads
    In winter time, when the grey light broke slowly through
The frosted window-lace to drag us shivering from our beds.
     And when at dusk the singing wind swung down
Straight from the stars to the dark country roads
                     Beyond the twinkling town,
    Striking the leafless poplar boughs as he went by,
Like some poor, stray dog by the wayside lying dead,
We left behind us the old world of dread,
I and the wind as we strode whistling on under the Winter sky.
 
And then in Spring for three days came the Fair
    Just as the planes were starting into bud
Above the caravans: you saw the dancing bear
    Pass on his chain; and heard the jingle and the thud.
            Only four days ago
            They let you out of this dull show
To slither down the montagne russe and chaff the man  la tte de veau 
            Hit, slick, the bull's eye at the tir,
Spin round and round till your head went queer
On the porcs-roulants. Oh! l l! fte!
Va pour du vin, et le tte-a-tte 
With the girl who sugars the gaufres! Pauvrette,
    How thin she was! but she smiled, you bet,
 
    As she took your tip--"One does not forget
The good days, Monsieur. Said with a grace,
But sacrebleu: what a ghost of a face!
    And no fun too for the demoiselles
Of the pensionnat, who were hurried past,
    With their "Oh, que c'est beau--Ah, qu'elle est belle!
A lap-dog's life from first to last! ;
The good nights are not made for sleep, nor the good days for dreaming in,
    And at the end in the big Circus tent we sat and shook and stewed like sin!
 
    Some children there had got--but where?
Sent from the south, perhaps--a red bouquet
    Of roses, sweetening the fetid air
With scent from gardens by some far away blue bay.
    They threw one at the dancing bear;
The white clown caught it. From St. Rmy's tower
    The deep, slow bell tolled out the hour;
The black clown, with his dirty grin
    Lay, sprawling in the dust, as She rode in.
 
She stood on a white horse--and suddenly you saw the bend
    Of a far-off road at dawn, with knights riding by,
A field of spears--and then the gallant day
Go out in storm, with ragged clouds low down, sullen and grey
    Against red heavens: wild and awful, such a sky
    As witnesses against you at the end
Of a great battle; bugles blowing, blood and dust--
The old Morte d'Arthur, fight you must--.
    It died in anger. But it was not death
    That had you by the throat, stopping your breath.
She looked like Victory. She rode my way.
 
She laughed at the black clown and then she flew
             A bird above us, on the wing
Of her white arms; and you saw through
A rent in the old tent, a patch of sky
With one dim star. She flew, but not so high--
             And then she did not fly;
She stood in the bright moonlight at the door
Of a strange room, she threw her slippers on the floor--
                    Again, again
              You heard the patter of the rain,
              The starving rain--it was this Thing,
Summer was this, the gold mist in your eyes;--
                     Oh God! it dies,
                     But after death--,
    To-night the splendour and the sting
    Blows back and catches at your breath,
The smell of beasts, the smell of dust, the scent of all the roses in the world,
                 the sea, the Spring,
The beat of drums, the pad of hoofs, music, the dream, the dream, the
                 Enchanted Thing!
 
    At first you scarcely saw her face,
    You knew the maddening feet were there,
What called was that half-hidden, white unrest
To which now and then she pressed
    Her finger-tips; but as she slackened pace
And turned and looked at you it grew quite bare:
             There was not anything you did not dare:--
Like trumpeters the hours passed until the last day of the Fair.
 
    In the Place d'Armes all afternoon
    The building birds had sung "Soon, soon,
The shuttered streets slept sound that night,
                      It was full moon:
The path into the wood was almost white,
The trees were very still and seemed to stare:
    Not far before your soul the Dream flits on,
    But when you touch it, it is gone
And quite alone your soul stands there.
 
Mother of Christ, no one has seen your eyes: how can men pray
                    Even unto you?
There were only wolves' eyes in the wood--
                    My Mother is a woman too:
Nothing is true that is not good,
With that quick smile of hers, I have heard her say;--
I wish I had gone back home to-day;
    I should have watched the light that so gently dies
    From our high window, in the Paris skies,
                    The long, straight chain
    Of lamps hung out along the Seine:
I would have turned to her and let the rain
Beat on her breast as it does against the pane;--
    Nothing will be the same again;--
There is something strange in my little Mother's eyes,
There is something new in the old heavenly air of Spring--
The smell of beasts, the smell of dust--The Enchanted Thing!
 
All my life long I shall see moonlight on the fern
    And the black trunks of trees. Only the hair
Of any woman can belong to God.
The stalks are cruelly broken where we trod,
                     There had been violets there,
                     I shall not care
As I used to do when I see the bracken burn.





Getting and Spending
 

Isabella Whitney, The maner of her Wyll, 1573

                                   1
  
 We're told it was mostly the soul
               at stake, its formal
  
               setting-forth, as over water,
 where, against all odds,
  
 the words-on-paper make
               a sort of currency, which heaven,
  
               against all odds, accepts.
 So Will, which is to say, May what
  
 I purpose, please, this once, and what
               will happen coincide.
  
               To which the worldly
 dispositions were mere after-thought:
  
 your mother's ring and so forth. What
               the law considered yours
  
               to give. Which in the case of 
 women was restricted--this was
  
 long ago, and elsewhere--so 
               that one confessedly "weak
  
               of purse might all the more
 emphatically be thought of as having little
  
 to say. Except about the soul. The late
               disturbance in religion
  
               having done that much, the each
 for each responsible, even a servant,
  
 even the poor. Wild, then--quite        
               beyond the pale--to hustle
  
               the soul-part so hastily off
 the page. And turn, our Isabella Whitney,
  
 to the city and its faithlessness. Whose
               smells and sounds--the hawker's cry,
  
               the drainage ditch in Smithfield--all
 the thick-laid, lovely, in-your-face-and-nostrils stuff
  
 of getting-by no woman of even the slightest
               affectation would profess to know,
  
               much less to know so well.
 As one would know the special places on
  
 his body, were the passion merely personal.
  
  
                                    2
   
 Wattle and brickwork. Marble and mud.
               The city's vast tautology. No city
  
               without people and no people but
 will long for what the city says they lack:
  
 high ceilings, gloves and laces, news,
               the hearth-lit circle of friendship, space
               
               for solitude, enough to eat.
 And something like a foothold in the whole-of-it,
  
 some without-which-not, some
               little but needful part in all the passing-
  
               from-hand-to-hand of it, so
 every time the bondsman racks his debtor or
  
 the shoemaker hammers a nail or one un-
               practiced girl imagines she
  
               has prompted a look of wistfulness,
 a piece of it is yours because
  
 your seeing it has made it that much slower
               to rejoin the blank
  
               oblivion of never-having-
 been. The year was fifteen hundred seventy-
  
 three. The year of our Redeemer, as
               they used to say. That other
  
               circuit of always-in-your-
 debt. From which she wrested, in her open
  
 I-am-writing-not-for-fun-but-for-the-money
               way of authorship, a world
  
               not just of plenty but--and here's 
 the part of that's legacy--of love.





Not Over It
 

In sympathy with Gaspara Stampa
By woman so touched, so pressed,
 detachment being thought
 achievable at all
  
 is boggling in itself. Its being
 thought achievable by love--but love
 for only all (not someone's single) sentience--
  
 appears the precept of too cold
 a form of flame. How much
 of a hand in things
  
 relinquishes the hold
 of things-at-hand?
 What kiss might such
  
 a mind reclaim? A swirl of dust
 in Buddhist schools, perhaps.
 A view of several solar
  
 systems from above.
 Not love.
 The thought
  
 appeals as it appals:
 Slow learners, we must spurn
 the selving sensualities, to feel
  
 for feelers of this kind,
 unfasten passion's burner
 to identify what's under it--
  
 in short, must court
 dispassion just
 to be compassionate.





To Mary Sidney, On Reading Her Psalms
 

You give me a little courage, Mary,
 in your skittish dedication to her highness;
 I too can dare as humbleness may dare;
 if there's anywhere to speak with you, it's here
 at the wordy Anglo-Saxon periphery
 of the universe's one great surge of praise
  
 though I'm lost here. Where's the joyful noise?
 the syllables I managed to memorize
 before they were weighted down by meaning?
 and what's all this complicated rhyme?
 Don't mistake me--I'm not complaining;
 it's just not my notion of a psalm
  
 for all my love of wrought, elaborate things--
 especially when they're the sort that sings
 and yours do sing a stunning song--
 but they're off-kilter without the awe
 inherent in my ancient holy tongue.
 I miss my amen sela, hallelujah
  
 though I do applaud you and your brother--
 going for the full linguistic bait-and-switch
 in the move from one language to another:
 David's disarmingly direct speech
 a tour-de-force of formal contrivance
 (no form repeated more than once
  
 in each of a hundred fifty psalms!)
 in your show-off/virtuoso hands.
 Talk about such a song in such a land--
 but what else is there in dreary England?
 Its sole extravagance a trove of synonyms
 that endlessly perplexes and expands
  
 its mongrel, unbeautiful tongue--
 a language, frankly, crying out for poetry
 given its absence, even, of integrity
 not to mention intrinsic song. . . .
 (Its sound: water going down the drain
 according to my friend, an Italian,
  
 after riding in a compartment of Americans
 gurgling all the way from Florence to Rome.)
 Why not a convoluted scheme
 of intricately wrought meter and rhyme?
 So what if the Hebrew has no strict patterns?
 Aim for a parallel sublime;
  
 aren't poems for the impossible?
 Though perhaps yours wouldn't have been written
 had you known how daunting their task was;
 you had no Hebrew, used the Coverdale,
 Wyatt, Geneva Bible, as cribs for Latin,
 even psaumes de David, mis en rime Franoise . . .
  
 Clearly, your secret weapon was ignorance,
 also useful (look at me!) in writing a poem,
 your psalms fourth- and fifth-hand half the time.
 Unless (of course!) your stroke of brilliance
 was to focus on the one thing you could do:
 Sing and let your song be new
  
 which they are, profoundly, even to me,
 who know so many bits of the originals
 of what you claim you're "translating by heart.
 Still, I'll be reading along, alternately
 put off and spellbound by your art-
 ifice, when my wary eye suddenly falls
  
 on something both completely known and new,
 my own--our own--ungainly language
 for a brief instant alien with grace,
 a black-on-white typescript mirage
 in which English letters turn into Hebrew
 or at least intercept its holiness. . . .
  
 How did you manage it, Mary?
 Your contemporaries called it piety--
 but I don't believe that for a second.
 What motivated you was love of poetry,
 or rather of your legendary
 brother--lost so young--whom you would spend
  
 your whole life working to immortalize. . . .
 I'm not sure he needed you. No lighter touch
 exists in English poetry than his . . .
 a touch you often managed to approach
 in your grief-induced lyric resolve
 to force a bit of him to stay alive.
  
 Poetry as solace, as wizardry--
 and there he is, with you, all the time,
 clearly palpable in all your artistry.
 It was your eagerness to be with him
 that kept you going back to intervene
 with yet one more indomitable line,
  
 got you through all hundred-fifty psalms.
 Or maybe it was just your poet's ruse
 (poetry often thrives on self-delusion)
 to trick yourself to rise to his occasion. . . .
 Unless he just provided the excuse
 to stake your own (quite vast) poetic claims,
  
 impossible to say from this vantage point:
 to distinguish collaborator from muse,
 self-doubt from false humility
 but, then again, there's a poetry in mystery.
 Who will contradict me if I confuse
 my own passions with yours--so convenient,
  
 inevitable?--in a poem like this--
 though you and I--despite the labyrinth
 of misapprehension, class, religion
 reinforcing our dissociation
 (Jew from Christian, commoner from countess,
 twenty-first-century from seventeenth)
  
 come together in passion upon passion
 (forgive me, Mary, if dare too far):
 psalms, poetic forms, your genius brother
 (I mean both the poet and the man;
 no poem could manufacture that much charm).
 We've even suffered from a kindred harm:
  
 my version, albeit, fairly mild,
 though I too was admonished as a child
 about what a woman dared not do.
 Still, I have a vast cohort, while you
 were almost entirely alone.
 Better yet, I had the complete Dickinson
  
 (published just a year before I was born);
 I didn't know it yet, but I had you . . .
 while you had to ransack antiquity
 for even fragments of poems by a woman.
 But of course you weren't troubled by inequity--
 it was, frankly, all you knew--
  
 you might even have relished your position
 as sole woman poet, thinker, patron--
 lonely as it was--though you did encourage
 your precocious niece, Mary (later Wroth).
 And who can really estimate the damage
 of your appalling bargain: a brother's death
  
 required to turn you into poet?
 Of course, in your time, death was everywhere.
 Perhaps you were pious--a last resort
 to shore up an attenuated heart
 against even further disrepair,
 immersion in the psalms a sort of antidote
  
 to life's massive overdose of pain:
 from living with a sad, disfigured mother
 (small-pox scars from nursing a sick queen)
 mourning her husband's lost affection
 to deaths of favorites--your sister, your brother,
 your only daughters, Katherine, then Anne.
  
 God made this day; he did us send it
 In joy and mirth then let us spend it
 Excellent advice, if it would hold--
 And maybe it does, when you can summon
 all that air or life enfold
 to distract you with a binge of exaltation . . .
  
 or if that fails, then an assiduous
 extravaganza of sublime detail
 calibrated to provide the wherewithal
 to face a universe we cannot alter
 if not with joy and mirth, at least with grace:
 a perfect, hand-illuminated psalter,
  
 the loops of all its letters filled with gold--
 a treasure, even, for an exacting Queen--
 offering a deity who'll listen
 to a voice alternately humble, bold,
 beseeching, thankful, ecstatic, bleak,
 through which (hallelujah, Mary!) you still speak.





Becoming Anne Bradstreet
 

It happens again
 As soon as I take down her book and open it.
  
 I turn the page.
 My skies rise higher and hang younger stars.
  
 The ship's rail freezes.
 Mare Hibernicum leads to Anne Bradstreet's coast.
  
 A blackbird leaves her pine trees
 And lands in my spruce trees.
  
 I open my door on a Dublin street.
 Her child/her words are staring up at me:
  
 In better dress to trim thee was my mind,
 But nought save home-spun cloth, i' th' house I find.
  
 We say home truths
 Because her words can be at home anywhere--
  
 At the source, at the end and whenever
 The book lies open and I am again
  
 An Irish poet watching an English woman
 Become an American poet.





"Oh Fairest of the Rural Maids
 

Oh fairest of the rural maids!
 Thy birth was in the forest shades;
 Green boughs, and glimpses of the sky,
 Were all that met thine infant eye.
  
 Thy sports, thy wanderings, when a child,
 Were even in the sylvan wild;
 And all the beauty of the place
 Is in thy heart and on thy face.
  
 The twilight of the trees and rocks
 Is in the light shade of thy locks;
 Thy step is as the wind, that weaves
 Its playful way among the leaves.
  
 Thine eyes are springs, in whose serene
 And silent waters heaven is seen;
 Their lashes are the herbs that look
 On their young figures in the brook.
  
 The forest depths, by foot unpressed,
 Are not more sinless than thy breast;
 The holy peace, that fills the air
 Of those calm solitudes, is there.





A Winter Piece
 


  The time has been that these wild solitudes,
 Yet beautiful as wild, were trod by me
 Oftener than now; and when the ills of life
 Had chafed my spirit--when the unsteady pulse
 Beat with strange flutterings--I would wander forth
 And seek the woods. The sunshine on my path
 Was to me a friend. The swelling hills,
 The quiet dells retiring far between,
 With gentle invitation to explore
 Their windings, were a calm society
 That talked with me and soothed me. Then the chant
 Of birds, and chime of brooks, and soft caress
 Of the fresh sylvan air, made me forget
 The thoughts that broke my peace, and I began
 To gather simples by the fountain's brink,
 And lose myself in day-dreams. While I stood 
 In Nature's loneliness, I was with one
 With whom I early grew familiar, one
 Who never had a frown for me, whose voice
 Never rebuked me for the hours I stole
 From cares I loved not, but of which the world
 Deems highest, to converse with her. When shrieked
 The bleak November winds, and smote the woods,
 And the brown fields were herbless, and the shades,
 That met above the merry rivulet,
 Were spoiled, I sought, I loved them still; they seemed
 Like old companions in adversity.
 Still there was beauty in my walks; the brook,
 Bordered with sparkling frost-work, was as gay
 As with its fringe of summer flowers. Afar,
 The village with its spires, the path of streams
 And dim receding valleys, hid before
 By interposing trees, lay visible
 Through the bare grove, and my familiar haunts
 Seemed new to me. Nor was I slow to come
 Among them, when the clouds, from their still skirts,
 Had shaken down on earth the feathery snow,
 And all was white. The pure keen air abroad,
 Albeit it breathed no scent of herb, nor heard
 Love-call of bird nor merry hum of bee,
 Was not the air of death. Bright mosses crept
 Over the spotted trunks, and the close buds,
 That lay along the boughs, instinct with life,
 Patient, and waiting the soft breath of Spring,
 Feared not the piercing spirit of the North.
 The snow-bird twittered on the beechen bough,
 And 'neath the hemlock, whose thick branches bent
 Beneath its bright cold burden, and kept dry
 A circle, on the earth, of withered leaves,
 The partridge found a shelter. Through the snow
 The rabbit sprang away. The lighter track
 Of fox, and the raccoon's broad path, were there,
 Crossing each other. From his hollow tree
 The squirrel was abroad, gathering the nuts
 Just fallen, that asked the winter cold and sway
 Of winter blast, to shake them from their hold. 
  
   But Winter has yet brighter scenes--he boasts
 Splendors beyond what gorgeous Summer knows;
 Or Autumn with his many fruits, and woods
 All flushed with many hues. Come when the rains
 Have glazed the snow and clothed the trees with ice,
 While the slant of sun of February pours
 Into the bowers a flood of light. Approach!
 The incrusted surface shall upbear thy steps,
 And the broad arching portals of the grove
 Welcome thy entering. Look! the massy trunks
 Are cased in pure crystal; each light spray,
 Nodding and tinkling in the breath of heaven,
 Is studded with its trembling water-drops,
 That glimmer with an amethystine light.
 But round the parent-stem the long low boughs
 Bend, in a glittering ring, and arbors hide
 The glassy floor. Oh! you might deem the spot
 The spacious cavern of some virgin mine,
 Deep in the womb of earth--where the gems grow,
 And diamonds put forth radiant rods and bud
 With amethyst and topaz--and the place
 Lit up, most royally, with the pure beam
 That dwells in them. Or haply the vast hall
 Of fairy palace, that outlasts the night,
 And fades not in the glory of the sun;--
 Where crystal columns send forth slender shafts
 And crossing arches; and fantastic aisles
 Wind from the sight in brightness, and are lost
 Among the crowded pillars. Raise thine eye;
 Thou seest no cavern roof; no palace vault;
 There the blue sky and the white drifting cloud
 Look in. Again the wildered fancy dreams
 Of spouting fountains, frozen as they rose,
 And fixed, with all their branching jets, in air,
 And all their sluices sealed. All, all is light;
 Light without shade. But all shall pass away
 With the next sun. From numberless vast trunks
 Loosened, the crashing ice shall make a sound
 Like the far roar of rivers, and the eve
 Shall close o'er the brown woods as it was wont.
  
   And it is pleasant, when the noisy streams
 Are just set free, and milder suns melt off
 The plashy snow, save only the firm drift
 In the deep glen or the close shade of pines--
 'Tis pleasant to behold the wreaths of smoke
 Roll up among the maples of the hill,
 Where the shrill sound of youthful voices wakes
 The shriller echo, as the clear pure lymph,
 That from the wounded trees, in twinkling drops,
 Falls, mid the golden brightness of the morn,
 Is gathered in with brimming pails, and oft,
 Wielded by sturdy hands, the stroke of axe
 Makes the woods ring. Along the quiet air,
 Come and float calmly off the soft light clouds,
 Such as you see in summer, and the winds
 Scarce stir the branches. Lodged in sunny cleft,
   Where the cold breezes come not, blooms alone
 The little wind-flower, whose just opened eye
 Is blue as the spring heaven it gazes at--
 Startling the loiterer in the naked groves
 With unexpected beauty, for the time
 Of blossoms and green leaves is yet afar.
 And ere it comes, the encountering winds shall oft
 Muster their wrath again, and rapid clouds
 Shade heaven, and bounding on the frozen earth
 Shall fall their volleyed stores, rounded like hail
 And white like snow, and the loud North again
 Shall buffet the vexed forest in his rage.





The Yellow Violet
 

When beechen buds begin to swell,
   And woods the blue-bird's warble know,
 The yellow violet's modest bell
   Peeps from the last year's leaves below.
  
 Ere russet fields their green resume,
   Sweet flower, I love, in forest bare,
 To meet thee, when thy faint perfume
   Alone is in the virgin air.
  
 Of all her train, the hands of Spring
   First plant thee in the watery mould,
 And I have seen thee blossoming
   Beside the snow-bank's edges cold.
  
 Thy parent sun, who bade thee view
   Pale skies, and chilling moisture sip,
 Has bathed thee in his own bright hue,
   And streaked with jet thy glowing lip.
  
 Yet slight thy form, and low thy seat,
   And earthward bent thy gentle eye,
 Unapt the passing view to meet
   When loftier flowers are flaunting nigh.
  
 Oft, in the sunless April day,
   Thy early smile has stayed my walk;
 But midst the gorgeous blooms of May,
   I passed thee on thy humble stalk.
  
 So they, who climb to wealth, forget
   The friends in darker fortunes tried.
 I copied them--but I regret
   That I should ape the ways of pride.
  
 And when again the genial hour
   Awakes the painted tribes of light,
 I'll not o'erlook the modest flower
   That made the woods of April bright.





To the Fringed Gentian
 

Thou blossom bright with autumn dew,
 And colored with the heaven's own blue,
 That openest when the quiet light
 Succeeds the keen and frosty night.
  
 Thou comest not when violets lean
 O'er wandering brooks and springs unseen,
 Or columbines, in purple dressed,
 Nod o'er the ground-bird's hidden nest.
  
 Thou waitest late and com'st alone,
 When woods are bare and birds are flown,
 And frosts and shortening days portend
 The aged year is near his end.
  
 Then doth thy sweet and quiet eye
 Look through its fringes to the sky,
 Blue-blue-as if that sky let fall
 A flower from its cerulean wall.
  
 I would that thus, when I shall see
 The hour of death draw near to me,
 Hope, blossoming within my heart,
 May look to heaven as I depart.





The Prairies
 


  These are the gardens of the Desert, these
 The unshorn fields, boundless and beautiful,
 For which the speech of England has no name--
 The Prairies. I behold them for the first,
 And my heart swells, while the dilated sight
 Takes in the encircling vastness. Lo! they stretch,
 In airy undulations, far away,
 As if the ocean, in his gentlest swell,
 Stood still, with all his rounded billows fixed,
 And motionless forever. --Motionless?--
 No--they are all unchained again. The clouds
 Sweep over with their shadows, and, beneath,
 The surface rolls and fluctuates to the eye;
 Dark hollows seem to glide along and chase
 The sunny ridges. Breezes of the South!
 Who toss the golden and the flame-like flowers,
 And pass the prairie-hawk that, poised on high,
 Flaps his broad wings, yet moves not--ye have played
 Among the palms of Mexico and vines
 Of Texas, and have crisped the limpid brooks
 That from the fountains of Sonora glide
 Into the calm Pacific--have ye fanned
 A nobler or a lovelier scene than this?
 Man hath no power in all this glorious work:
 The hand that built the firmament hath heaved
 And smoothed these verdant swells, and sown their slopes
 With herbage, planted them with island groves,
 And hedged them round with forests. Fitting floor
 For this magnificent temple of the sky--
 With flowers whose glory and whose multitude
 Rival the constellations! The great heavens
 Seem to stoop down upon the scene in love,-- 
 A nearer vault, and of a tenderer blue,
 Than that which bends above our eastern hills.
  
   As o'er the verdant waste I guide my steed,
 Among the high rank grass that sweeps his sides
 The hollow beating of his footsteps seems
 A sacrilegious sound. I think of those
 Upon whose rest he tramples. Are they here--
 The dead of other days?--and did the dust
 Of these fair solitudes once stir with life
 And burn with passion? Let the mighty mounds
 That overlook the rivers, or that rise
 In the dim forest crowded with old oaks,
 Answer. A race, that long has passed away,
 Built them;--a disciplined and populous race
 Heaped, with long toil, the earth, while yet the Greek
 Was hewing the Pentelicus to forms
 Of symmetry, and rearing on its rock
 The glittering Parthenon. These ample fields
 Nourished their harvest, here their herds were fed,
 When haply by their stalls the bison lowed,
 And bowed his maned shoulder to the yoke.
 All day this desert murmured with their toils,
 Till twilight blushed, and lovers walked, and wooed
 In a forgotten language, and old tunes,
 From instruments of unremembered form,
 Gave the soft winds a voice. The red man came--
 The roaming hunter tribes, warlike and fierce,
 And the mound-builders vanished from the earth.
 The solitude of centuries untold
 Has settled where they dwelt. The prairie-wolf
 Hunts in their meadows, and his fresh-dug den
 Yawns by my path. The gopher mines the ground
 Where stood their swarming cities. All is gone;
 All--save the piles of earth that hold their bones,
 The platforms where they worshipped unknown gods,
 The barriers which they builded from the soil
 To keep the foe at bay--till o'er the walls
 The wild beleaguerers broke, and, one by one,
 The strongholds of the plain were forced, and heaped
 With corpses. The brown vultures of the wood
 Flocked to those vast uncovered sepulchres,
 And sat unscared and silent at their feast.
 Haply some solitary fugitive,
 Lurking in marsh and forest, till the sense
 Of desolation and of fear became
 Bitterer than death, yielded himself to die.
 Man's better nature triumphed then. Kind words
 Welcomed and soothed him; the rude conquerors
 Seated the captive with their chiefs; he chose
 A bride among their maidens, and at length
 Seemed to forget--yet ne'er forgot--the wife
 Of his first love, and her sweet little ones,
 Butchered, amid their shrieks, with all his race.
  
   Thus change the forms of being. Thus arise
 Races of living things, glorious in strength,
 And perish, as the quickening breath of God
 Fills them, or is withdrawn. The red man, too,
 Has left the blooming wilds he ranged so long,
 And, nearer to the Rocky Mountains, sought
 A wilder hunting-ground. The beaver builds
 No longer by these streams, but far away,
 On waters whose blue surface ne'er gave back
 The white man's face--among Missouri's springs,
 And pools whose issues swell the Oregon--
 He rears his little Venice. In these plains
 The bison feeds no more. Twice twenty leagues
 Beyond remotest smoke of hunter's camp,
 Roams the majestic brute, in herds that shake
 The earth with thundering steps--yet here I meet
 His ancient footprints stamped beside the pool.
  
   Still this great solitude is quick with life.
 Myriads of insects, gaudy as the flowers
 They flutter over, gentle quadrupeds,
 And birds, that scarce have learned the fear of man,
 Are here, and sliding reptiles of the ground,
 Startlingly beautiful. The graceful deer
 Bounds to the wood at my approach. The bee,
 A more adventurous colonist than man,
 With whom he came across the eastern deep,
 Fills the savannas with his murmurings,
 And hides his sweets, as in the golden age,
 Within the hollow oak. I listen long
 To his domestic hum, and think I hear
 The sound of that advancing multitude
 Which soon shall fill these deserts. From the ground
 Comes up the laugh of children, the soft voice
 Of maidens, and the sweet and solemn hymn
 Of Sabbath worshippers. The low of herds
 Blends with the rustling of the heavy grain
 Over the dark brown furrows. All at once
 A fresher winds sweeps by, and breaks my dream,
 And I am in the wilderness alone.





Eight Ball
 

It was fifty cents a game 
             beneath exhausted ceiling fans,
the smoke's old spiral. Hooded lights 
             burned distant, dull. I was tired, but you
insisted on one more, so I chalked 
             the cue--the bored blue--broke, scratched.
It was always possible 
             for you to run the table, leave me
nothing. But I recall the easy 
             shot you missed, and then the way
we both studied, circling--keeping 
             what you had left me between us.





Dirty Face
 

Where did you get such a dirty face,
 My darling dirty-faced child?
  
 I got it from crawling along in the dirt
 And biting two buttons off Jeremy's shirt.
 I got it from chewing the roots of a rose
 And digging for clams in the yard with my nose.
 I got it from peeking into a dark cave
 And painting myself like a Navajo brave.
 I got it from playing with coal in the bin
 And signing my name in cement with my chin.
 I got if from rolling around on the rug
 And giving the horrible dog a big hug.
 I got it from finding a lost silver mine
 And eating sweet blackberries right off the vine.
 I got it from ice cream and wrestling and tears
 And from having more fun than you've had in years.





Openin Night
 

She had the jitters
 She had the flu
 She showed up late
 She missed her cue
 She kicked the director
 She screamed at the crew
 And tripped on a prop
 And fell in some goo
 And ripped her costume
 A place or two
 Then she forgot
 A line she knew
 And went "Meow
 Instead of "Moo
 She heard em giggle
 She heard em boo
 The programs sailed
 The popcorn flew
 As she stomped offstage
 With a boo-hoo-hoo
 The fringe of the curtain
 Got caught in her shoe
 The set crashed down
 The lights did too
 Maybe that's why she didn't want to do
 An interview.





When I am Gone
 

When I am gone what will you do?
 Who will write and draw for you?
 Someone smarter--someone new?
 Someone better--maybe YOU!





Leaving the Hospital
 

As the doors glide shut behind me, 
the world flares back into being-- 
I exist again, recover myself, 
sunlight undimmed by dark panes, 
the heat on my arms the earth's breath. 
The wind tongues me to my feet
like a doe licking clean her newborn fawn. 
At my back, days measured by vital signs, 
my mouth opened and arm extended, 
the nighttime cries of a man withered 
child-size by cancer, and the bells
of emptied IVs tolling through hallways. 
Before me, life--mysterious, ordinary-- 
holding off pain with its muscular wings. 
As I step to the curb, an orange moth 
dives into the basket of roses
that lately stood on my sickroom table, 
and the petals yield to its persistent 
nudge, opening manifold and golden.





The Triumph of Death
 

To Mary Sidney

In your lace ruff you resemble a giant
               snowflake or a spider web
 pearled with dew. What poets you catch
  
 in your symmetries, at your long table at Wilton
               what wits (Spenser, Fulke-
 Greville, Drayton) pitch into the roasted
  
 piglet, stewed apples, carp.
               If you rowzed God up, He
 knocked you back on your heels, Lady--
  
 "O God, why hast thou thus
               Repulst, and scattred us?--Through the high
 windows at Wilton seethe
  
 rumors of battle, Philip's pussing thigh,
               death in the Lowlands. Mother Wrong,
 Daughter Strife stalk the cities; still
  
 you keep house with grammar, you salt the psalms
               for long preserving. "As smoke in wind,
 as wax at fire doth waste
  
 the unjust dissolve. Your stanzas
               stay, still sting the tongue.
 Dawn finds you kneeling on stone, calling
  
 again the bleak God you believe
               will answer you.
 You mix medicines, you write
  
 in invisible ink. But Time
               trumps Fame which undoes Death
 which masters Chastity and Love--which leaves
  
 Eternity, your Master wrote, master of all.
               And like your lace, your lines
 shine, not pale, "but whitely,
  
 and more whitely pure
               than snow on windless hill that flaking falls,
 as one whom labour did to rest allure.
  
 Translate us too, rough line by line,
               into your crystalline
 severe design.





Coming to That
 

"If it comes to that, he said, "there'll be no
 preventing it.
 He uttered it as I listened. Had I got it right,
 hearing him?
 "If it comes to that, is what he said, and, 
 as if talking
 to himself, went on about how there'd be no
 preventing it.
 He came to that conclusion, saying it in a 
 slow way of
 coming to that, whatever that was it might
 come to before
 not being prevented--and as if such a thing
 were for him
 the unthinkable, and would prevail, if it 
 came to that.
  
 And while listening more closely now to
 what he said, 
 I realized if no one paid him heed, it would
 be as if he
 hadn't said it--if it came to that--and would
 then not be
 prevented from falling to forces known to 
 care little for
 what he said, even if they heard it, their
 being wily
 and forceful enough to make sure it would 
 come to that.





All Hallows Eve
 

Be perfect, make it otherwise.
 Yesterday is torn in shreds.
 Lightning's thousand sulfur eyes
 Rip apart the breathing beds.
 Hear bones crack and pulverize.
 Doom creeps in on rubber treads.
 Countless overwrought housewives, 
 Minds unraveling like threads,
 Try lipstick shades to tranquilize
 Fears of age and general dreads.
 Sit tight, be perfect, swat the spies,
 Don't take faucets for fountainheads.
 Drink tasty antidotes. Otherwise
 You and the werewolf: newlyweds.





Never Mind
 

Never mind the pins
 And needles I am on.
 Let all the other instruments
 Of torture have their way.
 While air-conditioners
 Freeze my coffee
 I watch the toaster
 Eating my toast.
 Did I press the right
 Buttons on all these
 Buttonless surfaces
 Daring me to press them?
 Did you gasp on seeing what 
 The mailman just brought?
  
 Will the fellow I saw pedaling
 Across the bridge live long
 After losing his left leg,
 His penis, and his bike
 To fearlessness?
 Will his sad wife find
 Consolation with the 
 Computer wizard called in
 Last year to deal with glitches?
  
 Did you defuse the boys'
 Bomb before your house
 Was under water, same 
 As everything else?
 Aunt Til grabbed her
 Silver hand mirror
 Before floating away.
 The dog yelped constantly,
 Tipping our canoe.
 Silly dog.





Lucky
 

Ever imagining the dire, the sudden
 the menace with no thought of the 
 gradual, the lingering itch of whatever.
 That was my sister.
 A stomach ache had to be diagnosed.
 "Oh, come on, it's no big deal.
 "How do you know? You aren't me.
  
 At the doctor's office she waited.
 He reached for his stethoscope,
 held it to her back and put it away 
 in his pocket. Then, leaning across
 his desk, he asked importantly,
 "How long have you been eating your hair?
 She couldn't answer.
  
 After surgery they came into the recovery
 room where she had just wakened.
 "You are a lucky lady. We found nothing.
 She had an incision and several visitors.
 Besides, she was so lucky (incisions heal)
 and not a little disgusted.
  
 "Me, eating my hair.





Asters
 

Asters--sweltering days
old adjuration/curse,
the gods hold the balance
for an uncertain hour.

Once more the golden flocks
of heaven, the light, the trim--
what is the ancient process
hatching under its dying wings?

Once more the yearned-for,
the intoxication, the rose of you--
summer leaned in the doorway 
watching the swallows--

one more presentiment
where certainty is not hard to come by:
wing tips brush the face of the waters,
swallows sip speed and night.





Express Train
 

Brown. Brandy-brown. Leaf-brown. Russet. 
Malayan yellow.
Express train Berlin-Trelleborg and the Baltic resorts.

Flesh that went naked.
Tanned unto the mouth by the sea.
Deeply ripened for Grecian joys.
How far along the summer, in sickle-submissiveness!
Penultimate day of the ninth month!

Parched with stubble and the last corn-shocks.
Unfurlings, blood, fatigue,
deranged by dahlia-nearness.

Man-brown jumps on woman-brown.

A woman is something for a night.
And if you enjoyed it, then the next one too!
O! And then the return to one's own care.
The not-speaking! The urges!

A woman is something with a smell.
Ineffable! To die for! Mignonette.
Shepherd, sea, and South.
On every declivity a bliss.

Woman-brown drapes itself on man-brown:

Hold me! I'm falling!
My neck is so weary.
Oh, the sweet last
fevered scent from the gardens.







Caryatid
 

Renege on the rock! Smash
the oppressor cave! Sashay
out onto the floor! Scorn the cornices--
see, from the beard of drunk Silenus
from the unique uproar of his blood
the wine dribble into his genitals!

Spit on the obsession with pillars:
ancient rheumatic hands quake toward
gray skies. Bring down the temple
by the yearning of your knees
twitching with dance.

Spill, spread, unpetal, bleed
your soft flowers through great wounds.
Dove-hauled Venus girds her loins
with roses--
see the summer's last puff of blue
drift on seas of asters to distant
pine-brown coasts; see 
this final hour of our mendacious 
southern happiness   
held aloft.





Evenings of Certain Lives
 


                                                  I

You don't need always to be scrubbing the tiles, Hendrickje, 
my eye drinks itself, 
drinks itself to death--
but other drink is in short supply--
the little Buddha there,
Chinese grove god
in exchange for a ladleful of Hulstkamp,
please!

Never painted anything 
in frost-white or ice-skater blue 
or that Irish green 
in which the purple shimmers through--
always my own monotone,
my compulsion to shadows--
not pleasant
to pursue that path so clearly.

Greatness--where?
I pick up the slate-pencil and certain things appear 
on paper or canvas
or whatever the heck else--
result: Buddha bronze hocked for booze--
but I draw the line at homage under ornamental plants,
banquet of the painters' guild--
something for the boardroom!

...Creaking, 
little sheep squeaking, chromotypes
Flemish, Rubensish--
for the grandchildren 
(same idiots!) 
Ah--Hulstkamp, 
hits the spot, 
midpoint of colors, 
my shadow brown, 
stubble aura around heart and eye--


                                                 II
 
The blocked chimney smokes 
--the Swan of Avon blows his nose--
the tree stumps are wet,
clammy night, emptiness mingled with draft--
enough characters, 
the world is overpopulated as it is,
plentiful peach-fall, four rosebuds
per annum--
asperged,
set to tread the boards
by this hand,
grown wrinkled
and with sluggish veins!

All the Juliets and Ophelias, 
wreathed, silvered, sometimes murderous--
all the soft mouths, the sighs
I extracted from them--
the original actresses long since turned to smoke,
rust, leeched dry, rats' pudding--
Ariel too, away with the elements.

The age takes off its frockcoat. 
These lousy skulls of lords, 
their trains of thought
that I pushed into extremes--
my lords makers of history
all of them crowned and sceptered illiterates,
great powers of the cosmos--
yes, like so many bats or kites!

Sir Goon wrote to me lately: 
"the rest is silence--
I think that's one of mine, 
could only be mine,
Dante dead--lacuna
of centuries
to my logomachic quotes--

what if they didn't exist, 
the booty never brought to light, 
the booths, the scaffolds, the cymbals 
never clashed--
gaps? Gap teeth maybe, 
but the great monkey jaws
would grind on
emptiness, mingled with draft--
the tree stumps are wet
and the butler snores in porter dreams.









Left the House
 


                                             I

Left the house shattered, it hurt so bad,
so many years as a man, compromise,
in spite of partial success in intellectual tussle
he was never anyone of Olympian allure.

He walked slowly through the dreamscape
of the late autumn day, barely distinguishable
from early spring, with young willows
and a patch of waste ground where blue jays screamed.

Dreamy exposure to phenomena
that to nature in its administration
of various cycles--young and old alike--
are inseparably part of a single order--:

so he drank his gin and accepted a dish
of sausage soup, free on Thursdays
with a beverage and so found the Olympian balance
of sorrow and pleasure.

                                             II
 
He had been reading on the park bench
and stared into the gray of the last roses,
there were no titans, just shrubs
thinned out by fall.

He put down his book. It was a day like any other
and the people were like all people everywhere,
that was how it would always be, at least
this mixture of death and laughter would persist.

A scent is enough to change things,
even small flowers stand in some relation to a cedar of Lebanon,
then he walked on and saw the windows of the furriers
were full of warm things for the winter ahead.

                                             III
 
All very well, a gin and a few minutes
in the park at noon, with the sun shining,
but what when the landlord comes by, there are problems
with your tax return, and the girlfriend's in tears?

Shattered: how far are you allowed to push your I,
and see peculiar things as somehow symptomatic?
Shattered: to what extent are you obliged to play by the rules--
as far as a Ludwig Richter canvas?

Shattered: no one knows. Shattered and you turn
equally pained to singular and universal--
your little experiment with destiny will end
gloriously and forever, but quite alone.

Damned evergreens! Vinyl whines!
Gin, sun, cedars--what use are they
to help the self reconcile landlord, God, and dream--
voices warble and words mock--
left the house and closed his reverie.








Divergences
 

One says: please no inner life,
manners by all means, but nothing affective,
that's no compensation
for the insufferable
difficulties of outward-directed expression--
those cerebralized
city-Styxes

when my little prince
pokes his chubby little legs through the bars of his cot
it melts my heart, it was like that with Otto Ernst,
and it's no different now

the contraries are not easy to reconcile 
but when you survey the provinces
the inner life
has it by a neck.









Fragments 1953
 

A day without tears is a rare occurrence
                culpable absent-mindedness
practically an episode

                                                   

when men still wore starched collars,
and stuffed cotton wool between their toes
hobbled about in pain, pedicure hadn't been invented,
but you would see faces that were worth a second look
those were years when something whispered






Alteration Finds
 

1. DELIRIUM, AFTER RIMBAUD

How many hours I kept
that vigil by your side--
entire nights, eyes wide,
as you so sweetly slept.

What I was wondering:
why you yearned to evade
the real. No one has prayed
harder for anything.

It wasn't for your life
I feared, but for mankind.
Did you, in the end, find
secrets for changing life?



2. DEFACED, AFTER RILKE

The head we cannot know,
nor its bright fruit, the eyes.
And yet the body has
its gaze: a lamp turned low.

Or else the breast would cease
to dazzle, the hips fail
to curve into that smile
that begets more than a kiss.

And flesh would lose all life,
not flare till there's no blind
it can't see you behind.
You must change your life.



3. DENIAL, AFTER SEFERIS

The afternoon grew hotter
along our secret shore.
We thirsted in the glare
but couldn't drink the water.

On golden sand we traced
your name beside the sea.
The wind came like a sigh;
our writing was erased.

How passionate our life,
how full of sex and song,
spirit and heart--how wrong!
And so we changed our life.





Fable and Moral
 

He fell and died, the skier,
high up there in the snow. 
And now, spring having come,
his father leaves his home,
dark in the valley, to throw
a hook in the heavy river.









A Life
 

That the stars are adamant
everyone understands--
but I won't give up seeking joy on each blue wave
or peace below every gray stone.
If happiness never comes, what is a life?
A lily withers in the sand
and if its nature has failed? The tide 
                                         washes the beach at night. 
What is the fly looking for on the spider's web?
What does a dayfly make of its hours?
(Two wings creased over a hollow body.)

Black will never turn to white--
yet the perfume of our struggle lingers
as each morning fresh flowers
spring up from hell.

The day will come
when the earth is emptied, the skies collapse
and all goes still--
when nothing remains but the dayfly
                                         folded in a leaf.
But no one knows it.





Now it is fall
 

when all the golden birds 
fly home across the blue deep water;
On shore I sit rapt in its scattering
                                                       glitter;
departure rustles through the trees.
This farewell is vast and separation draws close,
but reunion, that also is certain.

My head on my arm I fall asleep easily.
On my eyes a mother's breath,
from her mouth to my heart:
sleep, child, and dream now the sun is gone.--





Strange Sea
 

Implausible fish bloom in the depths,
mercurial flowers light up the coast;
I know red and yellow, the other colors,--

but the sea, det granna granna havet, that's most dangerous
                                                                            to look at.
What name is there for the color that arouses
this thirst, which says,
the saga can happen, even to you--

Translated from the Swedish by Averill Curdy






Lips
 

What is the structure of lips
That take care of sounds,
That can scream loud and long,
That can wait and be silent?
Yesterday I was mastering words
And kissing lips lightly--
Their loving weakness
Now remains on my own
Hardworking lips, 
Exacting, as if forever,
My terrible punishment.





After Quevedo
 

In memory of Octavio Paz
not even lost in death the memory
of why we burned, and therefore still
a fire consuming all obsequious delay,
now polvo, dust, of a desire but still alive

             and aching, not even lost to you 
within our common urn, urgent as an ash
still burning alma, soul, still
and moving toward you, la muerte, my amor--

             not even lost in death, memoria,
and feeling some reply, alma, memory and ash,
ash burning still, still
and moving toward you, dust and dust, ash

             ms all de la muerte, constant

even in our common urn, polvo enamorado.

In memory of Anthony Kerrigan

           Derelict thoughts
   (scattered over the South Pacific)
       of one dying in the ship's hold
somewhere between 1530 degrees latitude
and 135150 degrees southern longitude
at the crux of time stretched to its limit.
 
                                                    

   The ocean never finishes in the wake of boats.


   An unceasing torment infinitely prolonged 
that I would not wish on my worst enemy.
Especially since my worst enemy is myself.


   I cross the South Pacific like a deserted countryside
on a winter's night: not even a beast in sight.


Reduced to its own insularity, I becomes island.


   When seasick there's no place for Narcissus: one 
cannot drink one's own likeness.

                                                    

   In this singular life we can only scout new places.  

   Other than obligation, what keeps us on this earth?    

   Every day approaches death--some more than others.

                                                    

   In the year 14,000 the Southern Cross will shine over Paris...
   We will no longer exist, neither perhaps will Paris...
   But I will be here in a certain manner, if only to know it.


   There is no black box or recorder for ships. They disappear completely.
   A ship's black box is called the coffin. But the only coffins that one 
sees on the ocean are the ships themselves.
   

   There is also a black box within you. It's the frailness of humans;
they wear that fragility on the outside--Eros, a child, a book.


   For boats, there are packages heavier and not hurried: 
I travel like that, a package in order, but a piece of mail.

                                                    

   The universe is curved like a banana.

   I am an atheist because God does not believe enough in me.

   He was so afraid of death that arriving in old age he 
felt stupid.


--To search for God without expectation.

                                                    


   Life opens, gives and invites you--or it goes to hell.


   One must live to write. Our time here is for utterance.


--Sad animal post-cogitum.

                                                   

   Linger only with healthy ideas. Salty ones.


   Stupor is second nature.


   There are those born too soon and those born
too late who preserve with haunting smiles the mistakes, 
the traces. And the one born at the right moment is 
forever vivid, intensely illuminating  each instant.

   To write is to leave the world's surface, to descend
under the sea; the smallest pencil is my tuba.

   One doesn't report great things from grand 
events, the one suffering from depression thinks. 
After his world tour, Bougainville extravagantly 
gave his name to a flower; the botanist La Billardire 
gave his name to a type of grass--not bad; and you,
to what?--A pail for vomit?






To my Comrade, Moses J. Jackson, Scoffer at this Scholarship
 

As we went walking far and wide
Through silent fields and countryside,
We watched together star signs brim
And rise above the ocean's rim,
And planets too, that fret with light
The icy caverns of the Night.
These constellations we now mark,
When we were not, in formless dark,
A poet, centuries before,
Would watch from the Italian shore
Drop in the sea, and mindful Earth
Had made him mortal from his birth,
He set on high his music's bars
Among the everlasting stars,
To those to come, clear warning sign
To place no faith in the divine;
For sacred to the pole unfurled
Above, and compassing the world,
These songs yet suffered sad disgrace
And almost sank without a trace:
Though to our strand this wreckage came,
It scarcely owned its author's name.
Mine not to exhort the gods
Or stars that vex our mortal odds,
But love of virtue quick to fade
Makes me seek fame with human aid.
A man, I chose a man to stand
At this front page and my right hand--
Who thrive or perish in my pages,
Brief friend, your name should last the ages.
I send these lines to you who went
Where stars rise in the Orient,
From here where constellations sink
Below the ocean's western brink.
Take them: for that day will come
To add us to the canceled sum
And give our bones to earth to rot
(For we have no immortal lot,
And souls that will not last forever)
And the chain of comrades sever.









Bound for Hell
 

Hell, my ardent sisters, be assured,
Is where we're bound; we'll drink the pitch of hell--
We, who have sung the praises of the lord
With every fiber in us, every cell.

We, who did not manage to devote
Our nights to spinning, did not bend and sway
Above a cradle--in a flimsy boat,
Wrapped in a mantle, we're now borne away.

Every morning, every day, we'd rise
And have the finest Chinese silks to wear;
And we'd strike up the songs of paradise
Around the campfire of a robbers' lair,

We, careless seamstresses (our seams all ran,
Whether we sewed or not)--yet we have been
Such dancers, we have played the pipes of Pan:
The world was ours, each one of us a queen.

First, scarcely draped in tatters, and disheveled,
Then plaited with a starry diadem;
We've been in jails, at banquets we have reveled:
But the rewards of heaven, we're lost to them,

Lost in nights of starlight, in the garden
Where apple trees from paradise are found.
No, be assured, my gentle girls, my ardent
And lovely sisters, hell is where we're bound.





The Poor
 

The poor are many
and so--
impossible to forget.

No doubt,
as day breaks,
they see the buildings
where they wish
they could live with their children.

They 
can steady the coffin
of a constellation on their shoulders.
They can wreck 
the air like furious birds,
blocking out the sun.

But not knowing these gifts,
they enter and exit through mirrors of blood,
walking and dying slowly.

And so,
one cannot forget them.






The Day of Gifts
 

It's not true that Your saints have won everything: they left me with sins enough.
Someday I'll lie on my deathbed, Lord, ill-shaven and yellow as a lifelong drunk.
And I'll make a general examination of myself, looking back over all my days,
And I'll see that I'm rich after all, ripe and rich with evil in its unnumbered paths and ways.
I haven't lost one single chance, Lord, to make matter for You to pardon.
Now I hearten myself with vice, having long ago sloughed off virtue's burden.
Each day has its own kind of crime, plain to see, and I count them like some paranoid miser.

If what you need, Lord, are virgins, if what you need are brave men beneath your standard;
If there are people for whom to be Christian words alone would not suffice, 
But who know rather that only in stirring themselves to chase after You is there any life,
Well then there's Dominic and Francis, Saint Lawrence and Saint Cecilia and plenty more!
But if by chance You should have need of a lazy and imbecilic bore,
If a prideful coward could prove useful to You, or perhaps a soiled ingrate,
Or the sort of man whose hard heart shows up in a hard face--
Well, anyway, You didn't come to save the just but that other type that abounds,
And if, miraculously, You run out of them elsewhere . . . Lord, I'm still around.

And what kind of a man is so crude that he hasn't held a little something back from You,
Hasn't in his free time fashioned something special for You,
Hoping that one day the idea will come to You to ask it of him,
And maybe this little that he's made himself, kept back until then, though horrid and tortuous, will please Your whim. 
It would be something that he'd put his whole heart into, something useless and malformed.
Just like that my little daughter once, on my birthday, teetered forward with encumbered arms
And offered me, her heart at once full of timidity and pride,
A magnificent little duck she had made with her own two hands, a pincushion, made of red wool and gold thread.  






To the One Who is Reading Me
 

You are invulnerable. Didn't they deliver
(those forces that control your destiny)
the certainty of dust? Couldn't it be
your irreversible time is that river
in whose bright mirror Heraclitus read 
his brevity? A marble slab is saved
for you, one you won't read, already graved
with city, epitaph, dates of the dead.
And other men are also dreams of time, 
not hardened bronze, purified gold. They're dust
like you; the universe is Proteus. 
Shadow, you'll travel to what waits ahead,
the fatal shadow waiting at the rim. 
Know this: in some way you're already dead.





Music Box
 

Music of Japan. Parsimoniously
from the water clock the drops unfold 
in lazy honey or ethereal gold
that over time reiterates a weave 
eternal, fragile, enigmatic, bright.
I fear that every one will be the last.
They are a yesterday come from the past.
But from what shrine, from what mountain's slight
garden, what vigils by an unknown sea,
and from what modest melancholy, from
what lost and rediscovered afternoon
do they arrive at their far future: me?
Who knows? No matter. When I hear it play
I am. I want to be. I bleed away.









from "Voices
 

Some things become such a part of us that we forget them.

                                                               

I want because of what I wanted, and what I wanted, I wouldn't want again.

                                                               

The passing of a soul is light, extremely light, almost silence.

                                                                

 There are pains that have lost their memory and don't remember why they are painful.

                                                                

Convince me, but without convictions. Convictions no longer convince me.

                                                                

We don't forgive being as we are.

                                                                

At the last moment, my whole life will last a moment.

                                                               

Man is a thing children learn. A childish thing.

                                                               

Don't speak to me. I want to be with you.

                                                               

 There are those fallen who don't get up so as not to fall again.

                                                               

 The dream that doesn't feed on dream vanishes.
 






Psalms
 

lord
pray
pray loudly against the noise of the human hand
which seeks to drown you out
and appear on quiet soles
so that we might understand your footsteps
exert yourself
in order to recognize our prayers
even when they appear in a different garment
because no prayer ever looses itself from the source of the one praying


                                                        


lord
take up the speech
by which i pray to you
grant me the gestures
which have grown within me in your absence
so that i might remain true to my uneducable nature
and take your weakness upon me


                                                        


lord
you should always wander and never let yourself
settle down
because there are no longer any dwelling places
only footsteps
be loud and penetrating
sympathize with me and my stirrings
lead me
all the way to your bread
so that my word might wake

                                                       


lord
stay by me
even if i nourish myself from ashes and salt
be still and listen to that name
which i lend to you
because i want to distinguish you from the idols 
grant me patience to endure those who are vain 
with their empty words
and the converts
who are zealous to confirm their opposite
and grant
that my waiting be full of revolt

                                                       


lord 
when you arrive
we will be light
bread and water
the table is set and the door opened
come and take your place among us
free me of the belief
that you are only faithful from a distance
and speak with me
in the unharried language of animals
who from far off lie in wait for us
with their unadulterated hunger





from "Poems for Moscow
 

From my hands--take this city not made by hands,
my strange, my beautiful brother.

Take it, church by church--all forty times forty churches,
and flying up the roofs, the small pigeons;

And Spassky Gates--and gates, and gates--
where the Orthodox take off their hats;

And the Chapel of Stars--refuge chapel--
where the floor is--polished by tears;

Take the circle of the five cathedrals, 
my coal, my soul; the domes wash us in their darkgold,

And on your shoulders, from the red clouds,
the Mother of God will drop her own thin coat,

And you will rise, happened of wonderpowers
--never ashamed you loved me.

"Where does such tenderness come from?
 

Where does such tenderness come from?
These aren't the first curls
I've wound around my finger--
I've kissed lips darker than yours.

The sky is washed and dark
(Where does such tenderness come from?)
Other eyes have known
and shifted away from my eyes.

But I've never heard words like this
in the night
(Where does such tenderness come from?)
with my head on your chest, rest.

Where does this tenderness come from?
And what will I do with it? Young
stranger, poet, wandering through town,
you and your eyelashes--longer than anyone's.

1916






from "Poems for Blok
 

Your name is a--bird in my hand,
a piece of ice on my tongue.
The lips' quick opening.
Your name--four letters.
A ball caught in flight,
a silver bell in my mouth.

A stone thrown into a silent lake
is--the sound of your name.
The light click of hooves at night
--your name.
Your name at my temple
--sharp click of a cocked gun.

Your name--impossible--
kiss on my eyes,
the chill of closed eyelids.
Your name--a kiss of snow.
Blue gulp of icy spring water.
With your name--sleep deepens.

April 15, 1916






"I am happy living simply
 

I am happy living simply:
like a clock, or a calendar.
Worldly pilgrim, thin,
wise--as any creature. To know

the spirit is my beloved. To come to things--swift
as a ray of light, or a look.
To live as I write: spare--the way
God asks me--and friends do not.

1919






from "An Attempt at Jealousy
 

How is your life with that other one?
Simpler, is it? A stroke of the oars
and a long coastline--
and the memory of me

is soon a drifting island
(not in the ocean--in the sky!)
Souls--you will be sisters--
sisters, not lovers.

How is your life with an ordinary
woman? without the god inside her?
The queen supplanted--

How do you breathe now?
Flinch, waking up?
What do you do, poor man?

"Hysterics and interruptions--
enough! I'll rent my own house!
How is your life with that other,
you, my own.

Is the breakfast delicious?
(If you get sick, don't blame me!)
How is it, living with a postcard?
You who stood on Sinai.

How's your life with a tourist
on Earth? Her rib (do you love her?)
is it to your liking?

How's life? Do you cough?
Do you hum to drown out the mice in your mind?

How do you live with cheap goods: is the market rising?
How's kissing plaster-dust?

Are you bored with her new body?
How's it going, with an earthly woman, 
with no sixth sense?

                                                         Are you happy?
No? In a shallow pit--how is your life,
my beloved? Hard as mine
with another man?

1924






"A kiss on the forehead
 

A kiss on the forehead--erases misery.
I kiss your forehead.

A kiss on the eyes--lifts sleeplessness.
I kiss your eyes.

A kiss on the lips--is a drink of water.
I kiss your lips.

A kiss on the forehead--erases memory.


1917 







from "The Desk
 


Fair enough: you people have eaten me,
I--wrote you down.
They'll lay you out on a dinner table,
me--on this desk.

I've been happy with little.
There are dishes I've never tried.
But you, you people eat slowly, and often;
You eat and eat.

Everything was decided for us
back in the ocean:
Our places of action,
our places of gratitude.

You--with belches, I--with books,
with truffles, you. With pencil, I,
you and your olives, me and my rhyme,
with pickles, you. I, with poems.

At your head--funeral candles
like thick-legged asparagus:
your road out of this world
a dessert table's striped cloth.

They will smoke Havana cigars
on your left side and your right;
your body will be dressed
in the best Dutch linen.

And--not to waste such expensive cloth,
they will shake you out,
along with the crumbs and bits of food,
into the hole, the grave.

You--stuffed capon, I--pigeon.
Gunpowder, your soul, at the autopsy.
And I will be laid out bare
with only two wings to cover me.


Late July 1933






from "Poems to Czechoslovakia
 

Black mountain

black mountain
blocks the earth's light.
Time--time--time
to give back to God his ticket.

I refuse to--be. In
the madhouse of the inhumans
I refuse to--live. To swim

on the current of human spines.
I don't need holes in my ears,
no need for seeing eyes.
I refuse to swim on the current of human spines.

To your mad world--one answer: I refuse.

                                      

They took--suddenly--and took--openly--
took mountains--and took their entrails, 
they took coal, and steel they took,
they took lead, and crystal.

And sugar they took, and took the clover,
they took the West, and they took the North,
they took the beehive, and took the haystack,
they took the South from us, and the East.

Vari--they took, and the Tatras--they took,
they took our fingers--took our friends--

But we stand up--
as long as there's spit in our mouths!

May 9, 1939





Each Day
 

Each day as dawn approaches,
the King sits in majesty
and blesses the holy creatures:
To you, my creatures, I speak,
before you I declare--
Creatures who bear the throne of my glory
with all your heart, and willingly with your soul--
Blessed is the hour of your creation,
and exalted is the constellation
beneath which I gave you form.
May the light of that morning continue to shine
when you came into my mind--
for you are a vessel of my desire
prepared and perfected on that day.
Be silent, creatures of my making,
so I might hear my children pray.





From Whose Beauty the Depths Are Lit
 


When one stands before the throne of glory, he begins reciting
the hymn that the throne of glory sings each day:
 

King of kings,
God of gods 
and Lord of lords,
encircled by braided branches of crowns--
encompassed by branching commanders of radiance--
who covers the heavens with wings of His splendor
and in His majesty appears on high; 
from whose beauty the depths are lit,
whose glory flashes across the sky--
proud envoys shoot forth from His form,
powerful creatures explode from His crown,
and princes course from the folds of His robe.
All the trees rejoice at His word
as the grasses delight in His joy--
and His words pour forth as fragrance
in flames of issued fire,
proffering pleasure to those who search them
and peace to those who make them live.





Where Will I Find You
 

Where, Lord, will I find you:your place is high and obscured.         And where               won't I find you:         your glory fills the world.
You dwell deep within--
         you've fixed the ends of creation.
You stand, a tower for the near,
         refuge to those far off.
You've lain above the Ark, here,
         yet live in the highest heavens.
         Exalted among your hosts,
         although beyond their hymns--
               no heavenly sphere
                     could ever contain you,
         let alone a chamber within.

In being borne above them
         on an exalted throne,
you are closer to them
         than their breath and skin. 
Their mouths bear witness for them,
         that you alone gave them form.
         Your kingdom's burden is theirs;
         who wouldn't fear you?
               And who could fail
                     to search for you-- 
         who sends down food when it is due?

I sought your nearness.
         With all my heart I called you.
And in my going out to meet you,
         I found you coming toward me,
as in the wonders of your might
         and holy works I saw you.
         Who would say he hasn't seen
         your glory as the heavens'
               hordes declare
                     their awe of you
         without a sound being heard?

But could the Lord, in truth,
         dwell in men on earth?
How would men you made
         from the dust and clay
fathom your presence there,
         enthroned upon their praise?
         The creatures hovering over
         the world praise your wonders--
               your throne borne high
                     above their heads,
         as you bear all forever.





Prayers for the Protection and Opening of the Heart
 

I

May the Name send its hidden radiance 
       to open the gates of deliverance
to His servants--and shine in their hearts,
which now are shut in silent darkness.

May the great King be moved
       to act in perfection and righteousness--
to open the gates of wisdom for us
and waken the love of old, the love of ancient days.

                                                    ii
 
By the power of the hidden Name I-am-that-I-am,
and by the dew of Desire and Blessing, the dead will live again...

                                                   iii
 
I-am is the power of your Name in concealment,
and one who knows its mystery dwells in eternity's instant.

Over the world, it pours forth abundance and favor, 
and on it all worlds hang, like grapes in a cluster.

Send the dew of blessing, the dew of grace;
renew my dispensation, and grant me length of days.

Bring light to my eyes with your teaching, and let not the husks 
       that surround your hosts obstruct me.
May Heaven and Adam's children judge me with mercy.

Sustain me with their strength and fortune--
but do not leave me in need of the gifts of men.





Release, Please
 

Release, please, this bound one
      by the power of your right hand.
Receive the song of your people,
      exalt us, Lord, and make us 
pure. Almighty one, protect
      those who seek your oneness:
Bless them and cleanse them--bestow
      upon them your merciful justice.
Mighty one, holy one, in your
      goodness guide your assembly.
Turn, sole one on high,
      to those who remember your sanctity,
and accept our cry and plea-- 
      You who fathom all mysteries.





The Nut Garden
 

The Nut Garden holds things felt and thought
and feeling for thought is always a palace--

Sinai with flames of fire about it,
burning though never by fire devoured.

On all four sides surrounded so--
entrance is barred to pretenders forever.

For one who learns to be wise, however,
its doors are open toward the East: 

he reaches out and takes a nut,
then cracks its shell, and eats...





Incantation Against Lilith
 

Veiled in velvet, is she here?
      Leave off, leave off:
           You shall not enter,
                you shall not emerge.
      It is neither yours nor your share.

Return...Return:
      The sea is swelling;
           its waves are calling.
                I hold to the holy portion--
      I am held in the holiness of the King.





Hymn for the Third Meal
 

Prepare the feast
       of perfect faith,
the delight of the Holy King.
       Prepare the feast of the King.

This is the feast
       of the Lesser Presence;
the Ancient Eminence and Field of Apples 
       assemble with Him for the feast.

                                    

Sons of the Palace--
       you who yearn 
to behold the radiance 
       of the Lesser Presence--

be seated here 
       at this Sabbath table,
adorned and crowned
       with the name of the King.

Exult in your being
       part of this gathering
among the guardian
       angels' wings, 

and rejoice now 
       within this hour
of favor which knows 
       not what anger brings.

Draw near me here--
       see my power, 
without the judgments 
       of judgment's terror.

Those without 
       may not enter,
for they are dogs 
       of rancor and gall.

I hereby call
       to the Ancient of Days
to summon His will
       to drive them away--

for when His favor
       in this room is shown,
the husks are rendered
       null and void.

He drives them into
       holes in the ground,
conceals them deep
       in caverns of stone.

And so it is
       now and till twilight--
within the Impatient
       One's delight.





Peace Be Upon You
 

Peace be upon you--
      ministering angels,
            angels of heaven--
from the King who is king of all kings,
      the Holy One, blessed be He;
      in peace be your coming--
            angels of peace,
                  angels of heaven--
from the King who is king of all kings,
      the Holy One, blessed be He.

Bless me with peace--
      angels of peace,
            angels of heaven--
from the King who is king of all kings,
      the Holy One, blessed be He,
      in peace be your leaving--
            angels of peace,
                  angels of heaven,
from the King who is king of all kings,
      the Holy One, blessed be He.





But It Says Nothing
 

But it says nothing. And one is as quiet
 as if to say nothing moves me. Then
 there is the chair. And one speaks of 
 the chair sitting at the table.
 Scraping against surfaces, opening the mouth.
 The object is a piece of thing before. One
 shifts in a chair and opens the talk.
 And the time it says nothing one moves.
 The table is too long as the wall. Not
 a thing but it stays and one opens
 as a mouth will begin. Speaking of
 the table, nothing but to avoid that of
 the wall. One could return over and over
 to the chair, the wall one is sitting at.
 Least ways it says nothing. And the
 thing is, it stays still before
 speaking of. The object of nothing, even
 speech.





The Country Autumns
 

But it could not be brought to see what it
 could be brought. And the leaves are
 away again, teamed. A parent at the
 last and a parent in the middle. And
 as stones I thought it right.

Two plates, and on the other side all the
 forest pieces. The clock says stay.
 The books lower the earth, and in gardens
 flat stones spin. The volume was of waiting.
 Today is today, until the preposition taken up.
 Next to the tree sways.
  
The sky in pieces the leaves part the
 leaves piece together. To and from a hand
 given all directions. The bark comes from
 below. Takes from the books of the moves under
 the sky. Speaker holds up the talks held last.
 Motors the dust and the yellow syllables.
 A slant on which was never here or 
 only partly.





Album  A Runthru
 

I look in that one kind of dwindled. And in this,
 look up, a truncheon in my fist, tin pot
 on my head, the war. My father, I'm looking at, is my
 age then and thin, his pants streak to the ground,
 shadows of rosevines . . . His father sits beneath
 a cat. Here the shadow has more flavor than my
 trains, elbows on livingroom floor, bangs that
 curl, opera broadcast, The Surreptitious Adventures of
 Nightstick. I lie in the wind of the sun and hear
 toots and smell aluminium smoke. The tiny oval
 of my mother's youth in back and the rest is dark.
 Sundays, the floor was black. At the beach, here
 I'm a nest of seaweed, an earlier portrait of 
 surrealists I saw later, a stem of grey what
 rises from my scalp. My hair is peaked in brine.
 And this here hat, dark green fedora over same green
 corduroy suit for a trip to the nation's capitol,
 how far askance I've been since and never another
 hat. Cromium rods, the hand in the guide's pocket
 seems far removed. Blurry shoes on sandstone steps,
 double and over exposed. Then in this one the SECRET
 points to my head, shaved, and emblem, OPEN, striped
 in "pirate T-shirt and HERE IT IS. My elbow bent,
 upright this time, behind a pole. I had yet to 
 enter at this snap the cavern beneath my sneakers.
 To the right my soles protrude from beneath a boulder,
 for I had trapped my mother and she asked Why.
 Taken. Given. Flashlight brighter than my face,
 another grotto, where the ball of twine, indirection,
 gave out but we never got very far in, Connecticut.
 I swim out of another cave in a further frame, cramped
gaze of sunlit days, apparel forgot. Later I reel
 in a yell as my cousin takes a bite from my shank
 beneath ranchhouse breezy curtains of Marion. On a trudge up
 from the gasoline rockpit in the gaze of Judy Lamb, 
 she carries my pack, my jeans rolled as I step on
 a pipe. Estwing in hand and svelte as only youthful can.
 Most of those rocks remain and she married a so-so
 clarinetist. My greygreen zipper jacket leans against
 a concrete teepee, my father looking bullchested stands
 before. Perhaps we had just argued. Central Park cement
 steps of pigeons, the snow removed. Overexposed
 whiteshirt at the drums, stick fingers ride cymbal
 at the camera raised, livingroom Brenton with orange
 & black "sea wallpaper and orange&black tubs. I wore
 a wristwatch then and never again, drumtime hitching
 me past it. I graduate from highschool in white dinner
 jacket and diploma and frown, too many hot shadows
 back of the garage. Must roll up the bedroll with
 skinny arms and lam for the caves. Dave & A. Bell by
 the Ford Company Squire first time allowed alone to tool
 Bleak grass scapes of Knox farm. Rope down a crack,
 mosquitoes and Koolade, sun dapple leaf moss sandwiches, ache.
 Then in this group more drums on the roof, the gravel
 and the flat, a cover attempt for no album even thought.
 I tap and step in the dim known street. Lean on a 
 chimney to inhabit the sky, deep with drops. Here
 I'm pressed on a wall of Tennessee limes, stones-throw
 from mouth of the underground we camped in. Too many
 thoughts, elide. Then lie on a beach in a doughnut
 pattern shirt with a stick, a pipe?, in my mouth as my
 cousin grins shiny beyond. Truro, also waiting for the
 caves. With the poets then I'm fat and the driveway is
 dark, the clapboards all white in a day of all talk. 
 This then all ends in color, my red bandana and shirt out
 on Devil's Pulpit, open hand addressed to the grey
 where Hawthorne and Melville now view of a highschool.
 While the water still spills, and the cat squints at leaves
 blown, my father wears Brahms, families lean in on one
 for a group shot, and the rock remains shattered in a star.





The Fall Returns
 

the rooms are chosen, then they move on
 the beads are wetted in the lime
 the weedlot boils in the blood of one eye
 the children first are cankered then they spin
  

 there are not routes, only dials
 the rocks are spun together in one ball
 the laundry is of rust, the pillow shrieks
 pianos all blow northward and return

 
 must be a bath if  I could find it is a map
 of all the ways that center intermission
 skulls are simply caps for all compression
 day's light raising closets for its dark

 
 I put up the clothes and trail the keys
 that onyx knob in vacuum turns the train
 pressure on the pitches swaying back again
 a world without a heartbeat but it stays





They Say Its New
 

He crackles the air in big fist
 because it is turning, the night's spine
 and the fast floor of last year is now the wall of this
  
 Those cracks should be flowers but there is no light
 nor lights in the windless binnacle strewn
 a slow rate of thought in the broad attention
  
 What is shorn to say and then to leave
 awake in the sleep, the pen without its cap
 the numbers that will harm if not arrayed
  
 The windows are not blank, the dark not empty
 but solid as the mask held loose before
 the eyeless active ridden hive
  
 The sounds of the mind entire are
 the wind below at the valley floor then a thumping above
 as of rocks at work painting the wall
  
 Turn out the lights and think invisibly
 stain the turn of time
 and hear the year before it's there





Argument Over, Amounting
 

In edges, in barriers the tonal light of t
 the one thing removed overemphasizes tonally
 and you could hurry it, and it vanish and plan
  
 You go out on an avenue, but may be taken in despite
 your chordal list of hates, overcomings banished ready
 receiving you from a darkened cone, the one a beat
 behind the one you there are
  
 Then the I not part of the you equation, but the
 spider trying to build where it is written
 vibrates tentative
 I don't want to talk to you about it anymore
 crystal region in its light, there are failures and 
 there are failures
  
 But it's imperative, abrupt catch, that you sink the
 final catch, trounced morning
 this is awful but none other available, words reach
 and visually fail to tie audibly retire
 the pieces of the opening collision, and the reaches of
 turning aside remind
  
 I am hopefully
 this is position
 of the world overcome by
 and by the wind takes our voice
 the collateral one voice
  
                                                                   after Diane Ward





Blues for Alice
 

When you get in on a try you never learn it back
 umpteen times the tenth part of a featured world
 in black and in back it's roses and fostered nail
 bite rhyme sling slang, a song that teaches without
 travail of the tale, the one you longing live
 and singing burn
  
 It's insane to remain a trope, of a rinsing out
 or a ringing whatever, it's those bells that . . .
 and other riskier small day and fain would be
 of the soap a sky dares
  
                                                but we remand,
 that we a clasp of the silence you and I, all of
 tiny sphering rates back, I say to told wall, back
 and back and leave my edge, and add an L
  
 Night is so enclosed we'll never turn its page
 its eye, can be mine will be yours, to see all the people
 the underneath livid reaching part and past of the lying buildings
 the overreacher stops and starts, at in his head, in
 in her rhythm
 that knowledge is past all of us, so we flare and tap
 and top it right up, constant engage and flap in on
 keeping pace, our whelming rift, and soil and gleam
 and give back the voice, like those eary dead
  
 Step down off our whelm lessons and shortly fired
 enter the bristle strum of Corrosion Kingdom
 where the last comes by first ever ring, every
 race through that tunnel of sun drop and pencil
 in the margins of a flare, of higher wish than dare,
 the stroked calmings of a line will spin and chime
 in blue quicks of a dream blues, the chores
 of those whispering gone crenulations
  
 To meet a care is to dial redeem
 and we limp in the time sound balms
 so out of kilter is my name in the sun, and I win
 in the moon and you sing in that other spelling of win
 the way a blue is never singular





The Youngest Living Thing in L.A.
 

The youngest living thing in L. A. was my baby.
 The oldest living thing was the wind.
  
 The wind grew well in that city in the desert.
 As did my garden of well-tended cement.
 As did my baby, whom I held like a heavy statuette.
  
  
 I named him Mill at his birth  . . .  As the wheel goeth by drift of water . . .
  
  
 And he grew and the wind blew and we lived in that desert and . . . no rain. No rain, no river. No sound of water. But for--
  
 The fountain water.
  
 The official fountain. Which flowed. Every day. Every day the baby slept. The baby breathed. The fountain flowed. It flowed imperceptibly. As if its water were fast asleep.
  
  
 We stood on the fountain's shore: woman + newborn.
 We made one totem.
 I named the baby Easter Island.
  
  
 We played I Spy.

 
 I saw: coins at the fountain's bottom. Eyes. Copper cataracts, winking through the water at us.
  
  
 I held the baby close. I held the baby stiffly. I brought the baby to see nobody.
  
  
 I saw: statues in the fountain's water. Statues in tall grasses on the shore of a sea. I turned to tell somebody. The city had disappeared into complete silence. There was only: the baby.
  
  
 We were watching the water wrinkle in the wind.
 In the distance, maids were ironing.
  
  
 Overhead: jets drew ciphers in the blue with their chalk.
  
 The drift of the maker is dark.
  
  
 Beware that by the drifts thou perish not.
  
 The statues, the statues in the strange fountain were looking at us. They were weeping and turning, turning and weeping.
  
 They might have seen the city shimmering in the sun and wind, and known . . . It was a city with no one in it. If a door somewhere on the street opened, it would always be . . . no one.
  
 It would be a bad draft that had blossomed.
  
  
 I longed for meadows white with drifts of snow. I named the baby Drift.
  
 In the winter I had planned to bring him north. To a barn's eaves, to hear icicles drip. To prepare him to grow up in the path of the next great glacial drift.
  
  
 City whose sky was white jet streaks.
  
 Whose houses were apparitions of asbestos flakes.
  
 Whose homeless sipped wind from tins.
  
  
 Whose only water was the strange fountain.
  
  
 Angel, my angel, my sweetheart, wake up. See the foam on the wave, see the tornado, the hurricane.
  
  
 We stood on the fountain's shore. The wind blew particulates of rug powder, of lemon-scented floor polish. The maids of the city were cleaning so completely.
  
 And mutely.
  
 There may have been other names I gave the baby.
 Zeno sweet Zeno
  
 Little fellow little fellow
  
 Vertigo
  
  
 I said to the baby, We will stand here until there is snow on the mountain.
  
 I may have meant to say fountain.
  
 We peered all day into the strange fountain.
  
  
 I said to myself, That is just your face stiffening around your cheeks. That is just grass growing at your feet.
  
  
 I held the baby all the time, and he never ever cried.

In the Bakery
 

                                                   for Tim
It was in August, such a lovely summer, that I began the massacring.
 The flower killing. Feeding the sunflowers to the industrial dough mixer.
  
 Soon there was enough yellow petal pulp for twelve loaves.
  
 For twelve times ten loaves.
  
 For twelve hundred loaves.
  
  
 One of the food critics in town came around to inquire about my baking system.
. . . I glanced at the machete, propped next to the ovens.
  
  
 Toward October (and what auburn weather!), I still felt
 it, the substance of the soul, the libidinal terrible whatever.
  
 I sat out back with the two countergirls, Haley and Shayla. There was one cigarette, 
and we were sharing.
  
 Mourning is the horizon of all desire, we were commiserating.
  
  
 But Haley and Shayla, they're--
  
 They sell Kaiser rolls and sliced Sicilian and then they leave and put on a fancy tanktop 
and go out for the evening.
  
 They go even though--
  
 The little white clematis cling to the fences.
  
 (At dawn the buds were dying as a sweet white bread was rising.)
  
  
 November
 How beautiful were the yellow mums in the thin wintry sun!
 The bread they made had the hue of golden potatoes.
  
  
 December
 Specks of red in lit windows: amaryllis
 that I stole and slaughtered and sold inside a pain de mie roll.
  
  
 I love how in the cold, my breath flowers before me.
  
 January, February
 I hacked through the ice to get at flower fetuses. The breads were very seedy.
  
  
 Spring
 It was really beginning.
  
 Baguettes made entirely of white peonies.
  
 Brioche from the blood of purple lilacs.
  
 Long lines outside the bakery's door . . .
  
  
 What is the secret ingredient?
 I confessed: Flower. Flowers! Please, put me away. I am desperate.
  
  
 Summer
 I could not go through another.
  
 The woodbine had barely begun and already the mornings were full of the scent of 
them.
  
  
 Not one honeysuckle would go unsucked--unless--
  
  
 I closed the doors (every season is too full of longing!) and rechristened myself Flora.
 I drank a vat of rose water and put both my wrists through the slicer.
  
 And then I began to bleed--a white powder.
 Flour.
  
  
 And then you came in.
 I would have known you even if you were not wearing in your  buttonhole a carnation.
  
  
 The bakery is closed, I said tersely.
 I was bleeding profusely.
  
  
 I loved you even before you said
 Nothing breaks more slowly, more silently, than bread.
  
  
 With my blood pouring out as a fine, dry flour
 let me confess before I expire.
  
  
 There on the counter, in that vase
 fresh and pink is the corsage I was keeping for our dance.





The War
 

            Try as much as I can try not to be I, nevertheless, I would mind that so much . . . said the oats to the water . . . which was working up to a boil . . . See, I said . . . to my daughter . . . Even oats . . . even oats maybe mind the boil . . . mind becoming oatmeal . . . For there was a small matter . . . Oleg had sent me a letter . . .

I was telling her how I'd be . . . constantly . . . crossing over . . . to visit her . . . She asked . . . Will I know who you are? . . . Well not at first . . . No . . .

Once . . . when you were thirty-two . . . and in that attic apartment . . . and you . . . well . . . I understood . . . And you were cold . . . And I kissed your head . . . The top of it . . .

I must have been having a nucleolytic episode . . . in which I foresaw . . . Mom . . . I heard her . . . I was still there but already . . . in the . . . underbelly . . . ? I was thinking of a lovely girl I knew . . . Last name De Flamand . . . she once wrote a lovely piece . . . about the world daffodil . . . and the difference . . . between yellow and yellowy . . . Mom . . . How nice it was going to be . . . to fit in . . . the underneath . . . or overhead . . . what have you . . . happily! . . . It was all coming to a sharp point . . .

High and Bright and Fine and Ice
 

When the motorboat man asked me to love him
  
 I whispered precipice
 the word for the no-more-boyfriend feeling
  
 because precipice contains ice (practically twice)
 because I wanted teetering--
  
  
 What? he said
 Yes
  
 His ears from the engines--so hard of hearing--his hands always
   so hot
  
  
 Mid our first winter--I'd clung so long to the dock
 he had to crowbar my fingers off
  
 Each digit cracked so cleanly
 Would you say they break like icicles? I asked sweetly
  
  
 I knew I was nothing! But if I could sustain one song--
 I is, I is, I is I is I is
  
 I could be: ice
  
  
 Sex on the bathroom's cold marble counter was best
 I whispered statuette, monument
  
 What? he, sculpting my legs, said
  
 Yes
  
  
 The child? I named her Cecily
 It sounded like iced lily
  
  
 For pure, I said pristine
 At the ocean, I said brine
  
 Isle for vacation; for flowers, edelweiss
  
 But when I said (only of late, late!) I choose ice
 Brittle pearls broke behind my syllables
  
 Did he hear me?
 Again, twice, thrice:
  
 For my love
 we would need to live 
 in a great pyramid
 We would need to sleep
 beneath the continental shelf
 with Antarctic crust blanketing us
 The only driveway to any kind of house
 is an iceberg-ridden Northwest Passage
 When I whispered universe
 you were to translate it as
 one bright line
 one bright rime





I Too Have Been to Candyland
 

I TOO have been to Candyland, but I found myself missing the death cult.
 I missed the spectacle of the wounded bones being opened and instrumented.
  
 Bill Varner, when he was still just a boy, wrote a stunning line of Arabic verse.
 He wrote: "The crescent moon is a scimitar; the sun, a severed head.
  
 Gran cantar! and this, when he still had to keep his books in a locker!
 And he'd never even held hands with a girl--God! Penn State in the 1980s!
  
 In those days, we all sat at the feet of a pig poet, deaf in one ear. One of these
 Dreadful "white-haired lovers--oh, but he knew how to touch fire to fuse!
  
 That little stick of fire apt to launch a poetic career! But what is it now?
 Merely a billowing cloud of humidity floating out of a tree.
  
 Every turtle, snake, and bird is "born again--oh, isn't that so? The first time,
 Out the fted cloaca--and the next, through the top of the shell.
  
 The "I is Greek, the "it Italian, and Dickinson is our Ghalib. But that
 Ridiculous piece of dirt you're kissing on can never be anything but.
  
 Shut your eyes to what a worm he is, concentrate on his caress--but know
 Every half-truth is bound to call up its suppressed synoptic double.
  
 Close your eyes and moan softly, your head full of packed cotton--but know
 Every hidden camera's cockpit must one day be delivered of its black box.





The Milk One
 

HE has no gift for friendship, for he is void of all curiosity. Or rather,
 He's only interested in matters touching the Lord Hamlet himself.
  
 He was born in a lab whose walls were lined with giant, steamy jars
 Of the milk of the various mammals, from the milk of camels to the milk of men.
  
 Pig milk, monkey milk, rat milk. Dog and cat milk, and the milk of whales.
 The milk of the duck-billed platypus and that | of the platitudinous buck.
  
 The thick red milk of the vampire bat. And the black milk of the black bear.
 --A backlit wall of bottles, ranged from commonplace to rare!-- 
  
 There was stallion milk and rooster, anaconda milk and shark;
 There was tarantula milk, Venus flytrap, and that | of the barking aardvark lark.
  
 And he would have been perfectly normal, would have grown up socially adroit,
 But he stripped the sheet off a drinking straw, took a blade, and shaped a point;--
  
 And he syringed into his body a few drops from every jar,
 Fell in the floor and spoke languages he had never heard before.
  
 He spoke Titmouse. He spoke Miaow. He spoke Moo and Gnu and Ha.
 He spoke three kinds of Chickenhawk and the thirty dialects of Baa.
  
 And from that day to this, MARDUD's been lost in the zoo:
 A cautionary tale for whoever knows how to read the clues.





The Tragic Condition of the Statue of Liberty
 

                                      A collaboration with Emma Lazarus
Give me your tired, your poor,
 Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,
 The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
 Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,
 I lift my lamp beside the golden door!
 Give me your gentrificatees of the Lower East Side including all the well-heeled young Europeans who'll take apartments without leases
 Give me your landlords, give me your cooperators
 Give me the guys who sell the food and the computers to the public schools in District One
 Give me the IRS-FBI-CIA men who don't take election day off
 Give me the certain members of the school board & give me the district superintendent
 Give me all the greedy members of both american & foreign capitalist religious sects
 Give me the parents of the punk people
 Give me the guy who puts those stickers in the Rice Krispies
 Give me the doctor who thinks his time is more valuable than mine and my daughter's & the time of all the other non-doctors in this world
 Give me the mayor, his mansion, and the president & his white house
 Give me the cops who laugh and sneer at meetings where they demonstrate the new uses of mace and robots instead of the old murder against people who are being evicted
 Give me the landlord's sleazy lawyers and the deal-making judges in housing court & give me the landlord's arsonist
 Give me the known & unknown big important rich guys who now bank on our quaint neighborhood
 Give me, forgive me, the writers who have already or want to write bestsellers in this country
 Together we will go to restore Ellis Island, ravaged for years by wind, weather and vandals
 I was surprised and saddened when I heard that the Statue of Liberty was in such a serious state of disrepair & I want to help
 This is the most generous contribution I can afford.





Bright Day
 

I sing this morning: Hello, hello.
 I proclaim the bright day of the soul.
 The sun is a good fellow,
 the devil is a good guy, no deaths today I know.
 I live because I live. I do not die because I cannot die.
 In Tuscan sunlight Masaccio
 painted his belief that St. Peter's shadow
 cured a cripple, gave him back his sight.
 I've come through eighty-five summers. I walk in sunlight.
 In my garden, death questions every root, flowers reply.
 I know the dark night of the soul
 does not need God's eye,
 as a beggar does not need a hand or a bowl.





A Blind Fisherman
 

I teach my friend, a fisherman gone blind, to cast
 true left, right or center and how far
 between lily pads and the fallen cedar.
 Darkness is precious, how long will darkness last?
 Our bait, worms, have no professors, they live
 in darkness, can be taught fear of light.
 Cut into threes even sixes they live
 separate lives, recoil from light.
 He tells me, "I am seldom blind
 when I dream, morning is anthracite,
 I play blind man's bluff,
 I cannot find myself,
 my shoe, the sink,
 tell time, but that's spilled milk and ink,
 the lost and found  I cannot find.
 I can tell the difference between a mollusk and a whelk,
 a grieving liar and a lemon rind.
 Laughing, he says, "I still hope the worm will turn,
 pink, lank, and warm, dined
 out on apples of good fortune.
 Books have a faintly legible smell.
 Divorced from the sun, I am a kind
 of bachelor henpecked by the night.
 Sometimes I use my darkness well--
 in the overcast and sunlight of my mind.
 I can still wink, sing, my eyes are songs.
 Darkness is precious, how long will darkness last?
 He could not fish, he could not walk, he fell
 in his own feces. He wept. He died where he fell.
 The power of beauty to right all wrongs
 is hard for me to sell.





Poets at Lunch
 

              to W.S. Merwin
I said, "Nothing for the last time.
 You said, "Everything for the last time.
 Later I thought you made everything more
 precious with "everything for the last time:
 the last meditation, the last falling asleep,
 the last dream before the final makebelieve,
 the last kiss good night,
 the last look out the window at the last moonlight.
 Last leaves no time to hesitate.
 I would drink strong coffee before my last sleep.
 I'd rather remember childhood, rehearse forgiveness,
 listen to birdsong or a Spanish housemaid singing,
 scrubbing a tiled floor in Seville--
 I'd scrub and sing myself. O Susanna
 Susanna, quanta pena mi costi.
 I would strangle the snakes of lastness
 like Herakles in his crib
 before I cocked my ear to Mozart for the last time.
 There is not sky or clouds enough to cover
 the music I would hear for the last time.
 I know a bank whereon the wild thyme of
 everything for the last time grows, covered with
 deadly nightshade and poison hemlock.
  
 No last, no first, thinking in the moment,
 years ago, you prepared the soil in Hawaii
 before you planted your palm trees, then shared
 most of your days and nights with them as equals.
 You built your house with a Zen room.
 I made no prayer when I dug a hole
 and pushed in a twelve-foot white pine,
 root ball locked in green plastic netting.
 I did not cut the netting, so twenty years later
 a tall, beautiful, white pine died.
 I lynched the roots. To save my life
 I would let them seize, cut out a bear's heart,
 I would partake in its flesh.
 But you would die before you'd let them kill that bear.
 Again, I say, "Nothing for the last time.
 You say, "Everything for the last time.
 Sailor, I would have killed a stranger
 to save the world. Sailor, you would not.
 We kissed goodbye on the cheek.
 I hope not for the last time.
  
 Home, I look into my brass telescope--
 at the far end, where the moon and distant stars
 should be, I see my eye looking back at me,
 it's twinkling and winking like a star. I go to bed.
 My dogs, donkeys and wife are sleeping. I am safe.
 You are home with your wife
 you met and decided to marry in four days.





If a Garden of Numbers
 

If a garden is the world counted
                                                            and found analogue in nature
 One does not become two by ever ending
                                                                            so the stairs must be uneven in number
 and not exceed
 thirteen without a pause
 of two paces' width, which
                                                  for instance, the golden section
                             mitigates between abandon
 and an orchestra just behind those trees,
 gradations of green that take a stethoscope: we risk:
 Length over width
                                   to make the horizon run straight
 equals
             to make the pond an oval:
                                                             Width
                                                             over length minus the width
                               in which descending circles curl
 into animals exact as a remainder.
  
                               Which means excess. The meaning of the real
 always exceeds that of the ideal, said someone.
                                                                                       He was speaking of Vaux-le-Vicomte,
 but it's equally true of parking, or hunting, or wishing you could take it back. He
  
                               who is Allen Weiss, actually said, "The meaning
 of a plastic or pictorial construct always surpasses the ideal meaning of that work.
 Which is something else entirely. Said
 the axonometric
 divided by
 the anamorphic.
                                There is nothing that controls our thoughts
 more than what we think we see,
 which we label "we.





Disarmed
 

I should be diligent and firm,
I know I should, and frowning, too;
again you've failed to clean your room.
Not only that, the evidence
of midnight theft is in your bed--
cracked peanut shells and m&m's
are crumbled where you rest your head,
and just above, the windowsill
is crowded with a green giraffe
(who's peering through your telescope),
some dominoes, and half a glass
of orange juice. You hungry child,

how could I be uncharmed by this,
your secret world, your happy mess?





Absences
 

"Even when you are not in a room, you are in it, your voice everywhere. Bill Holm
        "Even when you are not in a room, 
        you are in it, your voice everywhere.  Bill Holm

The message that's recorded on the phone
is unmistakably bad news, and then
another call tells us it's one we love--
a sudden death while traveling, somehow
appropriate for one who always
seized life too completely to stand still.

A door slams shut, a wall has dropped away, 
and once again I'm driven back to
empty pages, insufficient words,
to rooms he always filled on entering--
rooms lined with books, piano music, and
good friends who raise their glasses one last time.

And now, as all the lights are blinking off
in every prairie town we've ever loved,
when all the toasts are made and songs are sung,
when leaving is the only certainty,
a single voice keeps echoing, along
each dark, untraveled hallway of the heart.





Marriage
 

When you are angry it's your gentle self
I love until that's who you are.
In any case, I can't love this anger any more
than I can warm my heart with ice.
I go on loving your smile
till it finds its way back to your face.





Vision Test
 

The brain, like the earth, lies in layers.
Floaters dart and punch. I see the field. 
My face stays numb. Keep your eye on the target.
Click the button when a light appears.
Last night I read "So little evidence is left
of what had vanished. I can't always follow directions.
The tumor pressed a lobe, charging
the amygdala, emotional core of the self.
In school they taught us that soil covers core
and mantle; mythology explains creation
and change. Now age drapes childhood;
my hair, the incision. I see a light but forget
to click. I didn't remember dreams for a year. 
How I've changed may not be apparent.





In the Black Camaro
 

Through the orange glow of taillights,   
I crossed the dirt road, entered 
the half-mile of darkness and owl screech,   
tangled briar and fallen trunk, followed 
the yellow beam of Billy Parker's flashlight   
down the slick needle-hill, 
half crawling, half sliding and kicking   
for footholds, tearing up whole handfuls   
of scrub brush and leaf mold 
until I jumped the mud bank, walked   
the ankle-deep creek, 
the last patch of pine, the gully,   
and knelt at the highway stretching   
in front of Billy Parker's house, 
spotted the black Chevy Camaro parked   
under a maple not fifty feet 
from the window where Billy Parker rocked   
in and out of view, 
studying in the bad light of a table lamp   
the fine print of his Allstate policy.   
I cut the flashlight, checked up   
and down the highway. Behind me   
the screech growing distant, fading   
into woods, but coming on 
a network of tree frogs signaling 
along the creek. Only that, and the quiet   
of my heels coming down on asphalt   
as I crossed the two-lane and stood 
at the weedy edge of Billy Parker's yard,   
stood in the lamp glare of the living room   
where plans were being made to make me rich   
and thought of a boat and Johnson outboard,   
of all the lures on a K-Mart wall,   
of reels and graphite rods, coolers 
of beer, weedy banks of dark fishy rivers,   
and of Billy Parker rocking in his chair,   
studying his coverage, his bank account,   
his layoff at Lockheed, his wife laboring   
in the maternity ward 
of the Cobb General Hospital. For all   
of this, I crouched in the shadow 
of fender and maple, popped the door   
on the Camaro, and found 
in the faint house-light drifting 
through the passenger's window 
the stripped wires hanging below the dash.   
I took the driver's seat, kicked 
the clutch, then eased again 
as I remembered the glove box 
and the pint of Seagram's Billy Parker   
had not broken the seal on. Like an alarm   
the tree frogs went off in the woods.   
I drank until they hushed 
and I could hear through cricket chatter   
the rockers on Billy Parker's chair   
grinding ridges into his living room floor,   
worry working on him like hard time.   
Then a wind working in river grass,   
a red current slicing 
around stumps and river snags, a boat-drift   
pulling against an anchor 
as I swayed in the seat of the black Camaro,   
grappled for the wires 
hanging in darkness between my knees,   
saw through the tinted windshield   
by a sudden white moon 
rolling out of the clouds, a riverbank 
two counties away, a place to jump and roll   
on the soft shoulder of the gravel road,   
a truck in a thicket a half-mile downstream. 






In Extremis
 


You don't get everything back.
Is today morning or night? The radio voice says
the composer is changing the place home is. 
When they try to put a tube down her throat, 
the woman beside me sobs. Nurses probe
a vein as she thrashes, call the Hmong translator.

Once a boy told me, in Laos he sat in a tree 
all night. Father pay me dollar for every man I'm shooting. 
When there's water to cross, the fish, caught,
get needled through gill slits. Down the dark hall,
machines bleat at each bed. Eyes open and shut: flashes,
detachment, vitreous gel. Her son, seven years old,
comes after school, peels oranges, watches football, 
changing the place home is.





Survivors Guilt
 


How I've changed may not be apparent.
I limp. Read and write, make tea at the stove
as I practiced in rehab. Sometimes, like fire, 
a task overwhelms me. I cry for days, shriek 
when the phone rings. Like a page pulled from flame,
I'm singed but intact: I don't burn down the house.

Later, cleared to drive, I did outpatient rehab. Others
lost legs or clutched withered minds in their hands.
A man who can't speak recognized me
and held up his finger. I knew he meant 
One year since your surgery. Sixteen since his.
Guadalupe wishes daily to be the one before. Nobody
is that. Sometimes, like love, the neurons just cross fire.
You don't get everything back.







Wisconsin
 


By new names
and then no names
at all, their laws
will reach your land,

Lorine, to feed
on your much loved
marshy spaces
whose occasional faces

discern a stranger
from far off
but like to take
a break from well

or welding just
to talk. We can-
not extricate
a place from those

it's made of, the sounds 
it makes. But now
from Blackhawk
Island to Madison

to Washington,
geologies
thin; more things 
sound or work

the same. Their laws 
will reach your land, 
Lorine, by new names
then no names at all.





Work
 


It hides its edges
in speed, it has
no edges. Plus every time
he thinks he knows

it close enough, can discriminate
centripetal force
from what gets sheared
straight off,

direction changes:
through stunned space the blade
snaps back,
turtles into its handle

and starts over spinning 
the other way. 
All along the chopped-up sidewalk 
(the need to keep 

breaking what we make
to keep making)
the concrete saw 
plunges and resurfaces,

precise as a skull;
it glints against 
the small smoke
of its own work.





The Wooden Overcoat
 


It turns out there's a difference between a detail
and an image. If the dandelion on the sidewalk is
mere detail, the dandelion inked on a friend's bicep
is an image because it moves when her body does,

even when a shirt covers the little thorny black sun
on a thin stalk. The same way that the bar code
on the back of another friend's neck is just a detail,
until you hear that the row of numbers underneath

are the numbers his grandfather got on his arm
in a camp in Poland. Then it's an image, something
activated in the reader's senses beyond mere fact.
I know the difference doesn't matter, except in poetry,

where a coffin is just another coffin until someone
at a funeral calls it a wooden overcoat, an image
so heavy and warm at the same time that you forget
it's about death. At my uncle's funeral, the coffin

was so beautiful it was like the chandelier lighting
the room where treaties are signed. It made me think
of how loved he was. It made me think of Shoshone
funerals, where everything the dead person owned

was put into a bonfire, even the horse. In that last
sentence, is the horse a detail or an image? I don't 
really know. In my mind, a horse is never anywhere 
near a fire, and a detail is as luminous as an image.

The trumpet vine on the sagging fence. The clothes
in the fire. And each tattoo that I touch on your back:
the three-part illustration of how to use chopsticks,
the four-leaf clover, the clock face stopped at 12:05.





Bad Sheep
 


Midnight's merely blue,
but me, me, me, I'm 
through 
and through 
sloe, cracked soot-
on-a-boot, 
nicotine spat, licorice whip. 
You can scratch, scratch, scratch 
but I stay underskin true 
to ebony, ink, crowberry, pitch;
hoist me up by my hooves 
and shake till I'm shook, I'm still 
chock full of coke, fuliginous 
murk.
O there's swart in my soul,
coal by the bag, 
cinders and slag, 
scoriac grit, so please
come, comb 
through my fleece with hands pallid 
as snow and watch 
how they grow tarry, raven, 
stygian, ashed-- 
or, if you wish, clean me with bleach
I won't 
flinch, just char 
down to a core of caliginous 
marrow,
pure carbon, atramentous,
utterly piceous, 
shadowed, and starless,
each clumpity clump 
and eclipse of my heart raptly 
re-burnishing 
a woolgather dark.





In Colorado My Father Scoured and Stacked Dishes
 


in a Tex-Mex restaurant. His co-workers,
unable to utter his name, renamed him Jalapeo. 

If I ask for a goldfish, he spits a glob of phlegm 
into a jar of water. The silver letters 

on his black belt spell Sangrn. Once, borracho, 
at dinner, he said: Jesus wasn't a snowman. 

Arriba Durango. Arriba Orizaba. Packed 
into a car trunk, he was smuggled into the States. 

Frijolero. Greaser. In Tucson he branded 
cattle. He slept in a stable. The horse blankets 

oddly fragrant: wood smoke, lilac. He's an illegal. 
I'm an Illegal-American. Once, in a grove 

of saguaro, at dusk, I slept next to him. I woke 
with his thumb in my mouth. No qu no 

tronabas, pistolita? He learned English 
by listening to the radio. The first four words 

he memorized: In God We Trust. The fifth: 
Percolate. Again and again I borrow his clothes. 

He calls me Scarecrow. In Oregon he picked apples. 
Braeburn. Jonagold. Cameo. Nightly, 

to entertain his cuates, around a campfire, 
he strummed a guitarra, sang corridos. Arriba 

Durango. Arriba Orizaba. Packed into 
a car trunk, he was smuggled into the States. 

Greaser. Beaner. Once, borracho, at breakfast, 
he said: The heart can only be broken 

once, like a window. No mames! His favorite 
belt buckle: an guila perched on a nopal. 

If he laughs out loud, his hands tremble. 
Bugs Bunny wants to deport him. Csar Chvez 

wants to deport him. When I walk through 
the desert, I wear his shirt. The gaze of the moon 

stitches the buttons of his shirt to my skin. 
The snake hisses. The snake is torn.





A Magnetic Personality
 


marc-antonizes.
Somehow it organizes
the mob--like so
much lead--into rank
and file. Somehow
it stands us 
rabble up and makes
a row of men stiffen
or a rose of lead filings 
arise. A rose is a rose
that arose, a magnetic
personality very
nearly said. She knew
how to draw
this one painter
to her place in Paris
and make him something
greater. (She knew
how to cube him.) 
But the magnetic 
can turn on
a dime and go
all red like a face
of a Rubik's Cube. 
In fact, its flip
side can repel what it
once sucked in--
all those friends,
Romans, countrymen,
cubists.





John Hancocks John Hancock
 


makes wind
the way it whirls
about and blows
the neighboring names
of other signatories
away. The point
of it is not
the John or Jane
Doe it names;
the point's the quill
in motion as if
still stuck 
and aquiver in 
goose skin. 
The trick to writing
well isn't up
the sleeve. It is 
the sleeve
that fluffs up 
the flourish,
that blooms around
the stunted stamens
of the fingers
and distracts us
from our grasping
for the sun
or the uncertain
scratching
of the stylus.





Snow Tiger
 


Ghost sun half
hidden, where did you go?

There's always a mother
of some other creature
born to fight for her young.

But crawl out of your hide,
walk upright like a man,
& you may ask if hunger is the only passion
as you again lose yourself
in a white field's point of view.

In this glacial quiet
nothing moves except--
then a flash of eyes & nerves.

If cornered in your head by cries from a cave
in another season, you can't forget
in this landscape a pretty horse
translates into a man holding a gun.





Islands
 

For Derek Walcott

An island is one great eye
    gazing out, a beckoning lighthouse,
searchlight, a wishbone compass,
    or counterweight to the stars.
When it comes to outlook & point
    of view, a figure stands on a rocky ledge
peering out toward an archipelago
    of glass on the mainland, a seagull's
wings touching the tip of a high wave,
    out to where the brain may stumble.

But when a mind climbs down
    from its high craggy lookout
we know it is truly a stubborn thing,
    & has to leaf through pages of dust
& light, through pre-memory & folklore,
    remembering fires roared down there
till they pushed up through the seafloor
    & plumes of ash covered the dead 
shaken awake worlds away, & silence
    filled up with centuries of waiting.

Sea urchin, turtle, & crab
    came with earthly know-how,
& one bird arrived with a sprig in its beak,
    before everything clouded with cries,
a millennium of small deaths now topsoil
    & seasons of blossoms in a single seed.
Light edged along salt-crusted stones,
    across a cataract of blue water,
& lost sailors' parrots spoke of sirens, 
    the last words of men buried at sea.

Someone could stand here
    contemplating the future, leafing
through torn pages of St. Augustine
    or the prophecies by fishermen,
translating spore & folly down to taproot.
    The dreamy-eyed boy still in the man,
the girl in the woman, a sunny forecast
    behind today, but tomorrow's beyond
words. To behold a body of water
    is to know pig iron & mother wit. 

Whoever this figure is,
    he will soon return to dancing 
through the aroma of dagger's log,
    ginger lily, & bougainvillea,
between chants & strings struck
    till gourds rally the healing air,
& till the church-steeple birds
    fly sweet darkness home.
Whoever this friend or lover is,
    he intones redemptive harmonies. 

To lie down in remembrance
    is to know each of us is a prodigal
son or daughter, looking out beyond land
    & sky, the chemical & metaphysical
beyond falling & turning waterwheels
    in the colossal brain of damnable gods,
a Eureka held up to the sun's blinding eye,
    born to gaze into fire. After conquering
frontiers, the mind comes back to rest, 
    stretching out over the white sand.





The Arch
 

Of all living monuments has the fewest
facts attached to it, they slide right off
its surface, no Lincoln lap for them to sit
on and no horse to be astride. Here is what
                                                 I know for sure:

Was a gift from one city to another. A city
cannot travel to another city, a city cannot visit 
any city but itself, and in its sadness it gives
        away a great door in the air. Well 
        a city cannot except for Paris, who puts
on a hat styled with pigeon wings and walks
through the streets of another city and will not
even see the sights, too full she is of the sights
already. And within her walk her women, 
        and the women of Paris looking like 
        they just walked through an Arch...

        Or am I mixing it up I think I am 
with another famous female statue? Born
in its shadow and shook-foil hot the facts
slid off me also. I and the Arch we burned
to the touch. "Don't touch that Arch a boy
we know got third-degree burns from touch-
        ing that Arch, says my mother sitting
for her statue. She is metal on a hilltop and
so sad she isn't a Cross. She was long ago
given to us by Ireland. What an underhand
        gift for an elsewhere to give, a door 
that reminds you you can leave it. She raises
        her arm to brush my hair. Oh no female
armpit lovelier than the armpit of the Arch.







Nulla Dies Sine Linea
 

On my birthday

A crow guffaws, dirty man throwing the punch of his 
one joke. And now, nearer, a murder 

answers, chortling from the pale hill's brow. 
From under my lashes' wings they stretch 

clawed feet. There the unflappable years 
perch and stare. When I squint, when I 

grin, my new old face nearly hops 
off my old new face. Considering what's flown, 

what might yet fly, I lean my chin 
on the palm where my half-cashed fortune lies.





The Breeders Cup
 

I. TO THE FATES

They cannot keep the peace
or their hands off each other,
breed not yet preach 
the old discredited creed.

Love is charity conceived 
as a coin dropped 
in a beggar's cup.
Reason not the need. 

Gluttony is no nicer than greed
or wrath, but lust
is our categorical must.
We have no choice but to breed.

 II. OLYMPIA
Olympia lies on her couch
with an insolent stare,
her hand hiding her crotch,
a flower in her hair.

She splits the lot of us with a sneer: 
we are either breeders or queer.
We will fight wars because of her.
She will root us on. We will win.

The face in the mirror is not brave,
but we crave contact with her skin
and the jewel in the mouth of her cave.
She tempts like a sin

and under her spell we fall
into a deep enchanted sleep,
and wake up ready to make the leap,
ready to heed her call,

only now we're alone,
on streets less friendly than wilderness,
a platoon of ex-pals in Manhattan.
Olympia tempts like a sin,

but then sends us home to the wife,
commands us to resume the life
we had planned to give up in her honor:
the life of a dutiful husband, a modest success

in his profession, impressive 
in credentials, in mood depressive
(but nothing that a pill won't cure).
You ask if he is happy? "Sure.

And Olympia lies on her couch,
with her insolent stare,
her hand hiding her crotch,
a flower in her hair.





Bemidji Blues
 

For Arnold Rampersad 

Shadows bluing the snow, the pines' and mine, 
bear the cast of a kestrel's blue-gray crown 
I note as I find my way about this town. 

Blues here more likely the Nordic-eyes kind 
than the blue-black of some Black folk back home.
Here so many lakes reflect the sky's blue dome; 

some summer days skimmed-milk blue tints windblown 
whitecaps. Blue's an adjective, verb, and noun, 
and the color of the world when I pine 

because she's gone leaving too much wine and time. 
Blue shadows on the snow, mine and the pines'. 
For a tall man, blue ox, and now me, home 

is Bemidji, though the blues here around 
more the cast of a kestrel's blue-gray crown 
than the blue-black of my cousins back home.





Six Lines for Louise Bogan
 

All that has tamed me I have learned to love
        and lost that wildness that was once beloved.

All that was loved I've learned to tame
        and lost the beloved that once was wild.

All that is wild is tamed by love--
        and the beloved (wildness) that once was loved.





You Cant Build a Child
 

with the medicinal poppies of June
nor with Celan's bloom-fest of dredged stone, 
      not with history's choo-choo train of corpses,
    not with Nottingham's Robin Hood 
            nor Antwerp's Diamondland.

Not walking on the Strand in Manhattan Beach with her
      silicone breast implants, refinery, waves of trash,
        not out of the Library of Alexandria 
            with her burnt gardens that prefigure gnarly,
        barnacle-laden surfboards broken in half. 

You can't build the child with the stone paths 
        that we have walked on through the atmosphere,
            the pirate's plank, the diving board, the plunge,
          nor with the moon whether 
                she be zombie or vampire.
        Not with Delphi, not with fangs, or cardamom bought
                in Fez, red with spring, red with
                    marathon running cheeks.

            Not with monk chant, bomb chant, 
        war paint, not with the gigantic Zen pleasure zones, 
                nor with this harnessed pig 
        on the carousel that I am sitting on with my son 
                in Nice, France. How it burns on its axis
            as if it were turning into pineapple-colored kerosene 
        the way the Hawaiian pig, apple in snout, roasts 
            in its own tropical meat under the countdown sun.





Once upon a Time
 

Once upon a time,
There was a beautiful shark.
She combed her long, blonde hair,
And it made the halibut bark.

It made the chicken oink,
And the whale to run for Congress.
A man should never obstruct
The course of material progress.

Yet a lamb cannot but weep
When the kiddies come home from college.
For they have forgotten to keep
The agreement they made to acknowledge

The woodpecker's right to peck,
And the maple's to be pecked at.
Let's have a little respect
For Rubber Duck with a doctorate.  

That provocative way of standing!
All elbows and bangles
And hips just like a coat hanger
And ankles at right angles! I like 

The shape of the pouring soy milk,
The sound of the splitting log.
But Egret finds it regrettable that her
Sister is dating a dog.

Don't listen to 'em, kid!
And don't listen to their questions.
This corporation's been ruined by
Well-meaning false confessions.

And the world is fast a-melting,
Though I would have it slow.
And I don't think it's helping:
The way these animals go

Straight from hatchery to quackery,
And, if only to amuse,
I'll throw my hat in with Mike Thataway in
Black patent leather shoes.

Maybe I'm just like my mother.
She's never satisfied.
Maybe I'm just like my father:
Always a bridesmaid, never a bride.

Maybe I'm just like my cat:
Licking invisible balls.
Perhaps you'll reflect upon that, 
Next time you're screening your calls.

And all the solvent and the solute,
They were walking hand in hand.
This the Indian poets were the
First to understand.

The ancient Indian poets
Had their heads screwed on straight.
Fixed on the body's affluence
And the effluents that escape.

And the influence they enjoyed?
Close-focus hocus-pocus.
And every gezunte moyd
In a juvenile honey locust

Will prefer their Hindi distichs
To the Indiana Hoosiers.
We're gonna be there from Spit Christmas
All the way to Mucus New Year's.

But for now I draw the curtain
And settle into Lent.
Last person to go to Harvard
Without knowing what that meant.





Horse Apocalypse
 

Hrhm Shp, colt-culling,
Is what hoof lore calls it--
The choke-chain sound a roan coined
To describe the things he saw
Before the sniff weevils crept 
Up his nostrils and chewed
His eyes at the hue-sweet root.

                      

Mother mares scare foals
From folly-trots and foxglove
By telling them fury tales
Of muck stirrup-deep and shells
Shoveling Passchendaele
Onto Passchendaele,
The foal fallen with the boy.

                      

One memory, common
To all breeds, spurs night mares
Sparking down the mute streets
Of their sleep, gas-blind
Witnesses scraping Krupp
Guns over the cobblestones,
Winged sparks breeding in the hay.

                      

Having watched us box and ditch 
Our dead, they thought our dead
Ate termite-runnels
In the black bark of the land
And pulled all horsefolk down
To join whatever dark cavalry
Thundered underground.

                      

The burlap gas mask cupped
And strapped to the wet snout
Could be mistaken, when
The gas gong sounded
And the men grew fly-heads, 
For a feed sack chock- 
Full of red ants.





Song-Riddle: Asian Box Turtle
 

Questions for a zoologist
starting with anatomy
        concluding with love:

Is a turtle's skin loaned? 
True or false: weight of his shell 
        is lighter 
        than the light of drums. 

What is the under-shell 
and is it tough as a mangrove? 

Can he see through his shell-box?
Can he see out the rear 
                        to this sea of ours? 

Does he exist in the order of things? 
How does life begin, when does it end
            and is that good or evil?

Yellow margin over a cuttlebone, 
domed carapace
        is it a lonely world

of sow bugs, cutworms, and God?





Song of the Oyamel
 

On the other side of this door

You are an oyamel native to the mountains of Mexico

Rising in a cloud forest of sister evergreens
Shedding pollen cones, shedding winged seeds

Our lost wings 
                    singly and in pairs.

This is why the monarchs vanish    
Raising sienna-hued colonies longer than my arms

Hibernating in Mexico where it's hotter in January
                than my front yard, where the red bougainvillea raves

And magnolias             with a mauve rush on paper
And open as though thinking about last year's novels

Read over the shoulders of garden-strollers 

Obey the apostle's exhortation 
And do everything in love.





Little Ice Age
 

I have one good memory--a total 

Eclipse of the sun--when out of brilliance 

Dusk came swiftly and on the whole 

At seven years it felt good on a summer afternoon 

To be outrun by a horse from another century--

The next morning I washed up 

On land like a pod of seals 

Struck with a longing for dark at noon--

If the cessation of feeling is temporary

It resembles sleep--if permanent, it resembles

A little ice age--and the end of some 

Crewelwork by a mother who put honey

Into my hands so the bees would love me.







Still Life
 

I'm having trouble looking animals in the eye.

Their empty suits in outer space!

Monkeys injected with a virus to show off 

Our eminent domain, the nervous system.

Teacup pigs we breed and obsessive mice  

Worrying themselves bald in a miniature opera.

For pleasures of the tongue we are

Winking cattle out of meadows 

Slashing their throats and swiftly quartering them.

In riding habits with gold flame pins we ride horses

To hounds, chase a fennec fox until his red

Coat flares up against the extinction 

Of light. Once in a circus we made

An elephant disappear and he did not mind.

Dear Writers, I'm compiling the first in what I hope is a series of publications I'm calling artists among artists. The theme for issue 1 is "Faggot Dinosaur. I hope to hear from you! Thank you and best wishes.  
 
                                                                                        --Ali, editor, Artists among Artists
 

I think that I shall never fear
a brontosaurus that is queer,

iguanodon as fetisheer,
a mammoth bringing up the rear,
an astrodon with extra gear,

metrosexual squirrel and deer, 
a breeder with a dance career,
a fruit with cauliflower ear, 

a lesbianic Chanticleer,
a grinning limpish-wristed Lear,
the weird one or the mutineer, 

but those who perfectly adhere,
stay clear, stay clear, stay clear, stay clear.





Reunion: J-School, Class of 19--
 

Cutlery clatters into the sink. 
But always the characters, uniquely themselves,
only some decades older. They search
for their coats. You were, she reminds him,
our resident nomad, come to pitch your tent 
here, sidewalks for sand, unaccustomed taboos: 
Morningside Heights, one of your lives.
                                        Thirty years 
since the awkward goodbye? Before he goes--
East Africa his beat, Germany hers--he'll
visit the nephew, the namesake in Boston
who drives a cab, sends a pittance each month 
to a wellhead in--we'll call it Sudan. 
He explains how it works, this drip feed
of cash to Sudan from the United States: 
cheap, fast. She's not clear about this--he jots 
her a website: it's a place she can go. 
So they won't meet again...suddenly
Can you forgive me? he blurts--
a classmate's apartment, Upper West Side,
the grown child's room, bears
in tidy shrines, scrum of sloughed coats. 
In the kitchen friends wash up. Sound
of laughter. Sound of water flowing
out of a tap. Yes, she replies, shocked
by the twinge, then ache, of remorse.
She "forgot? And him--thirty years--
the place still hurts? It's myself I can't forgive,
she knows later. Right now, vague shame. 
End of March. Maybe April. Street trees
are trying to bloom. The irretrievable
sits on the table, white as a plate. He holds her
her coat.





Hook
 

One year a general
packs the dead arithmetic in a drawer--
all the subtractions, divisions.
The next year, vines cover the bunkers.
The brain resumes its starbursts of rehearsal.
The heart leaps under the defibrillator.
The bone eases into its socket.
Skin grows back. Scars fade. Eyes clear.
Look at the trees at the burn, six years later.
Look at the sprout on a hay bale
on a truck. Look at the woman who was raped,
had her hands cut off in a creek:
She's getting married.
The choir sings. The bride smiles.
The groom slips a ring on her hook.





Numbered
 

The girl was known for shitting in her yard.  
I did so little for her.  She was small, a dandelion orb 
with ragged hair like an old woman's burnt from dye.  
Her face showed little sign of poverty--
it was her dusty shoes cut open at the top that told.
A bone look she'd mastered young, yet the curve 
of her face was edible, like a rounded sparrow in hand.  
She wasn't mean, but did what she wanted--quietly, 
with a lift to her chin, while I struggled to teach her anything. 
I'd like to say I brushed her brittle hair, called her beautiful, 
coaxed out sight words that dawdled on her tongue.   
I dream of her spinning like a fairy dervish in my failure.  
Consider this a prayer, a foolish one.





Wreaths
 

This poem originally appeared in the May 1957 issue of Poetry. See it in its original context. 





Song
 

Make and be eaten, the poet says,
Lie in the arms of nightlong fire,
To celebrate the waking, wake.
Burn in the daylong light; and praise
Even the mother unappeased,
Even the fathers of desire.

Blind go the days, but joy will see 
Agreements of music; they will wind 
The shaking of your dance; no more 
Will the ambiguous arm-waves spell 
Confusion of the blessing given. 

Only and finally declare 
Among the purest shapes of grace 
The waking of the face of fire, 
The body of waking and the skill 
To make your body such a shape 
That all the eyes of hope shall stare. 

That all the cries of fear shall know, 
Staring in their bird-pierced song; 
Lines of such penetration make 
That shall bind our loves at last. 
Then from the mountains of the lost, 
All the fantasies shall wake, 
Strong and real and speaking turn 
Wherever flickers your unreal. 

And my strong ghosts shall fade and pass 
My love start fiery as grass 
Wherever burn my fantasies, 
Wherever burn my fantasies.

April 1955





Song for Dead Children
 

We set great wreaths of brightness on the graves of the passionate 
who required tribute of hot July flowers-- 
for you, O brittle-hearted, we bring offering 
remembering how your wrists were thin and your delicate bones 
not yet braced for conquering. 

The sharp cries of ghost-boys are keen above the meadows, 
and little girls continue graceful and wondering. 
Flickering evening on the lakes recalls those young 
heirs whose developing years have sunk to earth, 
their strength not tested, their praise unsung. 

Weave grasses for their childhood--who will never see 
love or disaster or take sides against decay 
balancing the choices of maturity. 
Silent and coffined in silence while we pass 
loud in defiance of death, the helpless lie. 


October 1935





Gay Chaps at the Bar

Political Reflection
 

loquitur the sparrow in the Zoo

 No bars are set too close, no mesh too fine 
To keep me from the eagle and the lion, 
Whom keepers feed that I may freely dine. 
This goes to show that if you have the wit 
To be small, common, cute, and live on shit, 
Though the cage fret kings, you may make free with it.

September 1956





To the Mannequins
 

Adorable images, 
Plaster of Paris 
Lilies of the field, 
You are not alive, therefore 
Pathos will be out of place. 

But I have learned 
A strange fact about your fate, 
And it is this: 

After you go out of fashion 
Beneath your many fashions, 
Or when your elbows and knees 
Have been bruised powdery white, 
So that you are no good to anybody-- 

They will take away your gowns, 
Your sables and bathing suits, 
Leaving exposed before all men 
Your inaccessible bellies 
And pointless nubilities. 

Movers will come by night 
And load you all into trucks
And take you away to the Camps, 
Where soldiers, or the State Police, 
Will use you as targets 
For small-arms practice, 

Leading me to inquire, 
Since pathos is out of place, 
What it is that they are practicing.

Signature Song
 

Bunny Berigan first recorded "I Can't Get Started
with a small group that included Joe Bushkin, Cozy Cole
and Artie Shaw in 1936.
Earlier that same year, the song,
written by Ira Gershwin and Vernon Duke,
and rendered as a duet patter number by Bob Hope and Eve
Arden, made its debut on Broadway in The Ziegfeld Follies. 
By 1937, when Berigan re-recorded it in a big-band setting,
"I Can't had become his signature song, 
even though, within a few months, Billie Holiday would record
her astonishing version backed
by Lester Young and the rest of the Basie Orchestra.
 
Lovers for a time, Lee Wiley and Berigan began appearing
together on Wiley's fifteen-minute CBS radio spot,
Saturday Night Swing Club, in 1936.
Berigan died from alcoholism-related causes on June 2, 1942.
Although "I Can't Get Started is perfectly suited to Wiley's
deep phrasing and succinct vibrato, she recorded the ballad only
once, informally, in 1945, during a Town Hall performance date.
The Spanish Civil War started in 1936 and ended in 1939
with Generalissimo Francisco Franco's forces entering Madrid.
"I've settled revolutions in Spain goes Gershwin's lyric, just as odd.





[During the Second World War . . .]
 

During the Second World War, I was going home one night
along a street I seldom used. All the stores were closed
except one--a small fruit store.
An old Italian was inside to wait on customers.
As I was paying him I saw that he was sad.
"You are sad, I said. "What is troubling you?
"Yes, he said, "I am sad. Then he added
in the same monotone, not looking at me:
"My son left for the front today and I'll never see him again.
"Don't say that! I said. "Of course, you will!
"No, he answered. "I'll never see him again.
 
Afterwards, when the war was over,
I found myself once more in that street 
and again it was late at night, dark and lonely;
and again I saw the old man alone in the store.
I bought some apples and looked closely at him:
his thin wrinkled face was grim
but not particularly sad. "How about your son? I said.
"Did he come back from the war? "Yes, he answered.
"He was not wounded? "No. He is all right.
"That's fine, I said. "Fine!
He took the bag of apples from my hands and groping inside
took out one that had begun to rot
and put in a good one instead.
"He came back at Christmas, he added.
"How wonderful! That was wonderful!
"Yes, he said gently, "it was wonderful.
He took the bag of apples from my hands again
and took out one of the smaller apples and put in a large one.





Charlie Howards Descent
 

Between the bridge and the river
 he falls through
 a huge portion of night;
 it is not as if falling

 is something new. Over and over
 he slipped into the gulf
 between what he knew and how
 he was known. What others wanted

 opened like an abyss: the laughing
 stock-clerks at the grocery, women
 at the luncheonette amused by his gestures.
 What could he do, live

 with one hand tied
 behind his back? So he began to fall
 into the star-faced section
 of night between the trestle

 and the water because he could not meet
 a little town's demands,
 and his earrings shone and his wrists
 were as limp as they were.

 I imagine he took the insults in
 and made of them a place to live;
 we learn to use the names
 because they are there,

 familiar furniture: faggot
 was the bed he slept in, hard
 and white, but simple somehow,
 queer something sharp

 but finally useful, a tool,
 all the jokes a chair,
 stiff-backed to keep the spine straight,
 a table, a lamp. And because

 he's fallen for twenty-three years,
 despite whatever awkwardness
 his flailing arms and legs assume
 he is beautiful

 and like any good diver
 has only an edge of fear
 he transforms into grace.
 Or else he is not afraid,

 and in this way climbs back
 up the ladder of his fall,
 out of the river into the arms
 of the three teenage boys

who hurled him from the edge--
 really boys now, afraid,
 their fathers' cars shivering behind them,
 headlights on--and tells them

 it's all right, that he knows
 they didn't believe him
 when he said he couldn't swim,
 and blesses his killers

 in the way that only the dead
 can afford to forgive.





Omens
 

Her eyelids were painted blue.
When she closed her eyes the sea
rolled in like ten thousand fiery chariots,

leaving behind silence above & below
a thousand years old. He stood beneath
a high arched window, gazing out

at fishing boats beyond the dikes, their nets
unfurled, their offshore gestures
a dance of living in bluish entourage.

He was only the court's chief jester.
What he said & did made them laugh,
but lately what he sometimes thought he knew

could cost him his polished tongue & royal wig.
He was the masked fool unmasking the emperor.
Forget the revelation. Forget the briny sea.

He had seen the ravishing empress naked
in a forbidden pose. Her blue eye shadow.
Aquamarine shells crusted with wormy mud. 

Anyway, if he said half of what was foretold,
the great one would become a weeping boy
slumped beneath the Pillars of Hercules. 







Coming of the August Grandchild
 

Not even the males and the men of the males
make use of their pinched tongues
to sing, not even the females
and the women of the females, corollas stemmed to spray on end
sing their ruddy stones
 
 
The males and the men of the males
feel the sea
the ranch and the wheat, rice ears
 
 
polyglottal weddings
                                      unseasonable lips
 
                     one body to the next
 
 
Indigenes displaced by indigenes displaced
wherein the ranchlands, then the fields of wheat, burn to the crust
 
 
The choice between taking the flowers-of-the-trees-
to-blossom and the long-as-the-rocks
always lands on the flowers-of-the-trees-
to blossom--
 
                               bouquet thrown hurriedly into the sun





The Pond Museum
 

The fenestrate surface of the pond
surfaces in old companions     snag ripples
namely, Saburo
 
 
I recommend his face for the pond museum
above the fox's skulking face
the hare's face, death's polished stone
the crane's     larval pearl
eyes transmitting the code for a sodden voice
in the splintering reeds
 
 
And when I say I recommend
I mean the menagerie in the utmost dark
saviors hung from supping trees
gone the way of idiot flesh--where you
were endowed with a chance, and fucked up
 
 
Evening, I went down
on the pantry, pried open
a basket of rice cakes, grew
partial to eating in the dark
if only to concentrate the sound
of walking through the wilderness
at night, enlarged
without people
as wax I sleep in nectar
 
 
When was the flora brass
A woman kneeling among cranes
Willows waiting
for sticks to arrive
to burn cranes from her body
 
 
 
                genital
wind through which
 
 
No, it has always been this way
blooms erupting
suspicion, husband
making sure each dawn
the sticks stay lashed to his back, the wood
she waits for
thin as blades, and cut as close
 
 
To fallow soil
sea dragon in hand
proper, yes, though petrified
 
 
    crimson, pink, indigo, green
purple and yellow     lotus
cradle in the hedgerow
 
 
I feel
faint     exceptionally
hot      here on the ground
 
 
Should I be sweating this much?
Should the sea dragon weigh so heavily?
Bronze skin festooning the trees
cutting a spirit loose?
 
 
Carrion flowers
                           slip
 from my hand





Some Pink in Your Color
 

Did you know I'm in this hospital bed?
I'm not. I'm in the same light you stand in,
much the same way I'm in the waist of your Carolina
watching from the screen across the bed
whose pulse is worn down with an IV to the head.
 
We are all snow birds atop
the cherry blossoms of August.
Springtime in Washington D.C.
passed too fast, nearly in the flash of Rose
brushing her teeth over the bedpan.
 
No adrenal gland has known such cortisol,
such heartbreaking I love you O my God,
so many soldiers on the brink of their lives returning!
Are we still talking to the same god?
 
I can't imagine the heart anymore
 now that it presses my ribs apart,
 a balloon of such gravity I ache for stars in a jar,
 wasps whose love reminds me of fireflies tonight.





Butterfly the Gnarled
 

Into my stomach an explosion of stars
 where I rely on myself, my government name, bony letters
 of fingers that tunnel your bisected heart, skyward with dark.
  
 Parasites bed my inner lining--
 Am I not the rubberized universe?
 I am its buffer and get to name things for what they are,
 who they serve--what order.
  
 A plural centipede burrows outbound,
 crawls the spine of my hand,
 tells my pencil to move along, give out lead.
 Months of illness do that to a puppet,
 gnaw at her strings, place moths on her neighbors,
 blend them with gypsies who live the treetops uprooted.
  
 Dare the deliberately happy to butterfly the gnarled roots of life--
  
 That we pass too many pounds of flesh uncut.
 Too much genius hermitted in stereo.
 The round tables forgetting their bird seed.
 Clovers push luck to surround these hollow legs.
  
 Why no windows on the sides of houses?
 Why no flames beneath stones that burn?
 Why do all minutes lead the blue carp and black eel now?
  
 We'll be passing through heaven in a split pea shell,
 emptied of light, hard as effusive green
 ore the blood corrupts daily, within and without.





The Gilded Zero
 

Only open homes & woods & pansies' blue ledges
 can lead the zero with his only arms
 to embrace himself in open fields for all to gape upon.
 He unbuttons steel-gray sheets, a knotted top coat,
 bares himself, his hole, a vision
 as framed by the marker that is 
 where
 his body blew and left enclosure intact,
 skeletal innards
 enough to make moviegoers ask,
 "Has anyone finished themselves yet?
 I haven't. I swim the lagoon, take note:
 the babies are barely dirty,
 their armpits smooth with silky soot
 weighted in apartment cycles like
 we keep movement in boxes for thunderstorms,
 and the railroad leaves a dancing behavior
 absorbed by every second thought,
 escaping the socket that was his mission,
 his body incomplete, to help us
 to the maidenhead of Niagara,
 a target awakening
 the chlorophyll of trees,
 their tongues the densest forest
 canopy and floor
 thigh deep with root rot we sleep on and fold
 into growing-whole sheep what becomes of the lot:
 night's zero hour
 of what is & what isn't, till death, not us part.





Gone by Then
 

Gone then risen
  
 Milk dawn gone then risen
  
 Our ephemeral fawning done
  
 Gone sanguine then risen in spell
  
 High with your wrist while nihil busy
  
 Unburrowing dice teams from sand figurines
  
 Risen to swirl steam scooping passing seemingly
  
 A kindred-ided up and up, born of dormant corners
  
 Forms filial then filled          Goes mourn and swoon
  
 Love have and love loom                    Union and risen





Nine Key Chord
 

          
          Or nothing is really north, but you're so civic and indivisible.

7th Game : 1960 Series
 

--for Joel--
Nice day,
 sweet October afternoon
 Men walk the sun-shot avenues,
                                                      Second, Third, eyes
                                                      intent elsewhere
 ears communing with transistors in shirt pockets
                                     Bars are full, quiet,
 discussion during commercials
                                                       only
 Pirates lead New York 4-1, top of the 6th, 2
 Yankees on base,    1 man out
  
 What a nice day for all this  !
 Handsome women, even
 dreamy jailbait, walk
                                       nearly neglected  :
 men's eyes are blank
 their thoughts are all in Pittsburgh
  
 Last half of the 9th, the score tied 9-all,
 Mazeroski leads off for the Pirates
 The 2nd pitch he simply, sweetly
                                                            CRACK!

                                                      the 3rd base line
                                     and what men come down

 Yanquis, come home





The Caf Filtre
 

Slowly and with persistence
 he eats away at the big steak,
 gobbles up the asparagus, its
 butter & salt & root taste,
 drinks at a glass of red wine, and carefully
                              taking his time, mops up
                the gravy with bread--
 The top of the caf filtre is
 copper, passively shines back, & between
 mouthfuls of steak, sips of wine,
                              he remembers
                at intervals to
 with the flat of his hand
 the top removed,
                                        bang
 at the apparatus,
 create the suction that
 the water will
                           fall through
                           more quickly
  
 Across the tiles of the floor, the
 cat comes to the table  :  again.
 "I've already given you one piece of steak,
 what do you want from me now? Love?
                             He strokes her head, her
 rounded black pregnant head, her greedy
      front paws slip from his knee,
      the pearl of great price
      ignored  .  She's bored, he
 bangs the filtre again, its top is copper
 passively shines back  .
                                                                   Food & wine nearly
 finished.
 He lifts the whole apparatus off the cup  .  Merciful
 God, will it never be done?                      Too cold
                                                                       already
 to add cream and sugar, he offers the last
 piece of steak with his fingers  .
                           She accepts it with calm
                                       dignity,
 even delicacy  .  The coffee goes down at a gulp, it
 is black
 & lukewarm  .





Ritual X. : The Evening Pair of Ales
 

EAST OF EDEN
 is mountains & desert
 until you cross the passes into India  .
 It is 3 o'clock in the afternoon or
 twenty of 8 at night, depending
                    which clock you believe  .
  
 AND WEST IS WEST
 It's where the cups and saucers are,
 the plates, the knives and forks  .
  
                    The turkey sandwich comes alone
                    or with onions if you like
 The old newspaperman always takes his hat off
 & lays it atop the cigarette machine;
 the younger, so-hip journalist, leaves his on
 old-style .

The old man sits down in the corner, puts
                   his hat back on. No challenge, but
                         it's visible, the beau geste  .
                                        The cigarette
 hangs from the side of the younger man's mouth, he's
 putting himself on  .
                    East of Eden is mountains & desert & every
                    thing creeps up on you & comes in the night,
                                       unexpectedly  .
 when one would least put out his hand
 to offer, or to defend  .





Journal: April 19 : The Southern Tier
 

I

look out the window in upstate New York, see

 the Mediterranean stretching out below me

down the rocky hillside at Faro, three

years, two months, fourteen days earlier .

8:25 A. M.

Rosemary gone back to sleep, pink & white . I

stand at the livingroom window drinking coffee, open

the doors to the balcony . Warmth beginning, tho

I wrap my hands around the cup, count

fishing boats in the sunglare, moving shoreward now

slowly, or

sitting there motionless on the flat sea .

a fat blue arm stretches out from the coast, ripples

where wind and currents show

muscle below the blue skin of sea

stretched out below me .

                                                  The coffee's

cold toward the end of the cup . I go

back to the kitchen for more hot . put

orange in bathrobe pocket, reach for knife, return

to the balcony with the fresh cup where the flat blue sea

fills my eye in the sunglare . stretches out below me.

 

 The Southern Tier:    the maple outside the window

warms in the early sun . red buds at the ends of branches

commence their slow bursting . Green soon

                                                           Joan moves

                           her legs against mine in the hall, goes down to

start my egg . Carlos thumps the lower stairs . We move.

 

 All our farewells al-

ready prepared inside us   .   aaaall our

deaths we carry inside us, double-yolked, the

fragile toughness of the shell   .   it makes

sustenance possible, makes love    possible

as the red buds break against the sunglight

possible green, as legs move against legs

possible softnesses     .     The soft-boiled

egg is ready now  .

                                                       Now we eat.

 
                                                                                        19  .  IV  .  71





Sci-Fi
 

There will be no edges, but curves.
Clean lines pointing only forward.

History, with its hard spine & dog-eared
Corners, will be replaced with nuance,

Just like the dinosaurs gave way
To mounds and mounds of ice.

Women will still be women, but
The distinction will be empty. Sex,

Having outlived every threat, will gratify
Only the mind, which is where it will exist.

For kicks, we'll dance for ourselves
Before mirrors studded with golden bulbs.

The oldest among us will recognize that glow--
But the word sun will have been re-assigned

To the Standard Uranium-Neutralizing device
Found in households and nursing homes.

And yes, we'll live to be much older, thanks
To popular consensus. Weightless, unhinged,

Eons from even our own moon, we'll drift
In the haze of space, which will be, once

And for all, scrutable and safe.





The Universe: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack
 

The first track still almost swings. High hat and snare, even
A few bars of sax the stratosphere will singe-out soon enough.

Synthesized strings. Then something like cellophane
Breaking in as if snagged to a shoe. Crinkle and drag. White noise,

Black noise. What must be voices bob up, then drop, like metal shavings
In molasses. So much for us. So much for the flags we bored

Into planets dry as chalk, for the tin cans we filled with fire
And rode like cowboys into all we tried to tame. Listen:

The dark we've only ever imagined now audible, thrumming,
Marbled with static like gristly meat. A chorus of engines churns.

Silence taunts: a dare. Everything that disappears
Disappears as if returning somewhere.





The Universe as Primal Scream
 

5pm on the nose. They open their mouths
And it rolls out: high, shrill and metallic.
First the boy, then his sister. Occasionally,
They both let loose at once, and I think
Of putting on my shoes to go up and see
Whether it is merely an experiment
Their parents have been conducting
Upon the good crystal, which must surely
Lie shattered to dust on the floor.

Maybe the mother is still proud
Of the four pink lungs she nursed
To such might. Perhaps, if they hit
The magic decibel, the whole building
Will lift-off, and we'll ride to glory
Like Elijah. If this is it--if this is what
Their cries are cocked toward--let the sky
Pass from blue, to red, to molten gold,
To black. Let the heaven we inherit approach.

 Whether it is our dead in Old Testament robes,
Or a door opening onto the roiling infinity of space.
Whether it will bend down to greet us like a father,
Or swallow us like a furnace. I'm ready
To meet what refuses to let us keep anything
For long. What teases us with blessings,
Bends us with grief. Wizard, thief, the great
Wind rushing to knock our mirrors to the floor,
To sweep our short lives clean. How mean

Our racket seems beside it. My stereo on shuffle.
The neighbor chopping onions through a wall.
All of it just a hiccough against what may never
Come for us. And the kids upstairs still at it,
Screaming like the Dawn of Man, as if something
They have no name for has begun to insist
Upon being born.





My God, It's Full of Stars
 

          1. 
 
We like to think of it as parallel to what we know,
Only bigger. One man against the authorities.
Or one man against a city of zombies. One man
 
Who is not, in fact, a man, sent to understand
The caravan of men now chasing him like red ants
Let loose down the pants of America. Man on the run.
 
Man with a ship to catch, a payload to drop,
This message going out to all of space. . . . Though
Maybe it's more like life below the sea: silent,
 
Buoyant, bizarrely benign. Relics
Of an outmoded design. Some like to imagine
A cosmic mother watching through a spray of stars,
 
Mouthing yes, yes as we toddle toward the light,
Biting her lip if we teeter at some ledge. Longing
To sweep us to her breast, she hopes for the best
 
While the father storms through adjacent rooms
Ranting with the force of Kingdom Come,
Not caring anymore what might snap us in its jaw.
 
Sometimes,  what I see is a library in a rural community.
All the tall shelves in the big open room. And the pencils
In a cup at Circulation, gnawed on by the entire population.
 
The books have lived here all along, belonging
For weeks at a time to one or another in the brief sequence
Of family names, speaking (at night mostly) to a face,
 
A pair of eyes. The most remarkable lies.
 
 
          2.
 
Charlton Heston is waiting to be let in. He asked once politely.
A second time with force from the diaphragm. The third time,
He did it like Moses: arms raised high, face an apocryphal white.
 
Shirt crisp, suit trim, he stoops a little coming in,
Then grows tall. He scans the room. He stands until I gesture,
Then he sits. Birds commence their evening chatter. Someone fires
 
Charcoals out below. He'll take a whiskey if I have it. Water if I don't.
I ask him to start from the beginning, but he goes only halfway back.
That was the future once, he says. Before the world went upside down.
 
Hero, survivor, God's right hand man, I know he sees the blank
Surface of the moon where I see a language built from brick and bone.
He sits straight in his seat, takes a long, slow high-thespian breath,
 
Then lets it go. For all I know, I was the last true man on this earth. And:
May I smoke? The voices outside soften. Planes jet past heading off or back.
Someone cries that she does not want to go to bed. Footsteps overhead.
 
A fountain in the neighbor's yard babbles to itself, and the night air
Lifts the sound indoors. It was another time, he says, picking up again.
We were pioneers. Will you fight to stay alive here, riding the earth
 
Toward God-knows-where? I think of Atlantis buried under ice, gone
One day from sight, the shore from which it rose now glacial and stark.
Our eyes adjust to the dark.
 
 
          3.
 
Perhaps the great error is believing we're alone,
 
That the others have come and gone--a momentary blip--
 
When all along, space might be choc-full of traffic,
 
Bursting at the seams with energy we neither feel
 
Nor see, flush against us, living, dying, deciding,
 
Setting solid feet down on planets everywhere,
 
Bowing to the great stars that command, pitching stones
 
At whatever are their moons. They live wondering
 
If they are the only ones, knowing only the wish to know,
 
And the great black distance they--we--flicker in.
 
 
Maybe the dead know, their eyes widening at last,
 
Seeing the high beams of a million galaxies flick on
 
At twilight. Hearing the engines flare, the horns
 
Not letting up, the frenzy of being. I want to be
 
One notch below bedlam, like a radio without a dial.
 
Wide open, so everything floods in at once.
 
And sealed tight, so nothing escapes. Not even time,
 
Which should curl in on itself and loop around like smoke.
 
So that I might be sitting now beside my father
 
As he raises a lit match to the bowl of his pipe
 
For the first time in the winter of 1959.
 
          4. 
 
In those last scenes of Kubrick's 2001
When Dave is whisked into the center of space,
Which unfurls in an aurora of orgasmic light
Before opening wide, like a jungle orchid
For a love-struck bee, then goes liquid,
Paint-in-water, and then gauze wafting out and off,
Before, finally, the night tide, luminescent
And vague, swirls in, and on and on. . . . 
 
In those last scenes, as he floats
Above Jupiter's vast canyons and seas,
Over the lava strewn plains and mountains
Packed in ice, that whole time, he doesn't blink.
In his little ship, blind to what he rides, whisked
Across the wide-screen of unparcelled time,
Who knows what blazes through his mind?
Is it still his life he moves through, or does
That end at the end of what he can name?
 
On set, it's shot after shot till Kubrick is happy,
Then the costumes go back on their racks
And the great gleaming set goes black.
 
 
          5.
 
When my father worked on the Hubble Telescope, he said
They operated like surgeons: scrubbed and sheathed
In papery green, the room a clean cold, a bright white.
 
He'd read Larry Niven at home, and drink scotch on the rocks,
His eyes exhausted and pink. These were the Reagan years,
When we lived with our finger on The Button and struggled
 
To view our enemies as children. My father spent whole seasons
Bowing before the oracle-eye, hungry for what it would find.
His face lit-up whenever anyone asked, and his arms would rise
 
As if he were weightless, perfectly at ease in the never-ending
Night of space. On the ground, we tied postcards to balloons
For peace. Prince Charles married Lady Di. Rock Hudson died.
 
We learned new words for things. The decade changed.
 
The first few pictures came back blurred, and I felt ashamed
For all the cheerful engineers, my father and his tribe. The second time,
The optics jibed. We saw to the edge of all there is--
 
So brutal and alive it seemed to comprehend us back.





Don't You Wonder, Sometimes?
 

          1.
 
After dark, stars glisten like ice, and the distance they span
Hides something elemental. Not God, exactly. More like
Some thin-hipped glittering Bowie-being--a Starman
Or cosmic ace hovering, swaying, aching to make us see.
And what would we do, you and I, if we could know for sure
 
That someone was there squinting through the dust,
Saying nothing is lost, that everything lives on waiting only
To be wanted back badly enough? Would you go then,
Even for a few nights, into that other life where you
And that first she loved, blind to the future once, and happy?
 
Would I put on my coat and return to the kitchen where my
Mother and father sit waiting, dinner keeping warm on the stove?
Bowie will never die. Nothing will come for him in his sleep
Or charging through his veins. And he'll never grow old,
Just like the woman you lost, who will always be dark-haired
 
And flush-faced, running toward an electronic screen
That clocks the minutes, the miles left to go. Just like the life
In which I'm forever a child looking out my window at the night sky
Thinking one day I'll touch the world with bare hands
Even if it burns.
 
 
          2.
 
He leaves no tracks. Slips past, quick as a cat. That's Bowie
For you: the Pope of Pop, coy as Christ. Like a play
Within a play, he's trademarked twice. The hours
 
Plink past like water from a window A/C. We sweat it out,
Teach ourselves to wait. Silently, lazily, collapse happens.
But not for Bowie. He cocks his head, grins that wicked grin.
 
Time never stops, but does it end? And how many lives
Before take-off, before we find ourselves
Beyond ourselves, all glam-glow, all twinkle and gold?
 
The future isn't what it used to be. Even Bowie thirsts
For something good and cold. Jets blink across the sky
Like migratory souls.
 
 
          3.
 
Bowie is among us. Right here
In New York City. In a baseball cap
And expensive jeans. Ducking into
A deli. Flashing all those teeth
At the doorman on his way back up.
Or he's hailing a taxi on Lafayette
As the sky clouds over at dusk.
He's in no rush. Doesn't feel
The way you'd think he feels.
Doesn't strut or gloat. Tells jokes.
 
I've lived here all these years
And never seen him. Like not knowing
A comet from a shooting star.
But I'll bet he burns bright,
Dragging a tail of white-hot matter
The way some of us track tissue
Back from the toilet stall. He's got
The whole world under his foot,
And we are small alongside,
Though there are occasions
 
When a man his size can meet
Your eyes for just a blip of time
And send a thought like SHINE
SHINE SHINE SHINE SHINE
Straight to your mind. Bowie,
I want to believe you. Want to feel
Your will like the wind before rain.
The kind everything simply obeys,
Swept up in that hypnotic dance
As if something with the power to do so
Had looked its way and said:
                                                     Go ahead.





I Don't Miss It
 

But sometimes I forget where I am,
 Imagine myself inside that life again.
  
 Recalcitrant mornings. Sun perhaps, 
 Or more likely colorless light
  
 Filtering its way through shapeless cloud.
  
 And when I begin to believe I haven't left,
 The rest comes back. Our couch. My smoke
  
 Climbing the walls while the hours fall.
 Straining against the noise of traffic, music,
  
 Anything alive, to catch your key in the door.
 And that scamper of feeling in my chest,
  
 As if the day, the night, wherever it is
 I am by then, has been only a whir
  
 Of something other than waiting.
  
 We hear so much about what love feels like.
 Right now, today, with the rain outside,
  
 And leaves that want as much as I do to believe
 In May, in seasons that come when called,
  
 It's impossible not to want
 To walk into the next room and let you
  
 Run your hands down the sides of my legs,
 Knowing perfectly well what they know.





Duende
 

1.
  
 The earth is dry and they live wanting.
 Each with a small reservoir
 Of furious music heavy in the throat.
 They drag it out and with nails in their feet
 Coax the night into being. Brief believing.
 A skirt shimmering with sequins and lies.
 And in this night that is not night,
 Each word is a wish, each phrase
 A shape their bodies ache to fill--
  
             I'm going to braid my hair
        Braid many colors into my hair
             I'll put a long braid in my hair
        And write your name there
  
 They defy gravity to feel tugged back.
 The clatter, the mad slap of landing.
  
  
                                     2.
  
 And not just them. Not just
 The ramshackle family, the tos,
 Primitos, not just the bailaor
 Whose heels have notched 
 And hammered time
 So the hours flow in place
 Like a tin river, marking
 Only what once was.
Not just the voices of scraping
 Against the river, nor the hands 
 Nudging them farther, fingers
 Like blind birds, palms empty, 
 Echoing. Not just the women
 With sober faces and flowers
 In their hair, the ones who dance
 As though they're burying
 Memory--one last time-- 
 Beneath them.
                         And I hate to do it here.
 To set myself heavily beside them.
 Not now that they've proven
 The body a myth, a parable
 For what not even language
 Moves quickly enough to name.
 If I call it pain, and try to touch it
 With my hands, my own life,
 It lies still and the music thins,
 A pulse felt for through garments. 
 If I lean into the desire it starts from-- 
 If I lean unbuttoned into the blow
 Of loss after loss, love tossed
 Into the ecstatic void--
 It carries me with it farther,
 To chords that stretch and bend
 Like light through colored glass.
 But it races on, toward shadows
 Where the world I know
 And the world I fear
 Threaten to meet.
  
                                     3.
  
 There is always a road,
 The sea, dark hair, dolor.
  
 Always a question
 Bigger than itself--
  
             They say you're leaving Monday

            Why can't you leave on Tuesday?





Interrogative
 

1. Falmouth, Massachusetts, 1972
  
 Oak table, knotted legs, the chirp
 And scrape of tines to mouth.
 Four children, four engines
 Of want. That music.
  
 What did your hand mean to smooth
 Across the casket of your belly?
 What echoed there, if not me--tiny body
 Afloat, akimbo, awake or at rest?
  
 Every night you fed the others
 Bread leavened with the grains
 Of your own want. How
 Could you stand me near you,
  
 In you, jump and kick tricking
 The heart, when what you prayed for
 Was my father's shadow, your name
 In his dangerous script, an envelope
  
 Smelling of gun-powder, bay rum,
 Someone to wrestle, sing to, question,
 Climb?
  
  
                         2. Interstate 101 South, California, 1981
  
 Remember the radio, the Coca-Cola sign
 Phosphorescent to the left, bridge
 After bridge, as though our lives were
 Engineered simply to go? And so we went
  
 Into those few quiet hours
 Alone together in the dark, my arm
 On the rest beside yours, our lights
 Pricking at fog, tugging us patiently
  
 Forward like a needle through gauze.
 Night held us like a house.
 Sometimes an old song
 Would fill the car like a ghost.
  
                                     3. Leroy, Alabama, 2005
  
 There's still a pond behind your mother's old house,
 Still a stable with horses, a tractor rusted and stuck
 Like a trophy in mud. And the red house you might
 Have thrown stones at still stands on stilts up the dirt road.
  
 A girl from the next town over rides in to lend us
 Her colt, cries when one of us kicks it with spurs.
 Her father wants to buy her a trailer, let her try her luck
 In the shows. They stay for dinner under the tent
  
 Your brother put up for the Fourth. Firebugs flare
 And vanish. I am trying to let go of something.
 My heart cluttered with names that mean nothing.
 Our racket races out to the darkest part of the night.
  
 The woods catch it and send it back. 
  
  
                         4. But let's say you're alive again--
  
 Your hands are long and tell your age.
 You hold them there, twirling a bent straw,
 And my reflection watches, hollow-faced,
 Not trying to hide. The waiters make it seem
  
 Like Cairo. Back and forth shouting
 That sharp language. And for the first time
 I tell you everything. No shame
 In my secrets, shoddy as laundry.
  
 I have praised your God
 For the blessing of the body, snuck
 From pleasure to pleasure, lying for it, 
 Holding it like a coin or a key in my fist.
  
 I know now you've known all along.
  
 I won't change. I want to give
 Everything away. To wander forever.
 Here is a pot of tea. Let's share it
 Slowly, like sisters.





Carnival
 

The mask that burns like a violin, the mask
 that sings only dead languages, that loves
 the destruction of being put on. The mask
 that sighs like a woman even though
 a woman wears it. The mask beaded with
 freshwater pearls, with seeds. The plumed mask,
 the mask with a sutured mouth, a moonface,
 with a healed gash that means harvest. A glower
 that hides wanting. A grotesque pucker. Here's
 a beaked mask, a braided mask, here's a mask
 without eyes, a mask that looks like a mask
 but isn't--please don't try to unribbon it.
 The mask that snows coins, the mask full of wasps.
 Lace mask to net escaping thoughts. Pass me
 the rouged mask, the one made of sheet music.
 Or the jackal mask, the hide-bound mask
 that renders lovers identical with night.

In the Museum of Lost Objects
 

What thou lov'st well shall not be reft from thee;   What thou lov'st well is thy true heritage.                  Ezra Pound
You'll find labels describing what is gone:
 an empress's bones, a stolen painting
  
 of a man in a feathered helmet
 holding a flag-draped spear.
  
 A vellum gospel, hidden somewhere long ago
 forgotten, would have sat on that pedestal;
  
 this glass cabinet could have kept the first
 salts carried back from the Levant.
  
 To help us comprehend the magnitude
 of absence, huge rooms
  
 lie empty of their wonders--the Colossus,
 Babylon's Hanging Gardens and
  
 in this gallery, empty shelves enough to hold
 all the scrolls of Alexandria.
  
 My love, I've petitioned the curator
 who has acquired an empty chest
  
 representing all the poems you will
 now never write. It will be kept with others
  
 in the poet's gallery. Next door,
 a vacant room echoes with the spill
  
 of jewels buried by a pirate who died
 before disclosing their whereabouts.
  
 I hope you don't mind, but I have kept
 a few of your pieces
  
 for my private collection. I think
 you know the ones I mean.

Marblehead
 

    not to be in love with you I can't remember what it was like                      it must've been lousy                                                       James Schuyler
You take off your black
 motorcycle jacket, hang it
 on the back of a chair. It's cold
 from our walk along the sea wall.
 Your pockets jingle with shells.
 While we were gone, you left
 the stove on low--some things
 you do make me so nervous.
 You graze the surface of sauce
 simmering in a pan, shiny fingertip
 held out for me to lick, you say
 "What does it need? Maybe nothing,
 maybe honey to unbitter the lime.
 Later that night you'll bury your face
 in my belly and sob. "I'm sorry,
 though I don't think you are
 always talking to me, my love.
 But now lobster steam billows
 up the window, you gulp
 purple wine, your pinky sticking out,
 and the round olives are the green
 all green things aspire to be.





Create Desire
 

Someone was searching for a Form of Fire.
 Bird-eyed, the wind watched.
 Four deer in a blowsy meadow.
 As though it were simply random, a stately stare.
  
 What's six and six and two and ten?
 Time that my eye ached, my heart shook, why.
 Mistaking lime for lemon.
 Dressed in cobalt, charcoal, thistle--and control.
  
 If they had more they would need less.
 A proposal from the squinting logician.
 Seems we are legal, seems we are ill.
 Ponderous purpose, are you weather, are you wheel?
  
 Gold with a heart of cinder.
 Little blue chip dancing in the light of the loom.
 Mistress, May-girl, whom will you kiss?
 The death of water is the birth of air.





May
 

In May's gaud gown and ruby reckoning
 the old saw wind repeats a colder thing.
  
 Says, you are the bluest body I ever seen.
 Says, dance that skeletal startle the way I might.
  
 Radius, ulna, a catalogue of flex.
 What do you think you're grabbing
  
 with those gray hands? What do you think
 you're hunting, cat-mouth creeling
  
 in the mouseless dawn? Pink as meat
 in the butcher's tender grip, white as
  
 the opal of a thigh you smut the lie on.
 In May's red ruse and smattered ravishings
  
 you one, you two, you three your cruder schemes,
 you blanch black lurk and blood the pallid bone
  
 and hum scald need where the body says I am
 and the rose sighs Touch me, I am dying
  
 in the pleatpetal purring of mouthweathered May.





[I never wish to sing again as I used to . . .]
 

     I never wish to sing again as I used to, when two new eyes could always stain the sea, of tangent worlds, indolent as callows, and the clock went backward for a skip, to rise, to set.       Some will twine grass to fit in a thimble, some will carve bread to mend a craggy wall, some in the slantest midnight cry for sleep. When the pitch-owl swallows the moon, what welt will show it? Sighing helps nothing, raspberries raw and green, in the form of a heart       imperfectly divided. A wave grows sharper close to the shore. Some own words like strips of scape and summon. It is possible to suffer even  in the sun. And race the steep noon to its highest, hoary gate. Stares drop under the sky; silence of a windslap; and a scar drifts out of air to  stand whistling:       She who listens poorly will always be calling. She who sounds silence drowns with the dumb.       She who cuts her hands off must drink with her tongue.
        




[I believe there is a song that is stranger than wind . . .]
 

    I believe there is a song that is stranger than wind, that sips the scald from the telling, toss, toss. In the room I move in, a wrecked boy listened to each sky's erasing, for it was shrill winter, for it was blast and blur. For it was farther from the native birds and the gray heath heather and the uncaressable thighs of the one who shook in violet. Those who fly farthest must always burn the nest. But the mind in its implacable spec- trum dims to brown. Must you die on your back like a cheap engine, rust and wrack? In the crevicing days, there are no words for prizing, be- tween the lidless moon and the silver hands of the fountain. But if it is space you must fail in, teach it din.
        




New Song
 

After William IX, Duke of Aquitaine
As sweetness flows through these new days,
the woods leaf out, and songbirds phrase
in neumes of roosted melody
incipits to a new song.
Then love should find lubricity
and quicken, having slept so long.

The bloodroot blossoms, well and good,
but I receive no word that would
set my troubled heart at ease,
nor could we turn our faces toward
the sun, and open by degrees,
unless we reach a clear accord.

And so our love goes, night and day:
it's like the thorny hawthorn spray
that whips about in a bitter wind
from dusk to dawn, shellacked with sleet,
until the sun's first rays ascend
through leaves and branches, spreading heat.

I have in mind one April morning
when she relented without warning,
relenting from her cold rebuff
in laughter, peals of happiness.
Sweet Christ, let me live long enough
to get my hands beneath her dress!

I hate the elevated talk
that disregards both root and stalk
and sets insipid pride above
vicissitudes of lust and strife.
Let others claim a higher love:
we've got the bread, we've got the knife.





A Close Shave
 

From Baden, or what's left of it,
pursue a long, smooth curve of road
that skirts the northern flood wall
to parallel a palisade
of channel markers sunk in earth,
the folly of a cement works.
Its blank silos overlook
a pit of argillaceous shale,
the fine and fossilized remains
of bivalves, sponges, spines of shark,
quarried and burnt with limestone charge
to alchemize a binder of brick
and the city's shallow, brittle crust.

Around a bend, the riverbed 
swings wide to open a fetch of field.
Shadows skim its mucky thaw
as juncos, whisked about by the wind
on courses neither fixed nor free,
give but a quick metallic chink.
Behind you, rain has wrapped the bluffs
and scumbled limbs of sycamores.
Ahead, each bend assumes the name
of a gaudy packet run aground,
or snagged and sunk, or blown to bits:
for one, the side-wheel Amazon,
pluperfect wheelhouse painted green,
that struck a honey-locust pike
still rooted deep in river mud
and tore its hull from stem to stern.
Down in minutes! Within the month
an island silted up behind.

A flock of luggage floated south, 
remarked by those on Water Street
loafing before the trading post
and the barbershop of Madame Krull.
She can eternally be found
at work in her elaborate room
toujours prt to clip and coif
or wield her razor with great skill
for those who favor her with their chins.
The scent of ginger tonic blends
with that of borscht, its acrid tang,
consumed behind a wooden screen
as Illinois grows dark. In this,
her second year since coming west.





The Prodigal Son
 

"Fly at once! he said. "All is discovered. -- Edward Gorey
In Miami, this May afternoon, I look up,
the sky hot, so hot, always, and heating up hotter --
how long I have loved this scene.
The clouds are white optimistic churches; 
I cannot number them.
Herons, pelicans, and gulls glide like dreams 
through cloud-portals, cloud-porticos, and cloud-porte-cochres 
Giotto could have done with his passion for blues and dimensions.
Hard not to love a place always called by possibility.
Nearby, Cuba is singing and somewhere here
Richard Blanco is writing his poems. 
As I enter the city,
my bishop walks with a cane towards our cathedral.

The sun shines on the people 
and unites us in a delirium of light.
High above this bleached, scorched, fragile, groin-scented peninsula, 
the birds track their insects and remain loyal to their nests.
I look up and I feel bliss building 
as I did when my father read another book to me, 
and another, the pages like wings.
There are moments of memorable patience in this world.
Airplanes advance towards Miami International,
booked with Jewish retirees and Cuban migrs--
their descending engines disrupt the white-gloved illegal waiters
at the country clubs in Coral Gables, who deliver flan
to the ladies who have pulled their skin behind their ears like gum.

This is a place where few decisions are doubted.
On South Beach, 
where everyone rearranges or expands their sexual parts,
there seems to be no life outside the physical and time
becomes a tricky thing here, spring looks like winter,
winter like spring, the scenes dense, shifting, shut --
and before you know it the rats have preached from the mangoes
and then chewed them to corpses. 
And look, how the interior decorators
unroll their fresh bolts and wink-wink to new clients --
what would be considered frivolous anywhere else
is here pondered and coerced at great length.
The feminine gains strength.

Moving closer to the cathedral,
the sea presses the harbor, wanting to be loved,
pushing up the cruise ships with its muscles.
The sea says: "I am the sea.
We have seen Cubans come atop dolphins' backs here.
Mothers have drowned for their sons,
but the cool gray backs of the dolphins have buoyed their children to us,
numbed by the lullaby of sonar clicks.
The sea blesses the city the way mothers do --
forceful, pushy, ungraspable, persistent.
The black mangrove shoots take root on the porous, chalky rock,
building themselves up like steeples. Listen.
How the waves love what does not love them back.
Pedicurists buff the toenails of the sugar daddies in the Delano.
Lincoln Road refines its scarlet seductions.
Bees are sticky with tourism inside the motel rooms of the rose.
Red-orange petals from the Royal Poincianas tint the minutes
with flamboyance. The pink and white bottlebrush trees explode
with seeds. I will always love my time in this city, you might say
craziest of cities, delivering its youth in short-shorts
and Rollerblades with rainbow sweatbands.
City smelling of unzipped things. Cha cha cha! Cha cha cha!
I do not think the city will ever be mine. 
Beautiful Spanish and broken English spoken everywhere. 
How I love that sound,
for it is the sound of people making their way where they were not born.
Maids from Honduras push their carts,
stacking their wrapped soaps, counting them like children,
their cuticles sting with disinfectant,
perspiration staining their uniforms as they pray over the toilet seats they clean.

O Miami!
For a decade I did not speak to my parents.
Are you listening to me? I will not bore you with details.
Instead, I will tell you something new. Listen to me.
I was angry. But the reasons no longer interest me.
I take the liberty of assuming you approve of forgiveness,
stressing hardening gentleness as you do.
I speak to the bishop about my call and the sacraments,
we discuss blessings, absolutions, consecrations--
our work of the soul. The soul has no sex and I am relieved
to speak of a thing alive in the world that has no sex.

The bishop places a paperweight atop my reports on his desk,
our professional talk is measured by the silence of the dead
who are always flinging open their shutters,
religion being the work of the living and the dead,
the hope and release in the hearts of parents turning to their children
and the hearts of children turning to their parents --
all that business in life that remains unrehearsed.
Superior to obedient, we pray. 
The laughter of the bathers
through the grillwork of the office window pleases me,
their movements rinsed in the baptism of the sea, the languorous sea.

The sky at the end of the city trembles.
Light and dust warm to cream to pink to lavender.
Miami, it has been a gorgeous day, indeed. Thank you.
How I love your decks, bridges, promenades, and balconies --
the paraphernalia of connection.
How fast the pastels encroach upon the edges.
I have a dinner engagement in Coral Gables at Books & Books
where I will see the poet Richard Blanco.
I hope he will tell me stories of his beloved, broken Cuba.
Nearly five o'clock now, and I am late.
When I arrive, Richard Blanco speaks of Cuba
as I had wished, and the city quiets all around him.
"If our bodies house our souls, I think to myself,
"Then, Richard, poets are the interior decorators of the mind.
Richard Blanco is saying something about going back,
his relatives singing poems in the fields. I listen.
Behind us, in the palmetum, 
at the Fairchild Tropical Botanic Gardens,
the Elephant, Date, Malaysian, Kiwi, Coconut, and Royal palms
ask the city to remember their names with the insistence of priests.

Good-bye, Miami, good-bye.
Good-bye to the workers laying down the grids of the concrete embeds
on the high-rises, reinforcing their masculine nests,
gluing glass with their spermy compounds to stone and steel.
Good-bye to you, South Beach.
Let your rapturous sands darken to a deep grape color.
Let the polished feet of youth launch into their surprises and swaps. 
Let the elements cool.
Good-bye, Richard Blanco, good-bye.
Today my candidacy for Holy Orders was affirmed.
I listen to the sea flatten.
Cuba pleads in the distance one more night.
Honduras waits on too many things to count.
No longer can I stand still.
Stars smooth the sea with their immaculate highways of long lights.

Mother and father,
forgive me my absence.
I will always be moving quietly toward you.





River Politics
 

I spit my smack,

Jim slugs his Jack,

Rob stews his lack, 

Carey prepares his rack,

herons hunker on blowdowns,

deer wait on high moon for their rounds,

and the campfire

might as well be an empire

we all

watch dissolve 

(in the slough, a carp roll, a splash)

into ash.





And
 

1

Tense and tenuous
grow from the same root

as does tender
in its several guises:

the sour grass flower;
the yellow moth.


2

I would not confuse
the bogus
with the spurious.

The bogus
is a sore thumb

while the spurious
pours forth

as fish and circuses.





Luster
 

What flickers
with some delicacy

of feeling,

some hesitancy--
and then persists.

                 

What circles. What darts.

                 

Hunger

is like the inside
biting you.

"Like is like
insomnia.

                

These green cherry tomatoes;
their false pregnancies,

staked. Lustrous.

               

"That's all I meant.

All I meant by 
"witches.





The Thinning
 

1

These guys try to make us
match moods to products

the way once,
under love's spell,

we attached meaning
to sound,

attached sounds to objects.

The old magic won't work now,

but it's nice
to be reminded of it. 

2

She's a tease,
tears her skirts off 

one by one.
Really?

Drops her petals
as if she could always
make more.

It's tiresome.

We know
what she looks like
naked.

On a cold night,
we can see forever.





Daynight, With Mountains Tied Inside
 

Chandelier too full of brilliance to be indolent.
            Your prisms enunciate the light
and don't need rain to break it into rainbows.
Snow with six crutches in each crystal.
            Your livery your glitter, your purring
made visible. Only inanimate things can sparkle
without sweat. My spinet, the threat of music
            in its depths and miniature busts of men composers
carved of time on top. The hollow bench

held sheet music. Sing me
            Charm Gets In Your Eyes. I hear you best
when undistracted by your body. In headspace
technology, where flowers are living
            in glass globes, their fragrance vivisected.
Anything that blooms that long
will seem inanimate. Heaven. Grief
            like the sea. Keeps going. Over the same wrought
ground. The whole spent moan. Praise dies

in my throat or in the spooky rift
            between itself and its intended. Like a wish-
bone breaking. The little crutch inside
is not a toy. There is no night asylum.
            A restless bed, a haunt preserve,
a blanket rough as sailcloth. But sing me, was it kind
snow sometimes? With true divided lights and nothing
            flawed about it? If song goes wrong,
be dancerly. Dance me, at what point

does west turn to east as it spins?
            I've never understood. Perspective.
How charm gets to yes. Dance me Exile
and the Queendom, by request.
            It is a ferocious thing
to have your body as your instrument.
Glove over glove, let your dance express
            what I've been creeping like a vein of sweat
through a vastness of.

This tune with mountains tied inside
            and many silent letters
can be read as trackers scan the spaces
between toes and birders read the rustle
            left by birds. As any mammal
in its private purr hole knows,
the little crutch inside
            is not a crutch. More a sort of
steeple. Neither silver to be chased

nor gold to be beaten.
            You were==you are
more than ever like that too.
Noon upon noon,
            you customize this solitude
with spires
that want nothing from me
            and rise with no objective
as everything does when happy.

Wow Moment
 

From the guts of the house, I hear my mother crying
for her mother and wish I understood
the principles of tranquility. How to rest

the mind on a likeness of a blast furnace
framed in formica by anon. A photo of lounge
chairs with folded tartan lap robes. An untitled typology of

industrial parks. The gentle interface of yawn and nature.
It would soothe us. It would soothe us. We would be soothed
by that slow looking with a limited truth value. See

how the realtor's lens makes everything look larger
and there's so much glare the floor looks wow
under the smartificial xmas tree.

After studying Comparative Reality
I began Die Polyvinylchloride Tannenbaumserie.
Turn off that tiny tasteful star, I commanded.

While you're alive there's no time
for minor amazements. Turn off the sallow pages of
your paralegal pad. I don't need a light to think

of you. I don't need a god to pray.
Some things are glow alone. I said one thing you said
you remembered I said. Was it will you be my

trophy friend? Or are you someone else's
difficult person? I mean the more myself I
become the less intelligible I seem to otters.

I know what you mean you said.
It's like the time I was compelled to speak
on hedonism to the monks and nuns.

Did I say most religion is devotional
expediency? Or religion doesn't worry about being
religious, its wisdom corrupted by its brilliance as light

passing near the sun is deflected
in its path. Deep in its caprices,
the whole body thinks it's understood.

To think otterwise is isolating. When I said
hedonism stressed cheerfulness,
there were disappointed groans. Look, I'm sorry

I gave you an ornament shaped like a hollow look.
I liked its trinket brightness. Just don't give me
a water tower dressed up as a church steeple

or one of those silly thunderstorms
that hang around volcanoes. See how those teardrop lights
make every object jump? The memory does.

You made me love. Was it exile in honey
is still exile? Am I the fire or just another flame?
Please sell me an indulgence, I begged a monk.

And tell me what creature, what peril,
could craft that sound that night
dropped like a nubile sliver in my ear.

There is no freedom of silence
when morture forces us to speak
from organs other than the heart.

It was something about love. A far cry. It was come to me
unmediated, go to god lengths. In great things,
the attempt alone is sufficient. I think this

'cause I'm finite. That's an understanding
to which reason can only aspire
though an entire speech community labored

for generations to say it in a fair hand clearly
dated and scented with lavender. My one and only only
a crass color orgy will see us through

the dusk ahead, the months gray as donkey.
See how it grows its own cross of fur
and bears it on its back? I showed you that.





Spell
 

          
          Some fish for words from shore while others, lacking in such contemplative tact, like to go wading in up to their chins through a torrent of bone-freezing diamond, knife raised, to freeze-frame incarnadine and then bid it as with hermetic wand flow on again, ferociously, transparently, name writ in river.
        




Postcard 2
 

          
          Incomprehensible fate that sentenced my father to my mother. I can't blame him, I would have left the raving bitch myself, and would do so many many times in years to come. Then, of course, I came along. There is a limit to what one man can endure. So I suppose I am the reason he left, actually. I am the one to blame. And yet he did his best; he did all that he was capable of doing, and wrote me every year, like clockwork. He rarely remembered to mail what he wrote me, poor man (when I think of what I must have put him through), barely legible one-sentence postcards he sometimes worked at half the night; but as they all said the same thing, word for word, it wasn't that bad. He could be forgiven. The blizzard I visit your city disguised as will never be over and never arrive. I think what he was trying to say was that at some point I'd begin to notice I was freezing, wasn't dressed right, had nowhere to go, and was staggering into a blinding snow that no one else could see. I think he meant, the cold will make you what I am today.
        




Getting There
 

Time to give up
grieving my mother's loss,
faulting my father and 
his Neolithic moral certitude 
about every detail
on the evening news,
his general absence
hanging like the gray 
sheets on the line.

Never mind how 
mismatched in the heart,
I should be grateful 
they were there at all, 
for that moment 
that childhood stretched 
like fog, the beach empty
and unmarked.

It comes to little now
who I forgive, mourn, 
or thank. The dust shifts 
and we are barely 
suspended in the light. 

I know this little thing:
there's a boy somewhere 
in a station where 
the trains still run,
wearing scuffed brown shoes, 
gray overcoat, and cap;
someone has neatly parted
and combed his hair. 
He is waiting 
to be taken by the hand
and told where we are going, 
to hear we are headed home-- 
though I can see nothing 
beyond the smoke 
and midnight haze 
at the far end 
of the platform, 
where I am not
even sure of the stars.





The Dream of a Lacquer Box
 

I wish I knew the contents and I wish the contents
Japanese --

like hairpins made of tortoiseshell or bone
though my braid was lopped off long ago,

like an overpowering pine incense
or a talisman from a Kyoto shrine,

like a Hello Kitty diary-lock-and-key,
Hello Kitty stickers or candies,

a netsuke in the shape of an octopus,
ticket stubs from the Bunraku --

or am I wishing for Mother? searching for Sister?
just hoping to give something Japanese to my daughters?

then again, people can read anything into dreams

and I do as well. I wish I possessed 
my mother's black lacquer box

though in my dream it was red,
though I wish my heart were content.





The Dream of a Fire Engine
 

Without the sun filtered through closed eyelids,
without the siren along the service road,

without Grandpa's ginger-colored hair,
Mother's lipstick, Daughter's manicure, 

firecrackers, a monkey's ass, a cherry, Rei's lost elephant,
without communist or past tense,

or a character seeing her own chopped-off feet dancing in fairy slippers,
or Mao's favorite novel about a chamber --

the scientist of sleep has claimed 
that without warm blood a creature cannot dream.





A Bowl of Spaghetti
 

"To find a connectome, or the mental makeup of a person,
researchers experimented with the neurons of a worm

then upgraded to mouse hoping 
"to unravel the millions of miles of wire in the [human] brain

that they liken to "untangling a bowl of spaghetti

of which I have an old photo: Rei in her high chair delicately
picking out each strand to mash in her mouth.

Was she two? Was that sailor dress from Mother?
Did I cook from scratch? If so, there was a carrot in the sauce

as Mother instructed and I'll never forget 
since some strand determines infatuation as a daughter's fate.





One Life
 

I don't know when I stopped believing in heaven,
or if I do. Maybe I just stopped receiving heaven.

The sun rose. I climbed into the pines' brittle
crowns. You could say I was retrieving heaven.

Not a place or a time, but blindness to everything 
but one light, pulsing, pleasing: heaven.

We married in September. Everyone was still
wearing their summer shirts, sleeves of heaven.

It was white, there was a bend, and the car 
spun. It was then I prayed, pleading with heaven.

When he goes limp, lie him down on the gurney,
Mom. Oxygen mask, breathing heaven.

The hospital shines, our son flies in and out.
The snow falls hard, relieving heaven.

He loves the colors of planets. I teach him 
their lifelessness: beautiful, deceiving heaven.

I don't know who is buried beneath me
but I hear her break as I am leaving heaven.

How can you cry for one ruined life, Maria,
when you could be grieving for heaven?





What This Is
 

This isn't maths --
perhaps it is
a collapse
of certainties.

Perhaps it can't
configure planes,
yet it can cloud
our blue remains

so when we fall
as rain will do,
nothing fails
to carry through.





Ace
 

Bloody hell, the world's turned 
upside down

the flame tree has become
geranium

my coral bed has grown
into a tree

the hummingbird you hammered
to the wall

though tin, could any moment
turn and flee.

The yellow sky has gone
all roundabout

and clover threes where
seaweed used to be

and blood blossoms with fire,
the powers below grow higher --
if things turn right-way-up
will the falling fire stop?

The wave is in the hill
the nest abandons me
and all the reddened earth is still 

igniting





What Is a Person
 

capable of feeling
while in contact with another?

I look at the red-tiled roofs outside,
at all the angles

facing the white-blue cloudless sky
like the creases in Bellini's angel's

silver-blue dress, Tintoretto's white one
that's practically transparent in his

Annunciazione at the San Rocco
-- cloth complex as thought!

Then the bells start, flood the void.





Just Now Between Positions
 

These, his last, 
                          employers, dead
Inexplicably and
Unavailable 
              to praise his diligence, 

Cast a shadow on his prospects, and he sighed. 
Before all this, he 
Would have lit a pipe and 
                          mused on the past 
In aromatic mauve tobacco...Shadows 
Baffled pleasantly 
              the better rug 

Once a bear. 
                          Grizzly bear. 
He would have enjoyed a smoke with a bear. 
Hibernation is 
              not unlike a job you fail to love. 

He would have enjoyed 
Some banter on, and amiable disputation of, 
His claim. Or
                          on job loss, in general; 
On night air, the fanfare above a curve, a star,
If suitably 
              asparkle in public.





Inventory
 

We gaze into your eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes.
We forget the display is blind.

Your fanned tail really a cupped palm, 
gathering each hen's quiver to your ear,

your feathers the green-blue glamours of 
reflective absence. No one

ever praises the ass of the peacock,
grin of quills that does the heavy lifting,

or how you eat anything from ants
to Styrofoam, from cheese to chicken.

Road roamer, flower devourer: 
the one who'll pick a fight with a goat.

Preen all you want. What I love of you
will be the bare undercarriage, 

the calamus. I am done with beauty. 
Only a blinking eye can measure the light.





Pencil
 

My drawing teacher said: Look, think, make a mark.
Look, I told myself.
And waited to be marked.

Clouds are white but they darken
with rain. Even a child blurs them back
to little woolies on a hillside, little
bundles without legs. Look, my teacher
would surely tell me, they're nothing

like that. Like that: the lie. Like that: the poem.
She said: Respond to the heaviest part
of the figure first. Density is 
form. That I keep hearing destiny

is not a mark of character. Like pilgrimage 
once morphed to mirage in a noisy room, someone 
so earnest at my ear. Then marriage slid.
Mir-aage, Mir-aage, I heard the famous poet let loose 
awry into her microphone, triumphant.

The figure to be drawn --
not even half my age. She's completely 
emptied her face for this job of standing still an hour. 
Look. Okay. But the little

dream in there, inside the think
that comes next. A pencil in my hand, its secret life 
is charcoal, the wood already burnt,
a sacrifice.





Crystal Meth Under Her Choir Robe
 

No surprise. Bills to pay, pain to obliterate,
a favor to a friend desperate 
for more time before facing facts,
or a reason less beholden to One-day-at-a-time 
or I-don't-know-why or There-is-no-why-
I-just-like-getting-high or Then-Jesus-spoke-to-me
blather. Nothing's enough, not even the moments 
when her voice -- any voice, my voice --
vanishes into the Voice the hymn
wrenches from the throats of the spiritual
paupers up there swaying in black satin.
The God of the Garden is the God
of Chemistry, too, a single sniff
in a lifetime proof enough -- nothing
can slough errands or heartbreak
so fast into the metaphysical ditch 
where all of it belongs. Weren't we made 
for better than the Fall, if Fall this is? 
We all see what the Flood keeps doing.
A little while dry, please, a little while
with no chattering chimp between
the ears & the Wizard once more in Oz.
This is my mind, not hers. She's a story 
I heard. I'm a story I can't stop hearing. 
A plastic tarp in a monsoon may be
her future. A plush ride home to havoc.
A vision that delivers her from want,
deserving or not.





Fourth of July
 

Freedom is a rocket,
isn't it, bursting
orgasmically over
parkloads of hot
dog devouring
human beings
or into the cities
of our enemies
without whom we
would surely
kill ourselves
though they are
ourselves and
America I see now
is the soldier
who said I saw
something
burning on my
chest and tried
to brush it off with
my right hand
but my arm
wasn't there--
America is no
other than this
moment, the
burning ribcage,
the hand gone
that might have
put it out, the skies
afire with our history.





from You, part I
 

for Pat Silliman
I
 
Hard dreams. The moment at which you recognize that your own death lies
in wait somewhere within your body. A lone ship defines the horizon. The
rain is not safe to drink.
 
In Grozny, in Bihac, the idea of history shudders with each new explosion.
The rose lies unattended, wild thorns at the edge of a mass grave. Between
classes, over strong coffee, young men argue the value of a pronoun.
 
When this you see, remember. Note in a bottle bobs in a cartoon sea. The
radio operator's name is Sparks.
 
Hand outlined in paint on a brick wall. Storm turns playground into a
swamp. Finally we spot the wood duck on the middle lake.
 
The dashboard of my car like the keyboard of a piano. Toy animals anywhere.
 
Sun swells in the morning sky.
 
Man with three pens clipped to the neck of his sweatshirt shuffles from one
table to the next, seeking distance from the cold January air out the coffee
house door, tall Styrofoam cup in one hand, Of Grammatology in the other.
Outside, a dog is tied to any empty bench, bike chained to the No Parking
sign.





from You, part XII
 

for Pat Silliman
XII
 
A guide to the sky under full nondisclosure.
 
Dawn in the bare birch trees, the sun, swollen, throbs over the horizon. Hotel
buffet doodah. Two dogs dancing, sniffing one another's genitalia.
 
One can hear the electricity wired in the walls, water rushing through the
pipes, the boards and joints of the old house groaning as they settle.
 
Map of morning. Winter light. One's experience of the transfer point air-
port as that of the city itself. Dear winter, it's 5:15 AM. Shoes for Mickey
Mouse.
 
Waste deep in the big muddy. The sound of rain around. The line (not visible)
binds letters into words. People are drowning.
 
Moon, broken in the middle. What a watch watches. Song of the single en-
gine Cessna, threading the pre-dawn sky. One bird, one bird, many.
 
Blades of grass brittle in the freeze. Spider's corner of the bath room. One
maple tree that will not return to life.





To My Mother
 

Because I feel that, in the Heavens above,
The angels, whispering to one another,
Can find, among their burning terms of love,
None so devotional as that of "Mother,
Therefore by that dear name I long have called you--
You who are more than mother unto me,
And fill my heart of hearts, where Death installed you
In setting my Virginia's spirit free.
My mother--my own mother, who died early,
Was but the mother of myself; but you
Are mother to the one I loved so dearly,
And thus are dearer than the mother I knew
By that infinity with which my wife
Was dearer to my soul than its soul-life.





What to Say Upon Being Asked to Be Friends
 

Why speak of hate, when I do bleed for love?
 Not hate, my love, but Love doth bite my tongue
 Till I taste stuff that makes my rhyming rough
 So flatter I my fever for the one
 For whom I inly mourn, though seem to shun.
 A rose is arrows is eros, so what
 If I confuse the shade that I've become
 With winedark substance in a lover's cup?
 But stop my tonguely wound, I've bled enough.
 If I be fair, or false, or freaked with fear
 If I my tongue in lockd box immure
 Blame not me, for I am sick with love.
      Yet would I be your friend most willingly
      Since friendship would infect me killingly.





[Trying to see the proportional relation]
 

Trying to see the proportional relation
 Of one memory to another
 One is so strange, and then
 To try and see what looms
 And doesn't for the other person
 Who was there, it gets stranger,
 Especially when you've read
 His email.
 I don't know how people
 Understand their lives, measure
 Their sensations against "objective
 Or so-to-speak democratic estimations,
 Whether people accept the externality
 Of events, "events, as things
 That happen to them. I refuse
 To accept some coagulate
 Of other people's
 Impressions in exchange for this
 Privacy, no matter how flawed it is.
 This is lyric poetry. It has to be. It has
 No other hope. What was it
 About you and me that made whatever 
 Happen to us. In New York
 Everything fell apart. What I dreaded
 And expected.
 But still. Tonight
 It is dark and the weather is cooler
 Than it's been. It has taken
 A while for Fall to break; the global
 Warming kept me in summer
 Love with you like I was under a
 Fermata. Now that the times
 Are changing, I feel
 Even more for you; or I feel nothing.
 I can't tell; it's kind
 Of scary. I was sick of thinking
 About you this morning but
 I was listening to Bob Dylan and Leonard
 Cohen in order to think about
 You for literary purposes.
 When I feel nothing for a person
 I get scared I'm losing my humanity
 And that turning cold means 
 My heart's been botoxed: we're
 All fucked.
 I watched a movie on YouTube
 Called Ladies and Gentlemen, Mister
 Leonard Cohen that was made when
 He was still just a poet and only 
 Famous in Canada.
 He's a pretentious little nerd
 In it, self-important, teacher's pet wit.
 I think that, making music, he became
 So much nakeder, much more desperate.
 The talent, real, even pure, even
 Natural, had to ripen in
 The artificial man.
 Alain Badiou, on the day
 Of his class, said, "Because an event
 Is pure rapture, an event disappears
 Immediately: it does not exist
 Objectively, but only by appearing
 And disappearing. This is both
 Precise and vague; it is attractive
 I guess. I guess since you and me did not
 Disappear immediately, it was
 Not pure rapture, not in these
 Terms, but my smile
 Was real each time I swallowed
 Your cum. Getting
 Fucked by you was great; I could
 Feel it in my organs, but
 You didn't make me go insane
 Except for maybe once 
 Or twice. Actually maybe I am
 Being unfair. Maybe the fucking really
 Was that great. In this moment I
 Can't remember.
 I just read a poetry
 Review in which the reviewer
 States that a certain book
 Made his cock feel as though
 It were tall as a tree. That's
 Nice. I have no idea
 What it feels like to have
 A cock. Sometimes I feel
 As though I'm getting close
 To understanding and then
 Something happens to make
 Me have no clue again. When Sinan
 Fucks me, we lose our individuality
 So severely it's like we're both
 Gasping after an animal that's his
 Cock that is beyond us and I lose
 All sense of the world. His cock's
 Not even him, and he's not him either
 And we aren't anything.
 It's strange, the possessive. Didn't Thomas
 Mann write a book called Herr
 Und Hund or something like that?
 Man's best friend. What belongs
 To him. Me and Sunder 
 Talked about how scary and arousing
 It is to watch men masturbate, cos
 Everyone relates differently to his.
 Like dicks are always almost but never
 Quite another. Je est un autre,
 Said that brat Arthur Rimbaud.
 I am definitely in love with you
 As I write this. You are so petty
 And superfluous I cannot stand
 You. Sinan is definitely
 In love with me. I know, because
 I saw him tonight. I love
 Him too. You are gracious
 To accord me the space and time
 In which to develop, or to elaborate 
 Upon, as the French say, these
 Extreme emotions I am, despite
 The odds and certain lapses,
 So capable of feeling.
 It was good to slap
 Your face and to admit
 That your asshole 
 Made me nervous.
 Your eyes had a way 
 Of going soft and shiny
 When you said the really
 Tender things. We admitted
 It was intimidating
 For us both to hear each other describe
 People we've fucked and been
 In love with. I'm proud of what
 We accomplished together. Alain Badiou
 Ended his class with a reading
 Of "Ariane et Barbe-Bleue which
 Is an opera by Paul Dukas. You
 And me had gone pretty far
 By the time this day came, and
 Something very fragile in me breaks
 When somebody says my name, or
 Even a variant of it. I was tired.
 I think Badiou discusses "Ariane
 In Being and Event which
 I have not read. In class he said
 That the story of the opera is 
 About the relationship between law
 And freedom, and that it shows
 That the desire for freedom is not
 So simple. Ariane experiences an Event
 That causes her to demand freedom, Badiou
 Said, but she is unable to convince anybody
 Else, any other women to want freedom; she ends up alone.
 She genuinely falls in love with the wicked 
 Bluebeard at the beginning. Bluebeard
 Who previously got women by having a castle
 To lock them in. This woman Ariane
 Does not have to be taken
 By force. When she enters
 His castle he hands
 Her seven keys, six
 Of which he gives her permission
 To use, and leaves. She hears the cries
 Of his other, imprisoned wives,
 Coming from behind a door. So she uses
 The forbidden key, releasing them.
 Meanwhile Bluebeard is assaulted
 By the local peasants, who want
 To free Ariane, fearing her fate will turn out like
 That of the women who came before her.
 But Ariane is already free
 In herself, and proves this freedom
 By bringing the wounded Bluebeard
 Home, caring tenderly for him, and then
 Declaring that she's leaving him for good.
 By the end Bluebeard's shattered, sobbing, 
 Bleeding. Ariane
 Invites the other wives to leave with her
 In a wrenching aria, pleading
 With them one by one to taste
 With her the freedom awaiting 
 Them, The World. But they all prefer confinement
 Even though they had longed
 For freedom before Ariane opened
 Their door. Once liberty arrived they were no
 Longer capable of it, preferring to serve; even a gutted,
 Hollowed-out power. Ariane exits
 Alone. The end. Badiou narrated
 This with emotion and 
 I cried. Maybe cos I was tired and
 That thing about my name or because
 I am not heroic or free.
 I had missed half of Alain Badiou's
 Lectures messing around with you
 On the couch by the fire; in the women's
 Toilets; up on the hill. If this were a suitable parable,
 And it isn't, I would try to tell myself
 That those very early mornings in Brooklyn when I sat
 Up in your bed feeling wrong and
 Got dressed and walked away, I should
 Have stayed away cos I don't need you.
 Maybe I don't need you. But I want
 You. Maybe I don't love you. But
 I am getting to know you. Maybe
 What made me cry in class was how tired
 I was and how sad and hard
 It is, and how rare, to undertake an act
 That's truly free, and not just a response
 To a confused surge of drives and  fears.





Science Fiction
 

Just now I touched my chest
 And felt my heart quivering there.
 This must be one of the bad times.
  
 I think it is quivering with remorse
 And exhaustion. Once I saw a heart
 Beating in a documentary. I was a very
  
 Little girl and the sight disgusted me.
 Throbbing and not stopping my heart betrays
 Me and yet remains sure and true, a thing
  
 Of nature. Earth bleeding 
 Its guts out on the sea floor exhausts
 Me with remorse and shame, and yet I have to trust it
  
 As wealth is proven by how terribly it devastates
 Itself, and I am but one symptom among billions of the wealth
 Of Earth. A tired feeling that is recuperated by a passing spaceship
  
 Or an infinitude like fame but more universal. I will have to miss you
 Earth; I miss you already. And yet when I touch myself whom I should
 Not trust it is still only the heaviest and most jealous feelings that bind me to you, like blood.





The Four Seasons
 

Eight stars make
 A soft solfege
  
 Above this motel
 Where there are never
  
 Stars.
 I let a skinny man
  
 Put his long thick dick in me for you
 So we could break our hearts
  
 The way you want me to. Somewhere a white
 Wall stretches up behind the backs of a tribe
  
 Whose obscurity protects its secret from the common
 World and the connivances it ordains.
  
 What time is it. What season is it.
 I don't know.
  
 The moon blows green
 Gas into my skull
  
 I want to hide what I dream
 In a big boot, and wear the boot
  
 And starve as I lean upon the boot of my destitution
 And drag
  
 The truth as a gimp would drag the weight of her body.
 That would give me a feeling of honesty.





[Love]
 

          
          LoveIs an interruption or an aberration, a force in opposition to the ultimate inertia of the universe,   Wrote Marguerite Duras.   Whether or not it is worth it it occurs. Whether or not it is to be believed it is.   The wind moves us without a frond being needed to be held by a slave girl.   The rudiments of sentences are ancient without a mouth needing to remember  what it is losing as it lets those words out, something eviller than what they even mean right now, something too evil to be known right now   Or ever.   I feel sure that even the most culpable people have other qualities secreted  away   Adjusting their garments in light of fate   He turned his head upward, he looked up the white wall. The light from the lamp could be light coming from a great distance, it could be a great distance away, and the wall could be snow it is so beautiful, he said. His head looking up the wall, his eyes looking up it, he said, that nail in the wall could also be  beautiful, for so far away.
        




Cool Dust
 

A heave of afternoon light pulls a tulip from the turf, a bower for locusts, a cup of shells. The farmhouse tilts, a bent shadow on wheels. In cedar rooms a family is molded, silent, wrapped in the wire of steel eyes and stopped voice, romantic ash. This is not my house, my ghost, my uninvited guest, my lost labor of love, my thicket or grease, my JPEG gessoed or rawhide suit. The yellow light throbs like an internal organ -- soft body of an overture to insect sounds -- sapling of a new world -- whose future awaits me at the tilting window of my own domestic hut. Perhaps this is my mesh of hours, my muscular ache, my guardian sash, twist of rope carved around an old maple trunk, my rod of power red with anticipatory friction at the edge of an emerging set of planetary rings. Stained ochre by the air I pitch forward, a vanilla-scented pear that floats or falls. In the rattan chair on the front porch by the blistered boards of the front door a figure of tar watches. Cool dust sparkles and settles. Shadows have made me visible. An empty wagon flares on the hillside.





Plume
 

Transfixed to the, by the, on the congruities, who is herself a vanishing point coming to closure -- dusky flutter -- trilling away like a watchdog on drugged sop, channeling her mother and grandmother who've engraved on her locket phrases in script: "glide on a blade and "rustling precedes the shuck. This is not my teeming fate, my rind, my roiling ellipsis or valedictory spray of myrrh. Always it's morning, afternoon or evening -- the loot of hours -- a magic sack grasping vacuum but heavy in the hand, and from which, together, we pull a swarm of telepathic bees, melons beached in a green bin, a lithograph of the city from its crumbling ramparts, crackled pitchers and the mouth of a cave. Perhaps this is my open weave, my phantom rialto or plume of light. We bow to each other in the mash of flickering things. We are completely surrounded.





Then
 

Once we were in the loop . . . slick with information and the luster of good timing. We folded our clothes. Once we stood up before the standing vigils, before the popping vats, before the annotated lists of marshaled forces with their Venn diagrams like anxious zygotes, their paratactic chasms . . . before the set of whirligig blades, modular torrent. We folded our clothes. Once we remembered to get up to pee . . . and how to pee in a gleaming bowl . . . soaked as we were in gin and coconut, licorice water with catalpa buds, golden beet syrup in Johnny Walker Blue and a beautiful blur like August fog, cantilevered over the headlands . . . We tucked into the crevices of the mattress pad twirling our auburn braids, or woke up at the nick of light and practiced folding our clothes. Our pod printed headbands with hourly updates, announcing the traversals of green-shouldered hawks through the downtown loop, of gillyfish threading the north canals, of the discovery of electron calligraphy or a new method of washing brine. We smoothed our feathers like birds do, and twitched ourselves into warm heaps, and followed the fourth hand on the platinum clocks sweeping in arcs from left to right, up and down, in and out . . . We were steeped in watchfulness, fully suspended, itinerant floaters -- ocean of air -- among  the ozone lily pads and imbrex domes, the busting thickets of nutmeg, and geode malls. At night we told stories about the future with clairvoyant certainty. Our clothing was spectacular and fit to a T. We admired each other with ferocity.





Nobaude
 

          
          I left you last evening without the usual privileges. A lot of what my body was was toxin, that held me aloft in idle price, far from the witless wood and Arcadia. There's no more moon for birds to buss at over streetlamps. Urchins make their way in the mist, trolling for dinner rolls. How frugal my recent times were spent, the clocks keeping how stoned a content. There'll be much better dawns than this forthcoming.   Now--silver morning, body trussed across a sphere--what would Salome do? A certain Grace is coming toward you and xe is lovely. The troposphere might solder the iron we sought here, the sky is neither an abaude.   What Portia lacks is not anatomical, but philosophical: bitter is my sustenance, melancholy my food, sorry my wine.' Expressive geometrics of the New York sissy--and with such a disfunctional phone! Portia tells her students get thee to a muhfuckery, where I'll lay thee fool across my lap.   P meets Sally's longings, her shoes untied, and everything about her demonstrating a careless desolation, a blue eye and sunken. Take one step further and the Grace coming toward you is Beauty. The Grace turned away from you is Restraint. Hassan pleading for her life, fainting, having a bucket of water thrown on her, reviving.   Nothing but a farce, we animate Wall and Moon. The art is cruxy to the love-juice. Once there was many a sight, but now they are wilting, poor lambs. Once a malapert downpour, uncharacteristic of the rains of this place. Next football, a hemistich. The belle lettrist's idea of a billet-doux, the scientist's idea of a sauna.   What with their consummate barbeque wines, their tawdry dance moves, their go-go girls of yesteryear--we thought the Impressionists were trying to impress people. Fez--an impossibility the universe grew out of. Flaubert saying, Madame Bovary, c'est moi. Loeretta casting her lots.
        




Sloughing Off the Gentlemanly Sports
 

What makes that fox so grabby for the stars,
 Begging like boys do? I meant to fully
 Gild that lily, till less like virile Mars
 It's clepd the pansiest of pansy,
 The caducous calyx of a poppy.
 Cuz, step into these arms where you belong
 A coup at the prospect of this lording,
 A gleam in the gloom with serpentine song--
 The phosphorescent tide's mine to lavish upon.
  
 O stop me at the very vestibule--
 Before whom, and in what habit I speak
 I watched them use their meat to call me fool.
 Someone's cage is aching at the seams,
 The noisome idle falls to dirty dreams--
 Thus the flummoxed drunk of xem will coil
 And I'll learn the real, or it'll learn me,
 Making free with the Italian model
 The single summer shower mano  mano.
  
 The proverbial number of angels
 That could've fit on the head of a pin
 Are crying to the myriad angles,
 This glassy labyrinth we happened in
 Will not undo the errancer I've been.
 Soon the swancrest, the feedcrest, my distress
 Will feign to fuck the furlonged mannequin--
 At what--punishing pace we undress
 This crapshoot ide fixe and its yahoo mistress.
  
 Fictive trees harsh the billow of my cape,
 All kind of lovers crashed rubbernecking.
 The fishes on the frontispiece were draped
 In your leafy worded velocity.
 You whisper, London has no more fog for me
 To whit, my darksome peachpit! storms above
 --A buckler to them that walks uprightly--
 Will not enforce this porno hand from glove
 Or diminish one jott my vegetable love.





The Promise
 

Stay, I said 
to the cut flowers. 
They bowed 
their heads lower.

Stay, I said to the spider, 
who fled.

Stay, leaf. 
It reddened, 
embarrassed for me and itself.

Stay, I said to my body. 
It sat as a dog does, 
obedient for a moment, 
soon starting to tremble.

Stay, to the earth 
of riverine valley meadows, 
of fossiled escarpments, 
of limestone and sandstone. 
It looked back 
with a changing expression, in silence.

Stay, I said to my loves. 
Each answered, 
Always.





[Deeply repentant of my sinful ways]
 

Deeply repentant of my sinful ways
And of my trivial, manifold desires,
Of squandering, alas, these few brief days
Of fugitive life in tending love's vain fires,
To Thee, Lord, Who dost move hard hearts again,
And render warmth unto the frozen snow,
And lighten every bitter load of pain
For those who with Thy sacred ardours glow,
   To Thee I turn, O stretch forth Thy right hand
And from this whirlpool rescue me, for I
Without Thine aid could never reach the land;
O willingly for us didst suffer loss,
And to redeem mankind hung on the Cross,
O gentle Saviour, leave me not to die.





Collaboration
 

I am being paraded through the streets with my head shaved,
with no memory of what I have done to deserve this.
 
I run a gauntlet of women who call me slut and whore,
staggering under their fusillade of accusation:
 
What stories did I tell, what lies? What names did I reveal?
What men did I sleep with? What did I do? For what reward?
 
Or in a catacomb deep under Paris they press gloves
of barbed wire on to my bare hands, and when the wounds have healed
 
they point to the brambles left on my palms, saying, Surely
these lines of head and heart and mind are those of a traitor.
 
When you wake I hold you tight, saying, It's only a dream,
the language of dream has nothing to do with that of life.
 
And as eventually you sink back into the deep well
of sleep, I wonder if by my words I have betrayed you.





The Fetch
 

I woke. You were lying beside me in the double bed,
prone, your long dark hair fanned out over the downy pillow.
 
I'd been dreaming we stood on a beach an ocean away
watching the waves purl into their troughs and tumble over.
 
Knit one, purl two, you said. Something in your voice made me think
of women knitting by the guillotine. Your eyes met mine.
 
The fetch of a wave is the distance it travels, you said,
from where it is born at sea to where it founders to shore.
 
I must go back to where it all began. You waded in
thigh-deep, waist-deep, breast-deep, head-deep, until you disappeared.
 
I lay there and thought how glad I was to find you again.
You stirred in the bed and moaned something. I heard a footfall
 
on the landing, the rasp of a man's cough. He put his head
around the door. He had my face. I woke. You were not there.





The Story of Madame Chevalier
 

You remember the Incredible Shrinking Man? I said.
Well, last night I dreamed I was him. It began the same way.
 
The shirt cuffs were the first thing that came to my attention,
drooping down over my knuckles in the bedroom mirror.      
 
And my waistband and shoes were getting looser by the day.
Within weeks you could perch me on your knee like a male doll.
 
Later you would put me to bed in the empty matchbox.
You failed to watch for the spider that came to explore me.
 
I fought her with a darning needle, a button my shield.
She retreated from me on a thread. I followed her down
 
to the cellar. How I made my way back I'll never know.
It took me days to travel over the quilt to your hand.
 
No longer a hand but an Alpine range of sleeping flesh.
I crawled into an open pore and entered your bloodstream.





The New Estate
 

Forget the corncrake's elegy. Rusty
Iambics that escaped your discipline
Of shorn lawns, it is sustained by nature.
It does not grieve for you, nor for itself.
You remember the rolled gold of cornfields,
Their rustling of tinsel in the wind,
A whole field quivering like blown silk?
 
A shiver now runs through the laurel hedge,
And washing flutters like the swaying lines
Of a new verse. The high fidelity
Music of the newly-wed obscures your
Dedication to a life of loving
Money. What could they be for, those marble
Toilet fixtures, the silence of water-beds,
That book of poems you bought yesterday?





Campaign
 

They had questioned him for hours. Who exactly was he? And when
He told them, they questioned him again. When they accepted who he was, as
Someone not involved, they pulled out his fingernails. Then
They took him to a waste-ground somewhere near the Horseshoe Bend, and told him
What he was. They shot him nine times.
 
A dark umbilicus of smoke was rising from a heap of burning tyres.
The bad smell he smelt was the smell of himself. Broken glass and knotted Durex.
The knuckles of a face in a nylon stocking. I used to see him in the Gladstone Bar,
Drawing pints for strangers, his almost perfect fingers flecked with scum.





H
 

The Powers-that-Be decreed that from the--of--the sausage rolls, for reasons
Of security, would be contracted to a different firm. They gave the prisoners no reasons.
 
The prisoners complained. We cannot reproduce his actual words here, since their spokesman is alleged
To be a sub-commander of a movement deemed to be illegal.
 
An actor spoke for him in almost-perfect lip-synch: It's not the quality
We're giving off about. Just that it seems they're getting smaller. We're talking quantity. 
 
His Belfast' accent wasn't West enough. Is the H in H-Block aitch or haitch?
Does it matter? What we have we hold? Our day will come? Give or take an inch?
 
Well, give an inch and someone takes an effing mile. Everything is in the ways
You say them. Like, the prison that we call Long Kesh is to the Powers-that-Be The Maze.





Labuntur et Imputantur
 

It was overcast. No hour at all was indicated by the gnomon.
With difficulty I made out the slogan, Time and tide wait for no man.
 
I had been waiting for you, Daphne, underneath the dripping laurels, near
The sundial glade where first we met. I felt like Hamlet on the parapets of Elsinore,
 
Alerted to the ectoplasmic moment, when Luna rends her shroud of cloud
And sails into a starry archipelago. Then your revenant appeared and spake aloud:
 
I am not who you think I am. For what we used to be is gone. The moment's over, 
Whatever years you thought we spent together. You don't know the story. And moreover, 
 
You mistook the drinking-fountain for a sundial. I put my lips to its whatever,
And with difficulty I made out the slogan, Drink from me and you shall live forever.





Parchment, Please
 

Near the year
1000
we find
Maximos Planudes
nude
writing to a friend
in Asia Minor
asking for parchment
because the right quality
is not for sale
in his own neighborhood,
presumably Constantinople.
 
In the end,
all he receives
are some asses' skins,
which do not please
him in the least,
and a note:
 
                                                      Dear Max,
 
                                                      No parchment
                                                      till the summer,
                                                      months after the population
                                                      begins to eat meat.
                                                      Low yield
                                                      should come as no surprise,
                                                      our medieval animals
                                                      being much smaller
                                                      than their modern
                                                      counterparts.
 
                                                      Love,
                                                      A. Minor





Kaymakamlar Gezi Evi, Selamlik Odasi
 

This is the room.
Where mole guests are welcomed.
At this moment you see the wedding table prepared for the mole guests.
 
Rooms are heated with stoves.
Rooms have been designed according to the patriarchal way of living.
The family has, consists of, father, mather, sons and brides.
There is no sex discrimination within the family.
They artogether, have meal and altogether chat, but when the doors are clased.
 
Mole guests are welcomed in "Selamlik part.
Femole guests are welcomed in "Harem part.
On such occasions mole guests are served via the cupboard in the wall
               which turns on its axis.





Palinode
 

O dove, fly to Aleppo with my Byzantine ode And take my greeting to my kinsman.                                                  Mahmoud Darwish
Before I was born, I saw a tissue of ingenious detours, an inextricable tangle
wreathed with mistake.
 
Perhaps the ghost does not limp away, but rather forests flee me, frightened.
Look, they are setting a place for loss, clearing the table for the first glow of
antiquity.
 
Here we see William T. Walters in his little library illuminated, carefully
smoothing the lip of the continent.
 
What form bounds forward from behind but The Atlantic Railroad Coastline Co.?
The whole Roman Empire was sold by ascending auction in 193 A.D.
 
A globe enclosed. Bottomless years. The train has stopped on the platform and no
one is there, for these are the Public Days, when the "Poor Association claims the
museum's building.
 
As if bound by the knots of invention, I found a wrong road dotted with weeds
and sorrows.





Pantoum
 

Perhaps the universe is an extinguished building
with blue banners strung along
and the forest, more like a commodity
bordering bushes and asphalt,
 
something else to string our blue banners on.
Never was restoration swifter:
the leafless trees, the asphalt
less splintered and more splendid.
 
Never was restoration swifter
with its mightier solutions,
less splintered and more splendid
snipers, dynamiters, colorful bombs.
 
We please ourselves with mightier solutions,
picnics under blue spruces
snipers, dynamiters, colorful bombs
the guardians of what we might call "home rights.
 
At picnics, under blue spruces
we clamor after the news
and its employees, the guardians of "home rights
"the media mustering "one mind.
 
It's news,
the decision to nobly save rather than meanly lose
some pretense of mustering "one mind
secures its truth.
 
The decision to nobly save rather than meanly lose
our flag
secures its truth
as a squirrel secures its nuts by hiding them in the ground.
 
Our flag--
a souvenir of having been here before
a squirrel's nuts, deep in the ground.
But travel, travail, and The Method's mistakes
 
all souvenirs of having been here before,
haunt us and taunt us and call us names. 
But travail, travel, and Method's mistakes
mark a different season, nuts rotting, bulbs blooming.
 
Each season haunts us and taunts us and calls us names
until finally the universe is an extinguished building,
a different season, nuts rotting, bulbs blooming
and the forest, a commodity.





[In the very night of movement where I]
 

In the very night of movement where I
sought a sequential self 
The sea as blood, thought as
Earth that changes the sea
 
Changes the fishes in it
for the fortunes of landscapes
are in the fantasies
of architecture
 
H --        taught to sing
siren scales by ear
by rote or immersion
abroad
 
In the discrepancy of double exposure
Casts of light crack time's microscope





Family Stories
 

I had a boyfriend who told me stories about his family, 
how an argument once ended when his father 
seized a lit birthday cake in both hands 
and hurled it out a second-story window. That,
I thought, was what a normal family was like: anger 
sent out across the sill, landing like a gift 
to decorate the sidewalk below. In mine 
it was fists and direct hits to the solar plexus,
and nobody ever forgave anyone. But I believed 
the people in his stories really loved one another, 
even when they yelled and shoved their feet 
through cabinet doors, or held a chair like a bottle 
of cheap champagne, christening the wall,
rungs exploding from their holes. 
I said it sounded harmless, the pomp and fury 
of the passionate. He said it was a curse 
being born Italian and Catholic and when he 
looked from that window what he saw was the moment 
rudely crushed. But all I could see was a gorgeous 
three-layer cake gliding like a battered ship 
down the sidewalk, the smoking candles broken, sunk 
deep in the icing, a few still burning.







Scythe
 

In the barn demoted to garage,
the ax in a cherry stump can't be budged.

Daylight perforates siding despite
the battered armor of license plates--

corroded colors, same state: decay,
their dates the only history 

of whoever tilled the soil 
and left, as a welcome, the skull 

of a possum nailed to the door, and the trail
of lime to the torn sack  

in a corner where cobwebs festoon a scythe.
Rusted sharp, it sings 

when he grips its splintery handle, swings, 
and crowns topple from Queen Anne's lace.





The Supplicant
 

prays for birds
before an ancient icon--
a stray cat.
The inbred need
to pray
is what makes God
necessary,
and not, she says,
the other way
around;
beyond that
it's all mystery,
so don't question
why Man creates gods
that demand
sacrifice,
condemning mortals
to spend their lives
trying to praise
godhead into mercy.
Better instead
to ask the frog
to bless the fly,
and, once the cheese
is in the trap,
to beg forgiveness
from the rat.





Their Story
 

They were nearing the end of their story.
The fire was dying, like the fire in the story.
Each page turned was torn and fed
to flames, until word by word the book 
burned down to an unmade bed of ash. 
Wet kindling from an orchard of wooden spoons,  
snow stewing, same old wind on the Gramophone,
same old wounds. Turn up the blue dial
under the kettle until darkness boils
with fables, and mirrors defrost to the quick
before fogging with steam, and dreams
rattle their armor of stovepipes and ladles.
Boots in the corner kick in their sleep.
A jacket hangs from a question mark.





Christmas Trees
 

How should I now recall
the icy lace of the pane
like a sheet of cellophane,
or the skies of alcohol

poured over the saltbox town?
On that stony New England tableau,
the halo of falling snow
glared like a waxy crown.

Through blue frozen lots
my giant parents strolled,
wrapped tight against the cold
like woolen Argonauts,

searching for that tall
perfection of Scotch pine
from the hundreds laid in line
like the dead at Guadalcanal.

The clapboard village aglow
that starry stark December
I barely now remember,
or the brutish ache of snow

burning my face like quicklime.
Yet one thing was still missing.
I saw my parents kissing,
perhaps for the last time.





Heraclitean
 

In goes the cafeteria worker in her hairnet.
In goes the philosophy teacher
explaining the theory of eternal
return, and Anton Stadler with his clarinet,
still owing money to Mozart. In
goes Mozart. Everyone flopped into the creel
of the happy fisherman, everyone eaten.
Every river is Lethean,
so why should we care 
if it's not the same river? I hate
how everything changes, tree
to failing term paper, chatelaine
to beheaded plotter, drug dealer to narc.
The heart softening faster than cereal
but then hardening to a relic
which turns into another line
of depressed poetry to recite
to the next eager trainee
anxious to be more than lint.
Going up, you're also going down, so either
way, as your mother said, Be nice.
When she went in, she was very thin.
Earth, air, fire, water, mother.
Fish pulse slowly under the river ice.







Peach Farm
 

I'm thinking it's time to go back
to the peach farm or rather
the peach farm seems to be wanting me back
even though the work of picking, sorting,
the sticky perils and sudden swarms are done.
Okay, full disclosure, I've never
been on a peach farm, just glimpsed
from a car squat trees I assumed
were peach and knew a couple in school
who went off one summer, so they said, 
to work on a peach farm. She was pregnant,
he didn't have much intention, canvases
of crushed lightbulbs and screws in paste.
He'd gotten fired from the lunch counter
for putting too much meat
on the sandwiches of his friends
then ended up in Macy's in New York
selling caviar and she went home
I think to Scranton, two more versions
of never hearing from someone again.
I'd like to say the most important fruits
are within but that's the very sort of bullshit
one goes to the peach farm to avoid,
not just flight from quadratic equations,
waiting for the plumber,
finding out your insurance won't pay.
Everyone wants out of the spider's stomach.
Everyone wants to be part of some harvest
and stop coughing to death and cursing 
at nothing and waking up nowhere near
an orchard. Look at these baskets,
bashed about, nearly ruined with good employ.
Often, after you've spent a day on a ladder,
you dream of angels, the one with the trumpet
and free subscriptions to the New Yorker
or the archer, the oink angel, angel
of ten dollar bills found in the dryer
or the one who welcomes you in work gloves
and says if you're caught eating a single peach,
even windfall, you'll be executed.
Then laughs. It's okay, kiddo,
long as you're here, you're one of us.





Early Elegy: Smallpox
 

The world has certified itself rid of 
all but the argument: to eradicate or not 
the small stock of variola frozen, 
quarantined--a dormancy it has 
refused, just once, for a woman behind a sterile 
lens, her glass slide a clearest, most 
becoming pane. How could it resist slipping 
away with her, that discrete first pock?





Early Elegy: Headmistress
 

The word itself: prim, retired, its artifact 
her portrait above the fireplace, on her face 
the boredom she abhorred, then perfected, 
her hands held upward--their emptiness 
a revision, cigarette and brandy snifter 
painted, intolerably, out, to leave her this 
lesser gesture: What next? or shrugged Whatever.
From the waist down she was never there. 








And the Gauchos Sing
 

For Barry Silesky
Catalpas blooming up and down Catalpa Street, car alarms blooming 
up and down Waveland Avenue--an instant of nature without the narrative. 
O face-in-your-morning-juice, swimmer-in-an-old-wool-suit, 
we sit side by side on the steps smoking the same cigarette, 
watching children who live alone, women married to the wrong men.  

Here is your little dog roaming the alley. What will he do for love this time? 
The gauchos sing: "The silver lights of stars hurl themselves 
against the open pampas of Clark Street O tomato-in-a-woman's-palm, 
one millisecond following the next millisecond, "Heal thyself, 
the poem says, "Pick up your beggar's mat and walk. 

You hurl yourself into traffic. You talk to cops and street thugs;
they smile at their smartphones.  They strut in the sun like jackals 
after a kill. And the gauchos sing: "Everyone will finally leave you, fugitive. 
A cloud of pigeons cuts through the smog. Everyone will finally leave you.

When the bus comes we sing like sailors. A red sky presses you to its lips. 
I tell you that everything has already been written. You say 
on a long, difficult pilgrimage Basho wrote on his hat.





On a Picture by Czanne
 

There's no description in the braided stone,
the pear, the stone in the pear, the birchbark,
bread hills on the snowfall tablecloth.
The dog of work gnaws the day's short bone,
snarls a mountainside into lavender and green.
In the mind where objects vanish, almost is all.
Element of pitcher, sky, rockface, blank canvas
plastic and vast in one off-center patch.
To copy what's invisible, to improvise
a soul of things and remake solid life
into fresh anxious unlifelike form. 






New Endymion
 

She visits still too much, dressed in aromas
of fir needles, mango, mold: I still get lost
knowing she's close, me not getting younger
or more conscious. Sometimes I fantasticate
I'm broad awake: her witchy presence waits
for me to jump into her arms, but then she's just
an incoherent ache in sleep's freaked scenes.
I feel her frosty nitrogenous hands and wrists
vaporing nooses around my head and feet
and genitals, conjuring my drab hair
into a party bowl of oiled, desirable locks.
She makes me nervous, but what would I do
without her? So long as I can't have her,
I want her and this alarming manic frequency.
Then again, who wants to wake to change,
its pulped, smelly suit of meat, drawing flies?
My night-watch hot girl, moon-maiden, mom,
let me get just one night's sleep without regret,
released from your foxy ticklish fondlings,
your latest smell of windblown fresh-cut grass.





Skirts and Slacks
 

The .32 Special,
its Dutch Masters box,
still in their bedroom
closet, days after
my mother's death,
plus my father's
thirty years ago.
I used to practice
disarming, reloading,
putting it in my mouth
for fun. And so,
here it is again,
but (stupid woman,
Great Depression child
scrolling tens and twenties
in macaroni boxes)
loaded, half-cocked.
Oh yes, shoot the burglar
in the closet, the cat
in heat on the fence,
and Calvin Coolidge. She rose,
rammy, close to death,
cocked up in bed
as if pulleyed by heaven,
sometime past midnight.
I was there to watch
her eyes wake for a moment
enraged and hateful toward me.
Bone wooled with slights
of flesh, what certainty
in the body at its end?
And between here and there?
Breath stops, blood fades,
the comic head I'm lifting
from the pillow feels
too merely anatomical
and heavier than before.





The Shoe Box
 

A high school mash note's stammering lust.
Father and me, shirts and ties, snapshot glare,
and somehow graphed into that air
a young man's foolscap poem when a just,
loose joinery of words was all that mattered.
But then in last night's dream, she (mother, wife,
mash note's love?) tells me a box holding secret life
has been shipped, enclosing sounds I haven't heard:
a wind-harp's warp, words yarding across staves,
fluty sounds ribboned to sad, screechy tunes.
And things: a wishbone, ring, whatever I crave,
the heart-hollows, the cannot-do-withouts, the whens
and whos, the frayed veils between death and here...
I packed this box myself. I packed it full of fear.





Moving Things
 

My aunts mentioned her just once,
calling her my aunt, their sister,
though she wasn't. They mentioned
the vinyl recliner in the kitchen,
the "I Like Ike poster, the Sacred Heart,
cabbage smells, sulfur, and shame.

Before jolted by the gift that called
through but never really for her,
she became unpleasantly calm.
Moments later, after she said
"I don't want this please, God's love
raced down the pulse into her look.

It was as if her things spoke back:
a table leg scraped the floor, a fork
wobbled in a drawer, knickknacks fell.
She nearly died each time it happened.
They said her mind just wasn't there,
or she wasn't in it anymore.

She sat helpless afterward,
papery when they lifted her
from vision seat to bed. The might
to move what her eye fell upon
is the image of her I keep,
her iridescent readiness.





Brother Francis to Brother Leone
 

In my dream I watched it
from a windowsill Come see this
raptor's shadow hushed
down green-brick tenements
Bulk beak and feather struck
and tumbled aslant the air
with sparrow or chimney swift
Wilderness breathes wherever
we are and headed to O'Hare
late fall I saw on its vague
bare branch a goshawk
grace yes and auspicious terror
I should watch with him
I should be poorer than
any wing of the air

If you could have seen
(this is a different story)
above us cloud studies
out of Constable
Pescadero's sandstone cliffs
steeped and chewed by tides
I held Brother Antonio's hand
so afraid was he the cliff
would crumble What was that?
as if what then came had
already happened the osprey's
sea-foam breast
sign we said of the Holy Spirit
pounding the wind
Lift and save us it stormed
up beneath our feet
Alone in Inverness
I saw a kestral stop
in the blue and stoop
and icy blowtorch points
pecked my hands and feet
blood frothed from my side

Closer now my minders
watch and bear with me
while I'm walking barefoot
through a Tucson suburb
mesquite and prickly pear
a young peregrine
surveils me from the eye
of midmorning's sun
Last night Easter Saturday
I saw a deer enter
a bare-chested Yaqui ancient 
who obeyed the dance
danced through him the poor
we think aren't with us
everywhere the deer-dancer's
concrete ramada beside the freeway
and reservation projects

Brother Ash
the less I become of what
God made me the more real
I am in His heart
Let durable goods be ashes
to pour on our heads
Brother Wing
keep me in my place
on lower Market Street
with that bare-chested man
bird of beautiful want
speechifying clothed
in chaps rat-food blanket
and cherry running shoes
Lady Poverty at his side
I walked Avenue A
knee-deep in crows spirits
of murderers and suicides
croaking Whatever's given
I'll take away
Drenched in a Jersey storm
I tried to send my spirit
to God my core my sphere
I asked the hawk Who are you?
but in some nameless place
doubled-up overcoats pushed
oxcarts past me through mud
and hungry gray children
ate their cardboard name tags
Keep and bless such images
of our own killing kind?
Buzzards slice the silence
over our heads waiting
for us their food song
How little it takes to complete
a world to find what suffices
To Brother Fire I offer
our endless poor-men's wars
our starved ruined planet
song of thrush and whitethroat
beaks of meaningless fire
piercing our hands and feet
and offer wealth to Brother Ash
and waste of blood to Brother Rag.





Girl with Pearl Earring by Johannes Vermeer
 

He put the spirit essence
the light pip not only
in each eye's albumen
concentrate of starlight
but must have been taught
how to do that by first
finding it in the pearl
he posed then corrected
in dusty studio light
that pounced on the window
behind which sits the cheeky girl
pear- and apple-blossom cheeks
a fake description naturally
of their plain fleshiness
drably golden and her lips
from Haight Street's darlings
nose studs jacket studs
girls with that kind of eye
one by the atm machine
casual juicy and so fair
a Netherlandish type
panhandling strangers
pomegranate seed ball
bearings agleam in her nose
pearls not sea-harvested
but imagined seen put there
by a certain need and fancy
because love says it's so
picture that picture this.








Big City Speech
 


Use me
Abuse me
            Turn wheels of re
            on manhole hotheads

Sing me
Sour me
            Secrete dark matter's sheen
            on our smarting skin

Rise and shine
In puddle shallows
            under every Meryl Cheryl Caleb Syd
            somnambulists and sleepyheads

Wake us
Speak to us
            Bless what you've nurtured in your pits
            the rats voles roaches and all outlivers
            of your obscene ethic and politics

Crawl on us 
Fall on us
            you elevations that break and vein
            down to sulfuric ber-optic wrecks
            through drill-bit dirt to bedrock

Beat our brows
Flee our sorrows

            Sleep tight with your ultraviolets
            righteous mica and drainage seeps

your gorgeous color-chart container ships
and cab-top numbers squinting in the mist





The Green Man
 

rumdumb from last night's shrubbery tryst
exhales soot, fernseed, shoots and vines,
brings his hot breath from the city park's wood,
saying a song we don't understand
through the briar and bay leaves of his beard.
And in Philadelphia, 1954,
out of late autumn's darkening he came,
a junkman lugging a Penn Fruit cart,
straw bristling his face, crying a name.
Or from manholes in other cities,
his holographic ectoplasm greets us
when traffic lights turn green.
Uncover and there he is, membranous
Caliban alone with sewer rats,
or stumblebum Puck, unnameable solids
crusting nails and toes, bringing us his dark.
Or our neighborhood's soused John-John,
cobra down-at-heel boots skidding
at my feet among the maddening jasmine,
when I grab too late to save him growls:
"I can save you darling pigs.
Behold, behold, and maybe I'll help. 







Solo R&B Vocal Underground
 

It seems to head from its last stop too fast,
my transbay train's strung-out hoo, deep
inside the tunnel, and starts to bleed
into the baritone wail of that guy
at platform's end, a sort of lullaby
rubbed against the wall then caught in a squall
of wind darkening toward us, his whippy voice
skinning its tired song off the tiled dome:
he's determined, the silky lyric says,
to be independently blue, while we all
wait to be chuted to car lot or home,
closer to love, or farther, and sooner to loss,
our bashful shoes and arms like lives crossed,
every plural presence now some thing alone,
thanks to our singer-man. We wait for the train,
patient with hope, a hope that's like complaint.





Invocation
 

Silent, about-to-be-parted-from house.
Wood creaking, trying to sigh, impatient.
Clicking of squirrel-teeth in the attic.
Denuded beds, couches stripped of serapes.

Deep snow shall block all entrances
and oppress the roof and darken
the windows.    O Lares,
don't leave.
The house yawns like a bear.
Guard its profound dreams for us,
that it return to us when we return.


November 1969





Increment
 

So populous the region
That from the next region
The crowing of children, barking of cars could be heard,
So that a continuous linkage
Of sounds of living ran
In the limber air,
District to district, Woodlake to Montclair,
Freestone to Smithfield, and one child's cry
Was not concealed from any trade route,
Or passer by,
Or upstairs island of thought withdrawn, 
Or basement of submerged magnificence.
One crow
Welkened the evening sky,
Bark blasted the dark,
Like an assertion in a time of assent,
Or an increase to astonishment.


June 1958





Desert
 

When with the skin you do acknowledge drought,
The dry in the voice, the lightness of feet, the fine
Flake of the heat at every level line;

When with the hand you learn to touch without
Surprise the spine for the leaf, the prickled petal,
The stone scorched in the shine, and the wood brittle;

Then where the pipe drips and the fronds sprout
And the foot-square forest of clover blooms in sand,
You will lean and watch, but never touch with your hand.


September 1934





The Pear
 

There hangs this bellied pear, let no rake doubt,
Meat for the tongue and febrile to the skin,
Wasting for the mildew and the rot, 
A tallow rump slow rounded, a pelt thin
And for the quickest bite; so, orchard bred,
Heaviest downward from the shaking stem.
Whose fingers curve around the ripened head
Lust to split so fine a diadem.

There is the picker, stretches for the knife,
There are the ravening who claw the fruit,
More, those adjuring wax that lasts a life,
And foxes, freak for cunning, after loot.
For that sweet suck the hornet whines his wits, 
But husbandman will dry her for the pits.


December 1951






The Mother
 

Here where the rooms are dryly still
Who is this dustily asleep
While juicy children run the field?

Where is her ever deepening well
Whose buckets to a fullness dip
For needs compassion must fulfill?

Like freshets they themselves may yield
A little to the turned up cup,
But death is in the long dry spell.

Run children, run, the light grows dull,
And she who keeps the well must sleep,
And rain is unpredictable.


December 1951

 







Dreamwood
 

In the old, scratched, cheap wood of the typing stand
there is a landscape, veined, which only a child can see
or the child's older self, a poet,
a woman dreaming when she should be typing
the last report of the day. If this were a map,
she thinks, a map laid down to memorize
because she might be walking it, it shows
ridge upon ridge fading into hazed desert
here and there a sign of aquifers
and one possible watering-hole. If this were a map
it would be the map of the last age of her life,
not a map of choices but a map of variations
on the one great choice. It would be the map by which
she could see the end of touristic choices,
of distances blued and purpled by romance,
by which she would recognize that poetry
isn't revolution but a way of knowing
why it must come. If this cheap, mass-produced
wooden stand from the Brooklyn Union Gas Co.,
mass-produced yet durable, being here now,
is what it is yet a dream-map
so obdurate, so plain,
she thinks, the material and the dream can join
and that is the poem and that is the late report.


October/November 1987






November for Beginners
 

Snow would be the easy
way out--that softening
sky like a sigh of relief
at finally being allowed
to yield. No dice.
We stack twigs for burning
in glistening patches
but the rain won't give.

So we wait, breeding
mood, making music
of decline. We sit down
in the smell of the past
and rise in a light
that is already leaving.
We ache in secret,
memorizing

a gloomy line
or two of German.
When spring comes
we promise to act
the fool. Pour,
rain! Sail, wind,
with your cargo of zithers!


November 1981






Dusting
 

Every day a wilderness--no
shade in sight. Beulah
patient among knickknacks,
the solarium a rage
of light, a grainstorm
as her gray cloth brings
dark wood to life.

Under her hand scrolls
and crests gleam
darker still. What
was his name, that 
silly boy at the fair with
the rifle booth? And his kiss and
the clear bowl with one bright 
fish, rippling
wound!

Not Michael--
something finer. Each dust
stroke a deep breath and
the canary in bloom.
Wavery memory: home
from a dance, the front door
blown open and the parlor
in snow, she rushed
the bowl to the stove, watched
as the locket of ice
dissolved and he
swam free.

That was years before 
Father gave her up 
with her name, years before
her name grew to mean
Promise, then
Desert-in-Peace.
Long before the shadow and
sun's accomplice, the tree.

Maurice.


November 1981






Knowledge
 

Now that I know
That passion warms little
Of flesh in the mold, 
And treasure is brittle,

I'll lie here and learn
How, over their ground,
Trees make a long shadow
And a light sound.


August 1922





Miss Snooks, Poetess
 

Miss Snooks was really awfully nice
And never wrote a poem
That was not really awfully nice
And fitted to a woman,

She therefore made no enemies
And gave no sad surprises
But went on being awfully nice
And took a lot of prizes.


November 1964






Northumberland House
 

I was always a thoughtful youngster,
Said the lady on the omnibus,
I remember Father used to say,
You are more thoughtful than us.

I was sensitive too, the least thing
Upset me so much,
I used to cry if a fly
Stuck in the hatch.

Mother always said,
Elsie is too good,
There'll never be another like Elsie,
Touch wood. 

I liked to be alone,
Sitting on the garden path,
My brother said he'd never seen a
Picture more like Faith in the Arena.

They were kindly people, my people,
I could not help being different,
And I think it was good for me
Mixing in a different element.

The poor lady now burst out crying
And I saw her friend was not a friend but a nurse
For she said, Cheer up duckie the next stop is ours,
They got off at Northumberland House.

This great House of the Percies
Is now a lunatic asylum,
But over the gate there still stands
The great Northumberland Lion.

This family animal's tail
Is peculiar in that it is absolutely straight,
And straight as a bar it stood out to drop after them
As they went through the gate.


November 1964






Gooseberry Fool
 

The gooseberry's no doubt an oddity,
an outlaw or pariah even--thorny
and tart as any
kindergarten martinet, it can harbor
like a fernseed, on its leaves' under-
side, bad news for pine trees,
whereas the spruce
resists the blister rust
it's host to. That veiny Chinese
lantern, its stolid jelly
of a fruit, not only has 
no aroma but is twice as tedious
as the wild strawberry's sunburst
stem-end appendage: each one must
be between-nail-snipped at both extremities.

Altogether, gooseberry virtues
take some getting
used to, as does trepang,
tripe  la mode de Caen,
or having turned thirteen.
The acerbity of all things green
and adolescent lingers in 
it--the arrogant, shrinking,
prickling-in-every-direction thorn-
iness that loves no company except its,
or anyhow that's what it gets:
bristling up through gooseberry ghetto sprawl
are braced thistles' silvery, militantly symmetrical
defense machineries. Likewise inseparably en-
tangled in the disarray of an
uncultivated childhood, where gooseberry bushes (since
rooted out) once flourished, is
the squandered volupt of lemon-
yellow-petaled roses' luscious flimflam--
an inkling of the mingling into one experience
of suave and sharp, whose supremely im-
probable and far-fetched culinary
embodiment is a gooseberry fool.

Tomorrow, having stumbled into
this trove of chief ingredients
(the other being very thickest cream)
I'll demonstrate it for you. Ever since,
four summers ago, I first brought you,
a gleeful Ariel, the trophy
of a small sour handful,
I've wondered what not quite articulated thing
could render magical 
the green globe of an unripe berry.
I think now it was simply
the great globe itself's too much to carry.


December 1981





From "The Hollow Hill
 

Smaller than pollen-grain, smaller than seed
Of bitter berry red--
Do not look for the small,
The door has no size at all.

Some of sorrow have made a well
And deep have seen
In daylight far stars glimmer pale
In a nether heaven.


April 1963





Lament for the Feet
 

Except a six-year pony penned from birth
 inside a barn, I never seen anything worse.
 Eleven dobermans and mixed breeds, some still pups,
 removed from a residence after anonymous tips
 about a dead dog decomposing on the porch.
 Still and yet, this many dogs almost beats that one horse.
 The problem of human freedom one might couch
 in other terms than Kant's. It's nasty in there.
 Dog shit everywhere. I don't see how she could breathe.
 The woman, nearly ninety, wept and pleaded
 with the workers. I've been raising dogs right here
 in this very house since before your mothers were born.
 If I'm treating these dogs as bad as you say,
 how come you need those chokers to drag them away?
 The Humane Society truck's radio, left on,
 played "Me and Bobby McGee. They were strays, unwanted.
 I fed them and gave them a home. Now you'll kill them
 and call me cruel. And who will protect me?
 How will I sleep? When asked, the welfare worker
 said the woman cannot be forced from her home. 
 But freedom of will is not freedom from necessity
 and obligation. The neighbors lost interest soon
 and left her lawn. Meanwhile a breeze blows in 
 from the Gulf on a girl showing her friends the spot where
 she lost her left foot to a shark. He kept twisting it
 like a dog with a rag, she says just to hear them squeal. 
 Really, he only managed to take a chunk and maul
 the rest, but the doctors had to amputate. 
 She had to learn to trust loss. And in Houston
 a boy tries to jimmy a padlock with a broom
 to free his six-year-old sister from the storage shed
 their parents told them was "the naughty room.
 She was causing trouble at school, wetting her bed,
 and threatening to run away. We made a decision.
 We thought a few hours here was best for her.
 Police said the girl had been left water.
 A person may purchase the wind and the sun
 at the price of perpetual peregrination.





Be Someone
 

For Christ's sake,
 learn to type
 and have something
 to fall back on.
  
 Be someone,
 make something of yourself,
 look at Gertrudo Ganley.
  
 Always draw the curtains
 when the lights are on.
  
 Have nothing to do
 with the Shantalla gang,
 get yourself a right man
 with a Humber Sceptre.
  
 For Christ's sake
 wash your neck
 before going into God's house.
  
 Learn to speak properly,
 always pronounce your ings.
 Never smoke on the street,
 don't be caught dead
 in them shameful tight slacks,
  
 spare the butter,
 economise,
  
 and for Christ's sake
 at all times,
 watch your language.





Philomenas Revenge
 

As a teenager
 she was like any other,
 boys, the craic,
 smoking down the backs.
  
 Later there was talk
 she broke things,
 furniture and glass,
 her mother's heart.
  
 Mad at the world,'
 the old women nod,
 round each other's faces.
  
 But it was more
 than that
 and for less
 she was punished.
  
 That weekend
 she didn't leave a cup alone
 every chair hit the wall,
 Philomena's revenge.
  
 Soon after
 she was shifted
 and given the shocks.
  
 Round each other's faces
 the old women nod
 Treatment, treatment
 they've given her the treatment.'
  
 These days
 she gets on with the furniture,
 wears someone else's walk,
 sees visions in glass.
  
 She's good too
 for getting the messages;
 small things, bread and milk
 sometimes the paper,
  
 and closing the gate
 after her father drives out,
 she waits for his signal
 he always shouts twice,
  
 Get the gate Philo,
 get the gate, girl.'





The Blight
 

What's there to say? We didn't care for him much,
and you can't exactly commiserate
with someone you don't just not love
but almost (admit it) hate.
So the news just hung over us
like the dud summer weather we'd had--
rain since June, the lawn sodden,
garden a bog, all slugs, late blight so bad
our sickened Beefsteak vines, our Sweet One Hundreds,
San Marzanos, the lot,
yellowed half black before the fruit had set,
which, when it did, began to bloat and rot
before it ripened--but like I say
(and not to speak ill of the dead)
we just didn't care for him,
which is probably all there is to be said.





Blues for Samson
 

My stylist
calls me darling,
says Hi I'm Dee, and asks what I'd like today, smiling.
My hair back, I tell her, my precious locks,
thick and unruly and glossy as they were
before I was fleeced.

Her laughter
as she switches
the clippers on, brings back that sweet-throated witch's
who comforted me as only your enemy can
in the days of my strength, when I smote
hip and thigh in a great slaughter.

Her nice eyes
by and by rest
on mine in the mirror. She leans in, letting her breast
brush against me. She knows her middle-aged man;
playing me like some trailer Delilah,
and I feel it rise;

the old blunt
want-instrument
that always and only wanted what it shouldn't;
Gaza, Timna, my Valley girl
who spilled me in broad daylight. I must have reckoned
the sun shone out of her cunt.

Too long now
bereft of it,
a woman's hands in my hair, or what's left of it,
is all I seem to require of love, 
and all I'll spill is a tip, Dee; big as my straitened
circumstances allow,

for Dee, once 
my head wasn't bare
as that cornfield after the foxes I set on fire
rampaged through it, or the orchards and olive groves
I flattened with my slat-armored D9 'dozer,
but maned like a lion's.





Turkey Fallen Dead from Tree
 

Startled from snow-day slumber by a neighbor's mutt, 
it banged its buzzard's head then couldn't solve 
the problem of the white pine's limbs 
with wings nearly too broad for a planned descent. 
Somewhere an awkward angel knows 
whether it was dead before it hit the ground.
Any sinner could tell it was dead after--
eyes unseen beneath bare and wrinkled lids,
feet drawn up almost as high as hands.
I loved to watch thistle and millet 
disappear beneath it in the yard.
As snow covers feathers that will still be 
iridescent in the spring I remember seeing 
a businessman take a dripping handful 
of pocket change and throw it down 
a subway grate beside a homeless man. 
The coins bounced and clattered, vanishing 
in the humid dark. The rich man said 
now you're having a shitty day too. 
But it's not a shitty day and won't be 
when I retrieve the bird and walk it--
toes curling stiff from a shopping bag--
to a houseless scrap of oak savannah 
birdseed drew it from and dig it 
into deeper snow so what was hoarded 
by a man may by the thaw be doled.





I Had Just Hung Up from Talking to You
 

I had just hung up from talking to you
and we had been so immersed in the difficulty
you were facing, and forgive me,
I was thinking that as long as we kept talking,
you in your car in the parking lot of the boys' school
as the afternoon deepened into early evening,
and me in the study, all the books around
that had been sources of beauty to us,
as long as we stayed in the conversation
padded with history like the floor of the pine forest, 
as long as I thought out loud, made a joke
at my own expense, you would be harbored in that exchange, 
but the boys were leaving the track
and after we hung up I looked out the window 
to see the top of the bare January trees spotlit to silvery red, 
massive but made from the thinnest
twigs at the ends of the branches at the ends of the limbs
they were waving and shining in a light
like no other and left only to them.





A Poem for S.
 

Because you used to leaf through the dictionary, 
Casually, as someone might in a barber shop, and 
Devotedly, as someone might in a sanctuary,
Each letter would still have your attention if not
For the responsibilities life has tightly fit, like
Gears around the cog of you, like so many petals 
Hinged on a daisy. That's why I'll just use your
Initial. Do you know that in one treasured story, a 
Jewish ancestor, horseback in the woods at Yom
Kippur, and stranded without a prayer book, 
Looked into the darkness and realized he had 
Merely to name the alphabet to ask forgiveness--
No congregation of figures needed, he could speak
One letter at a time because all of creation 
Proceeded from those. He fed his horse, and then
Quietly, because it was from his heart, he
Recited them slowly, from aleph to tav. Within those
Sounds, all others were born, all manner of
Trials, actions, emotions, everything needed to
Understand who he was, had been, how flaws
Venerate the human being, how aspirations return
Without spite. Now for you, may your wife's
X-ray return with good news, may we raise our
Zarfs to both your names in the Great Book of Life.





For You Today
 

Of course there is a jackhammer. And a view, like Hopper,
but happier. Of course there is the newspaper--the daily
herald of our powerlessness. Easy go, easy come: thwash,
the next day another, an example of everything that gets done
in the dark. Like the initiative of the crocuses from a snow 
that was, as it works out, warming them. Or in this case,
the strange October weather warming them. There were the
conclusions we jumped to. To which we jumped. There was
pain, and then there was suffering. Of course there was my
ambition to offer you the world, but one that I have rearranged 
to make sense. Here are all the sensations of being alive
at the turn of the twenty-first century, here's how they ring out
against each other, here's how one brings out the sense of 
another, here is the yellow next to the fathomless blue.





I Love You More Than All the Windows in New York City
 

The day turned into the city 
and the city turned into the mind
and the moving trucks trumbled along 
like loud worries speaking over
the bicycle's idea
which wove between 
the more armored vehicles of expression
and over planks left by the construction workers
on a holiday morning when no work was being done
because no matter the day, we tend towards 
remaking parts of it--what we said 
or did, or how we looked--
and the buildings were like faces
lining the banks of a parade
obstructing and highlighting each other
defining height and width for each other
offsetting grace and function
like Audrey Hepburn from 
Jesse Owens, and the hearty pigeons collaborate 
with wrought iron fences
and become recurring choruses of memory
reassembling around benches
we sat in once, while seagulls wheel 
like immigrating thoughts, and never-leaving
chickadees hop bared hedges and low trees
like commas and semicolons, landing
where needed, separating 
subjects from adjectives, stringing along
the long ideas, showing how the cage
has no door, and the lights changed
so the tide of sound ebbed and returned
like our own breath
and when I knew everything
was going to look the same as the mind
I stopped at a lively corner
where the signs themselves were like
perpendicular dialects in conversation and
I put both my feet on the ground
took the bag from the basket
so pleased it had not been crushed
by the mightiness of all else
that goes on and gave you the sentence inside.





New Rooms
 

The mind must
set itself up
wherever it goes
and it would be
most convenient
to impose its
old rooms--just
tack them up
like an interior
tent. Oh but
the new holes 
aren't where 
the windows
went.





Miser Time
 

Miser time grows
profligate near the 
end: unpinching 
and unplanning,
abandoning the
whole idea of
savings. It's hard
to understand
but time apparently
expands with its
diminishing. The 
door thrown wide
on sliding hills of high-
denomination bills and 
nothing much to buy.





There Is No Word
 

There isn't a word for walking out of the grocery store
with a gallon jug of milk in a plastic sack 
that should have been bagged in double layers

--so that before you are even out the door
you feel the weight of the jug dragging 
the bag down, stretching the thin

plastic handles longer and longer
and you know it's only a matter of time until
bottom suddenly splits. 

There is no single, unimpeachable word 
for that vague sensation of something
moving away from you

as it exceeds its elastic capacity        
--which is too bad, because that is the word
I would like to use to describe standing on the street

chatting with an old friend 
as the awareness grows in me that he is
no longer a friend, but only an acquaintance, 

a person with whom I never made the effort--
until this moment, when as we say goodbye 
I think we share a feeling of relief,  

a recognition that we have reached
the end of a pretense,   
though to tell the truth 

what I already am thinking about
is my gratitude for language--
how it will stretch just so much and no farther;

how there are some holes it will not cover up;
how it will move, if not inside, then 
around the circumference of almost anything--

how, over the years, it has given me
back all the hours and days, all the 
plodding love and faith, all the

misunderstandings and secrets
I have willingly poured into it.





Note to Reality
 

Without even knowing it, I have 
believed in you for a long time.

When I looked at my blood under a microscope
                I could see truth multiplying over and over.

--Not police sirens, nor history books, not stage-three lymphoma
                                                                                     persuaded me

but your honeycombs and beetles; the dry blond fascicles of grass 
                                                              thrust up above the January snow. 
Your postcards of Picasso and Matisse,
                                         from the museum series on European masters. 

When my friend died on the way to the hospital
                                           it was not his death that so amazed me

but that the driver of the cab 
                                              did not insist upon the fare.

Quotation marks: what should we put inside them? 

Shall I say "I  "have been hurt "by  "you,  you neglectful monster?

I speak now because experience has shown me
                                 that my mind will never be clear for long.

I am more thick-skinned and male, more selfish, jealous, and afraid
                                   than ever in my life.

"For my heart is tangled in thy nets;
                              my soul enmeshed in cataracts of time...

The breeze so cool today, the sky smeared with bluish grays and whites.

The parade for the slain police officer
goes past the bakery

and the smell of fresh bread 
makes the mourners salivate against their will.





Dont Tell Anyone
 

We had been married for six or seven years 
when my wife, standing in the kitchen one afternoon, told me
that she screams underwater when she swims--

that, in fact, she has been screaming for years
into the blue chlorinated water of the community pool
where she does laps every other day.  

Buttering her toast, not as if she had been 
concealing anything, 
not as if I should consider myself

personally the cause of her screaming,
nor as if we should perform an act of therapy  
right that minute on the kitchen table,

--casually, she told me, 
and I could see her turn her square face up 
to take a gulp of oxygen,

then down again into the cold wet mask of the unconscious.
For all I know, maybe everyone is screaming 
as they go through life, silently,

politely keeping the big secret 
that it is not all fun
to be ripped by the crooked beak

of something called psychology,
to be dipped down 
again and again into time;

that the truest, most intimate 
pleasure you can sometimes find
is the wet kiss 

of your own pain.
There goes Kath, at one pm, to swim her twenty-two laps
back and forth in the community pool; 

--what discipline she has!
Twenty-two laps like twenty-two pages, 
that will never be read by anyone.





Your Other Heart
 

Mossy and thumping, bare of logic, red:
             why do they say your other head

                          and not your other heart? 

The snack cakes of Smut Wonderland
turn Alice smaller than her dress. She stirs,
nude in the folds of so much baby blue. 

             To think, they called this lesser art.

I ate mostly orders then, and you--
you were thinking with your other heart. 

I took in a dog the way some might take in
             a dress (I had become just skin).

                          It coughed. I cried for it

to stop, I fed it meat, its malady
recurrent and untreatable. I had 
to give it up, like some bum body part 

             whose incidental benefit

the human form has out-evolved. Don't start.
That dog: I called it Help, and I cried for it.





Epilogue
 

For my daughter

If the body is primal, if the body is performed,
if the body is a city made of matches, 
something the self burns as it retreats,

if death is a victory, if death is a cascade,
if death is the moment when the pianist rises 
from the piano and the piano plays on,

if you are a theater, if you are the wandering 
troupe, if you have checked, lost traveler,
into the softest of hotels, if you already existed, 

in endless repetitions, like an echo which,
biopsied, grows to completion, like the flames 
on a candelabra, not just born from a single 

match, but wavering in the tip before it's 
struck, the whole hive singularized, a queen 
subject to her ovaries, if the same horses 

grazing in me are grazing in you, if the body 
is a field written in hoofprints, the whole 
ghostly herd passing through, then I'll meet you 

where the generations end, where the last gene 
evaporates, my invisible, my twin...And 
Fortinbras enters, followed closely by the wind.





The New Self
 

Are you of or not of brain, matter's boss 
              or its crevasse, are you the body itself, 
or more than that, immortal you, crouched
             in flesh, like a vampire packed into a bat? 

Are you housed in me or not? The tenant 
             or the landlord of my skin? Am I your 
avatar? Are you my East Berlin? Are we an I
             or each other's synonym? Last night, 

the train I was on dimmed then re-electrified, 
             and I thought again that we are conscious 
a lot less often than we suppose, that half the time 
             in us you're half reposed. I was in 

South Orange again, city of my former self's last 
             stand. Do you remember him, your swallowed 
twin, the child king whom you deposed? Oh, 
             I know: you think you're the buried light, 

the jeweled glow, the sunlight falling through 
             the falling snow. But I've seen the uranium 
laced through your walls: you're an equation only 
             destruction solves. Who else but you

starts each day with masturbation and ends 
             each night with gin? And so how 
should I begin? Four years ago, you rose 
             in me like a fin. It started as an overflow, 

a drop of go, some royal beast in me, all gasoline 
             and yeast, unhinging its own jaw 
to accelerate the feast, the rails of thought so greased 
             that the outer world began to skew, 

as in that moment on a train when the view 
             becomes a wash of hues. There were clues. 
Phantom music in the air. At times, I'd look down 
             at my body and think, "How'd you get there? 

One day, I de-napped to find myself entrapped 
             within the tangled logic of a subway 
map. All day, I'd refrain, I'd double-track. 
             I'd talk to myself and myself talked back. 

Was it you? That tick I felt within the trick 
             of thought? That wick that curled itself 
around me, not exploding, just making a constant 
             tick-tick-tick that finally convinced me 

that I was sick, that there was a cascade of toxins
             in the air, that there 
was something queer about the neighbor's 
             stare, that charade of signals everywhere, 

an air raid in the brain, something in me
             left unpaid, a cosmic debt in arrears. 
Some nights, I'd hear the voices of my parents coming 
             near, like waves that overlapped--

she'd slap him, he'd slap her back--their rage 
             a single note that climbed its staff for years, 
my siblings and I in the closet with our fingers 
             in our ears, though still I heard one night 

the knife drawer heaved back, as if they really 
             might slice each other or the house in half, 
and then my thoughts unweaved and I began 
             to laugh. And it is funny, isn't it,

the way that which starts as confession ends 
             in blame, this constant search 
for the marionettist of your brain, the ghost 
             who stole the controls to your soul.

The truth is: we embrace the past that keeps 
             us whole. Again, I feel that treble in the skin, 
something at the edge of sight but closing in, 
             the world a picture that won't hang on the wall 

quite right. Again, the double agent of the heart 
             tries to take the past apart, but now I sense 
that the investigation is the crime, that it may be time 
             to give up on this which-is-which, 

this who-is-who, this endless voodoo in which the self 
             I am keeps evading the curses of the self 
I mean to be, or to admit at least that the lyric cracks 
             its voice trying to sing what's ugly into praise, 

and this language is the jeweler's bluff, a diamond 
             that scuffs between the teeth, a perfume misting 
foul air. Admit, admit, that what you craved 
             was sex those days, and after a one-night tryst,

you became convinced you'd contracted aids. 
             Say it plain: you thought you'd passed the disease 
on to your wife. In longhand, you wrote statistics 
             across the page, Googled infection rates, 

a one-in-a-million chance the battalion of hotline 
             workers liked to say, but they couldn't smudge 
that chance away. And did you let this madness in
             to build a drama around your sin, 

to become valedictorian of the damned, to turn 
             from lion into lamb, as the murderer longs 
to be the murdered one, and the king to swap 
             places with the fool, the self you thought 

you were so undone that you could only blame it 
             on a coup, on a malignant growth, or on you, 
my patsy, my herring, my phantom non grata, my ghoul, 
             you who I insist must exist, because, if not, 

who else was it that could have been so cruel?





The Death of Silence
 

A car's backfire 
rifles the ear 

with skeleton clatter, 
the crowd's walla walla

draws near, caterwaul 
evaporating in thin air. 

Silence is dead. 
(Long live silence.)

Let's observe a moment 
of it, call it what it's not: 

splatter of rain 
that can't soothe

the window's pane, 
dog barking 

up the wrong tree. 
Which tree, which air 

apparent is there to hear 
a word at its worth? 

Hammer that drums 
its water-logged warning 

against the side 
of the submarine: 

I'm buried to the hilt
like the knife, 

after it's thrown, 
continues to bow

to the apple
it's split.





Map to the Stars
 

A Schwinn-ride away: Eagledale Plaza. Shopping strip of busted 
walkways, crooked parking spaces nicked like the lines 
on the sides of somebody's mom-barbered head. Anchored 
by the Piccadilly disco, where a shootout was guaranteed every 
weekend, those gun claps: coughing stars shot from sideways
guns shiny enough to light the way for anyone willing to keep 
a head up long enough to see. Not me. I bought the Star Map 
Shirt for 15 at the Value Village next to the Piccadilly during
the daytime. The shirt was polyester with flyaway collars, 
outlined in the forgotten astronomies of disco. The shirt's 
washed-out points of light: arranged in horse & hero shapes 
 & I rocked it in places neither horse nor hero hung out. 
Polyester is made from polyethylene & catches fire easily 
like wings near a thrift store sun. Polyethylene, used in shampoo 
bottles, gun cases, & those grocery sacks skidding like upended 
stars across the parking lot. There are more kinds of stars 
in this universe than salt granules on drive-thru fries. Too many 
stars, lessening & swelling with each pedal pump away from 
the Value Village as the electric billboard above flashes first 
one dui attorney, then another who speaks Spanish so the sky 
above is constantly chattering, like the biggest disco ball ever.





End of Side A
 

It ends because the beginning won't jumpstart 
again: red smudge of a mouth, lipstick everywhere

the afterthought a comet leaves on its way 
out. What makes this moment unfold like a fine 

woman raising herself up from the bathroom floor? 
Honky-tonk in the honeyed brown of an eyeball? 

Perfume & its circus of heart-shaped introductions? 
It ends because the needle always winds up in 

the lead-out, like a man pawing around for broken 
spectacles after he wakes in the world's rubble. 

Hand over hand he paws, through stilted guitar 
picks & abandoned stilettos, raised skirts & rocks, 

glasses as chipped & smudged as the topography 
of a skipping record. He could be Albright 

himself, foraging the still-life swish of low-rise 
tutus & skyscrapers cracked in the twisted 

aftermath of a smile. Even without glasses, 
he remembers her in high style: magnanimously 

coming down the blue & violet threads of night, 
her green dress clashing with the bathroom tile.





Unemployment (1)
 

I had a calling.
I took the call.
It was all I could do to follow the voice streaming into me
Like traffic on the runway where I lay
Down to gather.
I had a calling. I heard the geese bleat
In the firmament as they migrated
Into the jet's jets.
And could I have foreseen that falling
I could have fallen too
Rather than being sutured to the bottomless
Freeze-out lake.
For it is fine to lie within one's borrowed blankets
Looking up at the 
Dropped ceiling coming down.
For at the moment I am employed counting the holes
In the sound absorbing tiles
Keeping a running record of the interlocutor's 
Chides.
I feel at one with extinction
By my own hand
(Inner hand)
Though once there were many of my kind
Flocking inland, or perhaps
It felt that way.





Tempo for a Winged Instrument
 

Full of light and music, the beating air.  

Light like a bird, Calvino says, not a feather.  

Over the water the shags come in to land


All wings, uh-ohing over the cliffs.

Rock, their nests, and bare the rookeries.  

Blue eye, blue eye, the wind plays fast and sharp.


They lift and ride and do not pick their fights.  

Oh, blue sky, blue day. Heart

Of muscle, thrumming down, and swift.





Unemployment (2)
 

Another day come, add it 
To the list, the
Not to do list.
Son of mine,
I was rambling across the undercarpeting
Strewn with imperceptible tacks
In one shapeless slip-on
When a pain rang out in my flank
And I fell to,
Braying,
But who should answer but no one.
I lost good cause that day, don't ask,
Let us sit a bit in this ill-starred
Suit in the form-filling
Chamber of subtraction,
Listing.
I haven't another trip around the sun 
Left in me. Speak to me
Son, vague one. 
For this is where it thickens,
Me here and it there and me there and them here
And you with the soul.
I'll cross that gravid boneyard 
All the day poking 
Radishes for remembrance.
For this is a private matter 
Between a man and his scaffolding
And it shall remain so 
Privation permitting.





Unemployment (3)
 

Out of cash, out of well-fitting trousers,
Out of soap and apples,
Out of pencils, out of my keeper's
Reach. 

I wish to set myself afire
But may not. This morning
(Last night) in the common room 
I watched the administration
Of oxygen to one who had none

And I would not sit down, demanding
To do so.

Later I happened on a man
At the piano, and though I have happened five or six times 
On men at the piano,
None moved his hand like this
Within the keys.

I sat beside him, looking for a sound
A chest sound. Not listening; I don't listen
Anymore. I make music
But I don't listen.





In the Corridor
 

I passed through, I should have paused,
there were a hundred doors. One opened. 
In there, someone whose name 
is not yet known to me lived out 

his middle years in simple terms, two chairs, 
one place laid for early breakfast, one plate 
with dry toast and butter softening. There 
his mind raced through writings 

he had memorized long ago while he tried 
to get hold of himself. Once 
in his youth he had studied with love 
in the corners of old paintings 

matrices of fields and towns, 
passages intricate and particular, wheat, 
columns, figures and ground,
classically proportioned 

in lines that were meant 
to meet, eventually,
at vanishing point. They continued,
nevertheless; they troubled the eye.

He collected sets of books printed
in the nineteenth century, unyielding
pages, memoirs of the poets,
engravings of rurified private subjects 

in times of public sector unhappiness,
frescoes of human oddity in gatefold printing.
Why does it continue
to chasten me, he says to no one. 

It does. It is a painful mistaking,
this setting something down,
saying aloud, "it is nothing yet
when he'd meant, not anything-- 

but then nothing peered 
through the keyhole, nothing
took possession. Snow on the roofs,
snow in traces on the ground, 

passersby with wet trouser-cuffs 
looking to the pavement as the hill rises,
light gathering in the river 
and gradually spreading.





Zwijgen
 

I slept before a wall of books and they
calmed everything in the room, even
their contents, even me, woken
by the cold and thrill, and still
they said, like the Dutch verb for falling 
silent that English has no accommodation for
in the attics and rafters of its intimacies.





On the Ground
 

When the collie saw the child
break from the crowd,

he gave chase, and since they both
were border-crossers,

they left this world. 
We were then made of--

affronted by--silence.
The train passed Poste 5, Paris,

late arrival, no luck, no
enlarging commentary

magnified in any glass.
"The ineffable

is everywhere in language
the speaker had said 

in the huge hall where 
I sat amongst coughers, 

students, in the late 
February of that year,

at the end of a sinuous 
inquiry on sense and sound--

"and very close to the ground, he'd said. 
Like mist risen above

the feet of animals
in a far field north of here.





Slugs
 

Who could have dreamed them up? At least snails
have shells, but all these have is--nothing.
Small black antennae like fat pins wave
as if they could take in enough to get them through.
Turn them over, they're the soles of new shoes,
pale and unmarked as babies. They flow,
the soil itself learning how to move and, moving,
almost staying still, their silver monorail
the only evidence of where they'd been.
And they die quiet, or at least (thankfully)
out of the human ear's range, between two stones,
under heels, shriveling in salt or piss, at the tips
of sharp sticks. Fight back, I hear myself say,
do something. Don't just take it. But they die
as they had lived, exuding slime, like
the smaller boys, who'd just
stand there, miserable in short pants,
school socks down to their ankles,
school tie unknotted and askew, and flowing
from noses slow cauls of snot that
from time to time they'd lick or sniff back up
part way, until it flowed again, coating
the upper lip, falling into the mouth, mixing
with tears before anything had been done,
the fear itself enough, so even if we wanted
we couldn't let them off. Sometimes it was
the knee "where you daren't show your mother,
other times the kick in the shins, the stick over
the head, the punch in the mouth, while they
just stood there, or double up, gasping
for breath, and we did it again.





from The Lost Letters of Frederick Douglass
 

                                                           June 5, 1892
 
Dear Daughter,
                             Can you be fifty-three this
month? I still look for you to peek around
my door as if you'd discovered a toy
you thought gone for good, ready at my smile
to run up and press your fist into my
broken palm. But your own girls have outgrown
such games, and I cannot pilfer back time
I spent pursuing Freedom. Fair to you,
to your brothers, your mother? Hardly.
 
                                                                       But
what other choice did I have? What sham,
what shabby love could I offer you, so
long as Thomas Auld held the law over
my head? And when the personal threat was
ended, whose eyes could mine enter without
shame, if turning toward my wife and children
meant turning my back?
 
                                               Your mother's eyes stare
out at me through yours, of late. You think I
didn't love her, that my quick remarriage
makes a Gertrude of me, a corseted
Hamlet of you. You're as wrong as you are
lucky. Had Anna Murray had your
education as a girl, my love for
her would have been as passionate as it
was grateful. But she died illiterate,
when I had risked my life to master language.
The pleasures of book and pen retain
the thrill of danger even now, and you
may understand why Ottilie Assing,
come into our house to translate me into
German, could command so many hours,
years, of my time--or, as you would likely
say, of your mother's time.
 
                                                Forgive me,
Rosetta, for broaching such indelicate
subjects, but as my eldest child and
only living daughter, I want you to
feel certain that Helen became the new
Mrs. Douglass because of what we shared
in sheaves of my papers: let no one
persuade you I coveted her skin.
I am not proud of how I husbanded
your mother all those years, but marriage,
too, is a peculiar institution.
I could not have stayed so unequally yoked
so long, without a kind of Freedom in
it. Anna accepted this, and I don't
have to tell you that her lot was better
and she, happier, than if she'd squatted
with some other man in a mutual
ignorance.
 
                 Perhaps I will post, rather
than burn, this letter, this time. I've written it
so often, right down to these closing lines,
in which I beg you to be kinder, much
kinder, to your step-mother. You two are
of an age to be sisters, and of like
temperament--under other circumstances,
you might have found Friendship in each other.
 
With regards to your husband--I am, as
ever, your loving father--
 
 
                                                Frederick Douglass 





her tin skin
 

i want her tin skin. i want
       her militant barbie breast,
resistant, cupped, no, cocked
       in the V of her elbow. i want
my curves mountainous
 
and locked. i want her
       arabesque eyes, i want her
tar markings, her curlicues,
       i want her tin skin. she
is a tree, her hair a forest
 
of strength. i want to be
       adorned with bottles. i
want my brownness
       to cover all but the silver
edges of my tin skin. my
 
sculptor should have made
       me like her round-bellied
maker hewed her: with chain-
       saw in hand, roughly. cut
away from me everything
 
but the semblance of tender.
       let nothing but my flexed
foot, toeing childhood, tell
     the night-eyed, who know
how to look, what lies within.
 
 
                                                          --after alison saar's "compton nocturne





where you are planted
 

he's as high as a georgia pine, my father'd say, half laughing. southern trees
as measure, metaphor. highways lined with kudzu-covered southern trees.
 
fuchsia, lavender, white, light pink, purple : crape myrtle bouquets burst
open on sturdy branches of skin-smooth bark : my favorite southern trees.
 
one hundred degrees in the shade : we settle into still pools of humidity, moss-
dark, beneath live oaks. southern heat makes us grateful for southern trees.
 
the maples in our front yard flew in spring on helicopter wings. in fall, we
splashed in colored leaves, but never sought sap from these southern trees.
 
frankly, my dear, that's a magnolia, i tell her, fingering the deep green, nearly
plastic leaves, amazed how little a northern girl knows about southern trees.
 
i've never forgotten the charred bitter fruit of holiday's poplars, nor will i :
it's part of what makes me evie :  i grew up in the shadow of southern trees.





on new years eve
 


       we make midnight a maquette of the year:
frostlight glinting off snow to solemnize
       the vows we offer to ourselves in near
silence: the competition shimmerwise
 
       of champagne and chandeliers to attract
laughter and cheers: the glow from the fireplace
       reflecting the burning intra-red pact
between beloveds: we cosset the space
 
       of a fey hour, anxious gods molding our
hoped-for adams with this temporal clay:
       each of us edacious for shining or
rash enough to think sacrifice will stay
 
       this fugacious time: while stillness suspends
vitality in balance, as passions
       struggle with passions for sway, the mind wends
towards what's to come: a callithump of fashions,
 
       ersatz smiles, crowded days: a bloodless cut
that severs soul from bone: a long aching
       quiet in which we will hear nothing but
 the clean crack of our promises breaking.





The Sonnets: III
 

Stronger than alcohol, more great than song,
deep in whose reeds great elephants decay,
I, an island, sail, and my shoes toss
on a fragrant evening, fraught with sadness
bristling hate.
It's true, I weep too much. Dawns break
slow kisses on the eyelids of the sea,
what other men sometimes have thought they've seen.
And since then I've been bathing in the poem
lifting her shadowy flowers up for me,
and hurled by hurricanes to a birdless place
the waving flags, nor pass by prison ships
O let me burst, and I be lost at sea!
and fall on my knees then, womanly.





The Sonnets: XLI
 

banging around in a cigarette      she isn't "in love
my dream a drink with Ira Hayes we discuss the code of the west
my hands make love to my body when my arms are around you
you never tell me your name
and I am forced to write "belly when I mean "love
Au revoir, scene!
I waken, read, write long letters and
wander restlessly when leaves are blowing
my dream a crumpled horn
in advance of the broken arm
she murmurs of signs to her fingers
weeps in the morning to waken so shackled with love
Not me. I like to beat people up.
My dream a white tree





The Sonnets: L
 

I like to beat people up
absence of passion, principles, love. She murmurs
What just popped into my eye was a fiend's umbrella
and if you should come and pinch me now
as I go out for coffee
. . . as I was saying winter of 18 lumps
Days produce life locations to banish 7 up
Nomads, my babies, where are you? Life's
My dream which is gunfire in my poem
Orange cavities of dreams stir inside "The Poems
Whatever is going to happen is already happening
Some people prefer "the interior monologue
I like to beat people up





The Sonnets: I
 

His piercing pince-nez. Some dim frieze
Hands point to a dim frieze, in the dark night.
In the book of his music the corners have straightened:
Which owe their presence to our sleeping hands.
The ox-blood from the hands which play
For fire for warmth for hands for growth
Is there room in the room that you room in?
Upon his structured tomb:
Still they mean something. For the dance
And the architecture.
Weave among incidents
May be portentous to him
We are the sleeping fragments of his sky,
Wind giving presence to fragments.





The Golden Shovel
 


          after Gwendolyn Brooks
 
I. 1981
 
When I am so small Da's sock covers my arm, we
cruise at twilight until we find the place the real
 
men lean, bloodshot and translucent with cool.
His smile is a gold-plated incantation as we
 
drift by women on bar stools, with nothing left
in them but approachlessness. This is a school
 
I do not know yet. But the cue sticks mean we
are rubbed by light, smooth as wood, the lurk
 
of smoke thinned to song. We won't be out late.
Standing in the middle of the street last night we
 
watched the moonlit lawns and a neighbor strike
his son in the face. A shadow knocked straight
 
Da promised to leave me everything: the shovel we
used to bury the dog, the words he loved to sing
 
his rusted pistol, his squeaky Bible, his sin.
The boy's sneakers were light on the road. We
 
watched him run to us looking wounded and thin.
He'd been caught lying or drinking his father's gin.
 
He'd been defending his ma, trying to be a man. We
stood in the road, and my father talked about jazz,
 
how sometimes a tune is born of outrage. By June
the boy would be locked upstate. That night we
 
got down on our knees in my room. If I should die
before I wake. Da said to me, it will be too soon.
 
 
II. 1991
 
Into the tented city we go, we-
akened by the fire's ethereal
 
afterglow. Born lost and cool-
er than heartache. What we
 
know is what we know. The left
hand severed and school-
 
ed by cleverness. A plate of we-
ekdays cooking. The hour lurk-
 
ing in the afterglow. A late-
night chant. Into the city we
 
go. Close your eyes and strike
a blow. Light can be straight-
 
ened by its shadow. What we
break is what we hold. A sing-
 
ular blue note. An outcry sin-
ged exiting the throat. We
 
push until we thin, thin-
king we won't creep back again.
 
While God licks his kin, we
sing until our blood is jazz,
 
we swing from June to June.
We sweat to keep from we-
 
eping. Groomed on a die-
t of hunger, we end too soon.





Writing
 

But prayer was not enough, after all, for my father. 
His last two brothers died five weeks apart. 
He couldn't get to sleep, had no appetite, sat 
staring. Though he prayed,
he could find no peace until he tried 
to write about his brothers, tell a story 
for each one: Perry's long travail 
with the steamfitters' union, which he worked for; 
and Harvey--here the handwriting changes, 
he bears down--Harvey loved his children.

I discovered those few sheets of paper 
as I looked through my father's old Bible 
on the morning of his funeral. The others 
in the family had seen them long ago; 
they had all known the story, 
and they told me I had not, most probably, because 
I am a writer, 
and my father was embarrassed by his effort. Yet 
who has seen him as I can: risen

in the middle of the night, bending over 
the paper, working close 
to the heart of all greatness, he is so lost.





Temporary Job
 

Leaving again. If I didn't care, I wouldn't be 
grieving. The particulars of place lodged in me, 
like this room I lived in for eleven days, 
how I learned the way the sun laid its palm 
over the side window in the morning, heavy 
light, how I'll never be held in that hand again.





The Song of Wandering Aengus
 

I went out to the hazel wood,
Because a fire was in my head,
And cut and peeled a hazel wand,
And hooked a berry to a thread;
And when white moths were on the wing,
And moth-like stars were flickering out,
I dropped the berry in a stream
And caught a little silver trout.

When I had laid it on the floor
I went to blow the fire a-flame,
But something rustled on the floor,
And someone called me by my name:
It had become a glimmering girl
With apple blossom in her hair
Who called me by my name and ran
And faded through the brightening air.

Though I am old with wandering
Through hollow lands and hilly lands,
I will find out where she has gone,
And kiss her lips and take her hands;
And walk among long dappled grass,
And pluck till time and times are done,
The silver apples of the moon,
The golden apples of the sun.





Spelt from Sibyls Leaves
 

Earnest, earthless, equal, attuneable, ' vaulty, voluminous, . . . stupendous
 Evening strains to be time's vst, ' womb-of-all, home-of-all, hearse-of-all night.

 With: ur vening is over us; ur night ' whlms, whlms, nd will end us.

II. The Mermaid (from The Sea Cabinet)
 

Between the imaginary iceberg and the skeletal whale
is the stuffed and mounted mermaid in her case,
 the crudely-stitched seam between skin and scale
 
so unlike Herbert Draper's siren dreams, loose
on the swelling tide, part virgin and part harpy.
 Her post-mortem hair and her terrible face
 
look more like P.T. Barnum's Freak of Feejee,
 piscene and wordless, trapped in the net of a stare.
 She has the head and shrivelled tits of a monkey,
 
the green glass eyes of a porcelain doll, a pair 
 of praying-mantis hands, and fishy lips
 open to reveal her sea-caved mouth, her rare
 
ivory mermaid-teeth. Children breathe and rap
 on the glass to make her move. In her fixity
 she's as far as can be from the selkie who slips
 
her wet pelt on the beaches of Orkney
 and walks as a woman, pupils widened in light,
 discarding the stuffed sack of her body.
 
Without hearing, or touch, or taste, or smell, or sight
 she echoes the numb roll of the whale
 in a sea congealed with cold, when it was thought
 
no beast could be a nerveless as the whale.





IV. The Cure (from A Quartet For the Falcon)
 

The secretive hart turns at bay,
lowers his tines to the hounds' cry.
The sword enters the bull's heart--
                         still he stands,
             amazed on the red sand
 as the stony unbeliever might,
 
who has seen God. Soon now
 horns will sound dedow
 for the unmaking. Beaters flush
                         the grey heron
             like a coney from its warren,
 the peregrine's jet eyes flash.
 
They go ringing up the air,
 each in its separate spiral stair
 to the indigo rim of the skies,
                         then descend
             swift as a murderer's hand
 with a knife. Death's gesture liquefies
 
in bringing the priestly heron down.
 Her prize, the marrow from a wing-bone
 in which she delights, her spurred
                         fleur-de-lys tongue
             stained gold-vermilion--
 little angel in her hangman's hood.





Aphrodisia
 

Love's language is hyperbole, but whispered,
 sibilant similes and promises sotto voce.
 It's easy to imagine you've misheard,
 
the form and content clash, create this weird
 distortion like an echo or a tape delay.
 Love's language is hyperbole, but whispered.
 
On which do you place emphasis: The words?
 Or the breath? The farfetched or the foreplay?
 It's easy to imagine you've misheard
 
when objectivity has disappeared
 and your lover is getting further carried away.
 Love's language is hyperbole, but whispered
 
vows? It's hard to take him at his word,
 or hers: Speak up! Proclaim! you want to say.
 It's easy to imagine you've misheard,
 
hard to admit one sharp as you is stirred.
 You need to back off, cool down, act blas.
 Love's language is hyperbole, but whispered.
 It's easy to imagine you've misheard.





Winter Psalm
 

Boston snowbound, Logan closed, snowplows
 and salt-trucks flashing yellow, drifts
 tall as a man some places, visibility poor,
 I sit by the window and watch the snow
 
blow sideways north-northeast, hot cup
 in hand, robe over pajamas.
 You have made me to seek refuge
 and charged me to care for my brothers.
 
How cruel. That could be You out there
 howling, cracking the trees, burying everything.
 What could I possibly want from You
 that would not undo the whole world as it is?





An Old Story
 

A few days after my mother died
 the furnace went out, and my father,
 who had been sitting in his chair
 across from hers since the funeral,
 
his unshaven chin on his chest,
 heaved himself up and went down
 the cold gray cellar stairs to see if
 he could relight the pilot himself
 
or would have to call for help.
 I know what it must have been like
 because I remember him other times
 on his back down there, cursing
 
match after match, god damning
 each for burning his fingers, as he
 reached through the tiny metal door
 as many times as it took. This time
 
it lit, caught, and roared back to life.
 When my father sat up he faced
 the washer, the dryer, the empty
 laundry basket, the ironing board,
 
and my mother's radio above the sink,
 her absence so vivid that climbing
 the stairs he thought he heard her 
 behind him, and he turned around.





Long Enough
 

You would have thought it foolish to speak to the dead,
 but I have lived two decades longer now than you
 and all this time I have carried you in my head
 
so I think I have the right to question what you said,
 dear teacher. My religious upbringing's residue,
 you would have thought it foolish. To speak to the dead,
 
however, is sometimes necessary, especially haunted
 by all the things I know you hoped I'd do
 with all this time that I have carried you in my head.
 
In a dream last night I followed where you led
 until you asked me in a loud voice what I knew.
 (You would have thought it foolish to speak to the dead,
 
but I was dreaming and could not refuse.) I said
 that you were wrong, that I could see your bitter view
 (since all this time I have carried you in my head)
  
 for what it was, and you for who you were. Instead
 of dreaming your reply I woke as you withdrew.
 You would have thought it foolish to speak to the dead
 but all this time I have carried you in my head.





December 31st
 

All my undone actions wander
 naked across the calendar,
 
a band of skinny hunter-gatherers,
 blown snow scattered here and there,
 
stumbling toward a future
 folded in the New Year I secure
 
with a pushpin: January's picture
 a painting from the 17th century,
 
a still life: Skull and mirror,
 spilled coin purse and a flower.





Book Three: 1
 

It was a forlorn eve,
                             my descent wintry.
                                                         In that foreign midnight,
  
  
 I sounded
                             the chanceries of doubt
                                                         as day drove up
  
  
 in an ordinary yellow cab.
                             To my astonishment,
                                                         I seemed to be blindfolded
  
  
 but the clock
                             --talk     talk-- 
                                                         continuing called me,
  
  
 a voice ever stranger
                             in complaint.
                                                         With my staff I came
  
  
 to the first step,
                             sanguine indeed,
                                                         and dressed in a well-cut Western suit
  
  
 --quite the best I saw on anybody
                             during my whole stay
                                                         in that unstable regime.
  
  
 There were people in plots
                             bowing to creation.
                                                         Please I protested,
  
  
 I had not come to stay,
                             You will go in
                                                         said Nobody,
  
  
 all will be quiet.
                             I looked down
                                                         and could see thousands
  
  
 crowding into the grounds
                             --my     my-- 
                                                         and climbed into the burial site.
  
  
 Within the twisted
                             rows of graves,
                                                         the teeth of under,
  
  
 some spoke of hatred
                             and some of hope.
                                                         Blind, they wept on command,
  
  
 in wheelchairs,
                             on crutches,
                                                         waving stumps.
  
  
 It was rather haunting--
                             the gates of shadows,
                                                         the path unlit,
  
  
 and ahead,
                             also dark,
                                                         an abandoned fortress.
  
  
 Carried along by the crowd,
                             our way lit by flashlights
                                                         through dim corridors,
  
  
 I said Citizens,
                             no     no.
                                                         Ahead, a door opened.
  
  
 I recognized the old council
                             sitting round a table,
                                                         some in religious collars,
  
  
 the atmosphere a court.
                             Chairing the proceeding,
                                                         a tall, bearded figure
  
  
 uttered a few words in German,
                             for my benefit.
                                                         He had lived for a time
  
  
 and remarked
                             that I needed
                                                         to be dealt with.
  
  
 Listening quietly,
                             I tried to avoid
                                                         any show of emotion.
  
  
 This clearly displeased him.
                             He seemed to expect me
                                                         to present my own commentary.
  
  
 I said in reply
                             the following,
                                                         shaken and uneasy,
  
  
 the slim thread of truth but little help . . .





Book Three: 16
 

I tried to cut through
                             all our hurried centuries,
                                                         lost in a forest within.
  
  
 Men
                             broke by war
                                                         emerged in frightful shape--
  
  
 more than human
                             but also less,
                                                         they were quite aware,
  
  
 the sovereign dead,
                             that time is like a window
                                                         opening up the sad patterns of never.
  
  
 As one they advanced--
                             Lloyd George
                                                         Georges Clemenceau
  
  
 Adolph Hitler
                             --through history.
                                                         But the past does not follow
  
  
 so straightforward a path
                             said I
                                                         (predictably in Italian),
  
  
 and, burning
                             under their masters,
                                                         they proclaimed
  
  
 the world a pendulum.
                             It is possible,
                                                         but this gives rise
  
  
 to the often-heard complaint
                             that repetition is unavoidable.
                                                         Still time issues into today,
  
  
 little fathers.
                             The years, I believe,
                                                         can be shaped with one's hands.
  
  
 The world
                             --its obscure moving fields,
                                                         Persian tragedies,
  
  
 and countries in peace--
                             I had to inform 
                                                         that council of the lost,
  
  
 remains an instrument,
                             a valve instrument,
                                                         which, when waning,
  
  
 is perfectly clear in the pit
                             --and, being given
                                                         to such classical concepts
  
  
 as freedom and necessity,
                             laboriously continued
                                                         in the traditional way--
  
  
 I believe     I believe.





Book Three: 19
 

Drawn in outer space
                             on a ceiling of night,
                                                         a hinged balance held true.

The Change
 

Thirteen years ago,    before bulk barns    and
 fifth gear diesel tractors,    we rode royal blue tractors with
 toolboxes big enough    to hold a six pack on ice.
 In the one hundred fifteen degree    summer
 heat    with air    so thick with moisture
 you drink as you breathe.
 Before the year dusters sprayed
 malathion over our clustered bodies,    perspiring
 while we primed bottom lugs,
 those ground level leaves of tobacco,
 and it clung to us with black tar so sticky we rolled
 eight-inch balls off our arms at night    and
 Cloroxed our clothes for hours and hours.
 Before we were poisoned    and
 the hospital thought we had been burned in fires,
 at least to the third degree,
 when the raw, oozing hives that 
 covered ninety-eight percent of our bodies
 from the sprays ordered by the FDA
 and spread by     landowners,
 before anyone had seen
 automated machines that top and prime.
 While we topped the lavender
 blooms of many tiny flowers
 gathered into one,    gorgeous.
 By grasping hold below the petals
 with our bare, calloused hands
 and twisting downward, quick, hard,
 only one time,    snapped them off.
 Before edgers and herbicides took
 what they    call weeds,
 when we walked for days
 through thirty acres    and
 chopped them out with hoes.
 Hoes,    made long before    from wood and steel
 and sometimes (even longer ago)
 from wood and deer scapula.
 Before the bulk primers came
 and we primed all the leaves by hand,
 stooped over at the waist for the
 lower ones    and    through the season
 gradually    rising higher     until    we stood
 and worked simultaneously,
 as married to the fields as we were to each other,
 carrying up to fifty pounds of fresh
 leaves under each arm    and    sewing them onto
 sticks four feet long on a looper
 under the shade of a tin-roofed barn,    made of shingle,
 and poking it up through the rafters inside
 to be caught by a hanger    who
 poked it up higher in the rafters    to another
 who held a higher position
 and    so    they filled the barn.
 And the leaves hung down
 like butterfly wings,    though
 sometimes the color of
 luna moths,    or Carolina parakeets,    when just
 an hour ago    they had been
 laid upon    the old wooden
 cart trailers pulled behind
 the orange Allis-Chalmers tractor
 with huge, round fenders and only
 a screwdriver and salt in the toolbox,
 picked by primers    so hot
 we would race through the rows
 to reach the twenty-five gallon
 jugs of water placed throughout
 the field to encourage    and    in attempt to
 satisfy our insatiable thirsts
 from drinking air    which poured
through our pores without breaking
 through to our need    for more
 water    in the sun.
 Sun we imagined to disappear
 yet respected    for growing all things on earth
 when quenched with rains called forth
 by our song     and drumming.
 Leaves, which weeks later,    would be
 taken down and the strings pulled
 like string on top of a large dog-food bag
 and sheeted up into burlap sheets
 that bundled over a hundred pounds
 when we smashed down with our feet,
 but gently smashing,
 then thrown up high    to
 a catcher    on a big clapboard trailer
 pulled behind two-ton trucks and
 taken to market in Fuquay-Varina
 and sold to Philip Morris    and
 Winston-Salem    for around    a buck a pound.
 Leaves cured to a bright leaf,
 a golden yellow with the strongest
 aroma of tobacco barn curing
 and hand grown quality
 before the encroachment of
 big business in the Reagan era
 and the slow murder of method
 from a hundred years before.
 When the loons cried out in
 laughter by the springs and
 the bass popped the surface on
 the pond, early on, next to
 the fields, before that time
 when it was unfashionable to
 transplant each individual baby plant,
the infant tobacco we nurtured, to
transplant those seedlings to each hill
 in the field, the space for that particular plant
 and we watched    as    they would grow.
 Before all of this new age, new way,
 I was a sharecropper in Willow Springs, North Carolina,
 as were you    and we were proud to be Tsa la gi
 wishing for winter    so we could make camp
 at Qualla Boundary    and Oconaluftee
 would be free of tourists and filled with snow
 and those of us who held out forever
 and had no CIBs would be home again
 with our people, while the BIA forgot to watch.
 When we still remembered before even the Europeans,
 working now shoulder to shoulder with descendants
 of their slaves they brought from Africa
 when they sold our ancestors as slaves in the Middle East,
 that then the tobacco was sacred to all of us and we
 prayed whenever we smoked and
 did not smoke for pleasure    and
 I    was content and free.
 Then they came and changed things
 and you left me for a fancy white girl
 and I waited on the land
 until you brought her back
 in that brand new white Trans Am,
 purchased from our crop,    you gave her
 and left her waiting in a motel.
 The nearest one was forty miles away,
 but    near enough    for you
 and    for her    and I knew    though
 I never spoke a word to you
 about it,    I knew and I kept it to
 myself    to this day    and time    and
 I never let on
 until I left    on our anniversary.
 I drove the pick-up
 down the dirt path    by the empty fields
 and rented a shack for eighty dollars,
 the one with cardboard windows
 and a Gillespie house floor design,
 with torn and faded floral paper on walls
 and linoleum so thin over rotted board
 that the floor gave if you weighed over
 a hundred pounds.    I did not.
 And with no running water of any kind,    or bathroom.
 The one at hilltop,    where I could
 see out across all the fields
 and hunt for meat when I wanted
 and find peace.
 I heard you remarried
 and went into automated farming
 and kept up with America.
 I watched all of you    from the hill
 and I waited for the lavender blooms
 to return    and when it was spring
 even the blooms    had turned white.
 I rolled up my bedroll,    remembering before,
 when the fields were like waves on a green ocean,
 and turned away,    away from the change
 and corruption    of big business on small farms
 of traditional agricultural people,    and sharecroppers.
 Away,    so that I could always    hold this concise image
 of before    that    time    and it
 floods    my memory.

Tear
 

It was the time before
 I was born.
 I was thin.
 I was hungry. I was
 only a restlessness inside a woman's body.
  
 Above us, lightning split open the sky.
 Below us, wagon wheels cut land in two.
 Around us were the soldiers,
 young and afraid,
 who did not trust us
 with scissors or knives
 but with needles.
  
 Tear dresses they were called
 because settler cotton was torn
 in straight lines
 like the roads we had to follow
 to Oklahoma.
  
 But when the cloth was torn,
 it was like tears,
 impossible to hold back,
 and so they were called
 by this other name,
 for our weeping.
  
 I remember the women.
 Tonight they walk
 out from the shadows
 with black dogs,
 children, the dark heavy horses,
 and worn-out men.
  
 They walk inside me. This blood
 is a map of the road between us.
 I am why they survived.
 The world behind them did not close.
 The world before them is still open.
 All around me are my ancestors,
 my unborn children.
 I am the tear between them
 and both sides live.






The History of Red
 

First
 there was some other order of things
 never spoken
 but in dreams of darkest creation.
  
 Then there was black earth,
 lake, the face of light on water.
 Then the thick forest all around
 that light,
 and then the human clay
 whose blood we still carry
 rose up in us
 who remember caves with red bison
 painted in their own blood,
 after their kind.
  
 A wildness
 swam inside our mothers,
 desire through closed eyes,
 a new child
 wearing the red, wet mask of birth,
 delivered into this land
 already wounded,
 stolen and burned
 beyond reckoning.
  
 Red is this yielding land
 turned inside out
 by a country of hunters
 with iron, flint and fire.
 Red is the fear
 that turns a knife back
 against men, holds it at their throats,
 and they cannot see the claw on the handle,
 the animal hand
 that haunts them
 from some place inside their blood.
  
 So that is hunting, birth,
 and one kind of death.
 Then there was medicine, the healing of wounds.
 Red was the infinite fruit
 of stolen bodies.
 The doctors wanted to know
 what invented disease
 how wounds healed
 from inside themselves
 how life stands up in skin,
 if not by magic.
  
 They divined the red shadows of leeches
 that swam in white bowls of water:
 they believed stars
 in the cup of sky.
 They cut the wall of skin
 to let
 what was bad escape
 but they were reading the story of fire
 gone out
 and that was a science.
  
 As for the animal hand on death's knife,
 knives have as many sides
 as the red father of war
 who signs his name
 in the blood of other men.
  
 And red was the soldier
 who crawled
 through a ditch
 of human blood in order to live.
 It was the canal of his deliverance.
 It is his son who lives near me.
 Red is the thunder in our ears
 when we meet.
 Love, like creation,
 is some other order of things.
  
 Red is the share of fire
 I have stolen
 from root, hoof, fallen fruit.
 And this was hunger.
  
 Red is the human house
 I come back to at night
 swimming inside the cave of skin
 that remembers bison.
 In that round nation
 of blood
 we are all burning,
 red, inseparable fires
 the living have crawled
 and climbed through 
in order to live
 so nothing will be left
 for death at the end.
  
 This life in the fire, I love it.
 I want it,
 this life.





Two
 

The weight of a man on a woman
 is like falling into the river without drowning.
  
 Above, the world is burning and fighting.
 Lost worlds flow through others.
  
 But down here beneath water's skin,
 river floor, sand, everything
  
 is floating, rocking.
 Water falls through our hands as we fall through it.
  
 And when a woman and a man come up from water
 they stand at the elemental edge of difference.
  
 Mirrored on water's skin,
 they are fired clay, water evaporating into air.
  
 They are where water turns away from land
 and goes back to enter a larger sea.
  
 A man and a woman are like those rivers,
 entering a larger sea
  
 greater than the sum of all its parts.





Buried
 

   "We do not dig graves or put caskets into graves any longer. The decision was made and funeral homes were notified that families and funeral homes would have to supply grave-digging personnel.
    --Ed Mazoue, New Orleans City Real Estate Administrator and Person in Charge of the City's Cemeteries
  
  
  
 There's nothing but mud. The ground looks dry and firm,
 but underneath is a stew of storm. Stout shovels, rusted,
 grow gummed and heavy with what I heft and rearrange.
  
 Progress is slow.
  
 The sun so often steams me shut, and I have to stop
 to gulp sugared bites of tea,
 flick away sweat with my swollen fingers,
 swat hard at sluggish flies who hover,
  
 like they know.
  
 And when I start again, there's a rhythm to it,
 some ticking jazz that gets my square hips involved.
 I craft a chant purely for downbeat:
 Plunge.   Push.   Lift.   Toss it.
 Plunge.   Push.   Lift.   Toss it.
 My untried muscles blaze,
 joints click,
 pulse clutches my chest.
  
 Whole clocks later, I pause to relish the feat,
 to marvel at the way I've compromised the earth,
 how I've been that kind of God for a minute.
 But only time has moved.
 It's like trying to reach the next world with a spoon.
  
 My boy would have laughed.
 Daddy, you better sit down and watch some ball game,
 and we'd settle, Sunday lazy,
 his squirm balanced on my belly.
  
 He needed what I was and what I wasn't.
 Giggling in little language, he lobbed me the ball soft,
 walked slower when I was at his side,
 shared puffed white bread and purple jelly.
 He waited patiently for me after dark
 while I shuffled piles of books, looking for
 a bedtime drama of spacemen or soldiers,
 some crayoned splash to wrap his day around.
  
 But every night, when I opened the door to his room,
 all I saw
 was a quivering mountain of Snoopys, Blues, and Scoobys.
 Underneath them, his happy body could barely cage breath.
 Giggles unleashed his toes. My line, then: Where are yoooou?

Plunge.   Push.   Lift.   Toss it.
  
 Plunge.   Push.   Lift.   Toss--
  
 With the dirt balanced high, screaming my shoulder,
 I think hard on those nights of tussle and squeal.
 I want to feel his heat and twist in my arms again.
  
 I have to dig.





Katrina
 

I was birthed restless and elsewhere
  
 gut dragging and bulging with ball lightning, slush,
 broke through with branches, steel
  
 I was bitch-monikered, hipped, I hefted
 a whip rain, a swirling sheet of grit.
  
 Scraping toward the first of you, hungering for wood, walls,
 unturned skin. With shifting and frantic mouth, I loudly loved
 the slow bones
  
 of elders, fools, and willows.





PrologueAnd Then She Owns You
 

This is not morning. There is a nastiness
 slowing your shoes, something you shouldn't step in.
 It's shattered beads, stomped flowers, vomit--
 such stupid beauty,
  
 beauty you can stick a manicured finger
 into and through, beauty that doesn't rely
 on any sentence the sun chants, it's whiskey
 swelter blown scarlet.
  
 Call this something else. Last night it had a name,
 a name wedged between an organ's teeth, a name
 pumping a virgin unawares, a curse word.
 Wail it, regardless,
  
 Weak light, bleakly triumphant, will unveil scabs,
 snippets of filth music, cars on collapsed veins.
 The whole of gray doubt slithers on solemn skin.
 Call her New Orleans.
  
 Each day she wavers, not knowing how long she
 can stomach the introduction of needles,
 the brash, boozed warbling of bums with neon crowns,
 necklaces raining.
  
 She tries on her voice, which sounds like cigarettes,
 pubic sweat, brown spittle lining a sax bell
 the broken heel on a drag queen's scarlet slings.
 Your kind of singing.
  
 Weirdly in love, you rhumba her edges, drink
 fuming concoctions, lick your lukewarm breakfast
 directly from her crust. Go on, admit it.
 You are addicted
  
 to her brick hips, the thick swerve she elicits,
 the way she kisses you, her lies wide open.
 She prefers alleys, crevices, basement floors.
 Hell, let her woo you.
  
 This kind of romance dims the worth of soldiers,
 bends and breaks the back, sips manna from muscle,
 tells you Leave your life. Pack your little suitcase,
 flee what is rigid
  
 and duly prescribed. Let her touch that raw space
 between cock and calm, the place that scripts such jazz.
 Let her pen letters addressed to your asking.
 You s-s-stutter.
  
 New Orleans's, p-please. Don't. Blue is the color
 stunning your tongue. At least the city pretends
 to remember to be listening.
 She grins with glint tooth,
  
 wiping your mind blind of the wife, the children,
 the numb ritual of job and garden plot.
 Gently, she leads you out into the darkness
 and makes you drink rain.





Siblings
 

Hurricanes, 2005
  
  
 Arlene learned to dance backwards in heels that were too high.
 Bret prayed for a shaggy mustache made of mud and hair.
 Cindy just couldn't keep her windy legs together.
 Dennis never learned to swim.
 Emily whispered her gusts into a thousand skins.
Franklin, farsighted and anxious, bumbled villages.
 Gert spat her matronly name against a city's flat face.
 Harvey hurled a wailing child high.
 Irene, the baby girl, threw pounding tantrums.
 Jos liked the whip sound of slapping.
 Lee just craved the whip.
 Maria's thunder skirts flew high when she danced.
 Nate was mannered and practical. He stormed precisely.
 Ophelia nibbled weirdly on the tips of depressions.
 Philippe slept too late, flailing on a wronged ocean.
 Rita was a vicious flirt. She woke Philippe with rumors.
 Stan was born business, a gobbler of steel.
 Tammy crooned country, getting the words all wrong.
 Vince died before anyone could remember his name.
 Wilma opened her maw wide, flashing rot.
  
 None of them talked about Katrina.
 She was their odd sister,
 the blood dazzler.





The President Flies Over
 

Aloft between heaven and them,
  
 I babble the landscape--what staunch, vicious trees,
 what cluttered roads, slow cars. This is my
  
 country as it was gifted me--victimless, vast.
 The soundtrack buzzing the air around my ears
 continually loops ditties of eagles and oil.
 I can't choose. Every moment I'm awake,
 aroused instrumentals channel theme songs,
 speaking
 what I cannot.
  
 I don't ever have to come down.
 I can stay hooked to heaven,
 dictating this blandness.
 My flyboys memorize flip and soar.
 They'll never swoop real enough
 to resurrect that other country,
  
 won't ever get close enough to give name
 to tonight's dreams darkening the water.
  
 I understand that somewhere it has rained.





Poem for My Father
 

for Quincy T. Trouppe Sr.
  

father, it was an honor to be there, in the dugout
 with you, the glory of great black men swinging their lives
 as bats, at tiny white balls
 burning in at unbelievable speeds, riding up & in & out
 a curve breaking down wicked, like a ball falling off a table
 moving away, snaking down, screwing its stitched magic
 into chitlin circuit air, its comma seams spinning
 toward breakdown, dipping, like a hipster
 bebopping a knee-dip stride, in the charlie parker forties
 wrist curling, like a swan's neck
 behind a slick black back
 cupping an invisible ball of dreams
  
 & you there, father, regal, as an african, obeah man
 sculpted out of wood, from a sacred tree, of no name, no place, origin
 thick branches branching down, into cherokee & someplace else lost
 way back in africa, the sap running dry
 crossing from north carolina into georgia, inside grandmother mary's
 womb, where your mother had you in the violence of that red soil
 ink blotter news, gone now, into blood graves
 of american blues, sponging rococo
 truth long gone as dinosaurs
 the agent-oranged landscape of former names
 absent of african polysyllables, dry husk, consonants there
 now, in their place, names, flat, as polluted rivers
 & that guitar string smile always snaking across
 some virulent, american, redneck's face
 scorching, like atomic heat, mushrooming over nagasaki
 & hiroshima, the fever blistered shadows of it all
 inked, as etchings, into sizzled concrete
 but you, there, father, through it all, a yardbird solo
 riffing on bat & ball glory, breaking down the fabricated myths
 of white major league legends, of who was better than who
 beating them at their own crap
 game, with killer bats, as bud powell swung his silence into beauty
 of a josh gibson home run, skittering across piano keys of bleachers
 shattering all manufactured legends up there in lights
 struck out white knights, on the risky edge of amazement
 awe, the miraculous truth sluicing through
 steeped & disguised in the blues
 confluencing, like the point at the cross
 when a fastball hides itself up in a slider, curve
 breaking down & away in a wicked, sly grin
 curved & posed as an ass-scratching uncle tom, who
 like old sachel paige delivering his famed hesitation pitch
 before coming back with a hard, high, fast one, is slicker
 sliding, & quicker than a professional hitman--
 the deadliness of it all, the sudden strike
 like that of the "brown bomber's crossing right
 of sugar ray robinson's, lightning, cobra bite
  
 & you, there, father, through it all, catching rhythms
 of chono pozo balls, drumming, like conga beats into your catcher's mitt
 hard & fast as "cool papa bell jumping into bed
 before the lights went out
  
 of the old, negro baseball league, a promise, you were
 father, a harbinger, of shock waves, soon come





A Terror is More Certain . . .
 

          
          A terror is more certain than all the rare desirable popular songs I know, than even now when all of my myths have become . . . , & walk around in black shiny galoshes & carry dirty laundry to & fro, & read great books & don't know criminals intimately, & publish fat books of the month & have wifeys that are lousy in bed & never realize how bad my writing is because i am poor & symbolize myself.   A certain desirable is more terror to me than all that's rare. How come they don't give an academic award to all the movie stars that die? they're still acting, ain't they? even if they are dead, it should not be held against them, after all they still have the public on their side, how would you like to be a dead movie star & have people sit- ting on your grave?   A rare me is more certain than desirable, that's all the terror, there are too many basketball players in this world & too much progress in the burial industry, lets have old fashioned funerals & stand around & forgive & borrow wet handkerchiefs, & sneak out for drinks & help load the guy into the wagon, & feel sad & make a date with the widow & believe we don't see all of the people sink- ing into the subways going to basketball games & designing baby sitters at Madison Square Garden.   A certain me is desirable, what is so rare as air in a Poem, why can't i write a foreign movie like all the other boys my age, I confess to all the crimes committed during the month of April, but not to save my own neck, which is adjustable, & telescopes into any size noose, I'm doing it to save Gertrude Stein's reputation, who is secretly flying model airplanes for the underground railroad stern gang of oz, & is the favorite in all the bouts . . . not officially opened yet Holland tunnel is the one who writes untrue phone numbers.   A desirable poem is more rare than rare, & terror is certain, who wants to be a poet & work a twenty four hour shift, they never ask you first, who wants to listen to the radiator play string quartets all night. I want to be allowed not to be, suppose a man wants to swing on the kiddie swings, should people be allowed to stab him with queer looks & drag him off to bed & its no fun on top of a lady when her hair is full of shiny little machines & your ass reflected in that television screen, who wants to be a poet if you fuck on t.v. & all those cowboys watching.
        




Believe, Believe
 

Believe in this. Young apple seeds,
 In blue skies, radiating young breast,
 Not in blue-suited insects,
 Infesting society's garments.
  
 Believe in the swinging sounds of jazz,
 Tearing the night into intricate shreds,
 Putting it back together again,
 In cool logical patterns,
 Not in the sick controllers,
 Who created only the Bomb.
  
 Let the voices of dead poets
 Ring louder in your ears
 Than the screechings mouthed
 In mildewed editorials.
 Listen to the music of centuries,
 Rising above the mushroom time.





O-Jazz-O War Memoir: Jazz, Dont Listen To It At Your Own Risk
 

In the beginning, in the wet
 Warm dark place,
 Straining to break out, clawing at strange cables
 Hearing her screams, laughing
 "Later we forgave ourselves, we didn't know
 Some secret jazz
 Shouted, wait, don't go.
 Impatient, we came running, innocent
 Laughing blobs of blood & faith.
 To this mother, father world
 Where laughter seems out of place
 So we learned to cry, pleased
 They pronounce human.
 The secret Jazz blew a sigh
 Some familiar sound shouted wait
 Some are evil, some will hate.
 "Just Jazz, blowing its top again
 So we rushed & laughed.
 As we pushed & grabbed
 While jazz blew in the night
 Suddenly they were too busy to hear a simple sound
 They were busy shoving mud in men's mouths,
 Who were busy dying on the living ground
 Busy earning medals, for killing children on deserted street corners
 Occupying their fathers, raping their mothers, busy humans we
 Busy burning Japanese in atomicolorcinemascope
 With stereophonic screams,
 What one hundred per cent red blooded savage, would waste precious 
             time
 Listening to jazz, with so many important things going on
 But even the fittest murderers must rest
 So they sat down in our blood soaked garments,
 and listened to jazz
             lost, steeped in all our death dreams
 They were shocked at the sound of life, long gone from our own
 They were indignant at the whistling, thinking, singing, beating,
             swinging,
 They wept for it, hugged, kissed it, loved it, joined it, we drank it,
 Smoked it, ate with it, slept with it
 They made our girls wear it for lovemaking
 Instead of silly lace gowns,
 Now in those terrible moments, when the dark memories come
 The secret moments to which we admit no one
 When guiltily we crawl back in time, reaching away from ourselves
 They hear a familiar sound,
 Jazz, scratching, digging, blueing, swinging jazz,
 And listen,
 And feel, & die.





Nebraska
 

La luna
 Sang the miles por los palos
 de Nebraska
 You bunch of lights
 And houses    How did you walk
 to this place
 Buffalo Bill
 Better know him some Spanish
 Para Horses    ride
 rubber horseshoes
 moderno.
  
 El caf
 Boiled water/no milk in sight.
 Homes that will travel interstate
 8 o tomorrow in the morning
 for the next edge of town.
  
 The cowgirls/the local rodeo
 As they galloped by their hair
 unmoved by 15 miles per hour wind
 It seems that 25 pounds of hair spray
 is enough to hold a mountain down
 Their hair style longer than their
 faces.
 Que Pasa?

 do not feel at home any more
 La luna

 Let's watch

Three Songs from the 50s
 

Song 1
  
 Julito used to shine the soul
 of his shoes before he left for
 the Palladium to take the wax
 off the floor while Tito Rodriguez
 flew around the walls like a
 parakeet choking maracas
 It was around this time that
 Julito threw away his cape
 because the Umbrella Man and the
 Dragons put the heat on all the
 Ricans who used to fly around
 in Dracula capes swinging canes
 or carrying umbrellas
 Even if there was no rain
 on the horizon
 That same epoca my mother
 got the urge to paint the
 living room pink and buy a
 new mirror with flamingoes
 elegantly on the right hand
 corner because the one we had
 was broken from the time that
 Carlos tried to put some respect
 Into Julito and knock the
 party out of him.
  
  
 Song 2
  
 All the old Chevies that the
 gringoes from upstate New York
 wore out
 Were sailing around the neighborhood
 with dices and San Martin de Porres
 el negrito who turned catholic
 Hanging in the front windows.
  
  
 Song 3
  
 There was still no central heating
 in the tenements
 We thought that the cold was
 the oldest thing on the planet earth
 We used to think about my Uncle Listo
 Who never left his hometown
 We'd picture him siting around
 cooling himself with a fan
 In that imaginary place
 called Puerto Rico.





Mountain Building
 

The mountain have changed to buildings
 Is this hallway the inside of a stem
 That has a rattling flower for a head,
 Immense tree bark with roots made out of 
 Mailboxes?
 In the vertical village moons fly out of
 Apartment windows and though what you 
 See is a modern city
 The mountain's guitars pluck inside
 It's agriculture taking an elevator
 Through urban caves which lead to
 Paths underground They say Camuy
 To Hutuado
 Taino subground like the IRT in
 Constant motion
  
 The streets take walks in your dark eyes
 Seashell necklaces make music in the
 Origin of silence
 What are we stepping on? Pineapple
 Fields frozen with snow
 Concrete dirt later the rocks of the
 Atlantic
 The sculpture of the inner earth
 Down there where you thought only worms
 And unnamed crocodiles parade
 Lefty stands on a corner
 Analyzing every seed
 Squeezing the walls as he passes
 Through at the bottom of the basement
 Where the boiler makes heat
 The flesh arrives out of a hole
 In the mountain that goes up like a
 Green wall
 Bodies come in making maraca sounds
 An invisible map out of the flora
 Bees arrive in the vicinity and sing
 Chorus while woody woodpeckers make
 Women out of trees and place flowers
 On their heads
 Waterfalls like Hurakan's faucets
 Caress the back of Yuquiyu
 God to all whose tongues have the
 Arawak's echoes
  
 Hallway of graffiti like the master
 Cave drawings made by owls when they
 Had hands
 You see the fish with pyramids inside
 Their stomachs
 Hanging near the doorways where
 San Lazaro turns the keys
 Villa Manhattan
 Breeze of saint juice made from
 Coconuts
 Slide down the stairs to your
 Belly and like a hypnotized guanabana
 You float down the street
 And win all your hands at dominoes
  
 The Moros live on the top floor eating
 Roots and have a rooster on the roof
 Africans import okra from the bodega
 The Indians make a base of guava
 On the first floor
 The building is spinning itself into
 a spiral of salsa
 Heaven must be calling or the
 Residents know the direction
 Because there is an upward pull
 If you rise too quickly from your seat
 You might have to comb a spirit's 
 Hair
 They float over the chimneys
 Arrive through the smog
 Appear through the plaster of Paris
 It is the same people in the windowed
 Mountains.





El Poema de lo Reverso
 

In which everything goes backwards
 in time and motion
 Palm trees shrink back into the ground
 Mangos become seeds
 and reappear in the eyes of Indian
 women
 The years go back
 cement becomes wood
 Panama hats are seen upon skeletons
 walking the plazas
 Of once again wooden benches
 The past starts to happen again
 I see Columbus's three boats
 going backwards on the sea
 Getting smaller
 Crossing the Atlantic back to the
 ports of Spain    Cadiz    Dos Palos    Huelva
 Where the sailors disembark
 and go back to their towns
 To their homes
 They become adolescents again
 become children                infants
 they re-enter the wombs of their mothers
 till they become glances
 Clutching a pound of bread
 through a busy plaza
 that becomes the taste
 of the sound of church bells
 in reverberation.





Red Beans
 

Next  to white rice
 it looks like coral
 sitting next to snow
  
 Hills of starch
 border
 The burnt sienna
 of irony
  
 Azusenas being chased by
 the terra cotta feathers
 of a rooster
  
 There is a lava flow
 through the smoking
 white mounds
  
 India red
 spills on ivory
  
 Ochre cannon balls
 falling
 next to blanc pebbles
  
 Red beans and milk
 make burgundy wine
  
 Violet pouring
 from the eggshell
 tinge of the plate.





Time Zones
 

Time is crying upon the backs of lizards,
 Through the white stone of the medieval city
 They dash.
 The houses that are walking up the stairs,
 Flowers out of ruins,
 Further into the fortress,
 The sounds of a language registers
 In our dreams.
  
 Words which are my hat in the city,
 Coming through the bamboo
 The shadows of lost meaning--
 Tilted light making slivers
 Through the forest of the mambo
 Behind the eyes.
  
 Time will shine your head into skull
 The circle song will come again and again,
 If we forget how to lay out a village,
 Just open a guayaba in half,
 These seeds are perfect,
 And can guide you back,
 Your hands the electric of the ghosts.
  
 In the Persia of shining alfombras,
 A belly button silks upon a horse,
 Enters a tent of rhythms,
 Makes the trees dance into shape,
 Rubn Daro saw them in the river,
 Bathing in the echoes of the castles,
 His Indio head,
 Clean enough to measure
 The tempo of a camel,
 The first string that vibrated
 The Rock of Gibraltar,
 To sway Greco-Roman lips,
 Arising fire of Gypsy song,
 Was making Castile dress and undress,
 With the sounds that were hitting the moon
 And falling down unto earth as colors.
  
 Of boats that were my shoes.
 Atlantic chachach.
 Splicing through 101st Street brick.
 Which covered dancing verdure green
 Rectangular mangos,
 Cylindric bananas
 Sounds in the sky blue tropic: mind.
  
 Trees are making maracas
 That will soon make you dance.
  
 Water is their god of cadence,
 As I sea walk through coconut heights,
 Legs of tamarind,
 Purple orchids arranged like syllables,
 Insects of the morning dew sting verses on caf.
 In embroidery of Italians,
 Garcilaso came to Jos Mart,
 Who ducked Spanish spies
 In Manhattan
 And hugged Walt Whitman's beard in Philadelphia
 As the Cuban Habaneras' Shango
 Made it south to tango.
  
 Boats are ages sailing on water,
 Parrots are flying out of castanets,
 Flamenco peeling pineapples
 That go up the river,
 The water that became El Quijote's language,
 As a cane field disappears into a bottle,
 To awake in a little town
 With molasses orbiting the cathedral,
 A wooden saint slicing through the
 Mountain full of potassium radiation,
 Slanted pltanos pointing into medieval
 Liturgy,
 Bongo and ocean waves carving
 Phantasmal antiquity
 Through the fabulous language
 That has taken the shape of
 An Andalusian rhyming door,
 One after the other.
 Perfume pagano
 Sailing out of the archways,
 As Ricardo Ray turns into a centipede,
 Marching across a Brooklyn piano,
 For dancers to Sanskrit their
 Gypsy feet,
 Upon Albaicn ceramic tile.
 Caribbean sun melts the caramel,
 Making our first national flag:
 White skirts waving  in the air.
 Machetes taking off like helicopters
 Chopping off branches for timbale sticks,
 The hands of the sun hitting the
 Moon like a drum--
 Making the atmosphere of moisture
 Heat up,
 For the chorus of the song
 To come back down upon us polinizando
 The carnival flower,
 A serenade walkilipiando.
  
 Sliding upon seashells,
 That disappear into the foam of time,
 One age living next to another,
 We are both living things at once,
 We are the cadaver that is
 About to be born.





La Lupe
 

Her voice comes out of her knees,
 her fingernails are full of sound,
 Birds are in her lungs,
 which gives her gargantuan flight,
 A florescence through ether waves,
 like ancestral Morse codes.
  
 Oriente province de Cuba
 her first steps.
 At nineteen she dismantled retinas--
 roosters blew themselves inside out,
 When she swayed by cathedrals they folded,
 guayacan trees fell to their knees,
 Mountains bowed with the contents
 for ajiaco.
 She filled the horizon with kerchiefs,
 gypsies danced behind her,
 Her bracelets were snakes,
 forces were captured in her gold chains,
 The moon was in her silver,
 there were reptiles stationed
 In her Afro-Siboney cheeks,
 there were in her Asian eyes
 Radars picking up the fingertips
 of the piano player--
 The language of the trumpet--
 black changos landing upon
 The shelf of her eyelids.
  
 She motioned in songs to live them.
 Her passion destroyed the container,
 She blew up into false promises,
 romantic lyrics tied her in knots,
 Broken into pieces of kisses,
 she knew it was "theater
 That you offered,
 A landscape hanging in the
 museums of desire,
 Rows of guayava paste,
 stories that according
 To your point of view,
 salons of dried roses.
 Illusions.
  
 Her songs became the windows
 of the city,
 In the distance a hurt bellows
 from a bird locked in a radio.
  
 Classroom teacher of tropical children,
 reading to them native flora--
 A wind entered her and she flew to
 New York,
 eating the skyline,
 Bridges of electric lights,
 conduits to the house of the Saints.
 At the Jefferson Theater
 she melted the microphone
 Into liquid mercury,
 and an ambulance had to
 Get her off the stage.
  
 She embodied in gowns, capes,
 dresses, necklaces, bonnets,
 Velvets, suedes, diamond-studded,
 flowers, sequins, 
 All through which
 she wanted to eat herself
 She salvaged us all,
 but took the radiation.
 Each time she sang
 she crossed the sea.
 From the Bronx
 she went back to Cuba,
 Adrift on the sails
 of a song.





Fado
 

A man reaches close
and lifts a quarter 
from inside a girl's ear,
from her hands takes a dove
she didn't know was there.
Which amazes more,
you may wonder:
the quarter's serrated murmur
against the thumb
or the dove's knuckled silence?
That he found them, 
or that she never had,
or that in Portugal,
this same half-stopped moment,
it's almost dawn, 
and a woman in a wheelchair
is singing a fado 
that puts every life in the room
on one pan of a scale, 
itself on the other, 
and the copper bowls balance.





Like Two Negative Numbers Multiplied by Rain
 

Lie down, you are horizontal. 
Stand up, you are not.

I wanted my fate to be human.

Like a perfume 
that does not choose the direction it travels,
that cannot be straight or crooked, kept out or kept.

Yes, No, Or
--a day, a life, slips through them,
taking off the third skin, 
taking off the fourth.

And the logic of shoes becomes at last simple,
an animal question, scuffing.

Old shoes, old roads--
the questions keep being new ones.
Like two negative numbers multiplied by rain 
into oranges and olives.





My Weather
 

Wakeful, sleepy, hungry, anxious,
restless, stunned, relieved.

Does a tree also?
A mountain?

A cup holds 
sugar, flour, three large rabbit-breaths of air.

I hold these.





Things keep sorting themselves.
 

Does the butterfat know it is butterfat,
milk know it's milk?
No.
Something just goes and something remains.

Like a boardinghouse table:
men on one side, women on the other.
Nobody planned it.

Plaid shirts next to one another,
talking in accents from the Midwest.

Nobody plans to be a ghost.

Later on, the young people sit in the kitchen.

Soon enough, they'll be the ones 
to stumble Excuse me and quickly withdraw.
But they don't know that.
No one can ever know that.





Like the Small Hole by the Path-Side Something Lives in
 

Like the small hole by the path-side something lives in,
in me are lives I do not know the names of,

nor the fates of,
nor the hungers of or what they eat.

They eat of me.
Of small and blemished apples in low fields of me 
whose rocky streams and droughts I do not drink.

And in my streets--the narrow ones, 
unlabeled on the self-map--
they follow stairs down music ears can't follow,

and in my tongue borrowed by darkness,
in hours uncounted by the self-clock,
they speak in restless syllables of other losses, other loves. 

There too have been the hard extinctions, 
missing birds once feasted on and feasting.

There too must be machines 
like loud ideas with tungsten bits that grind the day.

A few escape. A mercy.

They leave behind 
small holes that something unweighed by the self-scale lives in.





Snow
 

Snow is what it does.
It falls and it stays and it goes.
It melts and it is here somewhere.
We all will get there.






Mount Street Gardens
 

I'm talking about Mount Street.
Jackhammers give it the staggers.
They're tearing up dear Mount Street.
It's got a torn-up face like Mick Jagger's.

I mean, this is Mount Street!
Scott's restaurant, the choicest oysters, brilliant fish;
Purdey, the great shotgun maker--the street is complete
Posh plush and (except for Marc Jacobs) so English.

Remember the old Mount Street,
The quiet that perfumed the air
Like a flowering tree and smelled sweet
As only money can smell, because after all this was Mayfair?

One used to stay at the Connaught
Till they closed it for a makeover.
One was distraught
To see the dark wood brightened and sleekness take over.

Designer grease
Will help guests slide right into the zone.
Prince Charles and his design police
Are tickled pink because it doesn't threaten the throne.

I exaggerate for effect--
But isn't it grand, the stink of the stank,
That no sooner had the redone hotel just about got itself perfect
Than the local council decided: new street, new sidewalk, relocate the taxi rank!

Turn away from your life--away from the noise!--
Leaving the Connaught and Carlos Place behind.
Hidden away behind those redbrick buildings across the street are serious joys:
Green grandeur on a small enough scale to soothe your mind,

And birdsong as liquid as life was before you were born.
Whenever I'm in London I stop by this delightful garden to hear
The breeze in the palatial trees blow its shepherd's horn.
I sit on a bench in Mount Street Gardens and London is nowhere near.





The Plan
 

For Ann Forsythe Irwin Bourgois
Remembering Ann
Whose beauty began
At the crown of her head
And ran to the deep underneath
Of her feet--
Never aware of her own lan.
Now, half mad with pain, 
She crawls through her rooms,
Calling for doctors,
Falling,
Forgetting,
Consumed,
Trepanned.

Ever since the world began--
Star fall
Nightfall
Bomb fall
Downfall...
Read the scan:
Every woman and every man,
Once a flowered Palestine,
Falls blindly toward the Nakba--
Bald catastrophe,
Prescription--
According to the
Plan.





The State of New York
 

I like the part I play.
They've cast me as Pompeii
The day before the day.
It's my brilliant performance as a luxury man because I act that way.
They say: Just wait, you'll see, you'll pay,
Pompeii.

You're a miracle in a whirlpool
In your blind date's vagina
At your age. Nothin could be fina.
You eat off her bone china.
Don't be a ghoul. Don't be a fool,
You fool.

In the lifelong month of May,
Racing joyously on his moto poeta to the grave,
He's his own fabulous slave.
He rides his superbike faster and faster to save
His master from the coming lava from China, every day,
But especially today, because it's on its way.

Fred Astaire is about to explode
In his buff-colored kidskin gloves, revolving around
The gold knob of his walking stick, with the sound
Of Vesuvia playing,
And the slopes of Vesuvia saying
Her effluvia are in nearly overflowing mode.

Freud had predicted Fred.
In The Future of an Illusion he said:
"Movies are, in other words, the future of God.
Nothing expresses ordinary wishes more dysplastically than current
American politics do. Breast augmentation as a deterrent
To too much government is odd.

Korean women in a shop on Madison give a pedicure to Pompeii.
Fred only knows that he's not getting old.
Pompeii doesn't know it's the day before the day.
The governor of New York is legally blind, a metaphor for his state of mind.
He ought to resign, but he hasn't resigned.
Good riddance, goodbye. The bell has tolled.





Oedipal Strivings
 

A dinosaur egg opens in a lab
And out steps my paternal grandfather, Sam,
Already taller than a man,
And on his way to becoming a stomping mile-high predator, so I ran.
I never knew my mother's father, who may have been a suicide.
He was buried in a pauper's grave my mother tried
To find, without success. Jews grab
The thing they love unless it's ham,
And hold it tightly to them lest it die--
Or like my mother try
To find the ham they couldn't hold.
A hot ham does get cold.
Grampa, monster of malevolence,
I'm told was actually a rare old-fashioned gentleman of courtly benevolence.

At night the thing to do was drive to Pevely Dairy
And park and watch the fountain shooting up and changing colors.
The child sat in the back, finishing his ice-cream soda,
Sucking the straw in the empty glass as a noisy coda.
Sometimes on Sunday they drove to the Green Parrot.
There was the sideways-staring parrot to stare at.
The chickens running around were delicious fried, but nothing was sanitary.
B.O. was the scourge of the age--and polio--and bathroom odors.
If you didn't wash your hands,
It contributed--as did your glands!
His father always had gas for their cars from his royal rationing cards.
The little boy went to see the king at one of the king's coal yards.
The two of them took a trip and toured the dad's wartime coal mine.
It was fun. It was fine.

The smell of rain about to fall,
A sudden coolness in the air,
Sweetness wider than the Mississippi at its muddy brownest.
I didn't steal his crayon, Mrs. Marshall, honest!
It's captain midnight...brought to you by ovaltine!
I travel backwards in a time machine
And step inside a boy who's three feet tall.
How dare he have such curly hair!
A boy and his dog go rafting down the Mississippi River.
They have a message to deliver
To the gold-toothed king.
Sire, we have a message that we bring.
Little boy, approach the throne.
Ow! I hit my funny bone.

The British consul was paid extra because it was a hardship post.
The weather was Antarctica/equatorial extreme.
Surely summer was in error.
Winter was terror.
White snowflakes the size of dinosaur eggs
Versus humidity that walked across your face on housefly legs.
I loved both the most.
Radio made women dream
Of freedom from oppression and the daily nonsense.
Hairy tarantulas in boatloads of bananas made the lazy heat immense
In the heart. Blizzards didn't stop my father's big blue coal trucks so why bother.
Why bother, father?
Billie Holiday was inside.
I thought I had gone to heaven and died.





What Next
 

So the sun is shining blindingly but I can sort of see.
It's like looking at Mandela's moral beauty.
The dying leaves are sizzling on the trees
In a shirtsleeves summer breeze.

But daylight saving is over.
And gaveling the courtroom to order with a four-leaf clover
Is over. And it's altogether November.
And the Pellegrino bubbles rise to the surface and dismember.





Victory Parade
 

My girlfriend is a miracle.
She's so young but she's so beautiful.
So is her new bikini trim,
A waxed-to-neatness center strip of quim.

Now there's a word you haven't heard for a while.
It makes me smile.
It makes me think of James Joyce.
You hear his Oirish voice.

It's spring on Broadway, and in the center strip mall
The trees are all
Excited to be beginning.
My girlfriend's amazing waxing keeps grinning.

It's enough to distract
From the other drastic act
Of display today--Osama bin Laden is dead!
One shot to the chest and one to the head,

SEAL Team 6 far away from my bed
Above Broadway--in Abbottabad, Pakistan, instead.
Bullets beyond compare
Flew over there,

Flew through the air
To above and below the beard of hair,
A type of ordnance that exploded
Inside the guy and instantly downloaded

The brains out the nose. Our Vietnam
Is now radical Islam.
I tip my hat and heart to the lovely tiny lampshade
Above her parade.





From "Critical Opalescence and the Blueness of the Sky
 

Shrugging shallowly down, burrowing
in beneath the heaps of plumped cork- and sallow-
brown leaf, beneath the oak and the brittle bean-

dripping locust and the still so innocent fruit 
trees--bare-boughed and newly blossoming--skinnily
shadowing the frost-seared grasses, I and my 

"now [in this pictured perfect] four-
year-old daughter, huddled, hidden, lie
low. I remember hiding in the fort

too: bedtimes once how snug among books and the plush 
beasts we spoke the speech of angels. Now the world is huge-
ly hushed. The winter sky is hard, kiln-fired

blue. The cherry wood retouched with buds. And small,
untimely flowers like blood-drops on the snow.





Time lapsed. Time dwelt. There was nothing 
apparently to those rumors of rescue 
or reprisals. Absence only

emptied the mind. The fond heart felt
light--likewise lifted right and justly up
to praise the day as it was to high

heaven. You were a "find: rare, rose-
lipped, hennaed, ochred, kohled, long black-
stockinged O like one of Schiele's urewig
girls, flashing a shy semaphore--

spelling eloquently out the f-
word, tenderly revisiting its history.
Lust--like love lost--was the catalyst:
exquisitely expedient, unchanged.





Report from the Subtropics
 

For one thing, there's no more snow 
to watch from an evening window, 
and no armfuls of logs to carry into the house
so cumbersome you have to touch the latch with an elbow,

and once inside, no iron stove waiting like an old woman
for her early dinner of wood.

No hexagrams of frost to study carefully
on the cold glass pages of the bathroom. 

And there's no black sweater to pull over my head
while I wait for the coffee to brew.

Instead, I walk around in children's clothes--
shorts and a T-shirt with the name of a band
lettered on the front, announcing me to nobody.

The sun never fails to arrive early 
and refuses to leave the party
even after I go from room to room,
turning out all the lights, and making a face.

And the birds with those long white necks?
All they do is swivel their heads 
to look at me as I walk past
as if they all knew my password 
and the name of the city where I was born.






Cheerios
 

One bright morning in a restaurant in Chicago
as I waited for my eggs and toast,
I opened the Tribune only to discover
that I was the same age as Cheerios.

Indeed, I was a few months older than Cheerios
for today, the newspaper announced,
was the seventieth birthday of Cheerios
whereas mine had occurred earlier in the year.

Already I could hear them whispering
behind my stooped and threadbare back,
Why that dude's older than Cheerios
the way they used to say

Why that's as old as the hills, 
only the hills are much older than Cheerios
or any American breakfast cereal,
and more noble and enduring are the hills,

I surmised as a bar of sunlight illuminated my orange juice.





The Grind
 

Three mini ciabattini for breakfast
where demand for persnickety bread
is small, hence its expense, hence my steadfast
recalculation of my overhead,

which soars, and as you might expect
the ciabattini stand in for my fantasy
of myself in a sea-limned prospect,
on a terrace, with a lemon tree...

Not: Assessed a fee for rent sent a day late.
Not: Fines accrued for a lost library book.
Better never lose track of the date.
Oversleep, and you're on the hook.

It's the margin for error: shrinking.
It's life ground down to recurrence.
It's fewer books read for the thinking
the hospital didn't rebill the insurance;

the school misplaced the kids' paperwork.
Here's our sweet pup, a rescue
which we nonetheless paid for, and look:
he gets more grooming than I do.

When I turn my hand mill, I think of the dowager
who ground gems on ham for her guests; 
the queen who ground out two cups of flour 
on the pregnant abdomen of her husband's mistress;

I think of a "great rock-eating bird 
grinding out a sandy beach, 
the foam said to be particulate matter 
of minute crustaceans, each

brilliantly spooning up Aphrodite 
to Greek porticoes, and our potatoes,
and plain living which might be
shaken by infinitesimal tattoos.





The Gulf, 1987
 

The day upturned, flooded with sunlight, not
a single cloud. I squint into the glare,
cautious even then of bright emptiness.
We sit under shade, Ta Lucia
showing me how white folks dine, the high life.
I am about to try my first oyster,
Ta spending her winnings from the slots
on a whole dozen, the glistening valves
wet and private as a cheek's other side, 
broken open before us. Don't be shy.
Take it all in at once. Flesh and sea grit,
sweet meat and brine, a taste I must acquire. 
In every split shell, the coast's silhouette: 
bodies floating in what was once their home.





Wifes Disaster Manual
 

When the forsaken city starts to burn,
after the men and children have fled,
stand still, silent as prey, and slowly turn

back. Behold the curse. Stay and mourn 
the collapsing doorways, the unbroken bread 
in the forsaken city starting to burn.

Don't flinch. Don't join in. 
Resist the righteous scurry and instead
stand still, silent as prey. Slowly turn

your thoughts away from escape: the iron
gates unlatched, the responsibilities shed.
When the forsaken city starts to burn,

surrender to your calling, show concern 
for those who remain. Come to a dead
standstill. Silent as prey, slowly turn

into something essential. Learn
the names of the fallen. Refuse to run ahead
when the forsaken city starts to burn.
Stand still and silent. Pray. Return.

Read These
 

The King saith, and his arm swept the landscape's foliage into bloom
where he hath inscribed the secret mysteries of his love
before at last taking himself away. His head away. His
recording hand. So his worshipful subjects must imagine
themselves in his loving fulfillment, who were no more
than instruments of his creation. Pawns.
Apparati. Away, he took himself and left us
studying the smudged sky. Soft pencil lead.

Once he was not a king, only a pale boy staring down
from the high dive. The contest was seriousness
he decided, who shaped himself for genus genius
and nothing less. Among genii, whoever dies first wins.
Or so he thought. He wanted the web browsers to ping
his name in literary mention everywhere on the world wide web.

He wanted relief from his head, which acted as spider
and inner web weaver. The boy was a live thing tumbled in its thread 
and tapped and fed off, siphoned from. His head kecked back
and howling from inside the bone castle from whence he came
to hate the court he held.

He was crowned with loneliness 
and suffered for friendship, for fealty 
of the noblest sort. The invisible crown
rounded his temples tighter than any turban,
more binding than a wedding band, 
and he sat in his round tower
on the rounding earth. 
                                                     Read these, 
saith the King, and put down his pen, hearing 
himself inwardly holding forth on the dullest 
aspects of the human heart 
with the sharpest possible wit. Unreadable
as Pound on usury or Aquinas on sex.

I know the noose made an oval portrait frame for his face. 
And duct tape around the base of the Ziploc 
bag was an air-tight chamber
for the regal head--most serious relic, 
breathlessly lecturing in the hall of silence.





Suicides Note: An Annual
 

I hope you've been taken up by Jesus
though so many decades have passed, so far apart we'd grown
     between love transmogrifying into hate and those sad letters
           and phone calls and your face vanishing into a noose that
I couldn't 
     today name the gods
           you at the end worshipped, if any, praise being
impossible for the devoutly miserable. And screw my church who'd 
     roast in Hell poor suffering
           bastards like you, unable to bear the masks 
of their own faces. With words you sought to shape
     a world alternate to the one that dared
           inscribe itself so ruthlessly across your eyes, for you
could not, could never
     fully refute the actual or justify the sad heft of your body, earn
           your rightful space or pay for the parcels of oxygen you 
inherited. More than once you asked
     that I breathe into your lungs like the soprano in the opera
           I loved so my ghost might inhabit you and you ingest my belief 
in your otherwise-only-probable soul. I wonder does your 
     death feel like failure to everybody who ever
           loved you as if our collective cpr stopped
too soon, the defib paddles lost charge, the corpse
     punished us by never sitting up. And forgive my conviction 
           that every suicide's an asshole. There is a good reason I am not 
God, for I would cruelly smite the self-smitten. 
     I just wanted to say ha-ha, despite
           your best efforts you are every second
alive in a hard-gnawing way for all who breathed you deeply in, 
     each set of lungs, those rosy implanted wings, pink balloons.
          We sigh you out into air and watch you rise like rain.





Book X
 

          
          In the last book of The Republic Plato turns to poetry, implicitly contrasts it with philosophy, and argues that it shouldn't even exist in the ideal city he's meticulously constructed. His reasoning is liable to strike us now as quaint: poets traffic in appearances, not essences, and write of things they don't know anything about, like military strategy and battles; they portray heroic figures in the grip of powerful, deranged emotions, to which their readers must inevitably succumb; and there's a metaphysical complaint: all art, including poetry, is essentially mimetic, and representations are inherently inferior to what they represent. You need to make some changes if you want to know what's going on. Poetry for Plato wasn't what you'd probably think of if you're reading this, a marginalized enactment of experience and subjectivity in which the medium itself is half the point. Nor was philosophy the systematic study of the possibility of meaning we've become accustomed to, but sought instead to penetrate the veil of appearances, arriving at a vision of the good that shows us how we ought to try to live. It's been suggested that to understand him, think of movies and TV instead of poetry, for they're what occupy the space that poetry occupied in Athens. I agree, but then the question ultimately becomes: Should how we try to live be based on fantasies and feelings, or known facts and reason? And the suspicion that the latter aren't much fun shows just how troubling the question really is. Yet even in their late, attenuated forms philosophy and poetry pose a problem, Plato's problem. Write what you know: an admonition that concedes the point that poets usually don't. And what exactly does one know, in the intended sense? I guess what's meant is something like a lived identity within a social world, and yet behind those limited identities lies something larger, something commonplace and ordinary, but at the same time utterly unique. Like the hedgehog, each of us knows just one big thing, a thing philosophy can't capture and that poetry can at best remind us of or intimate, but can't describe. As it extends itself in time the individual life remains a captive of its point of view, confined to what it knows, cut off from all those others that resemble it in all respects but one. It's what I know and everything I know, it's something that I know so thoroughly I can't imagine or describe it, though it fills my eyes. But there's no need for imagery or words: you know it too, for it lies floating in your eyes. Would Plato even recognize a poetry of consciousness? And what of consciousness itself? It's sometimes said to have a history, a recent one, and to have been unknown to Homer's Greeks. But that's a fallacy, inferring how you feel from what you write; moreover, Bernard Williams showed that what they wrote shows that they felt like us. And yet the poems of the articulated consciousness lay in the blank, unwritten future, poised to spring from Hamlet's mind, not Oedipus's; and their challenge to Book X was still to be imagined, still to come. "There's the part where you say it, and the part where you take it back (J.L. Austin). I say these things because I want to, and sometimes even think they're true; but now I want to take them back. Knowledge is factive, meaning one can't know what isn't true, and truth is simply correspondence with the facts. What are the facts of consciousness? They're all analogies and metaphors, a feeling of existence but without reality's defining contours, like a sense of something hesitating on the brink of being said, or hiding in the shadows of an inner room. They're all appearances, but appearances of what? Something that wanders up your limbs and nerves and blossoms in your brain? They're all just figments of perspective, of a point of view from which the time is always now, the place is always here, and the thought of something hiding underneath the surface a seductive spell. The harder I try to pin them down the more elusive they become, as gradually the shadows disappear, the words turn into syllables, the face becomes anonymous and leaves me staring at a silver sheet of glass. What starts out as self-scrutiny becomes a study in self-pity, and instead of something tangible and true one winds up chasing the chimeras of Book X: the fruitless quarrel between philosophy and poetry, reason and unreason, and that tedious myth about the soul, of what becomes of it at death, then of its journey and rebirth. I'm tired, I'm far from home, I'm waiting in a chamber in a castle on a mountaintop in Umbria (poets get to do this), seven hundred miles from Athens as the crow flies, where perhaps "the sun still shines upon the hills and has not yet set. I write the way I do because I want it to exist, but then the spell breaks and it dries up like a dream, leaving me with just this smooth, unvariegated surface, which remains."His words made us ashamed, and we checked our tears. He walked around, and when he said his legs were heavy he lay on his back as he had been told to do, and the man who had given him the poison touched his body, and after a while tested his feet and legs, pressed hard upon his foot and asked him if he felt this, and Socrates said no. Then he pressed his calves, and made his way up his body and showed us that it was cold and stiff. He felt it himself and said that when the cold reached his heart he would be gone. As his belly was getting cold Socrates uncovered his head--he had covered it--and said--these were his last words--Crito, we owe a cock to Asclepius; make this offering to him and do not forget.'--It shall be done,' said Crito, tell us if there is anything else.' But there was no answer. Shortly afterwards Socrates made a movement; the man uncovered him and his eyes were fixed. Seeing this Crito closed his mouth and his eyes.
        




By the Same Author
 

Today, no matter if it rains,
It's time to follow the path into the forest.

The same people will be walking the same dogs,
Or if not the same dogs, dogs that behave in similar fashions,
Some barking, some standing aloof.
The owners carry plastic bags.

But this is the forest, they complain, we must do as we like.
We must let the dogs run free,
We must follow their example,
The way we did when we were young.

Back then we slept, watched TV--
We were the dogs.
By the time the screen door slammed, we were gone.

Nobody really talks like that in the forest.
They're proud of their dogs,
Proud especially of the ones who never bark.
They're upset about the Norway maple, it's everywhere,
Crowding out the hickories and oaks.

Did you know it takes a million seeds to make one tree?
Your chances of surviving in the forest,
Of replicating yourself, are slim. 

Today, the smaller dogs are wearing raincoats,
The bigger ones are stiffing it out.
They're tense, preoccupied,
Running in circles,
Getting tangled in the leash--

It's hard remaining human in the forest.
To move the limbs of the body,
To speak intelligible words,
These things promise change.





Opus Posthumous
 

When I painted, everybody saw.
When I played piano, everybody heard. 

I ate your raspberries.
The sign no trespassing applied to me.

Now, the hemlocks have grown higher than the house.
There's moss on my stoop, a little mildew 
In the shower but you've never seen my shower. 

I can undress by the window, 
I can sleep in the barn.

The sky, which is cloudy, 
Suits the earth to which it belongs.





Zelda
 

I want Rattawut Lapcharoensap to write my biography.
I want him to come to my apartment when my boyfriend's

not home. I want to make him coffee. I know that he
will want to tape record all of our sessions, and

after I die I want these tapes catalogued and archived
in the temperature controlled basement of an ivy league

university library. Additionally, I would like
my biography to have a neon purple dust jacket and

I would like Nancy Milford to grant us permission
to call the book Zelda even though there is already

a book called Zelda because it is about the life of Zelda
Fitzgerald. Maybe because it is just one word and

that word is a name we won't need permission; I'm
not a lawyer. Also: I would like Martin Scorsese to direct

the movie based on the book based on my real life.
I don't know if any of you have seen The Departed yet, but

I just saw it last night and my life is almost exactly like that
except instead of Boston I grew up in Chicago, and instead

of going to police academy I toured with Cirque du Soleil.
If Rattawut could just get a hold of a copy of the screenplay

and make Matt Damon a female trapeze artist
who was born to Prussian immigrant parents in 1984,

I'm sure he'd have a good three, four chapters right there, easy.
Have any of you ever tried to think of all the different ways

you could disappoint your parents and then done them?
I chose the calliope over the violin; I ran with gypsies;

I dated a boy three years younger than me just because
he had an apartment and I didn't want to live

with my parents anymore. I want Rattawut to tell me
he likes my blue sweater. Maybe I'll sit next to him

while I show him old photographs and wait to see
if he puts his hand on my leg. I don't know what will happen

to me after I turn 23, but when my biography comes out
I will have to avoid the reviews and the interviews

and any website that gives away the ending.
I will probably have to spend a few weeks in a cabin

in Minnesota. By then, I will have broken up 
with my boyfriend in order to marry Rattawut

beneath a chuppah in the western suburbs of Chicago
because even though I'm not technically Jewish,

my father is, and any tradition is better than none.
When Rattawut gives me my autographed copy,

I'll stay inside my childhood, making daisy chains,
enrolled in summer programs for the gifted and talented.

I'll concentrate on the photos of myself holding prize ribbons,
playing leapfrog, dressed up like Elizabeth Cady Stanton.

I won't read the chapters about my future addiction
to pain medication, my lepidopterophobia,

my failed marriages, my miscarriages, the fire
that will destroy all my manuscripts, my fall

down the stairs. I won't ever read the last chapter, 
the one that describes in vivid detail the flames

that will erupt from my fatal motorcycle accident
somewhere in the Badlands, how it will take weeks

for them to discover my body. I am only 22 years old. 
I want to fake my death on Facebook. I want a pony.





Marooned
 

Mother, I have been devastated all my life. I never said anything. 
That's why I wear a parachute. Why I tiptoed from my bedroom
to yours, and lay my head on the beige carpet for fear of worse.
Were there sirens? There were. Were there familiar songs? Yes.
I am afraid of the beds I have been in. In the morning there was
the heel of your boot sharper than before. Mother, what do I do
with your mail? Do you want to keep this snake in the basement?
What about the kitten? Do you want all these photographs of other
people's children? The temperature in the lizard's cage is dropping.
Let's be realistic. If I open the windows the birds will come in and
eat out the eyes. Mother, I am bereft. Mother, I wear your necklace
and nothing else. Mother, I never. Nevermind. Let's be fatalistic.
The neighbors know I'm down here. I can hear them watching.
Mother, after they take your eyes I will sew the lids myself.





A Brief History of My Life Part VII
 

I can't go to the east village anymore
because it is like going on a tour

of my worst dates. I get older, my heart
leaps at the sight of children

who don't belong to me, I pronounce
everything like an Italian opera title.

I used to listen to songs and have someone
in mind for the you parts, now I just want

to be where the light is intense, I want
the kind of heat that kills you

if you drive into it unprepared. This
isn't a metaphor for anything else.

When I speak of the light, I mean the light.
I go to church and sing along and feel

just as moved as if my faith were blind.
When I speak of the blind, I mean

the light. Truly the only things Lindsey Lohan and I
have in common are our preoccupations

with fame and weight loss, and yet I recognize
a kinship there, as if those two things mattered

more than anything. When I speak of
the darkness, I mean this living.

In a restaurant called Caracas,
I once spent fifteen minutes arguing

about an Ayn Rand book because
every time he said Anthem I thought

he meant We the Living and I said
what dystopia, what about the woman,

and he said what about the Home
of the Infants and I said what

Home of the Infants? What about
loving a man so much you'll sleep

with another man in order to finance
the first man's tuberculosis treatment?

Welcome to Russia, I said, and we
were looking at each other and then

not. I tried to picture Caracas, tried
to leave him for elsewhere, a fever.





Immortality
 

At the gym, they told me I would not die,
I would only get sexier, and I believed them.

I spent my nights wondering if this was going to turn
into something long-term, if this was what is meant by casual,

or if this was just my annual catastrophic disappointment
because if it wasn't, then I would have to brace

myself. I took my medication and looked at pictures
of people who were not in love with me. I deleted

their names from my cache, said hello to my cat
over the phone, took more medication. Days

passed. I learned it's hard to measure your own increasing
sexiness. I enlisted bystanders. I passed mirrors

and pretended they were not mirrors, but clean
windows, and I was not myself, I was

a clean stranger. Some days I was sure
she wanted to come home with me, and

I had to let her down easy, through the window,
like a priest. Once I'd been unleashed

from thoughts of my own death I was free
to be loved in the way I always knew I'd deserved:

reciprocally, in Fiji, our bodies lithe and bronzed
like gods, but at the same time I felt like a vampire,

and none of my friends could relate. They were jealous
of my book deal, my time spent at the ashram

while they were here, suffering another winter,
their unsexiness a flourescent sign that blinks all night.





Chinese Quatrains (The Woman in Tomb 44)
 

The aeroplane is shaped like a bird
 Or a giant mechanical penis
 My father escorts my mother
 From girlhood to unhappiness
  

 A dragonfly has iridescent wings
 Shorn, it's a lowly pismire
 Plucked of arms and legs
 A throbbing red pepperpod

 
 Baby, she's a girl
 Pinkly propped as a doll
 Baby, she's a pearl
 An ulcer in the oyster of God

 
 Cry little baby clam cry
 The steam has opened your eyes
 Your secret darkly hidden
 The razor is sharpening the knife
  

 Abandoned taro-leaf boat
 Its lonely black sail broken
 The corpses are fat and bejeweled
 The hull is thoroughly rotten

 
 The worm has entered the ear
 And out the nose of my father
 Cleaned the pelvis of my mother
 And ringed around her fingerbone
  

 One child beats a bedpan
 One beats a fishhook out of wire
 One beats his half sister on the head
 Oh, teach us to fish and love
  

 Don't say her boudoir is too narrow
 She could sleep but in one cold bed
 Don't say you own many horses
 We escaped on her skinny mare's back

 
 Man is good said Meng-Tzu
 We must cultivate their natures
 Man is evil said Hsun-Tzu
 There's a worm in the human heart

 
 He gleaned a beaded purse from Hong Kong
 He procured an oval fan from Taiwan
 She married him for a green card
 He abandoned her for a blonde
  

 My grandmother is calling her goslings
 My mother is summoning her hens
 The sun has vanished into the ocean
 The moon has drowned in the fen

 
 Discs of jade for her eyelids
 A lozenge of pearl for her throat
 Lapis and kudzu in her nostrils
 They will rob her again and again





"Altar (#3) from "Broken Chord Sequence
 

Why cry over dried flowers?
 They're meant to be straw.
 Why cry over miniature roses?
 They're meant to be small.
  
 Why cry over Buddha's hand citron?
 Why cry over the hidden flower?
 Why cry over Mother's burnt forehead?
 Her votive deathglow, her finest hour.





Rhapsody in Plain Yellow
 

for my love, Charles (1938-2000)
  
  
 Say: 
  
 I love you, I love you, I love you, no matter
     your race, your sex, your color. Say:
 the world is round and the arctic is cold.
     Say: I shall kiss the rondure of your soul's
 living marl. Say: he is beautiful,
     serenely beautiful, yet, only ephemerally so.
 Say: Her Majesty combs her long black hair for hours.
     Say: O rainbows, in his eyes, rainbows.
 Say: O frills and fronds, I know you
     Mr. Snail Consciousness,
 O foot plodding the underside of leaves.
     Say: I am nothing without you, nothing,
 Ms. Lookeast, Ms. Lookeast,
     without you, I am utterly empty.
 Say: the small throat of sorrow.
     Say: China and France, China and France.
 Say: Beauty and loss, the dross of centuries.
     Say: Nothing in their feudal antechamber
 shall relinquish us of our beauty--

The Way In
 

Sometimes the way to milk and honey is through the body.
 Sometimes the way in is a song.
 But there are three ways in the world: dangerous, wounding,
 and beauty.
 To enter stone, be water.
 To rise through hard earth, be plant
 desiring sunlight, believing in water.
 To enter fire, be dry.
 To enter life, be food.





Inside
 

How something is made flesh
 no one can say. The buffalo soup
 becomes a woman
 who sings every day to her horses
 or summons another to her private body
 saying come, touch, this is how
 it begins, the path of a newly born
 who, salvaged from other lives and worlds,
 will grow to become a woman, a man,
 with a heart that never rests,
 and the gathered berries,
 the wild grapes
 enter the body,
 human wine
 which can love,
 where nothing created is wasted;
 the swallowed grain
 takes you through the dreams
 of another night,
 the deer meat becomes hands 
 strong enough to work.
  
 But I love most
 the white-haired creature
 eating green leaves;
 the sun shines there
 swallowed, showing in her face
 taking in all the light,
  
 and in the end
 when the shadow from the ground
 enters the body and remains,
 in the end, you might say,
 This is myself
 still unknown, still a mystery.





Thus Spake the Mockingbird
 

The mockingbird says, hallelujah, coreopsis, I make the day
     bright, I wake the night-blooming jasmine. I am
 the duodecimo of desperate love, the hocus pocus passion
     flower of delirious retribution. You never saw such a bird,
 such a triage of blood and feathers, tongue and bone. O the world
     is a sad address, bitterness melting the tongues of babies,
 breasts full of accidental milk, but I can teach the flowers to grow,
     take their tight buds, unfurl them like flags in the morning heat,
 fat banners of scent, flat platters of riot on the emerald scene.
     I am the green god of pine trees, conducting the music 
 of rustling needles through a harp of wind. I am the heart of men,
     the wild bird that drives their sex, forges their engines,
 jimmies their shattered locks in the dark flare where midnight slinks.
     I am the careless minx in the skirts of women, the bright moon
 caressing their hair, the sharp words pouring from their beautiful mouths
     in board rooms, on bar stools, in big city laundrettes. I am
 Lester Young's sidewinding sax, sending that Pony Express
     message out west in the Marconi tube hidden in every torso
 tied tight in the corset of do and don't, high and low, yes and no. I am
     the radio, first god of the twentieth century, broadcasting
 the news, the blues, the death counts, the mothers wailing
     when everyone's gone home. I am sweeping
 through the Eustachian tubes of the great plains, transmitting
     through every ear of corn, shimmying down the spine
 of every Bible-thumping banker and bureaucrat, relaying the anointed
     word of the shimmering world. Every dirty foot that walks
 the broken streets moves on my wings. I speak from the golden
     screens. Hear the roar of my discord murdering the trees,
 screaming its furious rag, the fuselage of my revival-tent brag. Open
     your windows, slip on your castanets. I am the flamenco
 in the heel of desire. I am the dancer. I am the choir. Hear my wild
     throat crowd the exploding sky. O I can make a noise.





The Tawdry Masks of Women
 

Every bus ride is theater, giddy schoolgirls trying on
 the tawdry masks of women, flirting with my nephew,
  
 red and green lights, shop windows piled high, gold
 glistered skeletal mannequins in slips of iridescent silk.
  
 At night in the wind blowing over the Pont Marie I hear
 Camille Claudel crying from the walls of her studio,
  
 and two days before Christmas Elliot and I stand
 miraculously alone before La Gioconde, follow her eyes,
  
 cracked surface of her skin like softest sand before the deep
 water of her mouth, and later standing in the cold
  
 our Buddhist gardienne Nadine tells me in rapid-fire French
 that in all things she tries to remain neutral, neutre, neutre,
  
 neutre, the only word finally I understand in the barrage
 tumbling out of her mouth like a waterfall, but I can't be
  
 neutral, passion welling up in my heart for the exhausted maids,
 dapper men in berets, the madwoman on the PC bus,
  
 screaming, Salope, salope, as she descends at the Pont d'Ivry
 and everyone on the bus looking at each other, Whore?
  
 Who's the whore here? or the chic older woman, leather pants
 baggy on her skinny shanks, reading a battered paperback
  
 Rimbaud as we take the bus to see Pasolini's Canterbury Tales,
 the master himself as Chaucer, spinning his ribald stories
  
 of human folly, each one a mirror, and when I see myself
 in bus windows or store glass, the shock never wears off,
  
 for I recognize myself and see a stranger at the same time,
 because the minutes are racing by at the speed of light,
  
 and I am saying goodbye to Paris, to everyone, myself
 most of all, watching her disappear down the rue Jeanne d'Arc,
  
 and what can she possibly be thinking as she walks
 to the movies in the middle of this afternoon of her life?

 1)    knowing nothing into understand.   and
         this almost said solemnly was the one
         that least occurred to me.
  
          ii) i sent my heart in the upper pocked

2)    for a long spell
         a spell of weeping begins to come.





Command Filter with Negative Entailment
 

          
          A bridge is a passage between two banks. On Saturdays both banks are closed. A well is located in a wall of sound. But space is not the stake and suddenly both travellers fall in. Now draw a line between some water and their eyes. Express it as the border of a reservoir. The term ears stands ready to attack. Attach it then repeat the phrase my body lives inside a closed shed. The nose with this noise invents a scale. The cottage is attempts and tries to break at random or at noon a forest hidden by a single tree. Narrative dilates sporadic or clairvoyant in a place where bed becomes the meaning of the rest. Now say embrace me. Motors trivialize. Eighty-six windows show the noun to be a house. The heart is now a hole in space that falls across and leaves a certain number. Forget the thirds in this and the silhouettes change place. You can no longer have a choice. You start at zero by the church called word in the forest by a beach beyond the sea between a fingernail at the moment logic begins. Basic liquids add a soup. Now change it. Write down I can no longer state a model is at work. Then make filters for each body. Draw all the composition off. Forbid readers to leave. This sea as a mixture and the sand relating questions to the horizontal movements of a prebiotic plan. You are now discovering that concrete form involves both circulation and the clinamen. Start to weave and you'll connect this space. Now try to say the eye is paradoxical so that all future lines repeat a plate. Nothing is narrative. Now alter it. The equator drops and float upstream. A pluralist sidewalk remains. Go back to the start. The Saturdays stay close to a catastrophic separation. The bridge is now a son who kills the father at a crossroad. In the well of the week drops the son's name. Add wings to it. Now set out all the other links to constitute a set of probable ideas. The crevice of the lip connects a writing that's as still as ink. This final switch is exactly what's happening. The constant factor in a cloud.
        




Writing a Sand Thinking
 

After the gossip one returns to grammar.
 Almost to say that speech
                                         compares us
 renting that   as a fact the case stands firm
              for what we own.
                                                     Pragma
 by relations instance this as
               the index of my slab.  Your
 slap at it.
                             The clouds pastiche aubade
 Sid's bakery delivers                                symmetry
 inside an adult formula for
 Saturdays. Our poppies
 in history.

But it is not our wish to reproduce
              ourselves through you

 nor to reassure you that these words are true
 or where the line breaks           there is a meaning
 stabilized           by that news
 speech is                        assuring you

 Over this our patience supports you
                 beneath the topical tuck
 which is basic
                             to a sand ruse for writing through
 these intervals between
                             our disagreeable achievements

 more or less.





Artless
 

is my heart. A stranger
 berry there never was,
 tartless.
  
 Gone sour in the sun,
 in the sunroom or moonroof,
 roofless.
  
 No poetry. Plain. No
 fresh, special recipe
 to bless.
  
 All I've ever made
 with these hands
 and life, less
  
 substance, more rind.
 Mostly rim and trim,
 meatless
  
 but making much smoke
 in the old smokehouse,
 no less.
  
 Fatted from the day,
 overripe and even
 toxic at eve. Nonetheless,
  
 in the end, if you must
 know, if I must bend,
 waistless,
  
 to that excruciation.
 No marvel, no harvest
 left me speechless,
  
 yet I find myself
 somehow with heart,
 aloneless.
  
 With heart, 
 fighting fire with fire,
 fightless.
  
 That loud hub of us,
 meat stub of us, beating us
 senseless.
  
 Spectacular in its way,
 its way of not seeing,
 congealing dayless
  
 but in everydayness.
 In that hopeful haunting
 (a lesser
  
 way of saying
 in darkness) there is
 silencelessness
  
 for the pressing question.
 Heart, what art you?
 War, star, part? Or less:
  
 playing a part, staying apart
 from the one who loves, 
 loveless.





Liquid Flesh
 

In a light chocolatine room
 with blackout windows,
 a loud clock drowns in soft dawn's
  
 syllables, crisscrossed
 with a broken cloudiness
 I'd choose as my own bedcovers
  
 but cannot. My choice of sleep
 or sky has no music of its own.
 There's no "its own while the baby cries.
  
 Oh, the baby cries. He howls and claws
 like a wrongly minor red wolf
 who doesn't know his mother.
  
 I know I am his mother, but I can't
 quite click on the word's essential aspects,
 can't denude the flora
  
 or disrobe the kind of housecoat
 "mother always is. Something
 cunty, something used.
  
 Whatever meaning the word itself
 is covering, like underwear,
 that meaning is so mere and meager
  
 this morning. Mother. Baby.
 Chicken and egg. It's so obnoxious
 of me: I was an egg
  
 who had  an egg
 and now I'm a chicken,
 as usual scooping up
  
 both possibilities,
 or what I used to call
 possibilities. I used
  
 to be this way, so ontologically
 greedy, wanting to be it all.
 Serves me right.
  
 My belief in the fluidity
 of the self turns out to mean
 my me is a flow of wellwater,

                                                    
 without the well, or the bucket,
 a hole dug and seeping.
 A kind of unwell, where
  
 the ground reabsorbs
 what it was displaced to give.
 The drain gives meaning to the sieve.
  
 As I said: a chicken who still
 wants to be all potential.
 Someone who springs
  
 and falls, who cannot see
 how many of us I have 
 in me--and I do not like them all.
  
 Do I like us? Can I love us?
 If anyone comes
 first it's him, but how can that be?
  
 I was here way, way first.
 I have the breasts, godawful, and he
 the lungs and we share the despair.
  
 For we are a we, aren't we? We split
 a self in such a way that there isn't
 enough for either of us.
  
 The father of the baby is sleepy
 and present in his way, in the way
 of fathers. He is devoted like
  
 few fathers, and maybe hurts
 like I hurt, like no fathers.
 I don't know what someone else
  
 feels, not even these someones
 who are also me. Do they hurt
 like I do?  Why can't they
  
 tell me, or morse or sign: let
 me know they know where and how
 and why it hurts? Or something?
  
 What is the point of other people,
 being so separate, if we can't 
 help a person get that pain
  
 will stick its shiv into anything,
 just to get rid of the weapon
 and because it can? For if we share
  
 ourselves then they, too, must
 also be in so much pain.
 I can hear it. Oh, my loves.
  
 The wood of the crib, the white
 glow of the milk (which must
 have siphoned off the one
  
 and only pure part of me, leaving
 me with what, toxicity
 or sin or mush?), the awful softness.
  
 I've been melted into something
 too easy to spill. I make more
 and more of myself in order
  
 to make more and more of the baby.
 He takes it, this making. And somehow
 he's made more of me, too.
  
 I'm a mother now.
 I run to the bathroom, run
 to the kitchen, run to the crib
  
 and I'm not even running.
 These places just scare up as needed,
 the wires that move my hands
  
 to the sink, to the baby,
 to the breast are electrical.
 I'm in shock.
  
 One must be in shock to say so,
 as if one's own state is assessable,
 like a car accident or Minnesota taxes.
  
 A total disaster, this sack of liquid
 flesh which yowls and leaks
 and I'm talking about me
  
 not the baby. Me, this puddle
 of a middle, this utilized vessel,
 cracked hull, divine
  
 design. It's how it works. It's how
 we all got here. Deform
 following the function . . .
  
 But what about me? I whisper
 secretly and to think,
 around these parts used to be
  
 the joyful place of sex,
 what is now this intimate
 terror and squalor.
  
 My eyes burned out at three a.m. and again
 at six and eleven. This is why the clock
 is drowning, as I said earlier.
  
 I'm trying to explain it.
 I repeat myself, or haven't I already?
 Tiny self, along with a tiny self.
  
 I'll say it: he hurt me, this new
 babe, then and now.
 Perhaps he always will,
  
 though thoughts of the future
 seem like science fiction novels
 I never finished reading.
  
 Their ends like red nerves
 chopped off by cleaver, not aliens,
 this very moment, saving nothing for later.
  
 He howls with such fury and clarity
 I must believe him.
 No god has the power
  
 to make me believe anything,
 yet I happen to know
 this baby knows a way out.
  
 This dark hole closing in on me
 all around: he'll show me
 how to get through
  
 the shock and the godlessness
 and the rictus of crushed flesh,
 into the rest of my life.





Magi
 

If only you'd been a better mother.
  
 How could I have been a better mother?
 I would have needed a better self,
 and that is a gift I never received.
  
 So you're saying it's someone else's fault?
  
 The gift of having had a better mother myself,
 my own mother having had a better mother herself.
 The gift that keeps on not being given.
  
 Who was supposed to give it?
  
 How am I supposed to know?
  
 Well, how am I supposed to live?
  
 I suppose you must live as if you had been
 given better to live with. Comb your hair, for instance.
  
 I cut off my hair, to sell for the money
 to buy you what you wanted.
  
 I wanted nothing but your happiness.
  
 I can't give you that!
 What would Jesus do?
 He had a weird mother too . . .
  
 Use the myrrh, the frankincense, as if
 it were given unconditionally, your birthright.
  
 It's a riddle.
  
 All gifts are a riddle, all lives are
 in the middle of mother-lives.
  
 But it's always winter in this world.
 There is no end to ending.
  
 The season of giving, the season
 when the bears are never cold,
 because they are sleeping.
  
 The bears are never cold, Mama,
 but I am one cold, cold bear.

Chicago Poem
 

I lived here nearly 5 years before I could
      meet the middle western day with anything approaching
 Dignity. It's a place that lets you
      understand why the Bible is the way it is:
 Proud people cannot live here.
  
 The land's too flat. Ugly sullen and big it
      pounds men down past humbleness. They
 Stoop at 35 possibly cringing from the heavy and
      terrible sky. In country like this there
 Can be no God but Jahweh.
  
 In the mills and refineries of its south side Chicago
      passes its natural gas in flames
 Bouncing like bunsens from stacks a hundred feet high.
      The stench stabs at your eyeballs.
 The whole sky green and yellow backdrop for the skeleton
      steel of a bombed-out town.
  
 Remember the movies in grammar school? The goggled men
      doing strong things in
 Showers of steel-spark? The dark screen cracking light
      and the furnace door opening with a 
 Blast of orange like a sunset? Or an orange?
  
 It was photographed by a fairy, thrilled as a girl, or
      a Nazi who wished there were people
 Behind that door (hence the remote beauty), but Sievers,
      whose old man spent most of his life in there,
 Remembers a "nigger in a red T-shirt pissing into the
      black sand.
  
 It was 5 years until I could afford to recognize the ferocity.
      Friends helped me. Then I put some
 Love into my house. Finally I found some quiet lakes
      and a farm where they let me shoot pheasant.
  
 Standing in the boat one night I watched the lake go
      absolutely flat. Smaller than raindrops, and only
 Here and there, the feeding rings of fish were visible a hundred
      yards away -- and the Blue Gill caught that afternoon
 Lifted from its northern lake like a tropical! Jewel at its ear
      Belly gold so bright you'd swear he had a
 Light in there. His color faded with his life. A small
      green fish . . .
  
 All things considered, it's a gentle and undemanding
      planet, even here. Far gentler
 Here than any of a dozen other places. The trouble is
      always and only with what we build on top of it.
  
 There's nobody else to blame. You can't fix it and you
      can't make it go away. It does no good appealing
 To some ill-invented Thunderer
      Brooding above some unimaginable crag . . .
  
 It's ours. Right down to the last small hinge it
      all depends for its existence
 Only and utterly upon our sufferance.
  
 Driving back I saw Chicago rising in its gases and I
      knew again that never will the
 Man be made to stand against this pitiless, unparalleled
      monstrocity. It
 Snuffles on the beach of its Great Lake like a
      blind, red, rhinoceros.
 It's already running us down.
  
 You can't fix it. You can't make it go away.
      I don't know what you're going to do about it,
 But I know what I'm going to do about it. I'm just
      going to walk away from it. Maybe
 A small part of it will die if I'm not around
  
       feeding it anymore.





Circle Poems
 

Whenever I have a day off, I write a new poem.
 Does this mean you shouldn't work, or that you
 write best on your day off?
  
 For example, this is the poem I wrote today.
  
  
                                     *
  
  
 When he was 20, he understood some of the secrets of
 life, and undertook to write them down so simply that
 even an idiot could understand.
 "For, he reasoned, "if I can't do that, I don't
 understand it myself.
  
 He proved himself right.
 When he was 50, he didn't understand it himself.
  
  
                                       *
  
  
 "Why is it, he said, "that no matter what you say,
 a woman always takes it personally?
  
 "I never do, she said.
  
  
                                       *
  
  
 John said, "Then I met that short fat guy with the
 neat little beard, with a name like dawn.
  
 "You mean George Abend?
  
 "Yeah.
  
 "Abend means evening.

  
                                     *





Wobbly Rock
 


                                    for Gary Snyder
                   
                 "I think I'll be the Buddha of this place
  
                                     and sat himself
                                             down
  
          
         1.
 It's a real rock
  
         (believe this first)
  
 Resting on actual sand at the surf's edge:
 Muir Beach, California
  
         (like everything else I have
         somebody showed it to me and I found it by myself)
  
 Hard common stone
 Size of the largest haystack
 It moves when hit by waves
 Actually shudders
  
         (even a good gust of wind will do it
         if you sit real still and keep your mouth shut)
  
 Notched to certain center it
 Yields and then comes back to it:
  
 Wobbly tons
  
  
         2.
 Sitting here you look below to other rocks
 Precisely placed as rocks of Ryoanji:
 Foam like swept stones
  
         (the mind getting it all confused again:
         "snow like frosting on a cake
         "rose so beautiful it don't look real)
  
 Isn't there a clear example here
 Stone garden shown to me by
 Berkeley painter I never met
 A thousand books and somebody else's boatride ROCKS
  
        (garden)
    
 EYE
  
         (nearly empty despite this clutter-image all
         the opposites cancelling out a
         CIRCULAR process: Frosting-snow)
  
 Or think of the monks who made it 4 hundred 50 years ago
 Lugged the boulders from the sea
 Swept to foam original gravelstone from sea
  
         (first saw it, even then, when finally they
         all looked up the
         instant AFTER it was made)
  
 And now all rocks are different and
 All the spaces in between
  
         (which includes about everything)
  
 The instant
 After it is made
  
  
         3.
 I have been in many shapes before I attained congenial form
 All those years on the beach, lifetimes . . .
  
 When I was a boy I used to watch the Pelican:
 It always seemed his wings broke
 And he dropped, like scissors, in the sea . . .
 Night fire flicking the shale cliff
 Balls tight as a cat after the cold swim
 Her young snatch sandy . . .
  
                       I have travelled
                        I have made a circuit
                        I have lived in 14 cities
                        I have been a word in a book
                        I have been a book originally
  
 Dychymig Dychymig: (riddle me a riddle)
  
         Waves and the sea. If you
         take away the sea
  
 Tell me what it is
   
  
         4.
 Yesterday the weather was nice there were lots of people
 Today it rains, the only other figure is far up the beach
  
         (by the curve of his body I know he leans against
         the tug of his fishingline: there is no separation)
  
 Yesterday they gathered and broke gathered and broke like
 Feeding swallows dipped down to pick up something ran back to
 Show it
 And a young girl with jeans rolled to mid-thigh ran
 Splashing in the rain creek
  
         "They're all so damned happy--
         why can't they admit it?
  
 Easy enough until a little rain shuts beaches down . . .
  
  
 Did it mean nothing to you Animal that turns this
 Planet to a smoky rock?
 Back among your quarrels
 How can I remind you of your gentleness?
  
         Jeans are washed
         Shells all lost or broken
         Driftwood sits in shadow boxes on a tracthouse wall
  
 Like swallows you were, gathering
 Like people I wish for . . .
  
  
         cannot even tell this to that fisherman
   
    
         5.
 3 of us in a boat the size of a bathtub   .   pitching in
 slow waves   .   fish poles over the side   .   oars
  
 We rounded a point of rock and entered a small cove
  
 Below us:
                 fronds of kelp
                 fish
                 crustaceans
                 eels
 Then us
                 then rocks at the cliff's base
                 starfish
                 (hundreds of them sunning themselves)
                 final starfish on the highest rock then
 Cliff
                 4 feet up the cliff a flower
                 grass
                 further up more grass
                 grass over the cliff's edge
                 branch of pine then
 Far up the sky
  
                 a hawk
  
 Clutching to our chip we are jittering in a spectrum
 Hung in the film of this narrow band
 Green
                 to our eyes only
   
   
         6.
 On a trail not far from here
 Walking in meditation
 We entered a dark grove
 And I lost all separation in step with the
 Eucalyptus as the trail walked back beneath me
  
 Does it need to be that dark or is
 Darkness only its occasion
 Finding it by ourselves knowing
 Of course
 Somebody else was there before . . .
  
 I like playing that game
 Standing on a high rock looking way out over it all:
  
                                "I think I'll call it the Pacific
  
  
 Wind water
 Wave rock
 Sea sand
  
 
                   (there is no separation)
  
 Wind that wets my lips is salt
 Sea breaking within me balanced as the
 Sea that floods these rocks. Rock
 Returning to the sea, easily, as
 Sea once rose from it. It
 Is a sea rock
  
                   (easily)
  
   
 I am
 Rocked by the sea





[I Saw Myself]
 

I saw myself
 a ring of bone
 in the clear stream
 of all of it
  
 and vowed,
 always to be open to it
 that all of it
 might flow through
  
 and then heard
 "ring of bone where
 ring is what a
  
 bell does





Springtime in the Rockies, Lichen
 

All these years I overlooked them in the
 racket of the rest, this
 symbiotic splash of plant and fungus feeding
 on rock, on sun, a little moisture, air --
 tiny acid-factories dissolving
 salt from living rocks and
 eating them.
  
 Here they are, blooming!
 Trail rock, talus and scree, all dusted with it:
 rust, ivory, brilliant yellow-green, and 
 cliffs like murals!
 Huge panels streaked and patched, quietly
 with shooting-stars and lupine at the base.
  
 Closer, with the glass, a city of cups!
 Clumps of mushrooms and where do the
 plants begin? Why are they doing this?
 In this big sky and all around me peaks &
 the melting glaciers, why am I made to
 kneel and peer at Tiny?
  
 These are the stamps of the final envelope.
  
 How can the poisons reach them?
 In such thin air, how can they care for the
 loss of a million breaths?
 What, possibly, could make their ground more bare?
  
 Let it all die.
  
 The hushed globe will wait and wait for
 what is now so small and slow to
 open it again.
  
 As now, indeed, it opens it again, this
 scentless velvet,
 crumbler-of-the-rocks,
  
 this Lichen!





A Rose for George
 

If you don't have any control over your life and being happy
 If you don't have any control over your life and be happy
  
 A family in the wall
 Mouse avenue in kitchen
 A piece of cake
 Looms oozing
 Men and women are signs of life
 Children are signs of life
  
 When they put the cap on the oil well
 I thought my life pollutes
 Reading lamp = coal burn
 My failures to love
 To be friend family
  
 When are we given the right to control
 Fantasy?
  
 Sixty-eight is a little bit of
 Time in the world
 To be more sentient
 Kinder and "get up try again
 Body ow
  
 I pretend if I were in New York
 I could choose friends as I did in school
 Fork into flesh of animal
  
 Work all your life
 Not hard enough! there are things undone
  
 I was thinking you were my father
 I wasn't here, then I was
 Through you
  
 Through an internal externalized
 Spill
  
 It bumps around the world
 Tries not to be stupid
  
 When Dad you grew up
 Trying to intentionalize
 Family back of you
 George, young and into the continents
 With problems
  
 I already have what I desire
 I just have it in the future
 The structure of being is wanting
 And like a fountain I suck up
 Later
 My excesses
 A little evaporates
 One day it's dry and drying
 Means I'm done
 Oh whatever you'll always be there no?
  
 I can say when I die
 "I was agent of clock
  
 They call it an alarm
 I stopped having time to weed, friends
  
 Started in dark
 Light housed me
  
 The TV is so loud I can't think
 I'm sorry I can't be in that room
  
 Nobody has yelled at me for a long time
 Thank you
  
 You exist because your dad and mom
 And you tried to go away
  
 Continuity sweepstakes
 Freed under the cap
  
 Get up orderly   loving





Spell
 

Ampersand to start the poem, keep you going, there's a
 Next Anne Cunningham
 Now intubated in white bed mountain range --
 Event brought you here and event will blow you onward.
  
      this is the refrain from Anne harm
      refrain from all harm
      events blowing forward
      gentle your train
      refrain from all damn harm
  
 Camp out in the mountains
 Under fluorescent hiss and beep.
 Nina (pet) put to sleep, ancient incontinent;
 Now you mourn blood
 Into your gastric tract.
 Noble body, gather your
 Guts, seal the passage:
 Have to die sometime but curving intricate
 Amerspand-tract says you'll
 Meet us for breakfast.
  
     this is the refrain from Anne harm
      refrain from all harm
      events blowing forward
      gentle your train
      refrain from all damn harm





Down in the Valley
 

It was her first time coming home from college.
She headed downtown for a drink or two.
Her girlfriend went home early. That was Christmas. 
Now, under sapling pine trees in the clearing,
snowdrops are coming back to their old places.
They had been gone a lifetime. Now they stand,
poised like a choir on the verge of singing: 
Nature is just. There's nothing left to fear.
The worst thing that can happen happened here.





The Professor
 

I get there early and I find a chair.
I squeeze my plastic cup of wine. I nod.
I maladroitly eat a pretzel rod
and second an opinion I don't share.
I think: whatever else I am, I'm there.
Afterwards, I escape across the quad
into fresh air, alone again, thank god.
Nobody cares. They're quite right not to care.

I can't go home. Even my family 
is thoroughly contemptuous of me.
I look bad. I'm exactly how I look.
These days I never read, but no one does,
and, anyhow, I proved how smart I was.
Everything I know is from a book.





The Cement Plant
 

The cement plant was like a huge still
nailed in gray corrugated panels
and left out forty-five years ago
in the null center of a meadow
to tax itself to remorseless death 
near a black stream and briars, where
from the moment it began to breathe,
it began falling apart and burning.
But it still went, and the men were paid.

The plant made dust. Impalpably fine,
hung in a tawny alkaline cloud,
swept into drifts against mill room piers,
frozen by rain on silo ledges,
dust was its first and its final cause.
Pinups were traced on their car windshields.
Dust gave them jobs, and killed some of them.
Late into evening their teeth grated.
Its product was dust, its problem dust.

The thing was blind to all its own ends
but the one. Men's ordinary lives,
measured out on a scale alien 
to that on which its life was measured,
were spent in crawling the junk machine,
fitting new gaskets, screws, and bearings,
deceiving it towards the mood required
for it to avail and pay. Somehow 
it did. None cheered it. It sustained them.





Youve Come Back to Me
 

For G
A small thing crawling toward me
across this dark lawn. Bright
eyes the only thing I'm sure I see.

You've come back to me,
haven't you, my sweet? From
long ago, and very far. Through 

crawling dark, my sweet, you've
come back to me, have you? Even 
smaller this time than the stars.





Accounting
 

Its fine 
incisors
grinding

my mother
fed my 
father's
fledgling
carpentry
concern
into her
adding
machine

as if its 
hunger
could be
satisfied

costs and 
savings
spooling
to our 
wooden
kitchen
floor and 
pooling

amounting
to nothing

a shop tool's
shavings.





Ativan
 

That dream of a cricket 
in the dark of the night
at the foot 
of the gallows tree. 

Virtuous 
cricket. Little, hopeful
heart-
shaped face 
lit up by the moon. 

Little, hopeful, insistent
song 
about the future
sung 
to a hanged man's boots.





Game
 

I thought we were playing a game
in a forest that day.
I ran as my mother chased me.

But she'd been stung by a bee.
Or bitten by a snake. 
She shouted my name, which

even as a child I knew was not
"Stop. Please. I'm dying. 

I ran deeper 
into the bright black trees
happily
as she chased me: How 

lovely the little bits and pieces. 
The fingernails, the teeth. Even
the bombed cathedrals
being built inside of me. 

How sweet 
the eye socket. The spine. The
curious, distant possibility that God
had given courage 
to human beings
that we might 
suffer a little longer.

And by the time 

I was willing to admit that
all along
all along
I'd known it was no game

I was a grown woman, turning 
back, too late.





Elegy for a Suicide
 

She always liked to blow the candles out. Fact:
there's only so much you can do with friction
and an intentional hand before the hand burns.
The sound that scissors make in a child's hand 
while crunching construction paper aches when 
she grows older. Even popcorn ceilings lose that style, 
that feeling of a cereal freshly drowned in milk.
Ah, the white beneath things. And the black below that.
We come down from bunk beds. We come down from
the funky reds and yellows of the spring's summer tanager
gone in fall. We fail to see the most vivid birds
high in the trees on the other side of leaves.

Where did those sad seeds come from or how take root? 
Her departure spun out of some samara down into a maple
shadow that shadows well into night's sweet syrup.
O host, we don't know the words for this country,
and this country pretends we have no knife,
no guns in the bedroom, no large car for escaping
or crashing over hard hillsides or into houses. 
We stuff our faces, blank as pills, with pills.
No one wants to open that book, but it's a book.





Good Year
 

January. I pluck it,
this feather flapping in the high mesquite
only head-high, caught by the down,
iridescent, turkey. Another
feather hugging the ditch
along the fence line and another...
A coyote somewhere naps 
happy, grinning like the feather
evolved from a leaf. What luck. 

Clouds lift above the field
as if to swallow my eye
into hunger. Good hunger.
The greatest eye must
behold me like an ember
dropped into a finch nest,
and I smoke at the mouth
like a gun dreaming in a safe
of a war it can win by virtue
of its praise. I have lost
the killer phrase I concocted
on my country walk
with the feather in my pocket.
I cock it.





Releasing the Sherpas
 

The last two sherpas were the strongest,
faithful companions, their faces wind-peeled,
streaked with soot and glacier-light on the snowfield
below the summit where we stopped to rest.

The first was my body, snug in its cap of lynx-
fur, smelling of yak butter and fine mineral dirt,
agile, impetuous, broad-shouldered,
alive to the frozen bite of oxygen in the larynx.

The second was my intellect, dour and thirsty, 
furrowing its fox-like brow, my calculating brain
searching for some cairn or chasm to explain
my decision to send them back without me.

Looking down from the next, ax-cleft serac 
I saw them turn and dwindle and felt unafraid. 
Blind as a diamond, sun-pure and rarefied,
whatever I was then, there was no turning back.





Light chaff and falling leaves or a pair of feathers
 

on the ground can spook a horse who won't flinch when faced 
with a backhoe or a pack of Harleys. I call it "horse

ophthalmology, because it is a different kind of system--
not celestial, necessarily, but vision in which the small,

the wispy, the lightly lifted or stirring threads of existence
excite more fear than louder and larger bodies do. It's Matthew

who said that the light of the body is the eye, and that if
the eye is healthy the whole body will be full of light. Maybe

in this case "light can also mean "lightness. With my eyes of
corrupted and corruptible flesh I'm afraid I see mostly darkness

by which I mean heaviness. How great is that darkness? Not 
as great as the inner weightlessness of horses whose eyes perceive, 

correctly I believe, the threat of annihilation in every windblown 
dust mote of malignant life. All these years I've been watching 

out warily in obvious places (in bars, in wars, in night cities and
nightmares, on furious seas). Yet what's been trying to destroy 

me has lain hidden inside friendly-seeming breezes, behind 
soft music, beneath the carpet of small things one can barely see. 

The eye is also a lamp, says Matthew, a giver of light, bestower 
of incandescent honey, which I will pour more cautiously 

over the courses I travel from now on. What's that whisper? 
Just the delicate sweeping away of somebody's life.





Pentatina for Five Vowels
 

Today is a trumpet to set the hounds baying.
The past is a fox the hunters are flaying.
Nothing unspoken goes without saying.
Love's a casino where lovers risk playing.
The future's a marker our hearts are prepaying.

The future's a promise there's no guaranteeing.
Today is a fire the field mice are fleeing.
Love is a marriage of feeling and being.
The past is a mirror for wishful sightseeing.
Nothing goes missing without absenteeing.

Nothing gets cloven except by dividing.
The future is chosen by atoms colliding.
The past's an elision forever eliding.
Today is a fog bank in which I am hiding.
Love is a burn forever debriding.

Love's an ascent forever plateauing.
Nothing is granted except by bestowing.
Today is an anthem the cuckoos are crowing.
The future's a convolute river onflowing.
The past is a lawn the neighbor is mowing.

The past is an answer not worth pursuing,
Nothing gets done except by the doing.
The future's a climax forever ensuing.
Love is only won by wooing.
Today is a truce between reaping and rueing.





Nox Borealis
 

If Socrates drank his portion of hemlock willingly,
if the Appalachians have endured unending ages of erosion,
if the wind can learn to read our minds 
and moonlight moonlight as a master pickpocket,
surely we can contend with contentment as our commission.

Deer in a stubble field, small birds dreaming
unimaginable dreams in hollow trees,
even the icicles, darling, even the icicles shame us
with their stoicism, their radiant resolve. 

Listen to me now: think of something you love 
but not too dearly, so the night will steal from us
only what we can afford to lose.





The Span
 

From the old bridge we'd been stopped on, 
a little below us, it looked like a diving board.
When the girl switched her sign from Stop to Slow
I saw across the river three men standing like old-
fashioned divers at its base, newsreels we'd seen
of men in swim caps. "Hard hats, you literal you.

You agreed with "like a diving board, but no spring 
to it. Something below was holding it up, something
concrete. It was the business of your life. Concrete--
but for me the men were waiting their turn over there,
each to compete for the best two-and-a-half gainer
to knife the Tye River. They'd die, you said.

"That's a fine span, I learned, "a very long one--
they didn't make 'em like that back then. Or us
either, I thought as I almost saw the Hard Hat bounce
at the tip, his one knee up to his waist.
"Inspectors, you said as we drove across, "lolly-
gagging. Whichever. Our span is ready.





September 2011
 

It keeps on happening again and it will
be forgotten again until it's September.
We're in the tall building paying the bill

overdue to the city for gas to fuel 
our furnace. We're thinking November--
it keeps on happening again--and we'll

need heat. Now it's still summer, too hot until
fall to turn off the AC. Consider
that other cloudless day, paying the bill

in City Hall. It's way too high now, still
we pay it. Look at the line, at him, her--
it keeps on happening again and it will.

Energy's costly. We forget it can kill.
Though some of our children can't remember,
we in the building paying the bill

look at the date, at the window sill,
think of their choice between jump and tinder.
It keeps on happening again and it will.
We're in the tall building, paying the bill.





Moon
 

Last night, when the moon 
slipped into my attic room
as an oblong of light, 
I sensed she'd come to commiserate.

It was August. She traveled
with a small valise 
of darkness, and the first few stars 
returning to the northern sky,

and my room, it seemed, 
had missed her. She pretended 
an interest in the bookcase
while other objects 

stirred, as in a rock pool, 
with unexpected life: 
strings of beads in their green bowl gleamed,
the paper-crowded desk; 

the books, too, appeared inclined 
to open and confess. 
Being sure the moon 
harbored some intention,

I waited; watched for an age 
her cool gaze shift
first toward a flower sketch 
pinned on the far wall

then glide down to recline 
along the pinewood floor, 
before I'd had enough. Moon, 
I said, We're both scarred now. 

Are they quite beyond you,
the simple words of love? Say them. 
You are not my mother; 
with my mother, I waited unto death.





The Stags
 

This is the multitude, the beasts 
you wanted to show me, drawing me 
upstream, all morning up through wind-
scoured heather to the hillcrest. 
Below us, in the next glen, is the grave 
calm brotherhood, descended 
out of winter, out of hunger, kneeling 
like the signatories of a covenant; 
their weighty, antique-polished antlers 
rising above the vegetation 
like masts in a harbor, or city spires. 
We lie close together, and though the wind
whips away our man-and-woman smell, every
stag-face seems to look toward us, toward, 
but not to us: we're held, and hold them, 
in civil regard. I suspect you'd 
hoped to impress me, to lift to my sight 
our shared country, lead me deeper 
into what you know, but loath
to cause fear you're already moving 
quietly away, sure I'll go with you, 
as I would now, almost anywhere.

Heir
 

This gray board fence turns blue in the evening light
And the sycamores reign down upon it their diadems,
And blue and green batter in wood and stems
The stems of light
Their green and golden gems.

At once, out of a million years of energy,
All turn to flesh,--board, gate, and branch--
With that quick sunset wrench
Which seems like chance,
Out of the fashion of an entropy.

If then the flesh is yours, as now it is,
I have lost yard, sunset, and all
Into a mild greeting, and I call
The sunset to your thought, to tell it is
Parent apparent to your rich apparel.

"Dreams Are the Royal Road to the Unconscious
 

"Dreams Are the Royal Road to the Unconscious--Freud
The King's Highway to the Dare-Not-Know
--but I beg my rides and oh I know
these boring roads where hundreds and hundreds
of cars fade by in hundred-hundreds
of flashing windows too bright too fast
to see my face. I am steadfast
long hours o' the morning, I am so sad.
An old-time trap, an ancient sad
horse and his farmer stop by the way,
they'll take me one mile on my way
--out of my way--is this the Way?
I used to think I used to be happy,
but is it possible to be happy?
What is it like?--like Plato oh
we'll copy it at large and oh
plan a city where all the distances
(where? where?) are walking distances.

A Visit
 

"Fine bitches all, and Molly Dance...--Djuna Barnes
Come for duty's sake (as girls do) we watch
The sly very old woman wile away from her pious
And stagger-blind friend, their daily split of gin.
She pours big drinks. We think of what
Has crumpled, folded, slumped her flesh in
And muddied her once tumbling blood that, young,
Sped her, threaded with brave power: a Tower,
Now Babel, then of ivory, of the Shulamite,
Collapsed to this keen dame moving among
Herself. She hums, she plays with used bright
Ghosts, makes real dolls, and drinking sings Come here
My child, and feeling it, dear. A crooking finger
Shows how hot the oven is.

(Also she is alive with hate.
Also she is afraid of hell. Also, we wish
We might, illiberal, uncompassionate,
Run from her smell, her teeth in the dish.)

Even dying, her life riots in her. We stand stock still
Though aswarm with itches under her disreputable smiles.
We manage to mean well. We endure, and more.
We learn time's pleasure, catch our future and its cure.
We're dear blood daughters to this every hag, and near kin
To any after this of those our mirrors tell us foolishly envy us,
Presuming us, who are young, to be beautiful, kind, and sure.

Private and Profane
 

From loss of the old and lack of the new
From failure to make the right thing do
Save us, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu.
     From words not the word, from a feckless voice
     From poetic distress and from careless choice
     Exclude our intellects, James Joyce.
From genteel angels and apostles unappalled
From hollywood visions as virgins shawled
Guard our seeing, Grnewald.
     From calling a kettle an existential pot,
     From bodying the ghost of whatever is not,
     John save us, 0 most subtle Scot.
From pace without cadence, from pleasures slip-shod
From eating the pease and rejecting the pod
Wolfgang keep us, lover of God.
     Couperin come with your duple measure
     Alter our minds against banal pleasure.
Drer direct with strictness our vision
Steady this flesh toward your made precision.
     Mistress of accurate minor pain,
     Lend wit for forbearance, prideless Jane.
From pretending to own what we secretly seek,
From (untimely, discourteous) the turned other cheek,
Protect our honor, Demetrius the Greek.
     From ignorance of structural line and bone
     From passion not pointed on truth alone
     Attract us, painters on Egyptian stone.
     From despair keep us, Aquin's dumb son;
     From despair keep us, Saint Welcome One;
     From lack of despair keep us, Djuna and John Donne.
That zeal for free will get us in deep,
That the chance to choose be the one we keep
That free will steel self in us against self-defense
That free will repeal in us our last pretense
That free will heal us
     Jeanne d'Arc, Job, Johnnie Skelton,
     Jehan de Beauce, composer Johann,
     Dark John Milton, Charter Oak John,
Strike deep, divide us from cheap-got doubt,
Leap, leap between us and the easy out;
Teach us to seize, to use, to sleep well, to let go;
Let our loves, freed in us, gaudy and graceful, grow.

The Long Hill
 

I must have passed the crest a while ago
    And now I am going down.
Strange to have crossed the crest and not to know--
    But the brambles were always catching the hem of my gown.

All the morning I thought how proud it would be
    To stand there straight as a queen--
Wrapped in the wind and the sun, with the world under me.
    But the air was dull, there was little I could have seen.

It was nearly level along the beaten track
    And the brambles caught in my gown--
But it's no use now to think of turning back,
    The rest of the way will be only going down.


September 1919





The Answer
 

When I go back to earth
And all my joyous body
Puts off the red and white
That once had been so proud,
If men should pass above
With false and feeble pity,
My dust will find a voice
To answer them aloud:

"Be still, I am content,
Take back your poor compassion--
Joy was a flame in me
Too steady to destroy.
Lithe as a bending reed
Loving the storm that sways her--
I found more joy in sorrow
Than you could find in joy.

My Ambition
 

For Wade Hall
is to become a footnote
in a learned work of the

22nd century   not just a
"cf or a "see but a sol-

id note such as Raby gives
Walafrid Straho in Christ-

ian Latin Poetry or Ernst
Robert Curtius (the most

erudite German who ever
lived) devotes to Alber-

tino Mussato in his Euro-
pische Literatur und La-

teinisches Mittelalter   I
hope the scholar of the

22nd will lick his schol-
arly lips when he finds me

in some forgotten source
(perhaps the Obloquies of

Dreadful Edward Dahlberg)
and think here is an odd-
ball I would have liked,
immortalizing me in six

turgid lines of footnote.


October/November 1987





From "Five Poems
 

I
     He who has never tasted the grapes of Canaan can only view them from Pisgah.      I have my tides, O sea-foamed Venus, dearer than watercress, pipkins, thyme and clymene. You once held me by the cord of my navel, but I have not died to live in Mahomet's paradise.      Would that I could gather up my love to me as one does one's fate, or measure her nature as God does the sea.      We are a weary race that hates seedtime. Poor Persephone, who is Maying springtime, and the coming up of flowers! We remember only what we seed, and Persephone goes down into the earth after Spring and Summer vegetation only because Pluto gave her pomegranate seeds to remember him, but if the seed perish, Persephone will die, and memory shall pass from the earth.     A man of humble blood, with a soul of Kidron, needs a Rachel, but I labored for years in the weary fields for Leah.
II
     The world is a wound in my soul, and I have sought the living waters in meditation, and the angelical fountains in the desert of Beersheba for solitude, for what health there is in friendship comes when one is alone.      I shed tears on the Mount of Olives because people no longer care for each other, but my friends have lacked the character for the vigil. There is no Cana wine in human affections that are not always awake, for people who do not trouble about each other are foes.      It is humiliating being the lamb and bleating to each passerby, "Feed me! What is the use of saying that men are stones when I know I am going to try to turn them into bread.      I am afraid to say that people are truthful. When a man tells me he is honest I press my hand close to my heart where I keep my miserable wallet. If he says he has any goodness in him, I avoid him, for I trust nobody who has so little fear of the evils that grow and ripen in us while we imagine we have one virtuous trait. These demons lie in ambush in the thick, heady coverts of the blood, where hypocrisy and egoism fatten, waiting to mock or betray us in any moment of self-esteem.      I have no faith in a meek man, and regard anyone that shows a humble mien as one who is preparing to make an attack upon me, for there is some brutish, nether fault in starved vanity.      Yet once a friend leaned as gently on my coat as that disciple had on the bosom of the Saviour, and I went away, not knowing by his affection whether I was the John Christ was said to have loved most. I whispered thanks to my soul because he leaned upon me, for I shall never know who I am if I am not loved. 
V
     Much flesh walks upon the earth void of heart and warm liver, for it is the spirit that dies soonest.      Some men have marshland natures with mist and sea-water in their intellects, and are as sterile as the Florida earth which De Soto found in those meager, rough Indian settlements, and their tongues are fierce, reedy arrows. They wound and bleed the spirit, and their oaks and chestnut trees and acorns are wild, and a terrible, barren wind from the Atlantic blows through their blood as pitiless as the primitive rivers De Soto's soldiers could not ford.     Do not attempt to cross these mad, tumid rivers, boreal and brackish, for water is unstable, and you cannot link yourself to it.      There are also inland, domestic men who are timid pulse and vetch, and though they may appear as stupid as poultry rooting in the mire, they are housed people, and they have orchards and good, tamed wine that makes men loving rather than predatory; go to them, and take little thought of their ignorance which brings forth good fruits, for here you may eat and not be on guard for the preservation of your soul.     People who have domestic animals are patient, for atheism and the stony heart are the result of traveling: sorrow never goes anywhere. Were we as content as our forefathers were with labor in the fallow, or as a fuller with his cloth, or a drayman with his horses and mules, we would stay where we are, and that is praying.     There are men that are birds, and their raiment is trembling feathers, for they show their souls to everyone, and everything that is ungentle or untutored or evil or mockery is as a rude stone cast at them, and they suffer all day long, or as Paul remarks they are slain every moment.     God forgive me for my pride; though I would relinquish my own birthright for that wretched pottage of lentils which is friendship, I mistrust every mortal.     Each day the alms I ask of heaven is not to have a new chagrin which is my daily bread.  December 1959

from Don Juan: Canto 1, Stanzas 60-63
 

60
 Her eye (I'm very fond of handsome eyes)
    Was large and dark, suppressing half its fire
 Until she spoke, then through its soft disguise
    Flash'd an expression more of pride than ire,
 And love than either; and there would arise
    A something in them which was not desire,
 But would have been, perhaps, but for the soul
 Which struggled through and chasten'd down the whole. 

 61
 Her glossy hair was cluster'd o'er a brow
    Bright with intelligence, and fair, and smooth;
 Her eyebrow's shape was like the aerial bow,
    Her cheek all purple with the beam of youth,
 Mounting at times to a transparent glow,
    As if her veins ran lightning; she, in sooth,
 Possess'd an air and grace by no means common:
 Her stature tall--I hate a dumpy woman. 

62
 Wedded she was some years, and to a man
    Of fifty, and such husbands are in plenty;
 And yet, I think, instead of such a ONE
    'Twere better to have TWO of five-and-twenty,
 Especially in countries near the sun:
    And now I think on't, 'mi vien in mente,'
 Ladies even of the most uneasy virtue
 Prefer a spouse whose age is short of thirty.

 63
 'Tis a sad thing, I cannot choose but say,
    And all the fault of that indecent sun,
 Who cannot leave alone our helpless clay,
    But will keep baking, broiling, burning on,
 That howsoever people fast and pray,
    The flesh is frail, and so the soul undone:
 What men call gallantry, and gods adultery,
 Is much more common where the climate 's sultry.





from Don Juan: Canto 1, Stanzas 41-42
 

41
His classic studies made a little puzzle,
   Because of filthy loves of gods and goddesses,
Who in the earlier ages raised a bustle,
   But never put on pantaloons or bodices;
His reverend tutors had at times a tussle,
   And for their Aeneids, Iliads, and Odysseys,
Were forced to make an odd sort of apology,
For Donna Inez dreaded the mythology.
 
42
Ovid's a rake, as half his verses show him,
   Anacreon's morals are a still worse sample,
Catullus scarcely has a decent poem,
   I don't think Sappho's Ode a good example,
Although Longinus tells us there is no hymn
   Where the sublime soars forth on wings more ample:
But Virgil's songs are pure, except that horrid one
Beginning with 'Formosum Pastor Corydon.'





from Don Juan: Canto 1, Stanzas 47-48
 

47
Sermons he read, and lectures he endured,
   And homilies, and lives of all the saints;
To Jerome and to Chrysostom inured,
   He did not take such studies for restraints;
But how faith is acquired, and then insured,
   So well not one of the aforesaid paints
As Saint Augustine in his fine Confessions,
Which make the reader envy his transgressions.
 
48
This, too, was a seal'd book to little Juan--
   I can't but say that his mamma was right,
If such an education was the true one.
   She scarcely trusted him from out her sight;
Her maids were old, and if she took a new one
   You might be sure she was a perfect fright,
She did this during even her husband's life--
I recommend as much to every wife.





from Don Juan: Canto 1, Stanzas 217-221
 

217

Ambition was my idol, which was broken
   Before the shrines of Sorrow and of Pleasure;
And the two last have left me many a token
   O'er which reflection may be made at leisure:
Now, like Friar Bacon's brazen head, I've spoken,
   'Time is, Time was, Time's past', a chymic treasure
Is glittering youth, which I have spent betimes--
My heart in passion, and my head on rhymes.

 

218
What is the end of Fame? 'tis but to fill
   A certain portion of uncertain paper:
Some liken it to climbing up a hill,
   Whose summit, like all hills', is lost in vapour;
For this men write, speak, preach, and heroes kill,
   And bards burn what they call their 'midnight taper,'
To have, when the original is dust,
A name, a wretched picture, and worse bust.
 
219
What are the hopes of man? old Egypt's King
   Cheops erected the first pyramid
And largest, thinking it was just the thing
   To keep his memory whole, and mummy hid;
But somebody or other rummaging,
   Burglariously broke his coffin's lid:
Let not a monument give you or me hopes,
Since not a pinch of dust remains of Cheops. 
 
220
But I being fond of true philosophy,
   Say very often to myself, 'Alas!
All things that have been born were born to die,
   And flesh (which Death mows down to hay) is grass;
You've pass'd your youth not so unpleasantly,
   And if you had it o'er again--'twould pass--
So thank your stars that matters are no worse,
And read your Bible, sir, and mind your purse.' 
 
221
But for the present, gentle reader! and
   Still gentler purchaser! the bard--that's I--
Must, with permission, shake you by the hand,
   And so your humble servant, and good bye!
We meet again, if we should understand
   Each other; and if not, I shall not try
Your patience further than by this short sample--
'Twere well if others follow'd my example.
 






The Second Death
 

So like the slow moss encroaching, this
 dark anxiety. In the bricks
 by now
and all along
 the shaded left side of the house.

 And the statue, behind her knee. Her
 ankle, in the cool
 space between her breasts, spreading
 in the earliest hours
 of the morning.

 Between her fingers.
Her parted lips.
That black-green
 whispering.





At the Post Office
 

The line is long, processional, glacial, 
and the attendant a giant stone, cobalt blue 
with flecks of white, I'm not so much 
looking at a rock but a slab of night. 
The stone asks if anything inside the package 
is perishable. When I say no the stone 
laughs, muted thunderclap, meaning 
everything decays, not just fruit 
or cut flowers, but paper, ink, the CD 
I burned with music, and my friend 
waiting to hear the songs, some little joy 
after chemo eroded the tumor. I know flesh 
is temporary, and memory a tilting barn 
the elements dismantle nail by nail. 
I know the stone knows a millennia of rain 
and wind will even grind away 
his ragged face, and all of this slow erasing 
is just a prelude to when the swelling 
universe burns out, goes dark, holds 
nothing but black holes, the bones of stars 
and planets, a vast silence. The stone 
is stone-faced. The stone asks how soon 
I want the package delivered. As fast 
as possible, I say, then start counting the days.





Before Anything Happened the House Had No Skeleton
 

the termites had deboned the thing
 it was clean there was no saving it
  
 in one bedroom a dresser with blue drawers
 its peg-legs rested on pure membrane
  
 a girl just stood in her underwear
 ran the tips of her fingers over her ribs
  
 thought greyhound no one knew no explaining
 why she didn't fall through the floor
  
 the kids were drinking beer in the yard
 the tetherball rope caught one girl's throat
  
 her mother's face obscured
 behind the porch screen the mesquite shadow
  
 no one could make her out
 her feet rested on hot sashes of dust
  
 the sounds on the television were far away
 as that big caliche mound looked lake a waving man
  
 the president got shot
 the boards stayed together for another three days
  
 it was a matter of apathy or swelling
 or everyone was too hot to move





A Red Tricycle in the Belly of the Pool
 

the live oak over the nursery got a disease
 they could only save one limb
 it wasn't surprising; it wasn't that kind of nursery
  
 a girl rode her red tricycle around the bottom of the pool
 the pool had no water; it hadn't rained
  
 the girl kept smelling her hand
 it smelled like honeywheat, or the inside of a girl's panties
  
 someone said, race you
 she nodded okay and pedaled like hell
 after three laps no one had passed her
  
 she looked over her shoulder, lost her balance
 ripped her hands & knees on the blue concrete
  
 the one limb on the live oak curved like a question
 would she need stitches again
  
 there was already ink under her skin & iodine on her tongue
 or was it the other way around
  
 she could see black thread bunching
 sewing centipedes under her skin
  
 her throat burned and she couldn't move her legs
 it wasn't a tricycle
 it was something she couldn't get her foot out from under
  
 she hated to stop or lose her shoe and, I'm sorry
 the pool was full of water





I Have to Go Back to 1994 and Kill a Girl
 

It's no wonder          I'm always tired          with all these tract houses--
                                     It's night & cold
 on my belly in                                                  the undeveloped field now
                                     I have to bury her
 clothing inside                                                a black garbage bag in plot D
 police cars roll         past but continue        down the treeless parkway
                                     even after shining        
 their lights on                                                  me in my freshman sundress
                                     I can only assume
 they don't see                                                  the significance of my presence
 but I must say          1994 is a simpler         time--not everyone is suspect
                                     I crawl up next to
 my old house                                                   & look through a lit window
                                     my mother reads
 a book in bed            I want to knock           on the glass, there's something
                                     I need to tell her





[Sleeping sister of a farther sky]
 

Sleeping sister of a farther sky,
 dropped from zenith like a tender tone,
 the lucid apex of a scale unknown
 whose whitest whisper is an opaque cry
  
 of measureless frequency, the spectral sigh
 you breath, bright hydrogen and brighter zone
 of fissured carbon, consummated moan
 and ceaseless rapture of a brilliant why.
  
 Will nothing wake you from your livid rest?
 Essence of ether and astral stone
 the stunned polarities your substance weaves
  
 in one bright making, like a dream of leaves
 in the tree's mind, summered. Or as a brooding bone
 roots constellations in the body's nest.





[Show me the body that brides its quest]
 

Show me the body that brides its quest,
 that sleeps its seemings, tremblant inconnue,
 jeweled Ophelia of diaphanous hue
 in all her slippings, weed-wedded, water-dressed,
  
 the sluice and swooning of her semblant rest--
 the river ruptures, the weeds branch blue--
 day's jaune eyes (wide lucencies) bleed new
 hollow spaces where the breathings nest,
  
 irised mnemosyne, rumored as a rune.
 Oh roared red pulse, errata, when you die
 maiden-postured, murmur in the wrist,
  
 tendrilled syllables the waters twist,
 or innered element (it is an I)
 the dead girl blurring in the blooded noon.





[She goes, she is, she wakes the waters]
 

She goes, she is, she wakes the waters
 primed in their wave-form, a flux of urge
 struck into oneness, the solid surge
 seeking completion, and strikes and shatters
  
 and is its fragments, distinction's daughters
 and now, unholding, the cleave and merge
 the hew and fusing, plundering the verge
 and substance is the scheme it scatters
  
 and what it numbers in substantial sun.
 Her hands hold many or her hands hold none.
 And diving the salt will kiss a convex eye
  
 and be salt fact and be the bodied sky
 and that gray weight is both or beggared one,
 a dead dimensional, or blue begun.





The Persians by Rumi
 

If you're love's lover and look for love
 cold smoke the dog called bashfulness

 this poem isn't interested I'll bill you
 Why'd the mad one make madness in a thousand works
 that wild one make a thousand wild works of wiles?
 now he disrobes, now he's so fast
 now he likes intoxicating substances and wants to die
 Since a spider spies and eats a whole deer
 behold what the web of Zoroastrianism will do!
 Since the love of nighties had positive market outlook,
 how will it be with "He took His servant in nighties?
 Have you not seen the book of Waisa and Ramin?
 Have you not heard the tales of Wamiq and Adra?
 You hike your denim so you don't wear water
  
 do you have to pull that bridge stunt over & over?
 The way of love is filth and I'm drunk
 the storm storms--how should a storm calm?
 you'll be the jewel in the ring of lovers
 If you're insistent on assuming the consequence of jewelry
 so, say it, how does the earth hurt if we fuck?
 what gifts would be unreasonable?
 it's not cool to beat a drum when yr. in bed, son,
 and put your erection in the middle of the desert
 Listen to the sounds of fucking and coming,
 under the sky, which "Orientals, perhaps owing
 to some optical peculiarity, see as green.
 When you're drunk take your clothes off
 Heaven is great, Orion is confused
 how the world is high and killed
 by love which is high and killed!
 When the sun comes out, where do nighties hide?
 When the come comes, where does the pent go?
 I'm done. Speak to me, soul's soul's soul
 From desire of whom from whose desire every throat was cut





The Persians by Archilochos
 

Someone said you were dead
 it's not that I didn't care
 You were not bacterial
 You were not frozen water in winter
 You were not a hairbrush broken by hair
 You were a treasure of gold in the world-toilet
 For you appraised the world of grains
 And flung the earth to the earth
 The good wine is mixed with the bad wine,
 come to the wine jar's lips and let's unmix it
 Poor people only have one soul
 but you and I have two
 let's go on vacation to Mexico or Rome
 Everybody returns home
 How should old people associate with young people?
 Shut up--Be like a compass. The King
 has erased your name from the book of speech





#14 from The Poems of Gaius Valerius Catullus
 


    This boat you're videotaping. You're looking at a boat. Despite your protests that you are looking at a translation of the fourth poem in the corpus of Catullus, I assure you you are looking at this boat. Lots of bad things battered this boat. Forget about volunteering to swab its lintels. This boat denies it was minced in the Adriatic. It denies that it lit up the Cyclades with an all night buck and spill. Rhodes is horrible, noble, Thracian. Proponents of Rhodes call truce though it might be their sinuses. Where this boat is is post-boat. The word for this boat is phaselus. A phaselus was a rather long and narrow vessel, named for its resemblance to a kidney bean. This boat was built for speed. Yet this boat is sort of fragile. Lots of bad things battered this boat from the beginning of its life to now. You state it's cracked, but I tell you to go put your stupid hands in the water. Say it again. The boat frets about its impotence, falls over dead. The boat sucks lava dexterously; yes, this boat is right-handed. Its aura chainsmokes cigarettes, looks up at Jupiter out there in space, and its beams moist. What happens below deck, and involves feet, stays below deck. I'm not literally pointing out this boat to you, I'm writing a poem about it in limping trimeters. But this is a fact: botulism is sad. Noobs lurch toward a limpid coast. And before them stands a boat, a beautiful old boat looking like a kidney bean built for speed. It sits there quiet and old, looking over the lake and thinking this lake is really limpid. The noobs all have twins.





#104 from The Poems of Gaius Valerius Catullus
 

with Dana Ward
with Dana Ward
  
  
 I have so little want of activity
 even writing with its pain more terrible than life
 I don't want but do because I'm kind of stupid finally
 not in the way, you, Sarah know I am
 nor, you reader, who think of me fishing.
 Line, spindle, lure, bait. Instruments for me
 are accessories, even the matchbook is only
 a tiara to my eyes, the fishing lure a long
 & white bracelet. Some of my
 so-called friends think of me as a derelict
 they always try to hold me to account.
 "Tell me what happened on the drunken night in question
 On the witness stand I am a kitten
 terribly cute but I can't say a thing
 about stupid, or fish, or last night.
 I like to lay at the base of a hill
 asleep while the shepherds work
 bringing things to heel with tepid will where I source
 my contempt in the index of swill.
 The entries there make no mention of hell
 which was sifted through the vale of tears, & fell
 to make Earth, & the base of this hill where I sunbathe & murmur
 jealous cellmate' as my willful peers go by.





Aubade
 

for Andrew Joron
the desire to show is destruction
in lessons forgot before learned
no shrunken heads hang by wires
no mourning songs of half-remembered
shutters open the width of an eyelash
it is enough for vision to run
its finger along, for access to steal
from forbidden shores the still-cold
beams of night and pack them in ice
but a child couldn't live here nonetheless

in the morning is come a bell that summons
a fortune that reads she will soon
cross the water and the intended instructions
which may not florish after all
she leaves a painting outside her room
and in the morning it's gone
and not one word is spoke between them
but her father carries it to his grave
the desire to show is destruction
and we are not hung with skins
we must follow internal echoes
commit ourselves to memory





Ordinary History America
 

the trapdoor is closed; am finite again, but a moment ago--levitation!
purple lights the bluewater bridge turned on the oil-
black river st clair became fuel for the nightfishers there
it was the dream of a memory or the memory of a dream
that dumped me below a window, watching a woman change
into a man. she entered his dairy log: at first all the world was america
and didn't that suck, he thunk, and strunk his cunk against
an overwrought iron fence. they stood waiting like that photograph
of the bootblack jack and the aristocrat
                                                       looking away from her window
at a fact well worth recording--Alexander Graham Bell wanted to call
his daughter Photophone. between the forest and the gander
i hand her over to Metacomet. yes i certainly did.
and King Philip sayeth unto me: nature denatured thee
friction alone makes her come therefore i need some more
before you make me wear'um pants. O failed invention!
where'd you get that voice? refusing to come
to a particular point, castration finally made sense.








Andr Bretons Apartment
 

the madder runs
like blood

lifeblood of 
the livebud

that kindles next to earth

the hair on the church is water
the lovebirds curve their crutches down

so long
to the sacred
palaces

so long to the fingerbone that lingers on

if i'm alive
it's no thanks to you

if i'm comatose
let's make the most of it

tomato ghost

rude twilight

ruby tear

discipline disappears
between the shapeless necklace
and the cloudy robe of shrapnel

in the absence
of incense

no balm can grease
the throbbing temples

of the rotting world





Pome
 

From flowering gnarled trees 
they come, weighing down
the branches, dropping 
with a soft sound onto 
the loamy ground. Falling 
and fallen. That's a pome.

Common as an apple. Or 
more rare. A quince or pear.
A knife paring away soft skin
exposes tart sweet flesh.
And deeper in, five seeds in a core
are there to make more pomes.

Look how it fits in my hand.
What to do? What to do?
I could give it to you.
Or leave it on the table
with a note both true and untrue:
Ceci n'est pas un pome.

I could paint it as a still life,
a small window of light 
in the top right corner
(only a dab of the whitest white),
a place to peer in and watch it
change and darken as pomes will do.

O I remember days....
Climbing the branches of a tree
ripe and heavy with pomes. 
Taking whatever I wanted.
There were always enough then.
Always enough.





Mockingbird
 

No other song
                    or swoop (part
       quiver, part swivel and
             plash) with
  tour de force
stray the course note
       liquefactions
   (its new,
bawdy air an
       aria hangs in) en-
thralls,
             trills, loops, soars,
                    startles, out-warbles,
out-brawns, more
       juicily,
                    lifts up
the dawn, outlaws from
                        sackcloth, the cool
     sloth of bed sheets,
                             from pillows
           and silks
                and blue-quilted, feminine
bolsters, fusses
                      of coverlets;
                                   nips as the switch
of a juvenile willow, fuzz
               of a nettle, to
       window and window
                           and window and ever
                   toward egress, to
           flurry, pollen
and petal shed,
                            to wet street
  and wet pavement,
              all sentiment intemperate,
  all sentience
                         ephemeral.





Sequence
 

1. HELL

You'd have to be as crazy as Dante to get those down,
 the infernal hatreds.
 Shoot them. Shoot them where they live
 and then skip town.

Or stay and re-engineer 
the decrepit social contraption
to distill the 200-proof
elixir of fear

and torture the...the what 
from the what? And didn't I promise,
under threat of self-intubation,
not to envision this

corridor, coal-tar black,
that narrows down and in
to a shattering claustrophobia attack
before opening out

to the lake of frozen shit
where the gruesome figure is discerned?
Turn around, go home.
Just to look at it is to become it.


 2. PURGATORY, THE FILM

 He was chronically out of work, why we don't know.
 She was the second born of a set 
of estranged identical twins. They met,
hooked up, and moved in with her mother,
who managed a motel on Skyline Drive. 
But always it was the other,
the firstborn, the bad twin, the runaway, 
he imagined in the shadow
of the "Vacancy sign
or watching through the window
below the dripping eaves
while they made love or slept.
The body is relaxed and at rest,
the mind is relaxed in its nest,
so the self that is and is not 
itself rises and leaves
to peek over the horizon, where it sees
all its psychokinetic possibilities
resolving into shapely fictions.
She was brave, nurturing, kind.
She was evil. She was out of her mind.
She was a junkie trading sex for a fix,
a chief executive, an aviatrix.
She was an angel
to the blinded and the lamed,
the less-than-upright, the infra dig.
And she was even a failure.
She went to L.A. to make it big
 and crept back home injured and ashamed.


3. PURGATORY, THE SEQUEL

They put him in jail, why we don't know.
 They stamped him "Postponed.
But he didn't mind.
The screws were almost kind.
He had leisure to get his muscles toned,

mental space to regret his crimes,
and when he wasn't fabricating license plates
he was free
to remember the beauty
that not once but a thousand times

escaped him forever, and escapes me, too:
ghosts of a mist drifting
across the face of the stars,
Jupiter triangulating 
with the crescent moon and Mars,
 prismatic fracturings in a drop of dew...


 4. HEAVEN

There's drought on the mountain.
 Wildfires scour the hills.
So the mammal crawls down the desiccated rills
searching for the fountain,

which it finds, believe it or not,
or sort of finds. A thin silver sliver
rises from an underground river
and makes a few of the hot

rocks steam and the pebbles hiss.
Soon the mammal will drink,
but it has first 
to stop and think
its reflexive, impeccable thought:
that thinking comes down to this--
mystery, longing, thirst.





The Visitor
 

Does no dishes, dribbles sauce 
across the floor. Is more dragon 
than spaniel, more flammable 
than fluid. Is the loosening 
in the knit of me, the mixed-fruit 
marmalade in the kitchen of me. 
Wakes my disco and inner hibiscus, 
the Hector in the ever-mess of my Troy. 
All wet mattress to my analysis,
he's stayed the loudest and longest
of any houseguest, is calling now 
as I write this, tiny B who brings the joy.





The Hurt Sonnet
 

Dark days when I awaken so I slump
                             back to the swamp of his armpit, a whit

from the arachnid he inked to the stump
                that's left. So close to the vestige of it,

                                            the danger he's a reliquary of:
               tattooed noose to venerate the fist

                            of a slug buried still in his butt above
a white cross for the men he didn't miss.

               If only I could strip off the black map
I sleep against and be his liniment,

                            gloss over the explosion, the mishap
                                           phantom he feels in a forearm itch.

               He won't leave the long tale his tattoos read
                           for me, so I amend the story.





La Prima Victoria
 

She expects nothing but to witness our lives 
and find kindness and why shouldn't she 
but for the boiling water my partner spills 
on my arm and the FUCK'S SAKE 
that escapes my mouth now the snout 
of the spitting mammal in me. 
If there's a craft to the failing of simple 
expectations, I have mastered it 
and majestically--but when there's something 
that must be said, it must be said, 
Lispector says of a woman entering 
an empty room and finding a version 
of herself so dark it makes her pause 
and really see it, how she's no better 
than the cockroach in her closet 
and so she eats it.





Of the Divine as Absence and Single Letter
 

If our view were not a Holiday Inn
but a fringe of trees, I could say G here
is our greenly hidden.
                                          If we lived 
amid Joe-Pye weed and high grass 
instead of spackle and peeling plaster 
I could say perhaps
                                  I'm listening to G now 
but mean the owl, a wind playing the silo, 
a sticking sorrow,
                               any sound but the snore 
of our latest visitor on the futon. Dear G, 
please make him turn, make me kinder. 
I'm not far from unfathoming it all.





Borodin
 

When the world was loveliness I was
A composer, Borodin, my left eye
Level with the floor beside toy men.
Wild work and havoc they made,
Being glad. I could draw a line
Would run straight through the minds of men,
Being a sociable angel,
Music before and after, blushing.

Heaven is a nonsense entirely sensible.
I was a child on the floor beside you,
Making music, becoming small in the rosy
Embrace of God's best messenger.
I loved your havoc and your hair.





The Soul
 

It disappeared. 
It reappeared
as chimney smoke 
that burnt through carcasses
of swallows stilled,
and that it portrayed no will
was why I followed that smoke
with this pair of eyes.

It was that it didn't need
or require my belief
that I leant upon it 
as a tired worker
upon 
a gate.





Foreign Song
 

To bomb them, 
we mustn't have heard their music 
or known their waterless night watch,
we mustn't have seen how already 
the desert was under constant death bells
ringing over sleeping cribs and dry wells.
We couldn't have wanted 
this eavesdropping 
of names we've never pronounced 
praying themselves towards death.
I try to believe in us--
we must not 
have heard 
their music.





Speak to Us
 

For all of my years, I've read only living signs--
bodies in jealousy, bodies in battle, 
bodies growing disease like mushroom coral.
It is tiresome, tiresome, describing 
fir cones waiting for fires to catch their human ribs 
into some slow, future forest.

My beloved, he tires of me, and he should--
my complaints the same, his recourse 
the same, invoking the broad, cool sheet suffering drapes
over the living freeze of heart after heart, 
and never by that heart's fault--the heart did not make itself,
the face did not fashion its jutting jawbone 
to wail across the plains or beg the bare city. 

I will no longer tally the broken, ospreyed oceans, 
the figs that outlived summer 
or the tedious mineral angles and 
their suction of light. 

Have you died? Then speak. 
You must see the living 
are too small as they are, 
lonesome for more 
and in varieties of pain 
only you can bring into right view.





The Present
 

The cost of flight is landing.
On this warm winter day in the southwest,
down here on the edge of the border I want
to go to France where we all came from
where the Occident was born near the ancient
caves near Lascaux. At home I'm only
sitting on the lip of this black hole, a well
that descends to the center of the earth.
With a big telescope aimed straight down
I see a red dot of fire and hear the beast howling.
My back is suppurating with disease,
the heart lurches left and right,
the brain sings its ditties.
Everywhere blank white movies wait to be seen.
The skylark dove within inches of the rocks
before it stopped and rose again.
God's toes are buried deep in the earth.
He's ready to run. But where?





The Girls of Winter
 

Out the window of the bar I'm watching
a circle of girls stretching and yawning
across the street. It's late January and 74
degrees. They love the heat because
they are a moist heat. Heat loves
heat and today is a tease for what comes
with spring around here when the glorious birds
funnel back up from Mexico. The girls
don't care about birds because they are birds.
I recall in high school a half dozen
cheerleaders resting on a wrestling mat
in short shorts in the gym, me beside them
with a silly groin ache. What were they?
Living, lovely, warm meat as we all are
reaching out of our bodies for someone else.





Toward what island-home am I moving
 

Toward what island-home am I moving,
not wanting to marry, not wanting 
too much of that emptiness at evening, 
as when I walked through a field at dusk
and felt wide in the night.
And it was again the evening that drew me
back to the field where I was most alone,
compassed by stems and ruts, 
no light of the fixed stars, no flashing in the eyes, 
only heather pared by dry air, shedding 
a small feathered radiance when I looked away,
an expanse whose deep sleep seemed an unending 
warren I had been given, to carry out such tasks--
that I might find nothing dead.  
And it was again the evening that drew me
back to the field where I could sense no boundary--
the smell of dry earth, cool arch of my neck, the darkness 
entirely within myself.  
And when I shut my eyes there was no one.
Only weeds in drifts of stillness, only 
stalks and gliding sky.

Come, black anchor, let us not be harmed.
The deer leafing in the dark.
The old man at the table, unable to remember.
The children whose hunger is just hunger, 
and never desire.





Cough
 

I see you once I've got you down to size:
a two-day-stubble squatter; jailbait eyes;

the bottle-headed trophy mom; the mentor
always angling his face down from the center

of his universe to shine a light on yours.
The fated anorexic, whose allures

shimmer in the mirror for her eyes
only, denying what her denial denies.

Once you become a cliche I can hate you--
or, treat me tenderly and let me date you.

But that only retards the writing-off
that comes with boredom, amour propre, or (cough) 

irreconcilable differences, i.e.,
those things about you that are least like me,

yet just slightly different, my foible's homophone,
so in hating yours I really hate my own.

This keeps the focus where it wants to be--
On whom, you ask? Invariably on.... See?

I didn't even have to say, did I?
I love you so much. No need to reply.





Torch
 

                                      when I beheld a fire win out against a hemisphere of shadows.                           --Inferno, Dante (tr. by Allen Mandelbaum)
If I could hold a fire against
a hemisphere of shadows, hold it
close, not so that damage
finds my hands, but so fire scatters
galvanizing strands, my pupils
responsive to the flames' unbridled 
tutelage as they tell me
nothing but these little jumps
out of your definitions, small
or large or leaping, sinking, slumped...
If I could hold a fire against 
that latticework of shadows, standing
close to flames pivoting without
being singed or riveted or convinced
it is the only spirit, like a god,
making me something nailed to wood
then keep my head, then coolly draw
some backbone from that dazzle.





At the End of Life, a Secret
 

Everything measured. A man twists 
a tuft of your hair out for no reason 
other than you are naked before him 
and he is bored with nakedness. Moments 
before he was weighing your gallbladder, 
and then he was staring at the empty space 
where your lungs were. Even dead, we still 
say you are an organ donor, as if something 
other than taxes outlasts death. Your feet 
are regular feet. Two of them, and there is no 
mark to suggest you were an expert mathematician, 
nothing that suggests that a woman loved
you until you died. From the time your body 
was carted before him to the time your 
dead body is being sent to the coffin, 
every pound is accounted for, except 21 grams. 
The man is a praying man and has figured 
what it means. He says this is the soul, finally, 
after the breath has gone. The soul: less than 
$4,000 worth of crack--21 grams-- 
all that moves you through this world.





For the City that Nearly Broke Me
 

Knots like two dozen fists
swayed with want from the boy's
kaffiyeh, that black and white scarf
with its useless hands clopping
against the wind in protest
against this boy and his somebody
lost, against their own swaying
in a dance the lost body has lost.
A boy. A somebody lost. A body bodied
in the lights of inauguration night
when every light in the city flared 
with hope. Always losing, always
a boy left with a dozen weights,
small circles on strings pulling
his head down to the ground.
Downcast. Drop your bucket here
and make the city yours and all
that jive keeps him from running.
Escaping the pavement, where
bodies finally fall to rest.
The kaffiyeh keeps him from
bucking against the wind,
hurtling himself to the Grey-
hound or Amtrak or I-95
with a book bag and hitched finger.
His head shrouded in the black
and white, the knots keeping
his eyes down as he traverses
neighborhoods with names like 3rd
World, with names like a nation
falling. And the coffin-voiced
boy is who god tells us he will
save, and so those swinging knots
must be a kind of redemption,
a way to see the bullets that bury
you, constantly, as if death is
the disguise hiding your wings.





A Postmodern Two-Step
 

Some people say prison is the country 
where life is cheaper than anywhere else;
you wouldn't think that watching us take leave,
our caravan three deep and black against
the wine-dark asphalt, and two of three
are nothing but escorts: four uniformed
shotguns (off safety) leading and flanking
our coffle, all intent to keep us here,
and not wherever shackles and cuffs run
in this dead of morning, less than fifty miles 
from where Nat Turner dug a hole and lay
for weeks. Virginia, something noose-like then
and some say still, except for all the shit 
we did to land in this here hull and cul-
de-sac. The guard, he say "die, but don't run
when one of us begin to cough his lung 
up in sleep. And this is ruin. Damn these chains,
this awkward dance I do with this van. Two-step,
my body swaying back and forth, my head 
a pendulum that's rocked by the wild riffs
of the dudes I'm riding with: them white folks know
you ain't god body, what you commune wine
and bread? Where you from son? Red lines?
To what Onion? My eyes two caskets though,
so the voices are sheets of sound. Our van as dark
inside as out, and all the bodies black
and voices black too and I tell my god
if you have ears for this one, know I want 
no part of it, no Onions and no tears.
I tell no one, and cry my dirge. 
                                                        This place,
the cracked and scratching vinyl seats, the loud
loud talk of murder this and blanket fear
around the rest, is where I'm most at home,
but it's beyond where prayers reach, a point
something like purgatory. I lean back
and drift in sleep as someone says, his voice
all hoarse and jacked, all broken songbird-like
all revolutions end with a L-note.





The Magic Trick
 

Half clown, half Keebler elf, he works a throng
of meth heads and young mothers who peruse
the storefronts, tugging surly kids along.
The pant legs bunch around his wing-tipped shoes.

When a couple walks up to his TV tray,
he hands them each a tattered business card.
Who wants to see a magic trick today?
He grins and cuts a deck: His hands are scarred,

but seldom shake. The two confer, agree,
and fidget as the magician fans an arc
of cherubs laced with flips of filigree.
The man inspects them for a crease or mark,

but they look clean. I've watched him do this trick
for weeks now, each time to polite surprise:
He hams it up; he lays the charm on thick.
(As always, haughty jacks materialize.)

The woman smiles and nods in mild content.
Another trick: He pulls a wrinkled bill
from his lapel and folds the president,
explaining how a wise investment will

turn one buck into ten--et cetera. 
He taps twice on the bill, a modest "one,
unfolds it square by square, and then voila!--
the bust of Alexander Hamilton.

They clap as the magician takes a bow.
He's greasy, but he's on the up-and-up,
and magic tricks are good enough for now.
The woman floats a dollar to his cup.





As Is
 

Just north of town, a quaint Sargasso Sea 
for bric-a-brac: the barn, itself antique,
spills over with a grab-bag panoply
of outworn stock revalued as "unique.
Typewriters tall as headstones fill the loft
where they've been ricked away like sacks of grain;
a coffer yawns the must of oak--gone soft--
when one man, squinting, lifts the lid to feign
intrigue. Nearby, his wife surveys the smalls:
art deco bangles bright as harpsichords,
a glut of iron trivets, Christmas balls,
Depression glass and warping Ouija boards.
One man's junk is another's all the same.
They don't buy much, but that's not why they came.





Not the Song, but After
 

Now everywhere the pageantry of youth
      is on display:
The squeal of bike chains spinning through the gray
     plays fugue to puddle-froth;

The punctual blitz of hyacinths in April
     ushers spring
with lavender dripped from the upturned wing
     of wind-swept Gabriel.

A youngish pair walks wired at the arms--
     she casually ribbing
him, he lightly brushing her breast, jibbing
     their step to spare the worms

stranded along the road. Too soon, their laughter
     rises and goes
drifting toward silence. And now the young man knows
     love's not the song, but after--

like the mute, remembered chorus of the rain
     that stains the walk
long after falling, or the lifeless stalk
     still hoisting its head of grain.

Uneasy now, she loosens from his hand.
     Their dark familiars
stare back, reflected by the passing cars,
     with speechless reprimand.

Before the chill, each chartered hell grows hotter,
     yet every burn
will teach him how to run--and how to turn
     her wine back into water.





Fresco
 

I have come again to the perfumed city.
Houses with tiered porches, some decorated with shells.
You know from the windows that the houses
are from a different time. I am not
to blame for what changes, though sometimes 
I have trouble sleeping.
Between the carriage houses,
there are little gardens separated by gates.
Lately, I have been thinking about the gates.
The one ornamented with the brass lion, I remember
it was warm to the touch
even in what passes here for winter.
But last night, when I closed my eyes,
it was not the lion that I pictured first.





Imperial City
 

From the outset I hated the city of my ancestors.
I was fearful I'd be put in the dungeon below
the cathedral. The best example of the Romanesque
a guide was saying in German      in English      in French
where are buried eight German kings      four queens
twenty-three bishops      four Holy Roman Emperors
all of whom used this bishopric on the river as the seat
of the kingdom. On the old gate at one end a clock
told an ancient form of time. I sulked along behind
my parents as the guide gave facts about the war
with the Saracens      about the place where the Jews bathed
about the child like me whose father the Peaceful
having already produced an heir by his first marriage
could marry      for love.





Keys to the City
 

Didn't rain choke the animal throats
of the cathedral      sputter
against the roofs of the city      didn't the flight
of stairs rise up above the cobbled street
didn't the key clamor
in the lock      flood
the vestibule with clattering    didn't we climb
the second flight
toward the miniature Allegory
painted on the ceiling
and touch the flat-faced girls
winged      part animal
who did not flinch and did not scamper





I Remember Lotera
 

I remember nights of playing
Lotera w/Mom & Big Manny
as a way to learn the Spanish they spoke
to each other but not to their kids 
who caught on to certain words 
like cllate, cerveza, chicharrn; 
little nuggets I ate up 
like the pinto beans we used
instead of the blue chips
Mom kept in her Bingo bag
she carried every Friday night
when her & Tia Shirley
went to the Moose Lodge,
her hair & coat reeking
w/the smoke of all who lost.
     
I remember El Borracho,
the man always holding a bottle
& about to fall over yet never does
like Big Manny stumbling home
late at night after a payday,
breath & belly full of beer,
who one time took a piss
in our bedroom.

I remember La Garza,
not for the heron it is
but cousin Tony & his kids,
nights of sleepovers & pizza,
PlayStation on a 40-inch TV,
the night he & Lil Jesse sneaked 
bumps of coke in the bathroom
& I rubbed numb my teenage teeth.

I remember El Musico,
not the chubby man clutching his guitarra
but my brother Dave loading crates
of records & a dual turntable case
like a coffin into the back of a van,
the same set I hit my back on at ten
when I fell out of the top bunk bed.

But I prefer to remember La Sirena
back when her breasts were free
of the seashells she now holds
to cover them in water so blue 
 cold, her scales so red,
her name clung to the tongue
like dulce de leche.






GTA: San Andreas (or, "Grove Street, bitch!)
 

I play on Grove Street,
live on Grove Avenue.

Find me in the streets dressed
in greens like groves.

On the avenue, I'm a blue
jeans type of guy.

In the streets, never leave
home w/out my 9mm.

On the avenue, always carry
my pen & wine key, in case

some fool blows his cork.
My UZI sings songs in

the streets--rat-a-tat-tat.
Birds chirp-chirp-chirp

in trees on the avenue.
Rolling down the street

w/my lady--what she wanna do?
"Let's do a drive-by.

Rushing down the avenue
w/my baby: "I'm hungry.

Let's do drive-thru.
I'll punch punks purple & blue

in the streets, bleed 'em w/bullets.
On the avenue, I'll leave punching

to punks dressed in blues, reds,
et cetera & mind my own.





Blue Line Incident
 

He was just some coked-out,
crazed King w/crooked teeth
 & a teardrop forever falling,
fading from his left eye, peddling
crack to passengers or crackheads
passing as passengers on a train
chugging from Chicago to Cicero,
from the Loop through K-Town:
Kedzie, Kostner, Kildare.
    
I was just a brown boy in a brown shirt,
head shaven w/fuzz on my chin,
staring at treetops & rooftops
seated in a pair of beige shorts:
a badge of possibility--a Bunny
let loose from 26th street,
hopping my way home, hoping
not to get shot, stop after stop.

But a 'banger I wasn't & he wasn't
buying it, sat across the aisle from me:
Do you smoke crack?
Hey, who you ride wit'?
Are you a D'?
Let me see--throw it down then.

I hesitate then fork three fingers down
then boast about my block,
a recent branch in the Kings growing tree;
the boys of 15th and 51st, I say,
they're my boys, my friends.
I was fishing for a life-
saver & he took, hooked him in
& had him say goodbye like we was boys
 & shit when really I should've
gutted that fuck w/the tip
of my blue ballpoint.





Southern Gothic
 

About the dead having available to them
all breeds of knowledge,
some pure, others wicked, especially what is
future, and the history that remains 
once the waters recede, revealing the land 
that couldn't reject or contain it, and the land 
that is not new, is indigo, is ancient, lived 
as all the trees that fit and clothe it are lived, 
simple pine, oak, grand magnolia, he said 
they frighten him, that what they hold in their silences 
silences: sometimes a boy will slip 
from his climbing, drown but the myth knows why,
sometimes a boy will swing with the leaves.





Swing Low
 

We aren't the solid men.
       We bend like the number seven. 
Dig at corners, eat cobwebs, we
      are barefoot and bare-legged.
      We hang like leaves in autumn.

We aren't the stolid men.
      We scribble in familiar ink
about sunfalls and night. We
      see the white in the sky, and sigh.
      We lie with penciled grins.

We aren't the men, any men.
      We rip at the neck and wonder why 
while rattlers roll in. Bent 
      as a number, crooked, sundered,
      we aren't the idle lightning 

if black thunder.





You Are Not Christ
 

New Orleans, Louisiana
For the drowning, yes, there is always panic.
Or peace. Your body behaving finally by instinct
alone. Crossing out wonder. Crossing out
a need to know. You only feel you need to live.
That you deserve it. Even here. Even as your chest
fills with a strange new air, you will not ask 
what this means. Like prey caught in the wolf's teeth,
but you are not the lamb. You are what's in the lamb 
that keeps it kicking. Let it.





Protector #2 Your Personal Amulet
 

This sonnet is your personal amulet
 To be worn in instance of need
 Or constantly held in the mind
 Occurring here and elsewhere at this moment
 This sonnet is sent without cunning
 To cull a particular phrase from your lips
 To enlist another protector
 In this age of malcontent benefactors
 Against an ironclad schooner
 Feudal kingdom
 Dismemberment by jubilant crowds
 Strangely indifferent faces
 Heat and dust besides
 Suicide implicating others





pantoum: landing, 1976
 

dreaming the lives of the ancestors,
 you awake, justly terrified of this world:
 you could dance underwater and not get wet,
 you hear, but the pressure is drowning you:
  
 you're awake, but just terrified of this world,
 where all solids are ice: underwater boogie,
 you hear, but the press sure is drowning you:
the igbo were walking, not dancing:

where all solids are ice, underwater boogie
is good advice, because they're quick to melt:
 the igbo were straight up walking, not dancing:
 and you've still got to get through this life:
  
 take my advice, quickly: they're melting:
 you could dance underwater and not get wet:
 and you've got to, to get through this life still
 dreaming the lives of the ancestors





To fight aloud is very brave - (138)
 

To fight aloud, is very brave - 
But gallanter, I know
Who charge within the bosom
The Calvary of Wo - 

Who win, and nations do not see - 
Who fall - and none observe - 
Whose dying eyes, no Country
Regards with patriot love - 

We trust, in plumed procession
For such, the Angels go -
Rank after Rank, with even feet -
And Uniforms of snow.





Three Hundred Thousand More
 

We are coming, Father Abraham, three hundred thousand more, 
 From Mississippi's winding stream, and from New England's shore; 
 We leave our ploughs and workshops, our wives and children dear, 
 With hearts too full for utterance, with but a silent tear; 
 We dare not look behind us, but steadfastly before: 
 We are coming, Father Abraham, three hundred thousand more!
  
 If you look across the hill tops that meet the Northern sky, 
 Long moving lines of rising dust your vision may descry; 
 And now the wind, an instant, tears the cloudy vail aside, 
 And floats aloft our spangled flag, in glory and in pride, 
 And bayonets in the sunlight gleam, and bands brave music pour: 
 We are coming Father Abraham, three hundred thousand more!
  
 If you look all up your valleys, where the growing harvests shine, 
 You may see our sturdy farmer boys, fast forming into line; 
 And children from their mothers' knees, are pulling at the weeds, 
 And learning how to reap and sow against their country's needs; 
 And a farewell group stands weeping at every cottage door: 
 We are coming, Father Abraham, three hundred thousand more!
  
 You have called us, and we're coming, by Richmond's bloody tide 
 To lay us down, for freedom's sake, our brother's bones beside; 
 Or from foul treason's savage group to wrench the murderous blade, 
 And in the face of foreign foes its fragments to parade; 
 Six hundred thousand loyal men and true have gone before: 
 We are coming, Father Abraham, three hundred thousand more!







Weep
 

Weep for the country in its present state,
And of the gloom which still the future waits;
The proud confederate eagle heard the sound,
And with her flight fell prostrate to the ground!

Weep for the loss the country has sustained,
By which her now dependent is in jail;
The grief of him who now the war survived,
The conscript husbands and the weeping wives!

Weep for the seas of blood the battle cost,
And souls that ever hope forever lost!
The ravage of the field with no recruit,
Trees by the vengeance blasted to the root!

Weep for the downfall o'er your heads and chief,
Who sunk without a medium of relief;
Who fell beneath the hatchet of their pride,
Then like the serpent bit themselves and died!

Weep for the downfall of your president,
Who far too late his folly must repent;
Who like the dragon did all heaven assail,
And dragged his friends to limbo with his tail!

Weep o'er peculiar swelling coffers void,
Our treasures left, and all their banks destroyed;
Their foundless notes replete with shame to all,
Expecting every day their final fall,
In quest of profit never to be won,
Then sadly fallen and forever down!





 shall become as 
 

            you put this pen
 in my hand and you
 take the pen from
             my hand. the night
 before the full moon
  
             the moon seems
 full. what is missing
 is a dark hungry
             sickle, the sliver
 of shadow eating
  
             us up inside. after
 the mountains breathe
 their mint-and-sorrow
             green against the long
 summer sky, they burst
  
             into hot october
 laughter, lighting
 the horizon with citrus,
             rust, and blood. you
 put this knife in my
             
             hand. we pull. we
 meet as oceans come
 together, heaving
             against and clinging
 across our salt watery
  
             boundary. we approach
 endlessly like two rails 
 of one track, tied
             in a parallel that
 promises our eyes to
  
             merge, someplace far
 off in the distance. you
 put this feather in my
             palm. my fingers
 close around flight.





lifeline
 

wedged in the top branches, rain still sighing
             to earth as a dissolute sky dissolves,
 a mozambican woman turns mother,
             her water breaking loose to pool with the flood
  
 licking the trunk below, a country-sized
             puddle calls forth the child whose name, the mother
 vowed, would not be drowned, no matter how
             high she had to climb. my mother's water
  
 washed her bare yellow bathroom tile many
             years ago, a diluvial warning
 of my struggle to arrive. we fought to
             get me out, and have been tugging at each
  
 other ever since, tethered by a cord
             that simply thickens when it's cut. we
 descended then, thirsting, churning, not into
             the waters that hound the mozambican
  
 mother, baying her and her baby in
             the tree, but into that enduring ocean
 in which--as mother, daughter, or both--a
             woman's only choices are drink or swim.





waiting on the mayflower
 

"what, to the american slave, is your 4th of july?--frederick douglass
i.  august 1619
  
 arrived in a boat, named
 and unnamed, twenty, pirated
  
 away from a portuguese
 slaver, traded for victuals.
  
 drowned in this land of fresh,
 volatile clearings and folk
  
 with skin like melted
 cowrie shells. soon shedding
  
 servitude. soon reaping
 talents sown on african soil.
  
 after indenture, christians,
 colonists. not english, but
  
 not yet not-white. antoney
 and isabella, whose marriage
  
 stretched the short shadows
 of america's early afternoon
  
 into the dusky reaches of evening,
 whose conjugal coitus spent
  
 first the choice coin of africa
 on rough virginian citizenship,
  
 baptized their son, william,
 into the church of england.
  
  
 ii.  december 1638
  
 fear must have shuddered
 into boston on the backs
  
 of true believers--men and
 women of an unadorned god--
  
 deep in the heavy black fabric
 of their coats and dresses like
  
 a stench. black a mark of
 pride they wore as if branded,
  
 never dreaming they could
 take it off. envy anticipated
  
 their advent. glittered at them,
 settling in, from the knife
  
 blades of the massachusetts.
 seeped like low-pitched
  
 humming from the fur
 lining the natives' warm
  
 blankets. but desire docked
 in 1638. in from the harbor
  
 flocked a people whose eyes
 sparked like stars, even near
  
 death. whose hair promised
 a mixture of cotton and river
  
 water and vines, a texture
 the fingers ached for. who
  
 wholly inhabited a skin the
 midnight color of grace
  
 that clarified the hue of the
 pilgrims' woolen weeds. fear
  
 and envy claimed pride of place,
 put desire's cargo to good use.
  
  
 iii.  march 1770
  
 that night, crispus attucks
 dreamed. how he'd attacked
  
 his would-be master and fled
 in wild-eyed search of self-
  
 determination. discarded
 virginia on the run and ran
  
 out of breath in salt-scented
 boston. found there, if not
  
 freedom, fearlessness. a belief
 in himself that rocked things
  
 with the uncontrolled power
 of the muscular atlantic, power
  
 to cradle, to capsize. awoke
 angry again at the planter
  
 who'd taken him for a mule
 or a machine. had shouldered
  
 a chip the size of concord
 by the time the redcoat dared
  
 to dare him. died wishing he'd
 amassed such revolutionary
  
 ire in virginia. died dreaming
 great britain was the enemy.
  
  
 iv.  july 4th: last
       but not least
  
 17-, 18-, 19-76 and still
 this celebration's shamed
  
 with gunpowder and words
 that lie like martyrs in cold
  
 blood. africa's descendents,
 planting here year after year
  
 the seeds of labor, sweating
 bullets in this nation's warts,
  
 have harvested the rope,
 the rape, the ghetto, the cell,
  
 the fire, the flood, and the
 blame for you-name-it. so
  
 today black folks barbeque
 ribs and smother the echoes
  
 of billie's strange song in
 sauces. drink gin. gladly
  
 holiday to heckle speeches
 on tv. pretend to parade.
  
 turn out in droves for distant
 detonations, chaos, controlled
  
 as always, but directed
 away from us tonight. stare
  
 into the mirror of the sky
 at our growing reflection,
  
 boggled by how america
 gawks at the passing pinpoints
  
 of flame, but overlooks the vast,
 ebony palm giving them shape.

Naked in the Ditches
 

phlegmatic on my bier
 no regrets--my body bears
 truth stem to stern

A Small Anatomy of Feeling
 

That which installs itself in the mind embraces sound
  
 Rebounding,
                          rounding the fecund earth
  
 Birth, as in what is not, as in one makes one,
                                                      is a mighty absence to understand
  
 (and there are those who fail to get their lessons done)
  
 Dun is the color of submission
  
 Unfledged, she leafs through what has been nothing never
 Never to be what she is/ or could /or hope to be
 Bewitched by dictions (fictions) on the surface--
  
 Face naming that which she must save, polished like an apple--
  
 Apple of the eye, amour of town and street, apple of the cheek
 Eaten with a dab of honey for a sweet year
  
 Ear to who am I in the suddenly-arriving what-comes-next
 Next to being, next to delivery, next to undergone
 Gone parenthetical but now revived as her eye
 Spies the sudden trespass of his unexpected welcome--
  
 Succumbing, coming unto him in full sun this morning
  
 Mourning what she need not beguile or lie beside





from A Treatise on Painting
 

. . . some days ago I saw the picture of an Angel who, in making the Annunciation, seemed to be trying to chase Mary out of her room with movements showing the sort of attack one might make on some hated enemy; and Mary, as if desperate, seemed to be trying to throw herself out of the window. Do not fall into errors like these.                                                                                                   -- Leonardo da Vinci
It is time to speak of the lies
             of images, omissions, insertions--
  
             imitations of reality,
  
                         but whose reality, Leonardo?
  
      For you she's in nature--
  
                  you've lavished so much attention
                                       on rock formations along your raised horizon
                  varieties of grass in the lawn
                  cloud convocations
  
                           and the shadow the archangel casts
             obliterating most of what's imagined growing there
  
                         and she, lovely, composed--"great grace of shadows and of lights is added 
to the faces of those who sit beside the darkness of brown plasterwork--her right arm
 almost deformed, too far forward,
  
                         reaching out at an impossible angle--
  
                                                 FOR WHAT
  
 --Botticelli, Campin, van Eyck--for you
  
 she's indoors all decked out in luscious silk and satin,
 surrounded by finery--tied-back drapery, carved benches,
 a rug or tiled floor, loggias
 and archways beyond her wildest ken
 windows revealing hortus conclusi and winding paths
               slogging toward the sea

And what of all those blues and golds, so rife with wealth
  
             in her life there's only red from madder juice
             and yellow from kaolin clay
                         and a linen shift all frayed
  
 The truth also is a small opening high up on the wall
 A floor that's hard-packed dirt
 And beyond the room, villagers working the fields,
 donkeys dragging threshing boards over newly harvested wheat
  
             AND EVERYWHERE, INSIDE AND OUT, WORLD-MOTHETING DUST
  
                                          For all of you
 this is an event reduced to a book she cannot read
 a lily she does not smell
 a lectern she never owned
  
 She might as well comb her hair with a stiletto heel
 Make of her body a cloud of white tulle
 Carry a watering can and wear shapely wooden clogs
 Fake glamour in a black bare-back gown
 Crouch on the ground flipping coins
 Pop a pogo stick between her legs and levitate
  
                           SHE COULD BE ANYONE            ANYWHERE             ANYTIME

 bored to death, the intercom

 drown her in their soft pile,
  
 snuff out any NO she stashes in her mind,
 or the wind could whip his feathers
 and blow the townsfolk quickly to her side
  
           (Today, she knows no one will arrive in time . . . )
  
           Certainly not those people tending their gardens,
                       (as if anyone had topiary trees
                                as Rogier van der Weyden (possibly Memling) shows

 In his eyes, pools of light map no pollution, only flame
 In hers, no flecks, no threads mar the cobalt calm

                                               SHE'S GOT A CHOICE AFTER ALL
  
  
 For the child she will have boundless love
  
 For posterity the memory of being
  
 For her life no proper translation





Christmas Mail
 

Cards in each mailbox, 
angel, manger, star and lamb, 
as the rural carrier, 
driving the snowy roads, 
hears from her bundles 
the plaintive bleating of sheep, 
the shuffle of sandals, 
the clopping of camels. 
At stop after stop, 
she opens the little tin door 
and places deep in the shadows 
the shepherds and wise men, 
the donkeys lank and weary, 
the cow who chews and muses. 
And from her Styrofoam cup, 
white as a star and perched 
on the dashboard, leading her 
ever into the distance, 
there is a hint of hazelnut, 
and then a touch of myrrh.







The Birth of John Henry
 

 
  The night John Henry is born an ax
         of lightning splits the sky,
  and a hammer of thunder pounds the earth,
     and the eagles and panthers cry!

     John Henry--he says to his Ma and Pa:
         "Get a gallon of barleycorn.
     I want to start right, like a he-man child,
         the night that I am born!

  Says: "I want some ham hocks, ribs, and jowls, 
         a pot of cabbage and greens;
     some hoecakes, jam, and buttermilk,
         a platter of pork and beans!

     John Henry's Ma--she wrings her hands,
         and his Pa--he scratches his head.
     John Henry--he curses in giraffe-tall words, 
         flops over, and kicks down the bed.

     He's burning mad, like a bear on fire--
         so he tears to the riverside.
 As he stoops to drink, Old Man River gets scared
         and runs upstream to hide!

     Some say he was born in Georgia--O Lord!
         Some say in Alabam.
  But it's writ on the rock at the Big Bend Tunnel:
     "Lousyana was my home. So scram!





Satchmo
 

  
                     King Oliver of New Orleans
         has kicked the bucket, but he left behind
              old Satchmo with his red-hot horn
                to syncopate the heart and mind.
                  The honky-tonks in Storyville
       have turned to ashes, have turned to dust,
                 but old Satchmo is still around
         like Uncle Sam's IN GOD WE TRUST.
  
               Where, oh, where is Bessie Smith,
       with her heart as big as the blues of truth?
           Where, oh, where is Mister Jelly Roll, 
           with his Cadillac and diamond tooth?
              Where, oh, where is Papa Handy
  With his blue notes a-dragging from bar to bar?
       Where, oh where is bulletproof Leadbelly
          with his tall tales and 12-string guitar?
  
                                Old Hip Cats,
              when you sang and played the blues
                    the night Satchmo was born,
       did you know hypodermic needles in Rome
         couldn't hoodoo him away from his horn?
          Wyatt Earp's legend, John Henry's, too,
              is a dare and a bet to old Satchmo
  when his groovy blues put headlines in the news
            from the Gold Coast to cold Moscow.
  
                                 Old Satchmo's
    gravelly voice and tapping foot and crazy notes
                             set my soul on fire.
                                   If I climbed
           the seventy-seven steps of the Seventh
  Heaven, Satchmo's high C would carry me higher!
         Are you hip to this, Harlem? Are you hip?
              On Judgment Day, Gabriel will say
                       after he blows his horn:
   "I'd be the greatest trumpeter in the Universe
          if old Satchmo had never been born!





East Rivers Charm
 

Is this the river East I heard?--
 Where the ferries, tugs and sailboats stirred
 And the reaching wharves from the inner land
 Ourstretched, like the harmless receiving hand--
  
 And the silvery tinge that sparkles aloud
 Like the brilliant white demons, which a tide has towed
 From the rays of the morning sun
 Which it doth ceaselessly shine upon.
  
 But look at the depth of the drippling tide
 The dripples, reripples like the locusts astride;
 As the boat turns upon the silvery spread
 It leaves--strange--a shadow dead.
  
 And the very charms from the reflective river
 And from the stacks of the floating boat--
 There seemeth the quality ne'er to dissever
 Like the ruffles from the mystified smoke.





Conduct
 

By a peninsula the painter sat and
 Sketched the uneven valley groves.
 The apostle gave alms to the
 Meek. The volcano burst
 In fusive sulphur and hurled 
 Rocks and ore into the air--
 Heaven's sudden change at
 The drawing tempestuous,
 Darkening shade of dense clouded hues.
 The wanderer soon chose
 His spot of rest; they bore the 
 Chosen hero upon their shoulders,
 Whom they strangely admired, as
 The beach-tide summer of people desired.





The Glass Bubbles
 

The motion of gathering loops of water
 Must either burst or remain in a moment.
 The violet colors through the glass
 Throw up little swellings that appear
 And spatter as soon as another strikes
 And is born; so pure are they of colored
 Hues, that we feel the absent strength
 Of its power. When they begin they gather
 Like sand on the beach: each bubble
 Contains a complete eye of water.





The Nineteenth of April
 

This year, till late in April, the snow fell thick and light:
 Thy truce-flag, friendly Nature, in clinging drifts of white,
 Hung over field and city: now everywhere is seen,
 In place of that white quietness, a sudden glow of green.
  
 The verdure climbs the Common, beneath the leafless trees,
 To where the glorious Stars and Stripes are floating on the breeze.
 There, suddenly as Spring awoke from Winter's snow-draped gloom,
 The Passion-Flower of Seventy-six is bursting into bloom.
  
 Dear is the time of roses, when earth to joy is wed,
 And garden-plot and meadow wear one generous flush of red;
 But now in dearer beauty, to her ancient colors true,
 Blooms the old town of Boston in red and white and blue.
  
 Along the whole awakening North are those bright emblems spread;
 A summer noon of patriotism is burning overhead:
 No party badges flaunting now, no word of clique or clan;
 But "Up for God and Union! is the shout of every man.
  
 Oh, peace is dear to Northern hearts; our hard-earned homes more dear;
 But freedom is beyond the price of any earthly cheer;
 And freedom's flag is sacred; he who would work it harm,
 Let him, although a brother, beware our strong right arm!
  
 A brother! ah, the sorrow, the anguish of that word!
 The fratricidal strife begun, when will its end be heard?
 Not this the boon that patriot hearts have prayed and waited for;--
 We loved them, and we longed for peace: but they would have it war.
  
 Yes; war! on this memorial day, the day of Lexington,
 A lightning-thrill along the wires from heart to heart has run.
 Brave men we gazed on yesterday, to-day for us have bled:
 Again is Massachusetts blood the first for Freedom shed.
  
 To war,--and with our brethren, then,--if only this can be!
 Life hangs as nothing in the scale against dear Liberty!
 Though hearts be torn asunder, for Freedom we will fight:
 Our blood may seal the victory, but God will shield the Right!





The Picket-Guard
 

"All quiet along the Potomac, they say,
       "Except, now and then, a stray picket
 Is shot as he walks on his beat to and fro,
       By a rifleman hid in the thicket.
 'Tis nothing--a private or two, now and then,
       Will not count in the news of the battle;
 Not an officer lost--only one of the men
       Moaning out, all alone, his death-rattle.
  
                         *    *    *    *    *    *
  
 All quiet along the Potomac to-night,
       Where the soldiers lie peacefully dreaming;
 Their tents, in the rays of the clear autumn moon
       Or the light of the watch-fire, are gleaming.
 A tremulous sigh, as the gentle night-wind
       Through the forest-leaves softly is creeping;
 While stars up above, with their glittering eyes,
       Keep guard--for the army is sleeping.
  
 There's only the sound of the lone sentry's tread,
       As he tramps from the rock to the fountain,
 And thinks of the two in the low trundle-bed
       Far away in the cot on the mountain.
 His musket falls slack--his face, dark and grim,
       Grows gentle with memories tender,
 As he mutters a prayer for the children asleep--
       For their mother--may Heaven defend her!
  
 The moon seems to shine just as brightly as then,
       That night, when the love yet unspoken
 Leaped up to his lips--when low-murmured vows
       Were pledged to be ever unbroken.
 Then drawing his sleeve roughly over his eyes,
       He dashes off tears that are welling,
 And gathers his gun closer up to its place,
       As if to keep down the heart-swelling.
  
 He passes the fountain, the blasted pine-tree,
       The footstep is lagging and weary;
 Yet onward he goes, through the broad belt of light,
       Toward the shade of the forest so dreary.
 Hark! was it the night-wind that rustled the leaves?
       Was it moonlight so suddenly flashing?
 It looked life a rifle--"Ha! Mary, good-by!
       And the life-blood is ebbing and plashing.
  
 All quiet along the Potomac to-night,
       No sound save the rush of the river;
 While soft falls the dew on the face of the dead--
       The picket's off duty forever!





A Thought
 

Falling leaves and falling men!
     When the snows of winter fall,
 And the winds of winter blows,
     Will be woven Nature's pall.
  
 Let us, then, forsake our dead;
     For the dead will surely wait
 While we rush upon the foe,
     Eager for the hero's fate.
  
 Leaves will come upon the trees;
     Spring will show the happy race;
 Mothers will give birth to sons--
     Loyal souls to fill our place.
  
 Wherefore should we rest and rush?
     Soldiers, we must fight and save
 Freedom now, and give our foes
     All their country should--a grave!





Weaving
 

All day she stands before her loom;
     The flying shuttles come and go:
 By grassy fields, and trees in bloom,
     She sees the winding river flow:
 And fancy's shuttle flieth wide,
 And faster than the waters glide.
  
 Is she entangled in her dreams,
     Like that fair-weaver of Shalott,
 Who left her mystic mirror's gleams,
     To gaze on light Sir Lancelot?
 Her heart, a mirror sadly true,
 Brings gloomier visions into view.
  
 "I weave, and weave, the livelong day:
     The woof is strong, the warp is good:
 I weave, to be my mother's stay;
     I weave, to win my daily food:
 But ever as I weave, saith she,
 "The world of women haunteth me.
  
 "The river glides along, one thread
     In nature's mesh, so beautiful!
 The stars are woven in; the red
     Of sunrise; and the rain-cloud dull.
 Each seems a separate wonder wrought;
 Each blends with some more wondrous thought.
  
 "So, at the loom of life, we weave
     Our separate shreds, that varying fall,
 Some strained, some fair: and, passing, leave
     To God the gathering up of all,
 In that full pattern wherein man
 Works blindly out the eternal plan.
  
 "In his vast work, for good or ill,
     The undone and the done he blends:
 With whatsoever woof we fill,
     To our weak hands His might He lends,
 And gives the threads beneath His eye
 The texture of eternity.
  
 "Wind on, by willow and by pine,
     Thou blue, untroubled Merrimack!
 Afar, by sunnier streams than thine,
     My sisters toil, with foreheads black;
 And water with their blood this root,
 Whereof we gather bounteous fruit.
  
 "There be sad women, sick and poor:
     And those who walk in garments soiled:
 Their shame, their sorrow, I endure;
     By their defect my hope is foiled:
 The blot they bear is on my name;
 Who sins, and I am not to blame?
  
 "And how much of your wrong is mine,
     Dark women slaving at the South?
 Of your stolen grapes I quaff the wine;
     The bread you starve for fills my mouth:
 The beam unwinds, but every thread
 With blood of strangled souls is red.
  
 "If this be so, we win and wear
     A Nessus-robe of poisoned cloth;
 Or weave them shrouds they may not wear,--
     Fathers and brothers falling both
 On ghastly, death-sown fields, that lie
 Beneath the tearless Southern sky.
  
 "Alas! the weft has lost its white.
     It grows a hideous tapestry,
 That pictures war's abhorrent sight:--
     Unroll not, web of destiny!
 Be the dark volume left unread,--
 The tale untold,--the curse unsaid!
  
 So up and down before her loom
     She paces on, and to and fro,
 Till sunset fills the dusty room,
     And makes the water redly glow,
 As if the Merrimack's calm flood
 Were changed into a stream of blood.
  
 Too soon fulfilled, and all too true
     The words she murmured as she wrought:
 But, weary weaver, not to you
     Alone was war's stern message brought:
 "Woman! it knelled from heart to heart,
 "Thy sister's keeper know thou art!





The Black Regiment
 

Dark as the clouds of even,
 Ranked in the western heaven,
 Waiting the breath that lifts
 All the dread mass, and drifts
 Tempest and falling brand
 Over a ruined land;--
 So still and orderly,
 Arm to arm, knee to knee,
 Waiting the great event,
 Stands the Black Regiment.
  
 Down the long dusky line
 Teeth gleam and eyeballs shine;
 And the bright bayonet,
 Bristling and firmly set,
 Flashed with a purpose grand,
 Long ere the sharp command
 Of the fierce rolling drum
 Told them their time had come,
 Told them what work was sent
 For the Black Regiment.
  
 "Now, the flag-sergeant cried,
 "Though death and hell betide,
 Let the whole nation see
 If we are fit to be
 Free in this land; or bound
 Down, like the whining hound,--
 Bound with red stripes of pain
 In our old chains again!
 Oh, what a shout there went
 From the Black Regiment!
  
 "Charge! Trump and drum awoke,
 Onward the bondmen broke;
 Bayonet and sabre-stroke
 Vainly opposed their rush.
 Through the wild battle's crush,
 With but one thought aflush,
 Driving their lords like chaff,
 In the guns' mouths they laugh;
 Or at the slippery brands
 Leaping with open hands,
 Down they tear man and horse,
 Down in their awful course;
 Tramping with bloody heel
 Over the crashing steel,
 All their eyes forward bent,
 Rushed the Black Regiment.
  
 "Freedom! their battle-cry--
 "Freedom! or leave to die!
 Ah! And they meant the word,
 Not as with us 'tis heard,
 Not a mere party shout:
 They gave their spirits out;
 Trusted the end to God,
 And on the gory sod
 Rolled in triumphant blood.
  
 Glad to strike one free blow,
 Whether for weal or woe;
 Glad to breathe one free breath,
 Though on the lips of death.
 Praying--alas! in vain!--
 That they might fall again,
 So they could once more see
 That burst to liberty!
 This was what "freedom lent
 To this Black Regiment.
  
 Hundreds on hundreds fell;
 But they are resting well;
 Scourges and shackles strong
 Never shall do them wrong.
  
 Oh, to the living few,
 Soldiers, be just and true!
 Hail them as comrades tried;
 Fight with them side by side;
 Never, in field or tent,
 Scorn the Black Regiment.





In the Wilderness
 

Mangled, uncared for, suffering thro' the night
     With heavenly patience the poor boy had lain;
 Under the dreary shadows, left and right,
     Groaned on the wounded, stiffened out the slain.
       What faith sustained his lone,
       Brave heart to make no moan,
 To send no cry from that blood-sprinkled sod,
 Is a close mystery with him and God.
  
 But when the light came, and the morning dew
     Glittered around him, like a golden lake,
 And every dripping flower with deepened hue
     Looked through its tears for very pity's sake,
       He moved his aching head
       Upon his rugged bed,
 And smiled as a blue violet, virgin-meek,
 Laid her pure kiss upon his withered cheek.
  
 At once there circled in his waking heart
     A thousand memories of distant home;
 Of how those same blue violets would start
     Along his native fields, and some would roam
       Down his dear humming brooks,
       To hide in secret nooks,
 And, shyly met, in nodding circles swing,
 Like gossips murmuring at belated Spring.
  
 And then he thought of the beloved hands
     That with his own had plucked the modest flower.
 The blue-eyed maiden, crowned with golden bands,
     Who ruled as sovereign of that sunny hour.
       She at whose soft command
       He joined the mustering band,
 She for whose sake he lay so firm and still,
 Despite his pangs, not questioned then her will.
  
 So, lost in thought, scarce conscious of the deed,
     Culling the violets, here and there he crept
 Slowly--ah! slowly,--for his wound would bleed;
     And the sweet flowers themselves half smiled, half wept,
       To be thus gathered in
       By hands so pale and thin,
 By fingers trembling as they neatly laid
 Stem upon stem, and bound them in a braid.
  
 The strangest posy ever fashioned yet
     Was clasped against the bosom of the lad,
 As we, the seekers for the wounded, set
     His form upon our shoulders bowed and sad;
       Though he but seemed to think
       How violets nod and wink;
 And as we cheered him, for the path was wild,
 He only looked upon his flowers and smiled.





[Sonnet]
 

Brave comrade, answer! When you joined the war,
     What left you? "Wife and children, wealth and friends,
     A storied home whose ancient roof-tree bends
     Above such thoughts as love tells o'er and o'er.
 Had you no pang or struggle? "Yes; I bore
     Such pain on parting as at hell's gate rends
     The entering soul, when from its grasp ascends
     The last faint virtue which on earth it wore.
 You loved your home, your kindred, children, wife;
     You loathed yet plunged into war's bloody whirl!--
     What urged you? "Duty! Something more than life.
 That which made Abraham bare the priestly knife,
     And Isaac kneel, or that young Hebrew girl
     Who sought her father coming from the strife.





The Death of Lincoln
 

Oh, slow to smite and swift to spare,
 Gentle and merciful and just!
 Who, in the fear of God, didst bear
 The sword of power, a nation's trust!
  
 In sorrow by thy bier we stand,
 Amid the awe that hushes all,
 And speak the anguish of a land
 That shook with horror at thy fall.
  
 Thy task is done; the bond are free:
 We bear thee to an honored grave,
 Whose proudest monument shall be
 The broken fetters of the slave.
  
 Pure was thy life; its bloody close
 Hath placed thee with the sons of light,
 Among the noble host of those
 Who perished in the cause of Right.





The Southern Refugee
 

What sudden ill the world await,
     From my dear residence I roam;
 I must deplore the bitter fate,
     To straggle from my native home.
  
 The verdant willow droops her head,
     And seems to bid a fare thee well;
 The flowers with tears their fragrance shed,
     Alas! their parting tale to tell.
  
'Tis like the loss of Paradise,
     Or Eden's garden left in gloom,
 Where grief affords us no device;
     Such is thy lot, my native home.
  
 I never, never shall forget
     My sad departure far away,
 Until the sun of life is set,
     And leaves behind no beam of day.
  
 How can I from my seat remove
     And leave my ever devoted home,
 And the dear garden which I love,
     The beauty of my native home?
  
 Alas! sequestered, set aside,
     It is a mournful tale to tell;
 'Tis like a lone deserted bride
     That bade her bridegroom fare thee well.
  
 I trust I soon shall dry the tear
     And leave forever hence to roam,
 Far from a residence so dear,
     The place of beauty--my native home.





Lincoln Is Dead
 

He is gone, the strong base of the nation,
     The dove to his covet has fled;
 Ye heroes lament his privation,
     For Lincoln is dead.
  
 He is gone down, the sun of the Union,
     Like Phoebus, that sets in the west;
 The planet of peace and communion,
     Forever has gone to his rest.
  
 He is gone down from a world of commotion,
     No equal succeeds in his stead;
 His wonders extend with the ocean,
     Whose waves murmur, Lincoln is dead.
  
 He is gone and can ne'er be forgotten,
     Whose great deeds eternal shall bloom;
 When gold, pearls and diamonds are rotten,
     His deeds will break forth from the tomb.
  
 He is gone out of glory to glory,
     A smile with the tear may be shed,
 O, then let us tell the sweet story,
     Triumphantly, Lincoln is dead.





Like Brothers We Meet
 

Dedicated to the Federal and Late Confederate Soldiers
Like heart-loving brothers we meet,
     And still the loud thunders of strife,
 The blaze of fraternity kindles most sweet,
     There's nothing more pleasing in life.
  
 The black cloud of faction retreats,
     The poor is no longer depressed,
 See those once discarded resuming their seats,
     The lost strangers soon will find rest.
  
 The soldier no longer shall roam,
     But soon shall land safely ashore,
 Each soon will arrive at his own native home,
     And struggle in warfare no more.
  
 The union of brothers is sweet,
     Whose wives and children do come,
 Their sons and fair daughters with pleasure they greet,
     When long absent fathers come home.
  
 They never shall languish again,
     Nor discord their union shall break,
 When brothers no longer lament and complain,
     Hence never each other forsake.
  
 Hang closely together like friends,
     By peace killing foes never driven,
 The storm of commotion eternally ends,
     And earth will soon turn into Heaven.





Malvern Hill
 

(July, 1862)
Ye elms that wave on Malvern Hill
      In prime of morn and May,
 Recall ye how McClellan's men
      Here stood at bay?
 While deep within yon forest dim
      Our rigid comrades lay--
 Some with the cartridge in their mouth,
 Others with fixed arms lifted South--
             Invoking so
 The cypress glades? Ah wilds of woe!
  
 The spires of Richmond, late beheld
      Through rifts in musket-haze,
 Were closed from view in clouds of dust
      On leaf-walled ways,
 Where streamed our wagons in caravan;
      And the Seven Nights and Days
 Of march and fast, retreat and fight,
 Pinched our grimed faces to ghastly plight--
             Does the elm wood
 Recall the haggard beards of blood?
  
 The battle-smoked flag, with stars eclipsed
      We followed (it never fell!)--
 In silence husbanded our strength--
           Received their yell;
 Till on this slope we patient turned
      With cannon ordered well;
 Reverse we proved was not defeat;
 But ah, the sod what thousands meet!--
                Does Malvern Wood
 Bethink itself, and muse and brood?
  
                         We elms of Malvern Hill
                              Remember every thing;
                         But sap the twig will fill;
                         Wag the world how it will,
                              Leaves must be green in Spring.





The House-top
 

A Night Piece        (July, 1863)
No sleep. The sultriness pervades the air
 And binds the brain--a dense oppression, such
 As tawny tigers feel in matted shades,
 Vexing their blood and making apt for ravage.
 Beneath the stars the roofy desert spreads
 Vacant as Libya. All is hushed near by.
 Yet fitfully from far breaks a mixed surf
 Of muffled sound, the atheist roar of riot.
 Yonder, where parching Sirius set in drought
 Balefully glares red Arson--there--and there.
 The town is taken by its rats--ship-rats
 And rats of the wharves. All civil charms
 And priestly spells which late held hearts in awe--
 Fear-bound, subjected to a better sway
 Than sway of self; these like a dream dissolve,
 And man rebounds whole aeons back in nature.
 Hail to the low dull rumble, dull and dead,
 And ponderous drag that shakes the wall.
 Wise Draco comes, deep in the midnight roll
 Of black artillery; he comes, though late;
 In code corroborating Calvin's creed
 And cynic tyrannies of honest kings;
 He comes, nor parlies; and the Town, redeemed,
 Gives thanks devout; nor, being thankful, heeds
 The grimy slur on the Republic's faith implied,
 Which holds that Man is naturally good,
 And--more--is Nature's Roman, never to be scourged.





Sheridan at Cedar Creek
 

(October, 1864)
Shoe the steed with silver
      That bore him to the fray,
 When he heard the guns at dawning--
                Miles away;
 When he heard them calling, calling--
           Mount! nor stay:
                Quick, or all is lost;
                They've surprised and stormed the post,
                They push your routed host--
      Gallop! retrieve the day!
  
 House the horse in ermine--
      For the foam-flake blew
 White through the red October;
      He thundered into view;
 They cheered him in the looming;
      Horseman and horse they knew.
                The turn of the tide began,
                The rally of bugles ran,
                He swung his hat in the van;
      The electric hoof-spark flew.
  
 Wreathe the steed and lead him--
      For the charge he led
 Touched and turned the cypress
      Into amaranths for the head
 Of Philip, king of riders,
      Who raised them from the dead.
                The camp (at dawning lost)
                By eve recovered--forced,
                Rang with laughter of the host
       At belated Early fled.
  
 Shroud the horse in sable--
      For the mounds they heap!
 There is firing in the Valley,
      And yet no strife they keep;
 It is the parting volley,
      It is the pathos deep.
                There is glory for the brave
                Who lead, and nobly save,
                But no knowledge in the grave
      Where the nameless followers sleep.





In the Prison Pen
 

(1864)
Listless he eyes the palisades
      And sentries in the glare;
 'Tis barren as a pelican-beach--
      But his world is ended there.
  
 Nothing to do; and vacant hands
      Bring on the idiot-pain;
 He tries to think--to recollect,
      But the blur is on his brain.
  
 Around him swarm the plaining ghosts
      Like those on Virgil's shore--
 A wilderness of faces dim,
      And pale ones gashed and hoar.
  
 A smiting sun. No shed, no tree;
      He totters to his lair--
 A den that sick hands dug in earth
      Ere famine wasted there,
  
 Or, dropping in his place, he swoons,
      Walled in by throngs that press,
 Till forth from the throngs they bear him dead--
       Dead in his meagerness.





The College Colonel
 

He rides at their head;
     A crutch by his saddle just slants in view,
 One slung arm is in splints, you see,
     Yet he guides his strong steed--how coldly too.
  
 He brings his regiment home--
     Not as they filed two years before,
 But a remnant half-tattered, and battered, and worn,
 Like castaway sailors, who--stunned
           By the surf's loud roar,
     Their mates dragged back and seen no more--
 Again and again breast the surge,
     And at last crawl, spent, to shore.
  
 A still rigidity and pale--
     An Indian aloofness lones his brow;
 He has lived a thousand years
 Compressed in battle's pains and prayers,
     Marches and watches slow.
 There are welcoming shouts, and flags;
     Old men off hat to the Boy,
 Wreaths from gay balconies fall at his feet,
     But to him--there comes alloy.
  
 It is not that a leg is lost,
     It is not that an arm is maimed,
 It is not that the fever has racked--
     Self he has long disclaimed.
  
 But all through the Seven Days' Fight,
     And deep in the Wilderness grim,
 And in the field-hospital tent,
     And Petersburg crater, and dim
 Lean brooding in Libby, there came--
     Ah heaven!--what truth to him.





The Martyr
 

Indicative of the passion of the people on the 15th of April, 1865
Good Friday was the day
     Of the prodigy and crime,
 When they killed him in his pity,
     When they killed him in his prime
 Of clemency and calm--
          When with yearning he was filled
          To redeem the evil-willed,
 And, though conqueror, be kind;
     But they killed him in his kindness,
     In their madness and their blindness,
 And they killed him from behind.
  
               There is sobbing of the strong,
                    And a pall upon the land;
               But the People in their weeping
                                     Bare the iron hand:
               Beware the People weeping
                    When they bare the iron hand.
  
 He lieth in his blood--
     The father in his face;
 They have killed him, the Forgiver--
     The Avenger takes his place,
 The Avenger wisely stern,
          Who in righteousness shall do
          What heavens call him to,
 And the parricides remand;
     For they killed him in his kindness,
     In their madness and their blindness.
 And his blood is on their hand.
  
                     There is sobbing of the strong,
                         And a pall upon the land;
                     But the People in their weeping
                                     Bare the iron hand:
                     Beware the People weeping
                         When they bare the iron hand.





Charleston
 

Calm as that second summer which precedes
        The first fall of the snow,
 In the broad sunlight of heroic deeds,
        The City bides the foe.
  
 As yet, behind their ramparts stern and proud,
        Her bolted thunders sleep--
 Dark Sumter, like a battlemented cloud,
        Looms o'er the solemn deep.
  
 No Calpe frowns from lofty cliff or scar
        To guard the holy strand;
 But Moultrie holds in leash her dogs of war
        Above the level sand.
  
 And down the dunes a thousand guns lie couched,
        Unseen, beside the flood--
 Like tigers in some Orient jungle crouched
         That wait and watch for blood.
  
 Meanwhile, through streets still echoing with trade,
        Walk grave and thoughtful men,
 Whose hands may one day wield the patriot's blade
        As lightly as the pen.
  
 And maidens, with such eyes as would grow dim
        Over a bleeding hound,
 Seem each one to have caught the strength of him
        Whose sword she sadly bound.
  
 Thus girt without and garrisoned at home,
        Day patient following day,
 Old Charleston looks from roof, and spire, and dome,
        Across her tranquil bay.
  
 Ships, through a hundred foes, from Saxon lands
        And spicy Indian ports,
 Bring Saxon steel and iron to her hands,
        And summer to her courts.
  
 But still, along you dim Atlantic line,
        The only hostile smoke
 Creeps like a harmless mist above the brine,
        From some frail, floating oak.
  
 Shall the spring dawn, and she still clad in smiles,
        And with an unscathed brow,
 Rest in the strong arms of her palm-crowned isles,
        As fair and free as now?
  
 We know not; in the temple of the Fates
        God has inscribed her doom;
 And, all untroubled in her faith, she waits
        The triumph or the tomb.





The Two Armies
 

Two armies stand enrolled beneath
 The banner with the starry wreath;
 One, facing battle, blight and blast,
 Through twice a hundred fields has passed;
 Its deeds against a ruffian foe,
 Steam, valley, hill, and mountain know,
 Till every wind that sweeps the land
 Goes, glory laden, from the strand.
  
 The other, with a narrower scope,
 Yet led by not less grand a hope,
 Hath won, perhaps, as proud a place,
 And wears its fame with meeker grace.
 Wives march beneath its glittering sign,
 Fond mothers swell the lovely line,
 And many a sweetheart hides her blush
 In the young patriot's generous flush.
  
 No breeze of battle ever fanned
 The colors of that tender band;
 Its office is beside the bed,
 Where throbs some sick or wounded head.
 It does not court the soldier's tomb,
 But plies the needle and the loom;
 And, by a thousand peaceful deeds,
 Supplies a struggling nation's needs.
  
 Nor is that army's gentle might
 Unfelt amid the deadly fight;
 It nerves the son's, the husband's hand,
 It points the lover's fearless brand;
 It thrills the languid, warms the cold,
 Gives even new courage to the bold;
 And sometimes lifts the veriest clod
 To its own lofty trust in God.
  
 When Heaven shall blow the trump of peace,
 And bid this weary warfare cease,
 Their several missions nobly done,
 The triumph grasped, and freedom won,
 Both armies, from their toils at rest,
 Alike may claim the victor's crest,
 But each shall see its dearest prize
 Gleam softly from the other's eyes.





Flirtation
 

After all, there's no need 
to say anything 

at first. An orange, peeled 
and quartered, flares 

like a tulip on a wedgewood plate 
Anything can happen. 

Outside the sun 
has rolled up her rugs 

and night strewn salt 
across the sky. My heart 

is humming a tune 
I haven't heard in years! 

Quiet's cool flesh-- 
let's sniff and eat it. 

There are ways 
to make of the moment 

a topiary 
so the pleasure's in 

walking through.





A Little Shiver
 

After the news, the forecaster crowed 
With excitement about his bad tidings: 
Eighteen inches of snow! Take cover! 
A little shiver ran through the community. 
Children abandoned their homework. 
Who cared about the hypotenuse now? 
The snowplow driver laid out his long johns. 
The old couple, who'd barked at each other 
At supper, smiled shyly, turned off the TV, 
And climbed the stairs to their queen-size bed 
Heaped high with blankets and quilts.
And the aging husky they failed to hear 
Scratch the back door, turned around twice 
In the yard, settled herself in the snow, 
And covered her nose with her tail.





Up Against It
 

It's the way they cannot understand the window 
they buzz and buzz against, the bees that take 
a wrong turn at my door and end up thus 
in a drift at first of almost idle curiosity, 
cruising the room until they find themselves 
smack up against it and they cannot fathom how 
the air has hardened and the world they know 
with their eyes keeps out of reach as, stuck there 
with all they want just in front of them, they must 
fling their bodies against the one unalterable law 
of things--this fact of glass--and can only go on 
making the sound that tethers their electric
fury to what's impossible, feeling the sting in it.







Dead
 

for Hannah

 The way my daughter sleeps it's as if she's talking
 to the dead. Now she is one. I watch her eyes roll
 backwards in her head, her senses fold
  
 one by one, and then her breathing quiets to a beat.
 Every night she fights this silent way of being
 with all the whining ammunition that she has.
  
 She wins a tired story, a smothered song, the small
 and willful links to life that carry her away.
 Welcome to the Egyptian burial. She's gone to Hades
  
 with her stuffed animals. When she wakes,
 the sad circles disappeared, she blinks
 before she knows me. I have listened
  
 to one million breaths of her. And every night
 my body seizes when she leaves to go
 where I am not, and yet every night I urge her, go.





Talking Back to the Mad World
 

I will not tend. Or water,
 pull, or yank,
 I will not till, uproot,
  
 fill up or spray.
  
 The rain comes.
 Or not. Plants: sun-fed,
 moon-hopped, dirt-stuck.
  
 Watch as flocks
 of wild phlox
  
 appear, disappear. My lazy,
 garbagey magic
 makes this nothing
 happen.
  
 I love
 the tattered
 camisole of
 nothing. The world
 runs its underbrush
 course fed by
 the nothing I give it.
  
 Wars are fought.
 Blood turns.
 Dirt is a wide unruly room.





I Was Just Frosted
 


     Thanks, Ray, this is just what the doctor ordered.
  
      No, you never see me have one with olives--your father likes
 olives but I can't stand them.
  
      No, cocktail onions are just picked small. Turn that down, Dan.
  
             Avocados, toothpicks. Coleus, root sprawl.
             The diffident glints of a late-day sun, rays
             splintered by leaves: they shake and, in their
             shaking, streak the light. Transparent murk
             of glasses at the glass.
  
      Would you move just one inch over? There. The light was in my eye.





Shes a Pill
 


            Oh, dangling long sleeves in the Mercurochrome.
             Parking her punch on her knees.
  
      I'm not a joiner.
  
             In the night, a visitation, small as a thumb,
             enters the sealed house and ascends.
  
      Mother wouldn't have stood for that long. Drippy-drooping around
 on heels. Leaving the blue cheese out.





Elegy for the Native Guards
 

                                        Now that the salt of their blood     Stiffens the saltier oblivion of the sea . . .       --Allen Tate
We leave Gulfport at noon; gulls overhead
 trailing the boat--streamers, noisy fanfare--
 all the way to Ship Island. What we see
 first is the fort, its roof of grass, a lee--
 half reminder of the men who served there--
 a weathered monument to some of the dead.
  
 Inside we follow the ranger, hurried
 though we are to get to the beach. He tells
 of graves lost in the Gulf, the island split
 in half when Hurricane Camille hit,
 shows us casemates, cannons, the store that sells
 souvenirs, tokens of history long buried.
  
 The Daughters of the Confederacy
 has placed a plaque here, at the fort's entrance--
 each Confederate soldier's name raised hard
 in bronze; no names carved for the Native Guards--
 2nd Regiment, Union men, black phalanx.
 What is monument to their legacy?
  
 All the grave markers, all the crude headstones--
 water-lost. Now fish dart among their bones,
 and we listen for what the waves intone.
 Only the fort remains, near forty feet high,
 round, unfinished, half open to the sky,
 the elements--wind, rain--God's deliberate eye.





Incident
 

We tell the story every year--
 how we peered from the windows, shades drawn--
 though nothing really happened,
 the charred grass now green again.
  
 We peered from the windows, shades drawn,
 at the cross trussed like a Christmas tree,
 the charred grass still green. Then
 we darkened our rooms, lit the hurricane lamps.
  
 At the cross trussed like a Christmas tree,
 a few men gathered, white as angels in their gowns.
 We darkened our rooms and lit hurricane lamps,
 the wicks trembling in their fonts of oil.
  
 It seemed the angels had gathered, white men in their gowns.
 When they were done, they left quietly. No one came.
 The wicks trembled all night in their fonts of oil;
 by morning the flames had all dimmed.
  
 When they were done, the men left quietly. No one came.
 Nothing really happened.
 By morning all the flames had dimmed.
 We tell the story every year.





Miscegenation
 

In 1965 my parents broke two laws of Mississippi;
 they went to Ohio to marry, returned to Mississippi.
  
 They crossed the river into Cincinnati, a city whose name
 begins with a sound like sin, the sound of wrong--mis in Mississippi.
  
 A year later they moved to Canada, followed a route the same
 as slaves, the train slicing the white glaze of winter, leaving Mississippi.
  
 Faulkner's Joe Christmas was born in winter, like Jesus, given his name
 for the day he was left at the orphanage, his race unknown in Mississippi.
  
 My father was reading War and Peace when he gave me my name.
 I was born near Easter, 1966, in Mississippi.
  
 When I turned 33 my father said, It's your Jesus year--you're the same
 age he was when he died. It was spring, the hills green in Mississippi.
  
 I know more than Joe Christmas did. Natasha is a Russian name--
 though I'm not; it means Christmas child, even in Mississippi.





Myth
 

I was asleep while you were dying.
 It's as if you slipped through some rift, a hollow
 I make between my slumber and my waking,
  
 the Erebus I keep you in, still trying
 not to let go. You'll be dead again tomorrow,
 but in dreams you live. So I try taking
  
 you back into morning. Sleep-heavy, turning,
 my eyes open, I find you do not follow.
 Again and again, this constant forsaking.
  
 *
  
 Again and again, this constant forsaking:
 my eyes open, I find you do not follow.
 You back into morning, sleep-heavy, turning.
  
 But in dreams you live. So I try taking,
 not to let go. You'll be dead again tomorrow.
 The Erebus I keep you in--still, trying--
  
 I make between my slumber and my waking.
 It's as if you slipped through some rift, a hollow.
 I was asleep while you were dying.





South
 

Homo sapiens is the only species to suffer psychological exile.         --E. O. Wilson
I returned to a stand of pines,
                             bone-thin phalanx
  
 flanking the roadside, tangle
                             of understory--a dialectic of dark
  
 and light--and magnolias blossoming
                             like afterthought: each flower
  
 a surrender, white flags draped
                             among the branches. I returned
  
 to land's end, the swath of coast
                             clear cut and buried in sand:
  
 mangrove, live oak, gulfweed
                             razed and replaced by thin palms--
  
 palmettos--symbols of victory
                             or defiance, over and over
  
 marking this vanquished land. I returned
                             to a field of cotton, hallowed ground--
  
 as slave legend goes--each boll
                             holding the ghosts of generations:
  
 those who measured their days
                             by the heft of sacks and lengths
  
 of rows, whose sweat flecked the cotton plants
                             still sewn into our clothes.
  
 I returned to a country battlefield
                             where colored troops fought and died--
  
 Port Hudson where their bodies swelled
                             and blackened beneath the sun--unburied
  
 until earth's green sheet pulled over them,
                             unmarked by any headstones.
  
 Where the roads, buildings, and monuments
                             are named to honor the Confederacy,
  
 where that old flag still hangs, I return
                             to Mississippi, state that made a crime
  
 of me--mulatto, half-breed--native
                             in my native land, this place they'll bury me.





Theories of Time and Space
 

You can get there from here, though
 there's no going home.
  
 Everywhere you go will be somewhere
 you've never been. Try this:
  
 head south on Mississippi 49, one-
 by-one mile markers ticking off
  
 another minute of your life. Follow this
 to its natural conclusion--dead end
  
 at the coast, the pier at Gulfport where
 riggings of shrimp boats are loose stitches
  
 in a sky threatening rain. Cross over
 the man-made beach, 26 miles of sand
  
 dumped on the mangrove swamp--buried
 terrain of the past. Bring only
  
 what you must carry--tome of memory,
 its random blank pages. On the dock
  
 where you board the boat for Ship Island,
 someone will take your picture:
  
 the photograph--who you were--
 will be waiting when you return.





Father, in Drawer
 

Mouthful of earth, hair half a century silvering, who buried him. 
With what. Make a fist for heart. That is the size of it.
                                                             Also directives from our DNA.
The nature of his wound was the clock-cicada winding down.
                                                            He wound down.
July, vapid, humid: sails of sailboats swelled, yellow boxes
Of cigars from Cuba plumped. Ring fingers fattened for a spell.
                                                            Barges of coal bloomed in heat. 
It was when the catfish were the only fish left living 
                                                            In the Monongahela River. 
Though there were (they swore) no angels left, one was stillbound in 
The very drawer of salt and ache and rendering, its wings wrapped-in
                                                             By the slink from the strap 
Of his second-wife's pearl-satin slip, shimmering and still 
                  As one herring left face-up in its brine and tin.
The nature of his wound was muscadine and terminal; he was easy
                 To take down as a porgy off the cold Atlantic coast. 
                 In the old city of Brod, most of the few Jews left
Living may have been still at supper while he died.
That same July, his daughters' scales came off in every brittle 
                                                            Tinsel color, washing
To the next slow-yellowed river and the next, toward west, 
                                                            Ohio-bound.
                This is the extent of that. I still have plenty heart.





Extreme Wisteria
 

On abandon, uncalled for but called forth.
                                                                              The hydrangea
Of her crushed each year a little more into the attar of herself.

Wistful, woke most every afternoon 
                                In the green rooms of the Abandonarium.
                                                Beautiful cage, asylum in.
Reckless urges to climb celestial trellises that may or may not

So few wild raspberries, they were countable,

Ten-thousand-count Egyptian cotton sheets. Intimacy with others,

There was always the murmur, you remember, about going home.







A Perfect Mess
 

For David Freedman
I read somewhere 
that if pedestrians didn't break traffic laws to cross 
Times Square whenever and by whatever means possible,
       the whole city 
would stop, it would stop.
Cars would back up to Rhode Island, 
an epic gridlock not even a cat
could thread through. It's not law but the sprawl
of our separate wills that keeps us all flowing. Today I loved
the unprecedented gall
of the piano movers, shoving a roped-up baby grand
up Ninth Avenue before a thunderstorm. 
They were a grim and hefty pair, cynical
as any day laborers. They knew what was coming,
the instrument white lacquered, the sky bulging black
as a bad water balloon and in one pinprick instant
it burst. A downpour like a fire hose.
For a few heartbeats, the whole city stalled,
paused, a heart thump, then it all went staccato. 
And it was my pleasure to witness a not 
insignificant miracle: in one instant every black
umbrella in Hell's Kitchen opened on cue, everyone
still moving. It was a scene from an unwritten opera,
the sails of some vast armada.
And four old ladies interrupted their own slow progress
to accompany the piano movers.
each holding what might have once been 
lace parasols over the grunting men. I passed next
the crowd of pastel ballerinas huddled 
under the corner awning, 
in line for an open call--stork-limbed, ankles 
zigzagged with ribbon, a few passing a lit cigarette 
around. The city feeds on beauty, starves
for it, breeds it. Coming home after midnight, 
to my deserted block with its famously high 
subway-rat count, I heard a tenor exhale pure
longing down the brick canyons, the steaming moon 
opened its mouth to drink from on high...





The Blessed Mother Complains to the Lord Her God on the Abundance of Brokenness She Receives
 

Today I heard a rich and hungry boy verbatim quote
all last night's infomercials--an anorectic son
who bought with Daddy's Amex black card
the Bowflex machine and Abdomenizer,
plus a steak knife that doth slice
the inner skin of his starving arms.
Poor broken child of Eve myself,
to me, the flightless fly,
the listing, blistered, scalded.
I am the rod to their lightning.
Mine is the earhole their stories pierce.
At my altar the blouse is torn open
and the buttons sailed across 
the incensed air space of the nave,
that I may witness the mastectomy scars 
crisscrossed like barbed wire, like bandoliers.
To me, the mother carries the ash contents
of the long-ago incinerated girl.
She begs me for comfort since my own son
was worse tortured. Justice,
they wail for--mercy?
Each prostrate body I hold my arms out for
is a cross my son is nailed to.





The Obscenity Prayer
 

Our falter, whose art is Heavy,
Halloween be thy name.
Your kingdom's numb
your children dumb on earth
moldy bread unleavened.
Give us this day our
wayward dead.
And give us our
asses as we forgive those
who ass against us.
And speed us not
into wimp nation
nor bequiver us 
with needles, for thine
is the flimflam and the sour,
and the same fucking
story in leather 
for never and ever. 
Ah: gin.





Loony Bin Basketball
 

For Phil Jackson
The gym opened out 
before us like a vast arena, the bleached floorboards
yawned toward a vanishing point, staggered seats high
as the Mayan temple I once saw devoured by vines.
Each of us was eaten up inside--all citizens of lost
             and unmapped cities.

Frank hugged the pimply ball
over his belly like an unborn child. Claire
dressed for daycare in daffodil yellow and jelly shoes.
David's gaze was an emperor's surveying a desiccated
battlefield. Since he viewed everything that way, we all
            saw him the same.

The psych techs in Cloroxed white
were giant angels who set us running drills, at which
we sucked. The zones we set out to defend were watery
at every edge. We missed close chest passes, easy combos. 
Our metronomes run different tempos, 
            John proclaimed. 

Then Claire started seeing 
dashes stutter through the air behind the ball.
Then speed lines on our backs, and then her own head 
went wobbly as a spinning egg. She'd once tracked
planetary orbits for NASA and now sat sidelined
            by her eyes' projections. 

Only Bill had game.
Catatonic Bill whose normal talent was to schlub
days in a tub chair--his pudding face scarred
with chicken pox--using his hand for an ashtray,
belly for an armrest. Now all that peeled away, and he 
            emerged, clean as an egg.

 He was a lithe
and licorice boy, eeling past all comers, each shot
sheer net. He faked both ways, went left. Beneath the orange 
rim his midair pirouettes defied the gravity that I
could barely sludge through. He scored beyond what even
             Claire could count,

then he bent panting,
hands on knees as the orderlies held out water cups,
and the rest of us reached to pat his back or slap
his sweaty hand, no one minding about the stench or his 
breath like old pennies. Then as quick as that
             he went.

Inside his head
some inner winch did reel him back from the front
of his face bones where he'd been ablaze. He went back and 
back into that shadowed stare. Lucky we were to breathe
his air. Breath is God's intent to keep us living. He was
             the self I'd come in

wanting to kill, and I left him there.





March
 

Sky a shook poncho.
Roof wrung. Mind a luna moth
Caught in a banjo. 

This weather's witty
Peek-a-boo. A study in
Insincerity. 

Blues! Blooms! The yodel
Of the chimney in night wind.
That flat daffodil.

With absurd hauteur
New tulips dab their shadows
In water-mutter.

Boys are such oxen.
Girls!--sepal-shudder, shadow-
Waver. Equinox.

Plums on the Quad did
Blossom all at once, taking
Down the power grid.





Anaerobe
 

Touch swollen tonsils:
gill slits.
Inside eyelid: slimelight.
Cheek: shark.
Here foreknown
I've dived
down dawnless
microbial snows,
phosphor blue to blue-
black, to black. 
I fend
fish. I find
the saffron curb
of the sulfur vent,
veering voiceless 
again into the segmented,
swaying, white, 
toothed tube-
worm, Time.





Words Are the Sum
 

1


As so-called quarks, so atoms before and through
And after molecules, which too
Constitute us awhile, pluming

Through our slowly changing shapes
Like beachscapes
Through a duneless sandglass, say

(I said, once)--all these
So utterly forgetful, wiped clean
As numbers with each new use, lint-free.

How not so words, which pass our minds
And mouths and ears from hind-
Most elsewhere, on their way to elsewhere--why

So?
Words are the sum of their histories: rose
And roke and no and blanketing snow.



2


So much less LEGO-like, click-
Click together than like slick
Tentacular

Colonial hydrozoans tossed
Together in the copper pots
Of predication--all cross-

Shock and shimmery tangle--
How can
Anyone calculate semantic

Sets so dervishly complex?
How can we not expect not less but hellish
Much more than to mean what we say? Then guess:

How can we better but
Hope to become in sum what
We say when we say again love?





From "Beautiful Boyfriend
 

For Don (19582011)
My skiff is made of spicewood       my oars are Cassia bract
Music flows      from bow to starboard 
Early Mozart     cool side of Coltrane   and miles and miles     of Miles 
Cheap Californian Merlot       and my young boyfriend





If I could master      the nine doors of my body
And close my heart       to the cries of suffering
Perhaps     I could love you like no other
Float my mind      toward the other side of hate





The shanty towns of Tijuana       sing for you
The slums of Little Sudan       hold evening prayer
One dead brown boy is a tragedy
     Ten thousand is a statistic 
So let's fuck    my love       until the dogs pass





All beautiful boyfriends are transitory
They have no souls     they're shiny brown flesh
Tomorrow they'll turn into      purple festering corpses
Fissured     gored    by a myriad flies





Down the Irrawaddy River       you lay yourself to sleep
No sun no moon          no coming no going
No causality   no personality
No hunger     no thirst





Malarial deltas      typhoidal cays
Tsunamis don't judge     Calamity grieves no one
The poor will be submerged     the rich won't be saved
Purge the innocent     sink the depraved





What do I smell        but the perfume of transience
Crushed calyxes         rotting phloems
Let's write     pretty poems        pretty poems      pretty poems
Masque stale pogroms    with a sweet whiff of oblivion





Three Poems after Yannis Ritsos
 

REVERSALS


There are graves under the houses and houses 
under the graves and linking the three 

a broad stone staircase where the dead
go up and the living go down. They pass one another

wordlessly which might mean they don't know, or else
they're pretending not to know. You can smell

the orange grove on the hill; you can hear
children bowling barrel hoops down the street. 

Two women gossip as they fill their jug at the spring.
Their secrets cloud the water. 

Later they walk back through an avenue 
of cypresses, carrying the jug like a bastard child.



TRAPPED


In the house across the street, in a room
directly opposite his, was a long mirror. When he looked 

out of his window, he would see himself in the room
like a thief caught in a trap. He threw a stone.

His neighbor ran in to the sound of breaking glass,
then came to the window and shouted across: 

"Thank God for that: whenever I looked in my mirror 
there you were, doing something shifty behind my back. 

The first man turned away. The long mirror in his room 
brought him face to face with his neighbor, knife in hand.



THE ACCUSED


Just as he locked the door, as he pocketed the key, 
as he glanced over his shoulder, they arrested him. 
They tortured him until they tired of it. 
                                                                         "Look, they said, 
"the key is your key, the house is your house, 
we accept that now; but why did you put the key 
in your pocket as if to hide it from us?

They let him go, but his name is still on a list.





The Advance
 

1


Out the barred window sandbags 
in a sagging wall surround the guard post 
where a soldier half-hidden by the flag 
holds his rifle on his knees and looks a little lost. 

It's Sunday and quiet, the traffic noise 
off aways, the sea behind the post flat as the tarps 
pulled tight over the troop trucks. 
Somewhere down the hall soldiers are being boys, 

telling some joke in Arabic 
in which I'm pretty sure I hear the word "zubrak: 
I walk between shelves loaded with canned rations, 

the cool expiring slowly in the high-ceilinged room
while a pinned-up PSYOPS leaflet declares,
If you sleep in a cemetery, you're bound to have nightmares. 



2


No one sees the doll's decapitated head small 
and neat in rubble. Never tired or sleepy, 
the head is its own country 
obstinately surviving, the pupil 

of its one eye peering through the glass's pure 
transparency. And a few feet away lie its slim, plastic, 
long-legged thighs almost like 
an obscenity the eye watches over--

no one in the street, nothing but bolt-marks
from tank-treads scarring the concrete 
to give any of it drama--and what 

about the way the lips' frozen smirk 
keeps daring me to touch the sexless V 
between the thighs staring up at me? 



3


The barracks dissolve into a reef of rubble in the fog.
On either side of the road, crater after crater
flashes with glints of glass, plastic bags,
a chair leg clinging to a dismembered chair. 

The TV station, the power stacks 
thrusting up through mist, the black-bearded posters
and banners strung across 
the streets lead to an absolute nowhere:

all that's left in the emptied town 
after the army pulled out are PSYOPS leaflets 
fluttering up around the car that winds 

down the coast road deeper into mist, headlights
probing like instruments in a wound
they illuminate the more they violate.





Striplings
 

                                                      1. FIELD


 Truck a passel (a poke) of wildling boys 

                                             We call ourselves (our pack) the orphan-slaves
 

 Upcountry-- loosed from mothers 

                                                                    Farmed out for scratch by mamas
 

 Pale (pink-backed) tobacco-crew 

                                       Bossed by peeled-stick (breakback) donkey-switch
 

 Tarred cropper-force 

                                                                                               Forced cropper-line
 Right far afield past Social Knob 

                                                                                 Dark welty field near Luris


                                      2. BUNKHOUSE 

 Most nights the boy they called Tynan 
suppered us with scrapple from a can. Or some black-eyes 
he'd've road-begged; a quarter-peck of crowders 
scrounged off vines.


The broad back-skin on the tallest boy 
   --a (spreading) welt-weave, a lattice.


Last good gloam-minute after work 
we'd strip off there in the side-yard, yawping; taking turns 
de-tarring      un-burning 
arc-aiming cool hose-spray each on each.


Eleven of us/chigger-scritches, scablets. 
Eleven of us/none of us clean.


Where the boss of us bore down 
on us--our rank of bedrolls on the floorboards--one and 
one and one, eleven of us--ranked sack-beds 
on floorboards--boots of--black breath of--the boss


of us bearing down on us--ain't none 
of us (not a one of us) clean.


                                        3. AFTER-ROAD

            And so (the heaving) boys got trucked to CANDY'S STOP
up Hwy. 52 one night and dumped.





Three Poems from "A Manual for Living
 

Based on Epictetus
APPROACH LIFE AS IF IT WERE A BANQUET


Your rightful portion averts your ireful potion:
Caress what can't be blessed, cup shadows under breasts.

Let pass what's out of ken: lover, job, riches, 
a ripe peach
                       until it reaches you.

Bring salt for your honey, lime for your grenadine.
Money's not your fault. 

You're a feathered peahen
                                                preening for marzipan men.

Impeccable models, often peccable, 
drop their pants at inopportune instants.

Implore no more 
                               for what is, is no more. 



EVERYTHING HAS TWO HANDLES



Whether to grapple the hurt or hold
              the calm: Can reason spread 
                            where ire infests the mind?

The handle you refuse 
              to grasp proclaims you more than one 
                                           you lurch to reach.

Why mire in the right/wrong amphora song.

No vigilance in this choir of one.
             No fast hook in the urn's 
                           broken-off arm. 

                           Vie with hot verities.

The pie is getting cold. 



OUR DUTIES ARE IN RELATION TO ONE ANOTHER


Feel unique in roiling solitude? Oh, you are not alone
though you may feel fallen, snow up your nose. Join
             with others in your dank reclusion.

How do you find something worth saying?
How do you find desire to find desire
              to find something worth saying?

And yes. That is where you might be: twice--
or is it thrice--removed in a receding 
              mirror of acedia. Finding a way to 

find a way to want to find a way back in
to conversation. This is what negative numbers 
              (a negative soul) feel like: You want to want to want...

If you go back far enough--lateral excavation--
will you hit bone? So many converging lines yakking
             to themselves over a haywire switchboard

you used to find out who you were through 
cookie crumbs tossed down your own path.
              Now that you have no crumbs, don't

even have pockets to turn out--only the memory
of such acts, such things. How weary, stale, and 
              profligate it seems to be to plasticize these

lines. You're in a hamless state of mind. 
Now get out and talk to anyone your age: Like you 
              they've all got Death studded on the tongue, which 

livelies up the talk they walk.






Ovid on Climate Change
 

Bastard, the other boys teased him,
till Phaethon unleashed the steeds 
of Armageddon. He couldn't hold 
their reins. Driving the sun too close 
to earth, the boy withered rivers, 
torched Eucalyptus groves, until the hills 
burst into flame, and the people's blood 
boiled through the skin. Ethiopia,
land of burnt faces. In a boy's rage 
for a name, the myth of race begins.





Ruins
 

A spring day oozes through Trastevere. 
A nun in turquoise sneakers contemplates the stairs. 
Ragazzi everywhere, the pus in their pimples 
pushing up like paperwhites in the midday sun. 

Every hard bulb stirs. 

The fossilized egg in my chest 
cracks open against my will. 

I was so proud not to feel my heart.
Waking means being angry.

The dead man on the Congo road 
was missing an ear, 
which had either been eaten 
or someone was wearing it 
around his neck. 

The dead man looked like this. No, that. 

Here's a flock of tourists
in matching canvas hats. 
This year will take from me
the hardened person 
who I longed to be. 
I am healing by mistake. 
Rome is also built on ruins.





Libyan Proverbs
 

The naked man in the caravan 
                                                       has peace of mind. He whose covering 
belongs to others is uncovered. 
                           He who has luck will have the winds 
                                                                                  blow him his firewood.
He whose trousers are made of dry grass should not warm himself at
      the fire.
He howled before going mad. 
                                                           He led the lion by the ear. 
Like the sparrow, he wanted to imitate 
                                                             the pigeon's walk but lost his own. 
Walk with sandals till you get good shoes. 
                                        Where the turban moves, there moves 
the territory. Men meet 
                           but mountains don't. Always taking out 
                                                 without giving back, even the mountains 
                  will be broken down. Penny piled on penny 
will make a heap. Only the unlucky coin 
                                 is left in the purse. As long as a human being lives 
he will learn. 
                                       Learn to shave by shaving orphans. 
He who is to be hanged can insult the Pasha. 
                                             In the house of a man who has been hanged 
don't talk of rope. 
The small donkey is the one that everybody rides. 
                                      Fish eat fish 
                                                        and he who has no might dies. 
                                                                        My belly before my children. 







At the End of My Hours
 

I


here I'm here I'm here I'm

here here here here cricket

pulse--the katydidic tick

(and then a pause) tick 

(and then a pause) in greening trees--tales 

of a gratitude for water, the hollyhock's 

 trumpet Yes, Tenderness

her glove and hoe--her bad trip 

love/grief, her medic tent

talking me down, kissed fissures

in the world's despair, what I'd 

loved--alive for a while--a day called 

Rip and Brood, a day called 

Glorious Hour, the long hunt and the worm found 

in the battered petunias--every 

morning in summer

 that last summer

before the bees collapsed and the seas rose up 

to say Fuck You



II


perplexed by how it hadn't been 

unfailingly compatible, our

being numerous--how half the time

we couldn't see the shapes 

we were supposed to make

 made grave our disasters--a god's glass 

bearing down

to burn the wheat crop--to keep time alive 

inside a tomato, splicing 

fish into fruit--some 

wanted to defy limitation

were offered famine

bric-a-brac townships

virtual cities

 where you could stand in market aisles

 still expecting cherries



III


his rhythms were your rhythms

Murray the cat--sleeping  deux

draped your length from hip to knee 

like a scabbard--unsheathed his yawn

tortured finches for breakfast

yowled and yowled round the ravaged bowl

till you fed him chicken

 from your own plate

another mouth

pearling the wheel of appetite, coveting

a bloody mash 

to keep it going--such a dumb rondeau

who invented it! 

eating to live to kill to eat, even

 cat on a stick when fields failed, no 

crave for rain against the blasted scape

nor love nor god at the end 

 of my hours, but

garlic and butter

a splash of cognac

steak frites



IV


and when soil burned and order failed 

and dogs then people starved in char I remembered

an extraordinary peace, the privilege

of being left alone with bread to eat

 and famous butter "the chefs use, the venues

of white sleep, cannabis and Klonopin

the soma-goods of art and when

my back went up against a blackened wall 

for rumored beans in dented cans I forgot 

 my body--became a future remembering 

how it got that way, some

blah blah blah--about hoarding rivers 

and hiding gold, we 

died in droves--we killed each other and we

 killed ourselves until our bones wore out 

their plastic shrouds



V


 I couldn't quite 

quit some ideas--trees and chocolate

I couldn't stop yammering 

over the devastated earth

pining for nachos--prescription drugs 

 and a hint of spring, though I could see 

the new desert--its bumper-crop 

of bone and brick 

from shipwrecked cities--where now

 the sons and daughters of someone tough

are on the hunt for rat--the scent of meat

however mean and a root

sending an antenna up, to consider 

greening--what poems built their houses for 

once, in a blindered age, teaching us 

 the forms we felt, in rescue--hoarded-up scraps 

whirling around my cave

trying to conjure peaches





Fowl
 

The girl from Scarborough liked being slapped
Down the hall from where her mother slept.

A big, hard-working hand, anybody's
To come medicinally down, antibody

To the slow infection of her Western face
(what sucked the most was that it wasn't fast).

Some birds don't migrate. Above, two lonely fowl
Scream across the sky their only vowel. 

This river I step in is not the river
I stand in. We'll drive to Leslieville, wherever, 

Park in the Guildwood GO lot and get stoned.
Who's there? Nay, answer me. Stand

And unfold yourself. Her heart begins to pound.
No geese go winging to the rooky pond

No goslings disappear their small and speckled. 
If we endure this, it will make us special.





Todays Special
 

Well I guess that's all locked up tight 
Says Sam who guards the mall at night. 

Sam's a puppet! He can't use his eyes.
His body is an excellent disguise. 

I'm Muffy the Mouse! I'm condemned to rhyme
Until the Christmas special end of time. 

That's Jodi, my human friend.
The world goes on and on and will not end

Hiya there Jodi. Oh hi Sam. 
Jodi straightens Jeffrey's magic tam. 

Everything's safe here let's go upstairs
Sam says through a moustache Props repairs. 

Jodi is so pretty. I hate her. 
She carries Jeffrey up the escalator

To the kid's department every night
Where he turns into space and starlight 

When I say the magic rhyme. Jeff's a mannequin 
Until the mall goes dark. Then he's a man again.





Parkdale, then Princess Street
 

Make them say yes before you even ask,
L'essence de charme, c'est a. The mind's a damsel
Locked in a tower with her fathom of hair.
Coax the braid and it'll all be over. 

The rooms are plain where I am interviewed,
Abstract and clinical, and so I glory 
Like a corpse plant, perfume the marble-faced
With the reek and prodigy of my tomorrows. 

Dying is so boring as the soul
Rummages the liquidation sale
For a final bargain--

But time outbids all comers, and we die
Expensively in Princess Margaret
Who was herself once so beautiful.





The Scarborough Grace
 

An old man on Grace Street is going mad
In a Canadian T-shirt he won't change
And red unwrinkling pants I thought had made
Him stylish when I met him in the spring--

Five or six times a day I see him walk
Down Grace Street to St. Francis church, and knock
And pull its wooden doors, always shocked
That his entitled holy place is locked. 

Undreams Damascus from a baffled Paul,
Rolls back the road where some unstricken Saul
Rises up, as bubbles through a beer
To a surface where we disappear 

And wake in some uncalendared forever,
An unwelcome Elijah passing over.





To C
 

Inside, inside the return, inside, the hero diminishes.
 Over her vessel they place a veil, and when it is lifted
 the name of the vessel has been lost. Consider
 the darkness of the water which has no scent
 and neither can it swallow. Yet the ship's bow
 extends over the proscenium like a horse
 at a fence and the orchestra stands and files out.
 On the long walk home, I long to see your face.





Voiced Stops
 

Summer's sweet theatrum! The boy lunges through
 The kitchen without comment, slams the door. An
 Elaborate evening drama. I lug his forlorn weight
 From floor to bed. Beatific lips and gap-
  
 Toothed. Who stayed late to mope and swim, then
 Breach chimneys of lake like a hooked gar
 Pressing his wet totality against me. Iridescent
 Laughter and depraved. Chromatic his constant state. At
  
 Ten, childhood took off like a scorched dog. Turned
 His head to see my hand wave from a window, and I too saw
 The hand untouching, distant from. What fathering-
 Fear slaked the impulse to embrace him? Duration!
  
 An indefinite continuation of life. I whirled out wings. Going
 Toward. And Lord Child claimed now, climbing loose.





Line of Descent
 

Against the backdark, bright
                               riband flickers of heat lightning.    Nearer
                 hills begin to show, to come clear
                                                              as a hard, detached
                                                                                             and glimmering brim
                                              against light lifting there.    And here, pitched over
 the braided arroyo choked with debris,
                                                              a tent, its wan, cakey,
                                 road-rur color.    On the front stake, two
                 green dragonflies, riding each other, pause,
                                              Look! cries the boy, running, the father behind him
                                  running too--
                                                                and the canyon opening
                 out in front of them its magisterial consequence, cramming
                                vertiginous air down its throat--
                                                                                            to snatch him
                                                                     from the scarp.





Ligature
 

          
          When the strong drag of the boy's adolescence pulls through them, the family rises into thinness and begins to break like a wave.   You turned away when I kissed you, the woman says. Why?   Half-lidded days of early winter.   When he points toward the woman, the boy looks at his hand the way dogs will.   The boy's jaw sets. As though behind his teeth, into the soft flesh of his throat, a new set of teeth were cutting through. A mouth for what?   Each of them adopts a private view. Arguments veer every which way, and who can follow? A sequence of dark non sequiturs blows in.   When one, when one word, when the word suicide enters the room where they are shouting, the system closes down, prematurely becalmed.   The man writes, I am not given a subject but am given to my subject. I am inside it like a parasite.   He sees the woman's face contract at the approach of other futures than the one for which her face was prepared.   So they inhabit their bodies like music, for a given time. And yet he continues to act as if there were times to come.   I just want you to go away, one of them screams.   Expressionless and flat as a tortilla, the afternoon moon over their house.   She calls the man to a corner in the basement. Those aren't spider eggs, he says, backing up. Those are its eyes.   When the encounter with the self is volcanic, nothing can follow.   Tearing open the cocoon to reveal itself, a boy within the family.   As if they were waiting. As if inside experience, bright with meaning, there were another experience pendant, unnameable.
        




Bridge & Swimmer
 

Our eye goes past the hieroglyphic tree to the swimmer
 carving a wake in the water. And almost to the railroad bridge
 from which the swimmer might have dived. Then, as though
 come to the end of its tether,
 our gaze returns, pulling toward the blemish
 on the surface of the print. An L-shaped chemical dribble,
 it sabotages the scene's transparence
 and siphons off its easy appeal.
  
 At the same time, the blemish
 joins together the realms
 of seer and swimmer
 in our experience of plunging
 into and out of the image.





Ligature 4
 

          
          The bioluminescent undersides of squid render them invisible to predators below. That the radiance of the boy's anger might protect him.   Walking the dog and stepping on a patch of repaired road, I remember the soft spot in his head.   You're deaf as a beagle. No, you are.   Can I feel the tide's drag on the turning earth increase each day's duration?   A hair in my nostril has gone white.   In absolute night, from my bed, I hear him aiming for the toilet's center. The sound deepens, voice finding its register.   Scientists call it an entangled system.   We survive Christmas, his face pressed to the smooshed bosom of his grandmother in a house so immaculate, the spider in the seam of the ceiling stands out obscenely.   Like a star at the outskirts of the galaxy, and slung around by the gravity of  dark matter. For now, he goes where we go, but he does not belong to us.   I begin to begin my sentences leaning toward him, taking a deep breath.   He relinquishes the conversation with a contraction of his pupils.   What is for one of us the throb of the immediate is, for the other, the imminent mundane.   When napalm hits my brain, he takes on the tranquillity of a blinking newt.   She finds a photograph of him at seven. The sheer expressed of his face. As among Michelangelo's early drawings, there is a copy of Masacchio's lost Sagra, the consecration.   We search our memories of him for a certain unity of characteristics that would hold through the permutations he now submits to us.   When it clings to the wire-and-rug surrogate, lab technicians shock it again. Instead of releasing, it clings tighter.   Throwing himself into the back seat after wrestling practice, mat burns on his cheek and forehead.   His muteness an onomatopoeia of the rising moon.
        




Walking Parker Home
 

Sweet beats of jazz impaled on slivers of wind
 Kansas Black Morning/ First Horn Eyes/
 Historical sound pictures on New Bird wings
 People shouts/ boy alto dreams/ Tomorrow's
 Gold belled pipe of stops and future Blues Times
 Lurking Hawkins/ shadows of Lester/ realization
 Bronze fingers--brain extensions seeking trapped sounds
 Ghetto thoughts/ bandstand courage/ solo flight
 Nerve-wracked suspicions of newer songs and doubts
 New York alter city/ black tears/ secret disciples
 Hammer horn pounding soul marks on unswinging gates
 Culture gods/ mob sounds/ visions of spikes
 Panic excursions to tribal Jazz wombs and transfusions
 Heroin nights of birth/ and soaring/ over boppy new ground.
 Smothered rage covering pyramids of notes spontaneously exploding
 Cool revelations/ shrill hopes/ beauty speared into greedy ears
 Birdland nights on bop mountains, windy saxophone revolutions.
 Dayrooms of junk/ and melting walls and circling vultures/
 Money cancer/ remembered pain/ terror flights/
 Death and indestructible existence
  
 In that Jazz corner of life
 Wrapped in a mist of sound
 His legacy, our Jazz-tinted dawn
 Wailing his triumphs of oddly begotten dreams
 Inviting the nerveless to feel once more
 That fierce dying of humans consumed
 In raging fires of Love.

Their Bodies
 

To the students of anatomy  at Indiana University
That gaunt old man came first, his hair as white 
As your scoured tables. Maybe you'll recollect him 
By the scars of steelmill burns on the backs of his hands, 
On the nape of his neck, on his arms and sinewy legs, 
And her by the enduring innocence 
Of her face, as open to all of you in death 
As it would have been in life: she would memorize 
Your names and ages and pastimes and hometowns 
If she could, but she can't now, so remember her. 

They believed in doctors, listened to their advice, 
And followed it faithfully. You should treat them 
One last time as they would have treated you. 
They had been kind to others all their lives 
And believed in being useful. Remember somewhere 
Their son is trying hard to believe you'll learn 
As much as possible from them, as he did, 
And will do your best to learn politely and truly. 

They gave away the gift of those useful bodies 
Against his wish. (They had their own ways 
Of doing everything, always.) If you're not certain 
Which ones are theirs, be gentle to everybody.





This Place Rumord to Have Been Sodom
 


   might have been.
 Certainly these ashes might have been pleasures.
 Pilgrims on their way to the Holy Places remark
 this place. Isn't it plain to all
 that these mounds were palaces? This was once
 a city among men, a gathering together of spirit.
 It was measured by the Lord and found wanting.
  
 It was measured by the Lord and found wanting,
 destroyd by the angels that inhabit longing.
 Surely this is Great Sodom where such cries
 as if men were birds flying up from the swamp
 ring in our ears, where such fears that were once
 desires walk, almost spectacular,
 stalking the desolate circles, red eyed.
  
 This place rumord to have been a City surely was,
 separated from us by the hand of the Lord.
 The devout have laid out gardens in the desert,
 drawn water from springs where the light was blighted.
 How tenderly they must attend these friendships
 or all is lost. All is lost.
 Only the faithful hold this place green.
  
 Only the faithful hold this place green
 where the crown of fiery thorns descends.
 Men that once lusted grow listless. A spirit
 wrappd in a cloud, ashes more than ashes,
 fire more than fire, ascends.
 Only these new friends gather joyous here,
 where the world like Great Sodom lies under fear.
  
 The world like Great Sodom lies under Love
 and knows not the hand of the Lord that moves.
 This the friends teach where such cries
 as if men were birds fly up from the crowds
 gatherd and howling in the heat of the sun.
 In the Lord Whom the friends have named at last Love
 the images and loves of the friends never die.
 This place rumord to have been Sodom is blessd
 in the Lord's eyes.





At the New Year
 

In the shape of this night, in the still fall
         of snow, Father
 In all that is cold and tiny, these little birds
         and children
 In everything that moves tonight, the trolleys
         and the lovers, Father
 In the great hush of country, in the ugly noise
         of our cities
 In this deep throw of stars, in those trenches
         where the dead are, Father
 In all the wide land waiting, and in the liners
         out on the black water
 In all that has been said bravely, in all that is
         mean anywhere in the world, Father
 In all that is good and lovely, in every house
         where sham and hatred are
 In the name of those who wait, in the sound
         of angry voices, Father
 Before the bells ring, before this little point in time
         has rushed us on
 Before this clean moment has gone, before this night
         turns to face tomorrow, Father
 There is this high singing in the air
 Forever this sorrowful human face in eternity's window
 And there are other bells that we would ring, Father
 Other bells that we would ring.





The Heavenly City
 

I sigh for the heavenly country,
 Where the heavenly people pass,
 And the sea is as quiet as a mirror
 Of beautiful beautiful glass.
  
 I walk in the heavenly field,
 With lilies and poppies bright,
 I am dressed in a heavenly coat
 Of polished white.
  
 When I walk in the heavenly parkland
 My feet on the pasture are bare,
 Tall waves the grass, but no harmful
 Creature is there.
  
 At night I fly over the housetops,
 And stand on the bright moony beams;
 Gold are all heaven's rivers,
 And silver her streams.





The Entertainment of War
 

I saw the garden where my aunt had died
 And her two children and a woman from next door;
 It was like a burst pod filled with clay.
  
 A mile away in the night I had heard the bombs
 Sing and then burst themselves between cramped houses
 With bright soft flashes and sounds like banging doors;
  
 The last of them crushed the four bodies into the ground,
 Scattered the shelter, and blasted my uncle's corpse
 Over the housetop and into the street beyond.
  
 Now the garden lay stripped and stale; the iron shelter
 Spread out its separate petals around a smooth clay saucer.
 Small, and so tidy it seemed nobody had ever been there.
  
 When I saw it, the house was blown clean by blast and care.
 Relations had already torn out the new fireplaces;
 My cousin's pencils lasted me several years.
  
 And in his office notepad that was given me
 I found solemn drawings in crayon of blondes without dresses.
 In his lifetime I had not known him well.
  
 These were the things I noticed at ten years of age:
 Those, and the four hearses outside our house,
 The chocolate cakes, and my classmates' half-shocked envy.
  
 But my grandfather went home from the mortuary
 And for five years tried to share the noises in his skull,
 Then he walked out and lay under a furze-bush to die.
  
 When my father came back from identifying the daughter
 He asked us to remind him of her mouth.
 We tried. He said I think it was the one'.
  
 These were marginal people I had met only rarely
 And the end of the whole household meant that no grief was seen;
 Never have people seemed so absent from their own deaths.
  
 This bloody episode of four whom I could understand better dead
 Gave me something I needed to keep a long story moving;
 I had no pain of it; can find no scar even now.
  
 But had my belief in the fiction not been thus buoyed up
 I might, in the sigh and strike of the next night's bombs
 Have realized a little what they meant, and for the first time been afraid.





At night on the station platform . . .
 

          
          At night on the station platform, near a pile of baskets, a couple em- braced, pressed close together and swaying a little. It was hard to see where the girl's feet and legs were. The suspicion this aroused soon caused her hands, apparently joined behind her lover's back, to become a small brown paper parcel under the arm of a stout en- gine-driver who leaned, probably drunk, against the baskets, his cap so far forward as almost to conceal his face. I could not banish the thought that what I had first seen was in fact his own androgy- nous fantasy, the self-sufficient core of his stupor. Such a romantic thing, so tender, for him to contain. He looked more comic and complaisant than the couple had done, and more likely to fall heav- ily to the floor.   A caf with a frosted glass door through which much light is dif- fused. A tall young girl comes out and stands in front of it, her face and figure quite obscured by this milky radiance.   She treads out onto a lopsided ochre panel of lit pavement before the doorway and becomes visible as a coloured shape, moving sharply. A wrap of honey and ginger, a flared saffron skirt, grey- white shoes. She goes off past the Masonic Temple with a young man: he is pale, with dark hair and a shrunken, earnest face. You could imagine him a size larger. Just for a moment, as it happens, there is no one else in the street at all. Their significance escapes rap- idly like a scent, before the footsteps vanish among the car engines.     A man in the police court. He looked dapper and poker-faced, his arms straight, the long fingers just touching the hem of his checked jacket. Four days after being released from the prison where he had served two years for theft he had been discovered at midnight cling- ing like a tree-shrew to the bars of a glass factory-roof. He made no attempt to explain his presence there; the luminous nerves that made him fly up to it were not visible in daylight, and the police seemed hardly able to believe this was the creature they had brought down in the darkness.     In this city the governing authority is limited and mean: so limited that it can do no more than preserve a superficial order. It supplies fuel, water and power. It removes a fair proportion of the refuse, cleans the streets after a fashion, and discourages fighting. With these things, and a few more of the same sort, it is content. This could never be a capital city for all its size. There is no mind in it, no regard. The sensitive, the tasteful, the fashionable, the intolerant and powerful, have not moved through it as they have moved through London, evaluating it, altering it deliberately, setting in motion wars of feeling about it. Most of it has never been seen.     In an afternoon of dazzling sunlight in the thronged streets, I saw at first no individuals but a composite monster, its unfeeling sur- faces matted with dust: a mass of necks, limbs without extremities, trunks without heads; unformed stirrings and shovings spilling across the streets it had managed to get itself provided with.   Later, as the air cooled, flowing loosely about the buildings that stood starkly among the declining rays, the creature began to divide and multiply. At crossings I could see people made of straws, rags, cartons, the stuffing of burst cushions, kitchen refuse. Outside the  Grand Hotel, a long-boned carrot-haired girl with glasses, loping along, and with strips of bright colour, rich, silky green and blue, in her soft clothes. For a person made of such scraps she was beau- tiful.   Faint blue light dropping down through the sparse leaves of the plane trees in the churchyard opposite after sundown, cooling and shaping heads, awakening eyes.
        




The Thing about Joe Sullivan
 

The pianist Joe Sullivan,
 jamming sound against idea
  
 hard as it can go
 florid and dangerous
  
 slams at the beat, or hovers,
 drumming, along its spikes;
  
 in his time almost the only
 one of them to ignore
  
 the chance of easing down,
 walking it leisurely,
  
 he'll strut, with gambling shapes,
 underpinning by James P.,
  
 amble, and stride over
 gulfs of his own leaving, perilously
  
 toppling octaves down to where
 the chords grow fat again
  
 and ride hard-edged, most lucidly
 voiced, and in good inversions even when
  
 the piano seems at risk of being
 hammered the next second into scrap.
  
 For all that, he won't swing
 like all the others;
  
 disregards mere continuity,
 the snakecharming business,
  
 the masturbator's rhythm'
 under the long variations:
  
 Sullivan can gut a sequence
 in one chorus--
  
 --approach, development, climax, discard--
 and sound magnanimous.
  
 The mannerism of intensity
 often with him seems true,
  
 too much to be said, the mood
 pressing in right at the start, then
  
 running among stock forms
 that could play themselves
  
 and moving there with such
 quickness of intellect
  
 that shapes flaw and fuse,
 altering without much sign,
  
 concentration
 so wrapped up in thoroughness
  
 it can sound bluff, bustling,
 just big-handed stuff--
  
 belied by what drives him in
 to make rigid, display,
  
 shout and abscond, rather
 than just let it come, let it go--
  
 And that thing is his mood:
 a feeling violent and ordinary
  
 that runs in among standard forms so
 wrapped up in clarity
  
 that fingers following his
 through figures that sound obvious
  
 find corners everywhere,
 marks of invention, wakefulness;
  
 the rapid and perverse
 tracks that ordinary feelings
  
 make when they get driven
 hard enough against time.





Provision
 

The irritations of comfort--
 I visit as they rebuild the house
 from within: whitening, straightening,
 bracing the chimney-breast edges
 and forcing warmth, dryness
 and windows with views into
 the cottage below canal-level.
  
 For yes, there's a canal, bringing
 cold reflections almost to the door,
 and beyond it the main line to Manchester,
 its grid of gantries pale
 against the upland and the sky;
 there's a towpath pub, where the red-
 haired old landlady
 brings up the beer from the cellar slowly
 in a jug: there's a chapel
 next door to the cottage, set up
 with a false front and a real
 boiler-house, and--
 rest, my mind--nearby there's
 a small haulage contractor's yard.
  
 Everything's turned up here, except
 a certain complete cast-iron
 housefront, preserved and pinned
 to a blank wall in Ottawa.
  
 This comfort
 beckons. It won't do. It beckons.
 Driving steadily through rain in
 a watertight car with the wipers going.
 It won't do. It beckons.





The Afterlife
 

I've lived within half a mile of it
 for twenty years. West 
 by the black iron weather-hen
 half-strangled with clematis
 on the garage roof
 I can locate it. Past a low ridge
 in the cliff face of a limestone dale
 there's a cave in the bushes.
  
 When the old tigers
 were long since gone, leaving their
 teeth, the valley people
 would climb there with the dead
 they thought most useful;
  
 push them well in,
  
 take them out again,
 walk them around:
 They're coming! They're coming'
  
             We Malagasies love
             our second burials.
             We hire a band that comes
             in a van. Again
             with liquefaction almost done
             we hold our cherished ones
             in our arms. From the grave-clothes
             they fall in gobbets as dog-food
             falls from the can. We wrap them
             in fresh dry linen. They
             bless our lives with their happiness.
  
 Walk them around the valley. Drop
 here a finger
 for the god that is a rat or a raven,
 here a metatarsal
 to set under the hearth for luck.
  
 And what was luck?
  
 The afterlife back then
 was fairly long:
 nothing demented like for ever,
  
 nothing military. The afterlife
 would come to the party.





This Ones for You
 

Even if you didn't have green eyes (in the bathtub, blue).
 Even if you didn't have a lovely singing voice,
             or care for Alexandrine champagne
             some slow Saturday evenings to sing it through,
 it pleases me, your lips close to my ear,
             or when you're a big girl, and I'm a big girl too.
  
 Five years difference between we two.
 Sometimes it hardly matters. I've decided to worship you,
             Diana, goddess of the forest--
             or is she the one of the hunt?
             Who cares? You remind me of her
 too. Some woman caught me up, breathless, in her strong arms,
             said breathe, darling. Her eyes were green-blue.
  
 Vague resemblances: that's the daily news.
 Meaning: I'm willingly a fool for you
             any hour past midnight,
             and almost anytime in three-quarter view.
             Consider this, too: stumbling back, after a fight,
 to someplace we could call home, you and I have been known
             to duet a jubilee so funky it sounds like the blues.
  
 What steady arrows you shoot, Diana, become
 a goddess of the hearth: you whisper
             time to put the porchlight on,
             and we do. Who am I talking to?
 What is this strange glare, this prescience that you won't be true?
 Sometimes you say something like even so, boo,
 and it sounds like breathe, darling. That's why this one's for you.





Waiting for This Story to End Before I Begin Another
 

All my stories are about being left,
 all yours about leaving. So we should have known.
 Should have known to leave well enough alone;
 we knew, and we didn't. You said let's put
 our cards on the table, your card
 was your body, the table my bed, where we didn't
 get till 4 am, so tired from wanting
 what we shouldn't that when we finally found our heads,
 we'd lost our minds. Love,I wanted to call you
 so fast. But so slow you could taste each
 letter licked into your particular and rose-like ear.
 L, love, for let's wait. O, for oh no, let's not. V
 for the precious v between your deep breasts
 (and the virtue of your fingers
 in the voluptuous center of me.)
  
 Okay, E for enough.
  
 Dawn broke, or shattered. Once we've made
 the promises, it's hard to add the prefix if. . . .
 But not so wrong to try.
 That means taking a lot of walks,
 which neither of us is good at,
 for different reasons, and nights up till 2
 arguing whose reasons are better.
 Time and numbers count a lot in this. 13
 years my marriage. 5 years you my friend.
 4th of July weekend when something that begins
 in mist, by mistake (whose?), means too much
 has to end. I think we need an abacus to get our love
 on course, and one of us to oil the shining rods
 so we can keep the crazy beads clicking,
 clicking. It wasn't a question
 of a perfect fit. Theoretically,
 it should be enough to say I left a man
 for a woman (90% of the world is content
 to leave it at that. Oh, lazy world) and when the woman
 lost her nerve, I left
 for greater concerns: when words like autonomy
 were useful, I used them, I confess. So I get
 what I deserve: a studio apartment he paid the rent on;
 bookshelves up to the ceiling she drove
 the screws for. And a skylight I sleep alone
 beneath, and two shiny quarters in my pocket
 to call one, then the other, or to call one
  
 twice. Once, twice, I threatened to leave him--
 remember? Now that I've done it, he says
 he doesn't. I'm in a phonebooth at the corner of Bank
 and Greenwich; not a booth, exactly,
 but two sheets of glass to shiver between.
 This is called being street-smart: dialing
 a number that you know won't be answered,
 but the message you leave leaves proof that you tried.
 And this, my two dearly beloveds, is this called
 hedging your bets? I fish out my other
 coin, turn it over in my fingers, press
 it into the slot. Hold it there. Let it drop.





The Fish-Wife
 

I'll take a bath when it snows,
 when I can look out the window up high
 and see the sky all pale
 and blank like a fish's eye.
 And I know the boats won't go out tonight,
 the fishermen drinking whiskey, locked
 in a bar-dream, the music rocking them deeper.
  
 It doesn't snow enough here,
 though some would say otherwise,
 fearing accidents. But the paper boy, skidding
 uphill on his bike in light snow, knows better,
 making S-tracks when his wheels slide sideways.
  
 We really needed this snow, the old men will say,
 putting to bed the surface roots of trees,
 putting to bed the too-travelled streets.
  
 When everything is covered
 the earth has a light of its own;
 the snow falls down from the moon
 as everyone knows, and brings that light
 back to us. I needed this light.
  
 All day I kept by the window, watching the sky,
 a prisoner in my clothes, the wind felt dry
 and mean. Starlings stalked the yard with evil eyes
 --I hated them, and hated, too, my neighbor's house
 where sparks from the chimney fell back in a stinking
 cloud--black ashes bringing no blessing.
  
 When the roads are covered,
 when the water is black and snow falls
 into the waves, the birds' hunger swirls
 the air, dark lovely shapes. All hungers
 are equal now. I'll give them bread and seeds.
  
 I have no money; the whiskey is gone,
 and I must bathe in water. Fishermen, please
 do not go out in your flimsy boats tonight
 to chase after the cod and mackerel,
 to hook the giant eels. Go safe,
 go free. Let your feet leave trails
 through streets and yards, wandering
 home, your crooked voyages to bed.





The Length of the Hour
 

New houses relax on the fields.
 Garage doors open soundlessly
 to admit the monster. Tires stretched
 over forty pounds of air
 pressure float across gravel.
  
 The boy closes the last storm
 door on the last evening
 paper and runs to the car
 where his mother waits. She does not
 answer him; the door slam freezes
 her dreams. It is January.
  
 A dog chained to a barn door
 keeps barking. Somebody's angry,
 scared to let him go.
 On the other side
 of a forest past these fields,
 wolves sniff the hard snow
 of the tundra. I lay beside the only
 tree for warmth, there
 where the pack might find me.
  
 The house takes care of us now.
 Look at the meat
 browning under the light.
 The refrigerator switches on;
 ice crashes into the tray.
  
 Here are locks in case someone
 wants to do us harm. Remember
 how the police had to pound and pound
 to wake us that night a white Cadillac
 leapt from the icy road
  
 into the arms of our maple! It hung there,
 empty, doors flung wide--
 it was a great white petal of a car,
 breathing under the gas-lights, opening
 and opening.





Saint Stephens Day with the Griffins
 

for Janet and Christopher
     Half-eagle, half-lion, the fabulous
           animal struts, saber-clawed but saintly,
    a candlewicked ornament dangling
 from our rickety sugar pine. Butternut
  
      pudding in our bellies. His reindeer
           and sleigh hurried here and gone--thank God
      for us childless folks. Almost:   the lovelocked
 Griffins on the sofa, sockfooted, hearing
  
      gas and a kiddy heart in her tummy--
           a life more imaginary than real,
      though one is dazzled by gold that fills
 the egg unbroken. We feed her crumpets
  
      and listen again: The lamb's a hungry
           bugger, even snug from earth's
      imponderable fury. Tomorrow, in a spurt
 by jet I'm home. Clumsy as a puppy
  
      I'll scale the flightstairs into the nosecone,
           luggage banging at my sides, enter the egg-
      shaped cabin and await the infrared
 climb toward space. Tell me one
  
      thing true? If I could count the way
           things slip from us: Mother's fur gloves,
      Sunday's benediction, the dead gone before us,
 love's rambler on the prairie--all displaced
  
      as we buckle in our shuttle,
           jetbound on a screaming runway,
      gravity pulling at us castaways,
 more mammal than bird, subtle
  
      leg-weary griffins made manifest,
           arrowing towards home. How do we
      ignore it: the attenuated being
 of our age, the bittersweet collapse
  
      of dominoes mooned around our pine?
            Withered with hatred from his quarter,
      Saint Stephen even at death rolled mercifully over
 in high holiness. Sonless, wifeless, nine
  
      thousand feet from land, I roll the lozenge
           on my tongue, youthful habit for ache
      of any kind, parting a survivor (Wait!),
 love rescuing me from the fringe.





Painted Eyes
 

Dusty and treeless, the street sloped beneath us.
 Somewhere a hammer made thunderclaps,
 forging the night-sky.
  
                                        Then the children,
 seeing us, dashed from the Moorish houses,
 vigorously shouting, vying for position,
 while the bravest,
 in worn underpants and plastic sandals,
 climbed a high crater-like wall
 and plunged, with murderous cries,
 into the Roman pool
 where blue-lipped fish waited.
 Ah, those glorious soaked heads, spiked like palm fronds!
 Seeing one in our group clutch her purse--
 repelled by the wet black princes
 who shivered in circles of yellow mud
 and begged from us--
 I felt ashamed.
 In the brief African twilight,
 a canary chirped something
 shrewdly about avarice.
  
 Far off, in the little neighborhood
 where I grew--with neat cement walkways
 and crab-apple blossoms--
 money ran through the fingers
 of our house, with nothing much
 to record its loss but unhappiness:
 one of us ironing servilely,
 one of us sobbing in a bedroom,
 one of us sleeping on a rifle,
 one of us seizing another by the hair,
 demanding the animal-like submission
 we thought was love.
  
                                        Sunday evening.
 Mother is wearing a big cotton shift
 and tweezing her eyebrows.
 Her head is a thicket of hairpins.
 In the round hand-mirror
 that parodies her face,
 the world looks greater than it is.
 I am next to bathe in the water
 of the poor earth, reused by each of us
 in order of birth. Gray with sodium and grit,
 it covers me like a black robe,
 and yet I feel exalted.
  
                                        Soon the violent rain,
 like wet Sahara sand, would fall,
 scrubbing the hot labyrinthine
 corridors of shuttered houses and aimless dogs,
 where the sparse life is
 purgative and inexhaustible,
 where little pilfering hands
 moved freely in and out
 of my trouser pockets,
 though there were no diamonds
 except those the eyes mined.





Dont Let Me Be Wistful
 

The heat out there this evening
  
 is contained heat like things keep applicable boxes
  
 at the ready then subsume their diverging constituent parts
  
 long ambivalent talks into midnight, all those
  
 glowy Sophia Coppola movies, Prosecco
  
 the sexiest records I know. I don't feel
  
 how I know anymore to be more than something seeking
  
 my appalling lack of cinematic knowledge, fictive innocence
  
 & something like the break-down of those little boxes
  
 little tombs put their hands up in front of my mouth
  
 there's a tacitly humiliating eulogy to drown out couldn't feel
  
 much more stupid about feeling stupid over feeling
  
 stupid, living. Let me go & watch something
  
 moving several images some of them symbolize humility broken
  
 postures bloodshot eyes, intimately talking through this
  
 publicly I am not developing at all but just the same. So hot
  
 outside in the evening heat locking hazy jonquils
  
 & sunflowers dead for two weeks, ridiculously
  
 mournful as I'll try & dimly think of the last real shock.
  
 I remember disgust perhaps & something like alarm (the phone
  
 going off in the middle of the night) pervasive disappointment
  
 &, for sure, horror, but shock?, as if the heat were seceding from the frames
  
 of its containment thought & feeling & establishing some wonderama
  
 ratios & beanpole features quick to surge beyond the human model.
  
 I know I do the heat out there this evening
  
 will & maybe I should be the one I know who has to stop.
  
 If I have to heal myself completely every time before I start
  
 I shouldn't be. I think about the god of demurrment in the world
  
 or I think about it later having fallen to its love spell -- the heat
  
 keeps me shut up at the table in the evening
  
 at the laptop arranging each letter with the same affectless love
  
 it's nothing moving Avery born & Vivian to come December
  
 Kermit the Frog sings the Ave Maria while the white flag is endlessly
  
 lowered & raised through the whole master/slave dialectic forever.
  
 Don't let me be wistful. Let me be the actual heat, forgiven
  
 its severity & leaving for the year. Mercy is just like the children's zoo it's real
  
 weird to think about anything now, think how fucking hard
  
 a fucking beach read used to be sewn into its spine
  
 delicious words from start to finish I could just
  
 lay there & die it's so goddamn nice in this sigh vitrine real 9/11
  
 kind of midnight Friday midnight, lamely shifting in my chair, the fan
  
 that stops the love that moves the world that stops goes out on gold
  
 weeks other weeks it just sits in the back.
  
 It collects statically. I hate that.





Between Here & There
 

for Brandon Goacher
I.
  
 Let me speak with expressive
  
 hesitation & a feeling for
  
 interment why even
  
 lineate what isn't broken by
  
 music let me speak with
  
 inextricable reluctance.
  
 I want to tear the heart
  
 from refused convalescence
  
 & feed it those long fronds
  
 of river bed grass. I want to
  
 tear the heart out of style
  
 & put it between
  
 utter thrall & the infancy
  
 of all things impure.
  
 Torn out, a flame thickens
  
 between us as if
  
 not right now we'll be
  
 ripped from this life
  
 or each other a white
  
 lie not a little more tender
  
 than quick. Inextricable
  
 reluctance to die or even
  
 leave youth culture ever.
  
 What a stupid feeling.
  
 Do you think it isn't
  
 true? The very existence
  
 of flame throwers proves
  
 that sometime, somewhere,
  
 someone said to themselves
  
 You know I want to
  
 set those people over there
  
 on fire but I'm just not
  
 close enough to get the
  
 job done.' Someone
  
 puts their arms around you
  
 in the cold. There's an al-
  
 most disquieting closeness
  
 as gossamer clots &
  
 becomes an impasto derivative
  
 of some newly visible
  
 interdependence. Flame
  
 throwers then are just
  
 a description of prevailing
  
 ideology, relics, the life
  
 of the party, a soul
  
 flirts by burning
  
 that name for itself
  
 up in jonesing that comes
  
 at the end of desire?
  
 Well I wouldn't know
  
 about that. A little
  
 goat. Why would it
  
 nuzzle dreamily up
  
 the way I nuzzle dreamily
  
 up to my knees. In the
  
 fatal position' as my
  
 nephew used to call it
  
 estranged from play
  
 waiting on the fox hunt.
  
 Oh baby
  
 it beats up my lips
  
 the somatic effects
  
 of contriving a psychic
  
 blockade against death
  
 with the contours of your
  
 face & healing
  
 in constant eclipse
  
 where all things
  
 inextricably broken by
  
 music make the basic
  
 rhythmic unit go
  
 something like this -- I 
  
 don't want to loose you. I
  
 don't want to be
  
 empty, clever hold &
  
 keep you. I was lost
  
 to you to start with still
  
 I keep on coming back.
  
 Do you think you'll 
  
 keep on coming back to me
  
 forever? That's the meaning
  
 of our life together
  
 baby.





This Cant Be Life
 

Lapo Elkman gazes out from the frame with a
 come-hither look. His wrists have soft bracelets
 around them & his shirt, black, is open.
 Looped on his neck pale strands of beads hang
 which causes a ribbon of shadow at his nipple.
 His facial hair, bleached by the sun, is brown-white.
 Tatiana Santa Domingo wears a floral printed dress.
 It is summer where she's photographed or
 warm enough for clothes that light. Earrings
 perhaps of three golden hoops or two
 hang obscured in the shade of her hair.
 Her right cheek is touching the locks of
 Bianca Brandolini d'Adda whose own dress
 is dim purple satin. It has a
 black strap of lace an inch thick
 which, at her waist, intersects with another
 lace band even thicker & full of arabesques
 & Fleur De Lis. This lace
 is just above her belly which is pressed
 to the belly of Margherita Maccapani Missoni.
 White, with faint, almost invisible as
 flowers (maybe dots?) her sundress,
 exposes her shoulder. The left one
 is touching the patterned black stars on the silk frock
 partly covered by spilling brown hair, at its longest end,
 curled & falling from the head of Alexi Neideliski.
 Andrea Stefanowicz Sabrier
 lays on his belly wearing Ray-Bands
 & is laughing. Beside him
 on his back, with arm muscles
 slightly swollen, hands clasped behind his head
 & eyes closed Julio Mario Santo Domingo III
 laughs as well. Both are in blue
 jeans & t-shirts. Her blue & black checkered
 flannel clad shoulder hovers over
 the face of her sister whose cheek is buried
 in wildflowers. Each wears a ring, one is
 a cylinder of patterned white gold
 the other, more baroque, appears Victorian
 but isn't wholly visible.
 Olympia & Fiona Scarry are un-
 comfortably positioned in these clothes
 & rings. Olympia's eyes are wide,
 bright, but Fiona's are so full of shadow
 it seems they aren't there which gives her
 the look of the un-dead. White wife beater,
 ample hair in his pits, crotch
 the center of gravity here in this picture
 Harry Morton is laying on a bed. One arm
 behind his head it's tattooed almost classically,
 twice, with illegible symbols. His
 slacks have grey stripes, they pour into a boot
 pressed on the soft white sheet at the right
 at the left sink into a blood-colored
 comforter, velvet. The chocolate
 toned pea-coat he's wearing half-way
 reveals a hand, it grips the hem
 near the satin-coco lining. She has the
 the face of a mermaid, & the eyes
 Princess in her title, Elizabeth von Thurn und Taxis
 looks poised before apporaching the coffin.
 Count Gian Luca Passi de Preposulo is giddy & drenched
 having waded in the sea in his button up clinging
 his smile is one that gods give their children after
 hooking up with mortals for the fix. On a half-pipe
 ornate with graffiti the honorable Sophia
 Fermor-Hesketh rests a skate-board on her knee
 in black tights. She wears Docs. Her hair is blonde,
 mostly covered by a hat her dress is lycra black this is
 Madonna as eternal return. Yellow seal with
 ingratiating smile, caterpillar-seal hybrid antennae
 blue, markings pink, body yellow, silver 
 dolphin, dolphin with desert-camo designs &
 dolphin dressed for jungle warfare these inflatables are
 harbored at the edge of a pool in which Bianca
 Brandolini D'Adda is floating on a sting-ray
 shaped raft on her belly hands under her chin
 three bracelets no bathing suit she's swimming
 in her dress which is soaked & her legs are
 raised, ankles crossed this makes a diamond-
 shape between with liquid topaz. He has
 the cork in his teeth. In his left hand a half-
 glass of red. He is looking away at invisible friends & the
 ocean is beyond a grey mist with white
 bands Carlo Mondavi has hair
 that arcs at middle point a frozen cascade
 beneath which at right we see his ear half
 a sea-shell. The filigree is white, the
 buttons white impacted silk, the dots silk
 on sheer, on her blouse with short sleeves,
 she is blonde, her brother blonde his shirt
 white his scarf red she leans back on his chest
 his hand over his heart he takes an oath, Alexandre
 & Josephine de la Baume their lips closed
 eyes cold, unexpressive & imposing. JFK
 twice on a monitor his face & his back he
 is speaking Jared Kushner looks relaxed there's
 a copy of the New York Observer on his knees
 which are bent he sits up against a
 wall smiles easily cropped black hair dark tie
 & slacks & white shirts by a window in the
 city. It's a beach-house kitchen. Arnie Hammer's
 by the sink. The head of his acoustic guitar
 nears its lip, & his ass sits near a rack where
 dishes dry there is one tiny elegant hole
 in his t-shirt, in his collar which is loose,
 low, reveals his long neck & hairy chest.
 The Corona in his right hand sweats. There is
 white foam all over my face which began in
 a canister, moved as blue-gel expelled by
 air-pressure then diluted with water was smeared
 on my cheeks, between my nose, lip
 & down onto my chin. I am shaving naked I 
 have three rolls of fat each bigger than
 the last. Looking in the mirror I cough, draw
the phlegm from my lungs with a suck roll
it onto my tongue stick my tongue out examine
 phlegm's color for blood but there's none it's like mud-
 infused egg yolk. I spit it down into the sink with
 the little hairs spiking the cream. The cigarette
 pulls like a kite from her body on a long arm
 suspended by wind. Her tea-cup she holds it waist
 high & with one finger pins the fabric lightly
 to the bottom of the saucer. The cigarette ash
 is precarious her dress has five little shoelaces
 white at sternum's end. Margherita
 Maccapani Missoni is happy. Sophia Barclay
 has a grey cardigan under which she wears a Disney
 dress. Hayley Bloomingdale is blonde she has
 a kerchief on her head a thin slice of melon
 in her fingers a white strand of pearls
 her bangs are one soft shard that hook her chin.
 She turns like she noticed us following her,
 & ready with her smile meets our eyes Ivanka
 Trump is moving, carefree, through the city. A young
 Thomas Jefferson, Adrea Casiraghi stares proudly at the future
 of the world & finds it splendid, brown hair cascading
 over his wool grey coat his white shirt reveals his
 marshmallow chest which contrasts with his granite
 chin & jaw. Dasha Duhkohva reclines on a
 marble table outlined by hydrangeas in jeans &
 striped shirt a grey trench coat thrown over her body.
 In a little row-boat, in a tank-top
 across which in marker has been written River
 Keeper Amanda Hearst crowned by a loose,
 densely beaded tiara. Black rubber fishing
 boots swallowed her legs. She's drawing an
 enormous black tarp around her torso
 & smiling while her head tilts to the left.





Robinson Walks Museum Mile
 

the ideal city building itself in his brain.
 Is this mile magnificent? He's lived here
  
 a while, but the mile feels unreal. Robinson's
 training himself to act blas. Do museums
  
 amuse me? Yes, but not today. Would he
 like to be in one? Of course. Why not?
  
 An object of value with canvas wings,
 an unchanging face in a gilt frame, arranged--
  
 thoughtless, guilt-free, & preserved
 for eternity. Robinson doesn't want to be
  
 exceptional. He knows he is. He wants to be
 perceived exceptional. Trains plunge by, steam
  
 rising from the grates. Sing, muse! of a man
 ill-met at the Met. A man on his lunch break,
  
 heading for a heartbreak, a break-up with Time.
 A break-up with time? Feeling filled with ice,
  
 the way you chill a glass, Robinson passes
 the National Academy. He craves a sense
  
 of belonging, not to always be longing. To be
 standing in a doorway, incredibly kissable,
  
 not waiting at the four-way, eminently missable.
 Is this mile magnanimous? He wants it
  
 unanimous: that this is his kind of town--
 up & down & including Brooklyn. The sky
  
 is clearing, but the isolation sticks.
 Robinson's not sure what a camera obscura
  
 is for, but he thinks he should have
 his portrait done with one. Faces
  
 blur by as he heads toward the Frick.
 Something used to photograph the obscure.





Robinson Escapes to the Cape for Independence Day
 

O little-know facts--how Robinson attracts them!
  
 Pilgrims rocked ashore here, before Plymouth Rock.
  
 The word scrimshaw is of unknown origin.
  
 The stock name of the archaic two-lane main road? Route 6A. Really
 it's Old King's Highway.
  
 Some facts are useless: the paper bag was invented in Dennis.
  
 Some facts are not: Wellfleet's town clock sings out ship's time.
  
 19th century Americans observed only three holidays. The Fourth of
 July was one.
  
 O witty aperus--how Robinson accrues them!
  
 Good food is self-made, like a good millionaire.
  
 Don't just do something. Stand there.
  
 It's got to be the weekend somewhere.
  
 Robinson is crisp & perspicuous. His wife stands next to him on the
 sand.
  
 Democracy could be a lot more sexy if . . . this one fades in the rockets'
 red glare.
  
 Ann blushes, runs a hand through his hair.
  
 Robinson looks up, concussed.
  
 Fireworks percuss.





Robinsons Telephone Rings
 

the Tuesday after he was last seen.
  
 A policeman is there to pick the shrill thing up.
  
 Who is it? the couple of friends present ask as he cups it to his ear.
  
 Then hangs up. There was no one there.
  
 They have come to recon a vacant property--a mise en scne:
  
 Knoll butterfly chairs--a pair of them--
  
 two red socks soaking in the white bathroom sink,
  
 a saucer of milk for the cat to drink,
  
 a stack of reel-to-reel tapes,
  
 a matchbook from the Italian Village where he ate his last spaghetti
 dinner,
  
 & two books he'd been re-reading, or wanted someone to think he
 had:
  
 The Devils & The Tragic Sense of Life.
  
 Preoccupation & a certain mode of self-presentation.
  
 Even when absent, Robinson has a style.
  
 No wallet, though. No watch, no sleeping bag, no bankbook.
  
 The apartment looks the way it feels to read a newspaper that's one
 day old.
  
 The policeman wants to go back outside, among the lemons & fog &
 barking dogs.
  
 Out where the sun can copper their faces.
  
 Writing takes space, recordings take time.
  
 The place puts the policeman in mind of something he read recently,
 about the collapse of a dead star.
  
 About how it takes ages for the light to become motionless.
  
 Seven years after a disappearance, a person can be pronounced dead.
  
 But that's nothing compared to the size of the ocean.





Meds
 

1.
  
 Living from pill to pill, from bed to couch,
 what doesn't kill me only makes me dizzy.
 Pain dissolves like chalk in water,
 grit on the bottom of the glass.
  
 Waiting takes forever,
 throbs to the soles of my feet, Bella noche . . .
  
 Hives as large as mice hump up under my skin
 ("no more barbiturates for you, Cynthia!)
 --itch, stretch, I don't fit my flesh--
 sting, tingle, prick, the sorcerer's threat.
  
 There's a knife stabbed through my left eye.
 My right foot is made of elephant hide
 and weighs in at roughly one cartload of potatoes.
 Oxygen twenty-four hours; I'm swelled with steroids,
  
 prednisone buzz in the brain; a motel room
 with sixteen foreign workers sleeping in shifts,
 playing reggae at three a.m.
  
  
 2.
  
 Oh I love my white pill
 that makes the black fist of pain unclench,
 unspasming the nerves. I float,
 released to darkness visible,
 worlds dissolving.
  
 And the yellow pill, bitter on my tongue,
 that wakes me at 2 a.m.
 writing out plans in Arabic
 to organize an expedition to the Pole.
 Drug of hubris searing my eyes,
 my scrawl unreadable in daylight: foil my enemies.
  
 Bitter taste of fugue,
 my hand shakes: some foreign being in my brain giving orders.
 You must You must You will.
  
 Later, the pungent brown liquor
 shoots the dark with threads of gold behind my eyes.
 One flash as the mind goes out.
  
  
 3.
  
 I must elude pain
                                                             float past clarity
 pain in the brain
                                                             slammed down like a housefly.
  
 It's a big dodge.
  
 Fly on a stovetop
                                                             sizzle and ash pop.
  
 This is illusion,
                                                                         mental confusion
  
                                                             born in the synapse.
 What can be undone
                                                             down to the last gasp.
 It's a hodgepodge.
  
 If you kill pain
                                                 you will become pain;
  
 pain does not feel pain,
                                                             no nerves in the brain.
  
 It's a mind-fuck.
  
 It's just your bad luck.
  
                                                             A torpor sealed my brain
                                                             I felt no humans near
                                                             it seemed to me I could not feel
                                                             or touch or see or hear.
  
 I don't know who I am
                                                             without my medicine.
 My skin will crawl with bugs
                                                             if I don't get my drugs.
 My brain's a maelstrom,
                                                             singing a sad song.
 Reality is so cruel.
  
 Prednisone oh prednisone
 so fast my mind racing, never tasting
 rest.
  
 Razzle-dazzle razz
  
 Fist bitch piss stitch witch . . .
                                                             (only wait, the fit will pass.)
  
 fast, gash, lash, splash--QUIT!
  
 (I saw a werewolf in a white suit, walking
 past the tables at the Full Moon Caf.
 Floppy bow tie, big furry hands.)
  
 Percodan, Percocet, let you go, let you rest.
 When the grip lets you go and you float like a note
 on the flow, there's your life, there's no worry--
 (yeah, it's funky how the night moves.)
  
 Barbiturate babykins, narcotic slut,
 black oil of opiate. Chatty Cathy, dirty brat,
 bed-wetter, nasty pants.
  
 Painkiller, painkiller, I have a new friend,
 better than my old friend,
 plugging holes in the brain:
 Sigmund Freud, Sigmund Freud, Sigmund Freud, Cocaine!
  
 I want a soft landing; let me float.
 Once the seizure lifted me and threw me down.
 I did not like it. I did not like lying there
 on the floor looking up
 through air like green water.

 And there is one so dark, a ghost,
 it passes through the mesh of thought
 without tearing a strand, whispering
 destinies perceived true, pronouncing
 sentences of death.
  
  
 5.
  
 A cloud, the absence of a noun, no name,
 roaring far away in the summer
 dark like a train, or a giant fan, or a highway that never stops.
 The mind explodes in the dark of space,
 unnursed by atmospheres,
 as air raid sirens scream for blood
 and I am only nerves, strung on constellations,
 meridians and vectors quivering. A red and yellow
 capsule invades the chemistry of thought; cathode rays blast
 from the television screen and signals pass deep into space
 until the stars are singing "Rosalita. You
 will not remember this night.





Shot Up in the Sexual Revolution: The True Adventures of Suzy Creamcheese
 

                                               "So, why don't you sleep with girls?                                               "I'm not really attracted to girls.                                                "Are you telling me you were really                                                attracted to every man you slept with?                                                                         Conversation with a friend
1.
  
 After twenty I stopped counting,
 not like my friend Beverly, who sewed
 an embroidered satin star on her bell-bottoms
 for every new guy she fucked.
 She had them running down both legs
 and around the billowing hem,
 and was starting up the inseam
 when the jeans gave out in the wash.
  
 It was a boys' game anyway, those years
 of our extended homage to the penis:
 the guitar playing the penis, drums saluting it,
 cock rock, Molotov cocktail, the motorcycle
 gripped between the thighs, and I went down,
 we all went down, in the old cultural disaster
 of idol worship--a thousand-year bender.
 Only this time it was the adolescent member,
 oiled and laved, thrust forward arcing,
 thin with ache, all tight flesh poked upward,
 claiming its own. How it came and went,
 penetrating but never settling down,
 and how often we were caused to admire it:
 hairless sweet warrior, raider against the State.
  
 But I have this sweet pink flower
 here between my legs--I put my hand down and touch it,
 still soft and wet, and many-folded, endlessly opening,
 hiding, seeking, hidden and sought,
 but never very much admired or even smiled on
 in those years, never served much less sung to.
 Not a garden then but a citadel,
 a wall to be breached, a new land claimed,
 but linger there? No, I would say
 there was an overall lack of appreciation,
  
 though breasts were well respected, slopping loose
 under T-shirts like little animals,
 and I would feel my nipples brush the cotton
 with pleasure, see them regarded also with pleasure.
 Still, sex then was a taking, like spoils of war, a victory
 over all those straight fucks back home, marooned
 in the dismal suburbs that birthed us squalling and red
 and watched us flee in ungrateful cars down night highways.
  
 And God knows it felt good those nights.
 I was ready, it was ready, to open and answer the call.
 And take me down and roll me over, yes, and give
 it to me--but why all this riding away afterward?
  
 Where was everyone going
 and why didn't I get to ride along? Who knew at first
 nothing had changed, just wanting the thrust and tug
 and slam up against the headboard, I should say so,
 but left still wanting more, wanting to leap
 out of centuries' shame and be something new,
 not this old consolation of women for the powerless,
 some kind of cosmic door prize awarded
 just for showing up with a dick,
 some proof to themselves these boys were men.
  
 "You're good, he said. Hell, I wasn't taking a typing test,
 I was fighting to live in a dying world.
 I was throwing myself away, an offering to wildest space,
 surrender to the mind's dissolve, the body's electric light,
 nerve endings firing like exploding stars.
 "You're good, they all said:
 you'd think somebody was doing a survey.
 Girls say yes to boys who say no, and then
 your professor asks if you're wearing underwear,
 when you meet for your conference on the poetry of Yeats.
  
 Crossing the border after midnight in a borrowed car
 after a visit to the after-hours doctor's office in Sarnia.
 Nodding out in the back seat, pills wearing off.
 He was a legend among undergraduates:
 cheap and reliable, always on call,
 until a month later the headlines screamed
 "Abortion Doc! when a girl died in his office
 and he dragged her down to the river
 and dumped her body in the underbrush.





Dirt Cowboy Caf
 

Heart, oh heart,
 I sit here writing your name
 on pieces of paper,
 folded, hidden, misplaced . . .
 found again.
  
 There is the element of saying
 and there is the element of making:
 one needn't choose.
 I am singing the dream out from the ice,
 asking it to carry me
 like a horse or a river, down and away.
  
 This day, here in paned-glass sun:
 the young waitress shaking out her apron
 and retying it flat across her stomach--
 a bit of vanity--her hair swept off her neck,
 crash of a milk bottle
 on the granite counter, cream
 spread in a mild pool toward the rim,
 and the roots of habit and longing
 briefly seized by the mind.
  
 So noisy here! The sound echoes
 out of years, brought to this 
 showing forth, unrehearsed.
 It seems we wake 
 and find ourselves repeating,
 embodying the ancient gestures
 by which we recognize
 ourselves completed.
  
 Not one of us could be born
 and invent life--it must show through us--
 the arm flung in the air, the coffee poured out,
 and down the street, someone hurrying by,
 head down against the wind.
  
 And a man and a woman
 come to an old grief,
 carved in them, carved
 into them
 --the old way of water wearing rock--
 by law, and the hatred
 between them is equal
 to the hope neither will release.
  
 Each wants to be whole,
 to embody all of time, when nothing
 in this world is whole, and
 this is by law.
  
 When my father said bitterly
 to my mother: you have changed,
 he meant, without meaning to say,
 how she had changed him. A man
 holds his head down against the wind.
 Yet the wind fills him
 with the dust of temples,
 the breath of the dead.
  
 The dream of the light
 inside the branches--
 a gleam of wet, glimmer that is a bud,
 the leaf within the bud.
  
 The photographer comes inside
 and closes the lens of his camera.
 Then he is the lens. Then my eye
 is the light. This
 is the element of saying.
 The young waitress flings a paper cup
 behind her, into the trash can.
 That is a saying. The cream swirled
 into the coffee, the sugar
 dissolving, disembodied,
 and the body of the manager disappears,
 swallowed into a doorway.
  
 The element of making is slow,
 uncertain as a temple,
 a falling forward, stitching back,
 like a stone wall, like the panes in an
 arched window, like a repetition
 chosen beyond necessity.
  
 Yet somehow we have seen all this before--
 the girl in the fur hat
 speaking syrup into a phone;
 the falseness of her charm
 is an ancient imposter, familiar and
 therefore true.
 A door is opened and falls
 closed. Suddenly at every table
 someone looks down and is reading--
 books, newspapers, calendars,
 reading tea leaves, reading bones.
  
 A woman in a periwinkle jacket: I am reading
 her shoulders as the day introspects.
 In dream the passive construction
 and the past perfect tense prevail:
 she was being pushed on a swing.
 The woman with many television credits
 gazes out the window, heavy with years,
 forgetting herself, forgetting sorrow,
 the false husband, the crippled child,
 the old plots forgetting,
  
 and it is suddenly lovely, as free as
 something read or dreamed; the young
 waitress with sun on her
 face--her unblemished face--looks up,
 from the middle of eternity, her desire
 immaculate in the moment.
  
 When a word is beautiful
 above all others--your name--
 when a woman appears as a bird of prey
 and we turn away,
 hoping not to be recognized--oh heart!--
  
 when the light on the branches
 flares in a window with no sky,
 this is old story reading us, these are springs
 from words laid down before
 and ahead of us, and in the moment
 we are making an answer.





The Aureole
 

(for E)

               I stop my hand midair.
  
                If I touch her there everything about me will be true.
                The New World discovered without pick or ax.
  
                I will be what Brenda Jones was stoned for in 1969.
                I saw it as a girl but didn't know I was taking in myself.
  
                My hand remembers, treading the watery room,
                just behind the rose-veiled eyes of memory.
  
 Alone in the yard tucked beneath the hood of her car,
 lucky clover all about her feet, green tea-sweet necklace
 for her mud-pie crusty work boots.
  
 She fends off their spit & words with silent two-handed
 twists & turns of her socket wrench. A hurl of sticks &
 stones and only me to whisper for her, from sidewalk far,
  
 break my bones. A grown woman in grease-pocket overalls
 inside her own sexy transmission despite the crowding of
 hurled red hots. Beneath the hood of her candy-apple Camaro:
  
 souped, shiny, low to the ground.
  
                The stars over the Atlantic are dangling
                salt crystals. The room at the Seashell Inn is
                $20 a night; special winter off-season rate.
                No one else here but us and the night clerk,
                five floors below, alone with his cherished
                stack of Spiderman. My lips are red snails
                in a primal search for every constellation
                hiding in the sky of your body. My hand
                waits for permission, for my life to agree
                to be changed, forever. Can Captain Night
                Clerk hear my fingers tambourining you
                there on the moon? Won't he soon climb
                the stairs and bam! on the hood of this car?
                You are a woman with film reels for eyes.
                Years of long talking have brought us to the
                land of the body. Our skin is one endless
                prayer bead of brown. If my hand ever lands,
                I will fly past dreaming Australian Aborigines.
                The old claw hammer and monkey wrench
                that flew at Brenda Jones will fly across the
                yard of ocean at me. A grease rag will be
                thrust into my painter's pants against my
                will. I will never be able to wash or peel
                any of this away. Before the night is over
                someone I do not know will want the keys
                to my '55 silver Thunderbird. He will chase
                me down the street. A gaggle of spooked
                hens will fly up in my grandmother's yard,
                never to lay another egg, just as I am jump-
                ed, kneed, pulled finally to the high ground
                of sweet clover.





Dancing with Strom
 

            I want to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, there's not enough            troops in the army to force the southern people to break            down segregation and accept the Negro [pronounced Nigra]            into our theatres, into our swimming pools, into our homes,            and into our churches.                                    --Strom Thurmond, South Carolina                                    Senator and Presidential Candidate                                         for the States' Rights Party, 1948             I said, "I'm gonna fight Thurmond from the mountain to            the sea.                                     --Modjeska Monteith Simkins, Civil                              Rights Matriarch, South Carolina, 1948
The youngest has been married off.
  
 He is as tall as Abraham Lincoln. Here, on his
 wedding day, he flaunts the high spinning laugh
 of a newly freed slave. I stand above him, just
 off the second-floor landing, watching
 the celebration unfold.
  
 Uncle-cousins, bosom buddies, convertible cars
 of nosy paramours, strolling churlish penny-
 pinchers pour onto the mansion estate. Below,
 Strom Thurmond is dancing with my mother.
  
 The favorite son of South Carolina has already
 danced with the giddy bride and the giddy bride's
 mother. More women await: Easter dressy,
 drenched in caramel, double exposed, triple cinched,
 lined up, leggy, ready.
  
 I refuse to leave the porch.
  
 If I walk down I imagine he will extend his
 hand, assume I am next in his happy darky line,
 #427 on his dance card. His history
 and mine, burnt cork and blackboard chalk,
 concentric, pancaked, one face, two histories,
 slow dragging, doing the nasty.
  
 My father knows all this.
  
 Daddy's Black Chief Justice legs straddle the boilerplate
 carapace of the CSS H. L. Hunley, lost Confederate
 submarine, soon to be found just off the coast of
 Charleston. He keeps it fully submerged by
 applying the weight of every treatise he has
 ever written against the death penalty of
 South Carolina. Chanting "Briggs v. Elliott,
 he keeps the ironside door of the submarine shut.
 No hands.
  
 His eyes are a Black father's beacon, search-
 lights blazing for the married-off sons, and
 on the unmarried, whale-eyed nose-in-book
 daughter, born unmoored, quiet, yellow,
 strategically placed under hospital lights to
 fully bake. The one with the most to lose.
  
 There will be no trouble. Still, he chain-
 smokes. A burning stick of mint & Indian
 leaf seesaws between his lips. He wants
 me to remember that trouble is a fire that
 runs like a staircase up then down. Even
 on a beautiful day in June.
  
 I remember the new research just out:
 What the Negro gave America
 Chapter 9,206:
  
 Enslaved Africans gifted porches to North
 America. Once off the boats they were told,
 then made, to build themselves a place--to live.
  
 They build the house that will keep them alive.
  
 Rather than be the bloody human floret on
 yet another southern tree, they imagine higher
 ground. They build landings with floor enough
 to see the trouble coming. Their arced imaginations
 nail the necessary out into the floral air. On the
 backs and fronts of twentypenny houses,
 a watching place is made for the ones who will
 come tipping with torch & hog tie through the
 quiet woods, hoping to hang them as decoration
 in the porcupine hair of longleaf.
  
 The architecture of Black people is sui generis.
 This is architecture dreamed by the enslaved:
  
 Their design will be stolen.
 Their wits will outlast gold.
 My eyes seek historical rest from the kiss-
 kiss theater below; Strom Thurmond's
 it's-never-too-late-to-forgive-me chivaree.
 I search the tops of yellow pine while my
 fingers reach, catch, pinch my father's
 determined-to-rise smoke.
  
 Long before AC African people did the
 math: how to cool down the hot air of
 South Carolina?
  
 If I could descend, without being trotted
 out by some roughrider driven by his
 submarine dreams, this is what I'd take
 my time and scribble into the three-tiered,
 white crme wedding cake:
  
 Filibuster. States' Rights. The Grand Inquisition
 of the great Thurgood Marshall. This wedding
 reception would not have been possible without
 the Civil Rights Act of 1957 (opposed by
 you-know-who).
  
 The Dixiecrat senator has not worn his
 sandy seersucker fedora to the vows.
 The top of Strom Thurmond's bald head
 reveals a birthmark tattooed in contrapposto
 pose: Segregation Forever.
  
 All my life he has been the face of hatred;
 the blue eyes of the Confederate flag,
 the pasty bald of white men pulling wooly
 heads up into the dark skirts of trees,
 the sharp, slobbering, amber teeth of
 German shepherds, still clenched inside
 the tissue-thin, (still marching), band-leader
 legs of Black schoolteachers, the single-
 minded pupae growing between the legs of
 white boys crossing the tracks, ready to
 force Black girls into fifth-grade positions,
 Palmetto state-sanctioned sex 101.
  
 I didn't want to dance with him.
  
 My young cousin arrives at my elbow.
 Her beautiful lips the color of soft-skin
 mangoes. She pulls, teasing the stitches
 of my satin bridesmaid gown, "You better
 go on down there and dance with Strom--
 while he still has something left.
  
 I don't tell her it is unsouthern for her
 to call him by his first name, as if they
 are familiar. I don't tell her: To bear
 witness to marriage is to believe that
 everything moving through the sweet
 wedding air can be confidently, left--
 to Love.
  
 I stand on the landing high above the
 beginnings of Love, holding a plastic
 champagne flute, drinking in the warm
 June air of South Carolina. I hear my 
 youngest brother's top hat joy. Looking
 down I find him, deep in the giddy crowd,
 modern, integrated, interpretive.
  
 For ten seconds I consider dancing with
 Strom. His Confederate hands touch
 every shoulder, finger, back that I love.
 I listen to the sound of Black laughter
 shimmying. All worry floats beyond
 the gurgling submarine bubbles,
 the white railing, every drop of 
 champagne air.
  
 I close my eyes and Uncle Freddie
 appears out of a baby's breath of fog.
 (The dead are never porch bound.)
 He moves with ease where I cannot. 
 He walks out on the rice-thrown air,
 heaving a lightning bolt instead of
 a wave. Suddenly, there is a table set,
 complete with 1963 dining room stars,
 they twinkle twinkle up & behind him.
 Thelonious, Martin, Malcolm, Nina,
 Dakota, all mouths Negro wide &
 open have come to sing me down.
 His tattered almanac sleeps curled like
 a wintering slug in his back pocket.
 His dark Dogon eyes jet to the scene
 below, then zoom past me until they are
 lost in the waning sugilite sky. Turning
 in the shadows of the wheat fields,
 he whispers a truth plucked from
 the foreword tucked in his back pocket:
 Veritas: Black people will forgive you
 quicker than you can say Orangeburg
 Massacre.
  
 History does not keep books on the
 handiwork of slaves. But the enslaved
 who built this Big House, long before
 I arrived for this big wedding, knew
 the power of a porch.
  
 This native necessity of nailing down
 a place, for the cooling off of air,
 in order to lift the friendly, the kindly,
 the so politely, the in-love-ly, jubilant,
 into the arms of the grand peculiar,
 for the greater good of
 the public spectacular:
  
 us 
 giving us
 away.





Renascence
 

All I could see from where I stood
 Was three long mountains and a wood;
 I turned and looked another way,
 And saw three islands in a bay.
 So with my eyes I traced the line 
 Of the horizon, thin and fine,
 Straight around till I was come
 Back to where I'd started from; 
 And all I saw from where I stood
 Was three long mountains and a wood.
  
 Over these things I could not see;
 These were the things that bounded me;
 And I could touch them with my hand,
 Almost, I thought, from where I stand.
 And all at once things seemed so small
 My breath came short, and scarce at all.
  
 But, sure, the sky is big, I said;
 Miles and miles above my head;
 So here upon my back I'll lie
 And look my fill into the sky.
 And so I looked, and, after all,
 The sky was not so very tall.
 The sky, I said, must somewhere stop,
 And--sure enough!--I see the top! 
 The sky, I thought, is not so grand;
 I 'most could touch it with my hand!
 And reaching up my hand to try,
 I screamed to feel it touch the sky.
  
 I screamed, and--lo!--Infinity
 Came down and settled over me;
 Forced back my scream into my chest,
 Bent back my arm upon my breast,
 And, pressing of the Undefined
 The definition on my mind,
 Held up before my eyes a glass
 Through which my shrinking sight did pass
 Until it seemed I must behold
 Immensity made manifold;
 Whispered to me a word whose sound
 Deafened the air for worlds around,
 And brought unmuffled to my ears
 The gossiping of friendly spheres,
 The creaking of the tented sky,
 The ticking of Eternity.
  
 I saw and heard, and knew at last
 The How and Why of all things, past,
 And present, and forevermore.
 The Universe, cleft to the core,
 Lay open to my probing sense
 That, sick'ning, I would fain pluck thence
 But could not,--nay! But needs must suck
 At the great wound, and could not pluck
 My lips away till I had drawn
 All venom out.--Ah, fearful pawn!
 For my omniscience paid I toll
 In infinite remorse of soul.
  
 All sin was of my sinning, all
 Atoning mine, and mine the gall
 Of all regret. Mine was the weight 
 Of every brooded wrong, the hate
 That stood behind each envious thrust,
 Mine every greed, mine every lust.
  
 And all the while for every grief,
 Each suffering, I craved relief
 With individual desire,--
 Craved all in vain! And felt fierce fire
 About a thousand people crawl;
 Perished with each,--then mourned for all!
  
 A man was starving in Capri;
 He moved his eyes and looked at me;
 I felt his gaze, I heard his moan,
 And knew his hunger as my own.
 I saw at sea a great fog bank
 Between two ships that struck and sank;
 A thousand screams the heavens smote;
 And every scream tore through my throat.
  
 No hurt I did not feel, no death
 That was not mine; mine each last breath
 That, crying, met an answering cry
 From the compassion that was I.
 All suffering mine, and mine its rod;
 Mine, pity like the pity of God.
  
 Ah, awful weight! Infinity
 Pressed down upon the finite Me!
 My anguished spirit, like a bird,
 Beating against my lips I heard;
 Yet lay the weight so close about
 There was no room for it without.
 And so beneath the weight lay I
 And suffered death, but could not die.
  
 Long had I lain thus, craving death,
 When quietly the earth beneath
 Gave way, and inch by inch, so great
 At last had grown the crushing weight,
 Into the earth I sank till I
 Full six feet under ground did lie,
 And sank no more,--there is no weight
 Can follow here, however great.
 From off my breast I felt it roll,
 And as it went my tortured soul
 Burst forth and fled in such a gust
 That all about me swirled the dust.
  
 Deep in the earth I rested now;
 Cool is its hand upon the brow
 And soft its breast beneath the head
 Of one who is so gladly dead.
 And all at once, and over all
 The pitying rain began to fall;
 I lay and heard each pattering hoof
 Upon my lowly, thatched roof,
 And seemed to love the sound far more
 Than ever I had done before.
 For rain it hath a friendly sound
 To one who's six feet underground;
 And scarce the friendly voice or face:
 A grave is such a quiet place.
  
 The rain, I said, is kind to come
 And speak to me in my new home.
 I would I were alive again
 To kiss the fingers of the rain,
 To drink into my eyes the shine
 Of every slanting silver line,
 To catch the freshened, fragrant breeze
 From drenched and dripping apple-trees.
 For soon the shower will be done,
 And then the broad face of the sun
 Will laugh above the rain-soaked earth
 Until the world with answering mirth
 Shakes joyously, and each round drop
 Rolls, twinkling, from its grass-blade top.
  
 How can I bear it; buried here,
 While overhead the sky grows clear
 And blue again after the storm?
 O, multi-colored, multiform,
 Beloved beauty over me,
 That I shall never, never see
 Again! Spring-silver, autumn-gold,
 That I shall never more behold!
 Sleeping your myriad magics through,
 Close-sepulchred away from you!
 O God, I cried, give me new birth,
 And put me back upon the earth!
 Upset each cloud's gigantic gourd
 And let the heavy rain, down-poured
 In one big torrent, set me free,
 Washing my grave away from me!
  
 I ceased; and through the breathless hush
 That answered me, the far-off rush
 Of herald wings came whispering
 Like music down the vibrant string
 Of my ascending prayer, and--crash!
 Before the wild wind's whistling lash
 The startled storm-clouds reared on high
 And plunged in terror down the sky,
 And the big rain in one black wave
 Fell from the sky and struck my grave.
  
 I know not how such things can be;
 I only know there came to me
 A fragrance such as never clings
 To aught save happy living things;
 A sound as of some joyous elf
 Singing sweet songs to please himself,
 And, through and over everything,
 A sense of glad awakening.
 The grass, a-tiptoe at my ear,
 Whispering to me I could hear;
 I felt the rain's cool finger-tips
 Brushed tenderly across my lips,
 Laid gently on my sealed sight,
 And all at once the heavy night
 Fell from my eyes and I could see,--
 A drenched and dripping apple-tree,
 A last long line of silver rain,
 A sky grown clear and blue again.
 And as I looked a quickening gust
 Of wind blew up to me and thrust
 Into my face a miracle
 Of orchard-breath, and with the smell,--
 I know not how such things can be!--
 I breathed my soul back into me.
  
 Ah! Up then from the ground sprang I
 And hailed the earth with such a cry
 As is not heard save from a man
 Who has been dead, and lives again.
 About the trees my arms I wound;
  
 Like one gone mad I hugged the ground;
 I raised my quivering arms on high;
 I laughed and laughed into the sky,
 Till at my throat a strangling sob
 Caught fiercely, and a great heart-throb
 Sent instant tears into my eyes;
 O God, I cried, no dark disguise
 Can e'er hereafter hide from me
 Thy radiant identity!
  
 Thou canst not move across the grass
 But my quick eyes will see Thee pass,
 Nor speak, however silently,
 But my hushed voice will answer Thee.
 I know the path that tells Thy way
 Through the cool eve of every day;
 God, I can push the grass apart
 And lay my finger on Thy heart!
  
 The world stands out on either side
 No wider than the heart is wide;
 Above the world is stretched the sky,--
 No higher than the soul is high.
 The heart can push the sea and land
 Farther away on either hand;
 The soul can split the sky in two,
 And let the face of God shine through.
 But East and West will pinch the heart
 That can not keep them pushed apart;
 And he whose soul is flat--the sky
 Will cave in on him by and by. 
  





Cairo
 

The evidence was in and it went to the contrary.
The contrary wound around us rather like a river.
The river reacted, spider-like, tangling up its legs
with other wet parts we thought we knew,
such as creeks and fjords and deltas and such.

A beaver sits on the riverbank watching all of this unfold.
He doesn't know what a fjord is, and he doesn't care
for other waters, or even other beavers, or the merest
hint of other business, so he removes this evidence.

Then he builds a structure which for years he is rehabbing.
Inside it is hollow and there is his nest.
He is a dark little bastard, all the same.
The water had a fine way of being, now it is tortured
by these nests and their vassal.

Yet the river doesn't overthrow the beaver.
Quite the contrary. The river goes around polite as a snake.
It argues a tiny bit at the edges of the lodge,
where young beavers could be napping.

You and I would let loose a flood of tears. Not the river.
You and I would seep hotly into our darkest places.
Not the river. It is a long way from home
and has that on its mind, the day of rising,
when the temples will all be cleansed
and the whole unfathomable truth will out.

According to the waters. According to their book.





Spellbound
 

Two women on a train
sit beside me.

I am young and the world
is flying and I am watching.

One of them is frosty.
The other turns like a leaf

to hand me something--
it looked for all the world like a page.

I thought at the time
that it needed me and I was right.

The letters fell into place
and simple flowers grew.

Now it talks unceasingly
in long white verses

as if at a wedding,
something women understand

and gently want and then regift.
I myself agree with Herbert,

who in a dark mood conjured
the mushrooms underfoot

unseen by bride or groom
and with him I say, Perhaps

the world is unimportant
after all, though this is not

what one discusses with
women on a train, no matter

how long the journey,
or untroubled the land.





Gravitas
 

The overweight, overnight parts
that came to me in a dream.

Their clothes no longer fit,
it was this that brought them
to me crying, their faces twitching.

That had to end. No, they said,
it didn't. So I rolled over to ghosts 
that couldn't dent a pillow.

The clock shed. Night pulled its
burdens into harbor and I woke,
glad for the day, its telltale light,

its flying minute, that genie work,
and the everlasting perturbations
of my people, their glories,

their heavy last words,
and for these, I rose.





Countermeasures
 

I wish I could keep my thoughts in order
and my ducks in a row.
I wish I could keep my ducks in a thought
or my thoughts in a duck.
My point is that we all exist, wetly, in the hunt.
The ducks are aware of this
in their own way, which is floating.
The way of the mind is brevity.
There may be other thoughts on other days
in the minds of other and better men
and their constant companions, the women,
but these same tidy capsules--never.
This is just one of the things
I noticed about my thoughts
as they passed easefully by.





Moves in the Field
 

Had to come in out of the people,
they blew me about so.
Was told of the life taking place
elsewhere. Went to check on that,
flying late and low over the west.

Saw no house, no shade.
Sat down on the damp bank
on the far shore at the left
edge of the world, against which
the sea endlessly lapped.

So now there were two of us,
who beat the world by
day and caressed it by night
and the world didn't say
yea and she didn't say nay.





Nocturne
 

Last night in bed
I mouthed a prayer
of my own composition.

It sounded offhand, it was carelessly
addressed, it twisted my meaning
entirely, it left an ache,
I didn't know what I was doing.

So I took down my yellowed copy
of French With Pictures
by the late literary critic I.A. Richards
and I put my petition
into soft French words.

I.A. Richards believed that irony
was the language of redemption.
He wrote and lectured famously on this,
but his masterpiece was French With Pictures.
"The chapeau is on the table.
"The man with the beard stands before the window.
"She comes from a village by the sea.

There is no improving the old traditions.
They are already mortal, partial, and wrong.
The woman at the table by the window
puts her head into her hands.
"Into your hands, she said.





A Vase
 

There was a vase
that held the world's riches, but it wasn't cheap.
It cost a dime--and this in a time and place

when dimes were sizable, especially for
a girl of eight whose construction-worker father
was unemployed. The old metaphor

was literal in this case and she
counted her pennies till there were ten--
then embarked on a mission of great secrecy,

a purchase whose joys ran so deep,
seventy years later, as she told the tale again,
her face flushed. It was a birthday gift for her mother. 


There was a race
of people heretofore glimpsed only on hanging scrolls
in library books. They were on the vase-- 

the smallest whole figures imaginable,
purposeful and industrious
as they fished or planted rice or hiked a hill 

whose spiral trail led to a temple perched upon
a crag between cloud and waterfall.
They were a vision exported from Japan--

a country far as the moon, and far more beautiful,
whose artists grasped an eight-year-old girl's soul's
need for the minutely amplitudinous.


There was a place
(Detroit, the thirties) now slipped from sight,
though here and there I'll catch some holdover trace--

maybe the grille on an old apartment door, 
or a slumped block of houses, draped
in torn sheets of rain, apparently posing for 

black-and-white photographs. Even the out-
of-a-job, men like my grandfather, donned hats back then
before leaving the house--to circle endlessly about,

as if a lost job were a lost coin that might 
yet be found on the street where it had been dropped, 
making them whole again.


There was a face,
rucked with care, that would dreamily soften
if talk floated off toward some remote someplace

beyond the seas. My grandmother had a yen for the faraway
(which she imparted to her daughter),
even as her life was tethered between a gray

icy motionless Midwestern city--
stalled like a car with a frozen ignition--
and a Tennessee farm without electricity. 

(She did once see Washington--cherry season--and often 
spoke of those long pink walkways beside the water 
that were Japan's gift to a grateful nation.)


There is a vase--
a piece of gimcrack that somehow 
made its way to a crowded curio case

in a small souvenir shop
in Detroit, seventy-plus years ago--
which today stands atop 

the mantel in the apartment in DC
where my fading mother is now living.
When she was eight, in 1933,

she gave it to my grandmother, who 
for all her poverty bequeathed her daughter so 
rich a bounty, including a taste for giving:


the gift of grace. 
It seems a little miracle
almost--that it's intact, the little vase,

conveying what its makers set out to convey:
an inward island spared by Time,
by the times. These days, she can scarcely say

who she gave it to, or on what occasion.
A--birthday? The pilgrim climbs the winding hill
forever, station by station,

and "Isn't it beautiful?
she asks. "You bought it for a dime,
I tell her. It holds the world's riches still.





Letter to a Lost Friend
 

There must be a Russian word to describe what has happened
              between us, like ostyt, which can be used
for a cup of tea that is too hot, but after you walk to the next room,
              and return, it is too cool; or perekhotet, 
which is to want something so much over months
              and even years that when you get it, you have lost 
the desire. Pushkin said, when he saw his portrait by Kiprensky, 
              "It is like looking into a mirror, but one that flatters me. 
What is the word for someone who looks into her friend's face
              and sees once smooth skin gone like a train that has left
the station in Petersburg with its wide avenues and nights
              at the Stray Dog Cafe, sex with the wrong men,
who looked so right by candlelight, when everyone was young
              and smoked hand-rolled cigarettes, painted or wrote
all night but nothing good, drank too much vodka, and woke
              in the painful daylight with skin like fresh cream, books
everywhere, Lorca on Gogol, Tolstoy under Madame de Svign, 
              so that now, on a train in the taiga of Siberia,
I see what she sees--all my books alphabetized and on shelves, 
              feet misshapen, hands ribbed with raised veins,
neck crumpled like last week's newspaper, while her friends 
              are young, their skin pimply and eyes bright as puppies',
and who can blame her, for how lucky we are to be loved 
              for even a moment, though I can't help but feel like Pushkin, 
a rough ball of lead lodged in his gut, looking at his books 
              and saying, "Goodbye, my dear friends, as those volumes 
close and turn back into oblong blocks, dust clouding 
              the gold leaf that once shimmered on their spines.





Three Persons
 

The fields are infertile
as far as I can tell.
Their winter systems
sparkle like the diamonds
that pelt Neptune.

Limpid silvers
reflect in the dark
museums and theaters 
back in town.

To them we run
to elevate our eyes 
to a well-shaped ethics.
Colors are supplied
by our nervous minds.



Towards a just
and invisible image
behind each substance
and its place in a sentence
you must have been walking.

Well-defended, best
when lost from wanting.

Be like grass, she told me,
lie flat, spring up.



We drop the shadows where they are then 
return to them
when the light has grown heavy.

You'll take your time lugging the weight into our room.
Or stand over there in the shade.

We've never been too sure that we exist as the earth does.
We're most at home in water 
that soaks up the letters in our brains.

It could be we have been dry too long.

A spirit is a mess when excess spoils it. 



I see them through the slats
and crack of the open window.
A cold rain. Leaves flipped
and palsied.

The river is brown near
the sand, loose banks and twigs
stick at the edge and a lilac's
silhouette of a child I love.


How in the dark hole can I hide
if I can't get outside?


Then I won't remember
what I did to deserve it.


That arch and bridge
will form a shape of repentance. 

If I'm hanging,
then judgment has been passed.

And I am hanging

upside down
head swinging towards the moon.

Years of inversion.
A face in a mirror displaced 
by its position outside silver.

And so?
Next will come muscle,
a little grief but no shoulder.



You're learning how to be a unit
with an infinite in its attic.

It's not difficult. 

Light is the last message.


White streaks like oil paint
are the first to appear along the wet railing. 

Next similar colors 
correspond by chance.


We would rather be (die) with total strangers than with partial ones
      we realized in the elevator going down. 
It was the only time that day that we were as alone as we were awake.


Sensing a just
and impartial ghost
close to each living thing
I could see the genius

of institutional religion.
Examine your conscience.
Confess in darkness
and take away a task.

Soon you'll wash off flesh
scented by its parallel past.
What were your feet thinking in their hurry
to connect the parts?

Get the children to the other side!
What children? You were the one running.

There was never any other.





The Gargantuan Muffin Beauty Contest
 

We were at the Edison Hotel on West 47th Street
for the annual muffin beauty contest-- 
I can't tell you how pumped up we were.
Times Square was having another psychotic judder.
The bellhop was all thumbs up: Sir, have a nice day 
and get one gratis. All those avenues of doors
and the Hispanic chambermaid who couldn't speak English.
Spider-Man was doing all that Spider-Man shit 
just to get a bird's eye view. Donna Summer
was almost dead and we were barely into spring.
I want to dance to "Love to Love You Baby, I want to groan.
I've never seen so many high-quality muffins.
If I wasn't a religious man, and maybe I wasn't
I would have said the muffins were walking on water:
I've never felt so half-and-half. Have you read the Bible? 
The bellhop said: You ain't seen muffin yet. 
They were drifting in from Queens, Brooklyn, Harlem, 
The Bronx, Manhattan muffins too and that weird 
cute coke-faced muffin who'd taken the subway 
from Coney Island. If only I were a betting man, 
but hey I am a betting man, it's Coney Island every time. 
Lou Reed isn't getting any younger. Zappa said,
Girl you thought he was a man but he was a muffin,
he hung around till you found he didn't know nuthin'.
In the lobby Nina Simone was singing, I Loves You Muffin
and in the restroom they piped in "Mack the Knife: 
Hey Suky Tawdry, Jenny Diver, Polly Peachum
and old Miss Lulu Brown. Muffin The Romance 
was the biggest show in town. We were hurtling back
to the 1970s and sometimes the 1970s are almost 
as good as the 1930s. I want my muffins to be ahistorical: 
shit just to say ahistorical makes me joyful. 
I saw Leonard Cohen crooning with a couple 
of octogenarian muffins and I'm telling you now 
the lobby was pleasantly disturbing. You may find 
yourself behind the wheel of a large automobile.
You may find yourself in another part of the world.
You may find yourself at the gargantuan muffin beauty contest
and you may ask yourself, Well, how did I get here?
Times Square was having another psychotic judder.
Love is in the air, it's in the whisper of the trees.
This is not America, this is the cover version:
sun, sex, sin, divine intervention, death and destruction,
welcome to The Sodom and Gomorrah Show.
All those white muffins trying to be black muffins!
Give us our daily muffin, save us from temptation.
Jimmy Buffett was singing, Why don't we get drunk
and screw? In Times Square the most beautiful muffins
in the world were hanging on a thousand screens.
Where are my singing Tibetan balls? Am I dead?





Ode to the Belt Sander & This Cocobolo Sapwood
 

The belt kicks on with a whir & the whir
licks the end grain of the offcut with a hint

of hesitation. A small wind of ochre dust
sweeps off the belt before the belt comes back

to where it was. The whole room swells
with the scent of cinnamon & desire.

How imprecise the smell of desire.

The wood takes on a sheen, a gloss
the grain can live behind without worry

of being forgotten. A single knot blinks
out of the small block and becomes

the eye of a hummingbird, its beak
bending around the edge of the wood,

its small song captured in the annular rings. 
To think, this block was tossed in

with the scraps. That the bird
could have been lost. Or burned.





Ode to the Gain
 

gain -- a bevel cut into plank ends in traditional lapstrake boat construction that allows otherwise lapped planks to lay flush at stem and transom.
There's the paring chisel's purpose 
in the steamed cedar strake, its long warp 

laid strong against the bench,
whose pocked surface is the book 

of what has already been made,
or marred in learning's wake -- & clamped 

now in the jaws one is 
waiting for its match, for the chisel to elaborate

the pencil's scribed hypothesis, under which
lies another path, & through a tilting eye

the curving bevel's made, the chisel rolling
back tight scrolls of thinnest grain & what bright 

sleeves begin to fleece the floor; there is a lack
given to the wood, some short song cut loose

from the lignin's name, that a longer &
more buoyant melody be made.





Ode to the Steam Box
 

The steam box is used for bending frames and planks in traditional boatbuilding.
With a match I became a man 
who summoned diesel

from the yellow caverns
of a ten-gallon jug, called the flame

now hissing out the hose 
at the small house of water, that

rusted drum from which travels
an excruciating wetness -- this

is what makes the body 
otherwise, what makes it

sing. To take that 
which has decided on a shape, 

and bend, without breaking, 
the lengthening fibers. To give 

the straight thing curve. 
To make of the tree a song 

grown long in a linseed skin,
the slick hot strake waiting 

to become parcel 
of the round world again.





End Grain
 

is an opening, is all 
we can see 

of the long
strands that make

the pathways for 
rays, bisecting 

annular rings, 
the most

vulnerable door
of what makes

the holiest of
things.





Strange Little Prophets
 

When is the smell of a blackberry tree
a harbinger of violent movement
rather than simply the recollection of
a childhood Sunday dress hem-dipped
in mud, handprinted with juice and seeds?
Hard to say. A mind, when playing tricks
is at its most sincere--at home raking
through the body's history, repeating
the strange and nostalgic. The taste of
dirty copper, the imagined cockroach
in the corner, the sluggish slow of the clock
-- doctors call these strange little prophets
warning signs of a seizure, synaptic misfires
looming like a song discordant, until the body
-- an unplucked string -- is finally strummed.





Not for You, Not for the World
 

          
          Because a little reprieve, a little hope (even for those whom I love)would exculpate the world of its actions, I hold to logic steadfast.Belief, without knowledge, dislodges perception of all the empirical world-- (even for you, mom and dad). Know that if, for you, on some filthy lieI could wish for the mind's persistence after death, I would say no.
        




My Dad, in America
 

Your hand on my jaw
              but gently

and that picture of you
punching through snow
              to bring two deer, a gopher,

and a magpie 
to the old Highwalker woman

who spoke only Cheyenne
              and traced our footprints

on leather she later chewed to soften. 
              We need to know in America there is still blood

for forgiveness. 
Dead things for the new day.





Hesperus
 

My four-year-old daughter handed me a card. 
To Daddy written on the front
and inside a rough field 
of five-pointed lights, and the words
You're my favorite Daddy in the stars.

In this western night we all light the sky
like Vega, Deneb, Altair, Albireo, 
the Summer Triangle, 
Cygnus the Swan, our hair 
tangled with wood and gravel, 
our eyes like vacant docks
that beckon every boat.

Tell me about the word
stars, I said.

Oh, she said. Sorry. 
I didn't know
how to spell world.





I Dont Buy It
 

I don't buy it, says

the scientist.

Replies the frail

and faithful heart,

it's not for sale.





Bane
 

Full of strength and laced
with fragility:

the thoroughbred,
the hummingbird,
and all things
cursed
with agility.





If Youre Crowish
 

If you're crowish and you know it
give a caw

Caaaw

If you're weighted and you bear it
send a moo

Moooo

If you're owl and you dreamed it,
give a hoo

Hoooo

If you're thirsty and you mean it
breathe an ahhh

Ahhhh

You are putty in my hands

said the wind 

to the stone 

said the dawn 

to the bloom 

said the dark 

to the moon.





Proverbial
 

It's always darkest before the leopard's kiss.

Where there's smoke there is emphasis. 

A bird in the hand is bound for the stove.

The pen is no mightier than the soul. 

Never underestimate the nib of corruption. 

Better late than suffer the long introduction.

All work and no play is the way of the sloth.

If you can dream it bring the child the moth. 

He is not wise that parrots the wise.

All that glitters has been revised. 

An idle mind is a sign of the time.

The less things change the more we doubt design.





A Lizard in Spanish Valley
 

A lizard does not make a sound,
it has no song,
it does not share my love affairs
with flannel sheets,
bearded men, interlocking
silver rings, the moon, 
the sea, or ink.

But sitting here the afternoon,
I've come to believe
we do share a love affair
and a belief--
in wink, blink, stone,
and heat. 
Also, air.

This is not a fable,
nor is it bliss. 

Impatience,
remember this.





The Fishermens Farewell
 

Their long stares mark them apart; eyes gone 
to sea-colors: gray, foam-flecked 

and black in the undertow, blue 
as the blue banners of the mackerel, whipping west.

On land, they are smoke-walkers, where each stone 
is a standing stone, every circle a stone circle.

They would be rumor if they could, in this frozen
landscape like a stopped sea, from the great stone keels

of Callanish to the walls of Dunnottar and Drum. 
They would be less even than rumor: 

to be ocean-stealers, to never throw a shadow --
to dream the blank horizon and dread the sight of land.

The drink storms through these men, uncompasses 
them, till they're all at sea again.

Their houses, heeled over in the sand: 
each ruin now a cairn for kites.

And down by the quay
past empty pots, unmended nets, and boats:

this tiny bar, where men sleep upright
in their own element, as seals.





Their Pleas
 

They pluck my sleeve, tug my hand, pull
my hair. They do not kneel to kiss my hem.
No, it's not like that but they want tokens.
Again, not souvenirs but something small
and useful, something that will help them out
after life, maybe in an underworld.
They need a sighted guide to lead them to
the river, and they need a remnant of
the old world as they embark for the older world,
the one that has existed since the first
grievous death. They need to feel they still
can touch and still be touched, as once they did
and were, and one would have to be a cold,
uncaring woman to deny their pleas:
a woman with a bulletproof heart,
without a memory of life on earth.





I like to see it lap the Miles - (383)
 

I like to see it lap the Miles -
And lick the Valleys up - 
And stop to feed itself at Tanks - 
And then - prodigious step

Around a Pile of Mountains - 
And supercilious peer
In Shanties - by the sides of Roads - 
And then a Quarry pare

To fit it's sides
And crawl between
Complaining all the while
In horrid - hooting stanza - 
Then chase itself down Hill - 

And neigh like Boanerges - 
Then - prompter than a Star
Stop - docile and omnipotent
At it's own stable door - 





New Kind of Light
 

I move my hands
 in these woods
 to find her sex-parts.
  
 We discover our sex-parts
 make heat
 and blue light.
  
 We become outlines of ourselves--
  
 long scratches
 in the sky.
  
 We have a daughter
 who was never born.
  
 She lives in the house
 we never built,
  
 but in this new light,
 you can almost see
 its tattered roof.





The Abandoned Hotel
 

Inside the woods is an abandoned hotel.
 Trees grow in the lobby
 and up through the rooms.
 Limbs jut out through the windows.
 It looks like outside
 inside.
  
 I climb the trees
 through 1000 rooms.
  
 I look for you
 in each of them.
  
 You're a long shiny line.





The Fire Cycle
 

There are trees and they are on fire. There are hummingbirds and they are on fire. There are graves and they are on fire and the things coming out of the graves are on fire. The house you grew up in is on fire. There is a gigantic trebuchet on fire on the edge of a crater and the crater is on fire. There is a complex system of tunnels deep underneath the surface with only one entrance and one exit and the entire system is filled with fire. There is a wooden cage we're trapped in, too large to see, and it is on fire. There are jaguars on fire. Wolves. Spiders. Wolf-spiders on fire. If there were people. If our fathers were alive. If we had a daughter. Fire to the edges. Fire in the river beds. Fire between the mattresses of the bed you were born in. Fire in your mother's belly. There is a little boy wearing a fire shirt holding a baby lamb. There is a little girl in a fire skirt asking if she can ride the baby lamb like a horse. There is you on top of me with thighs of fire while a hot red fog hovers in your hair. There is me on top of you wearing a fire shirt and then pulling the fire shirt over my head and tossing it like a fireball through the fog at a new kind of dinosaur. There are meteorites disintegrating in the atmosphere just a few thousand feet above us and tiny fireballs are falling down around us, pooling around us, forming a kind of fire lake which then forms a kind of fire cloud. There is this feeling I get when I am with you. There is our future house burning like a star on the hill. There is our dark flickering shadow. There is my hand on fire in your hand on fire, my body on fire above your body on fire, our tongues made of ash. We are rocks on a distant and uninhabitable planet. We have our whole life ahead of us.





The Animal Spell
 

Someone once told me that animals are people under spells, and if you fall in love with them the spell will be lifted. I recently fell in love with a black trumpeter swan. I watched her ruffle her neck feathers for hours, watched her peck bugs from her breast. I was sure she would make a beautiful bride, but she was always a black trumpeter swan. I once brushed a horse's hair for 3 straight years until it crumpled into death. The truth is there is no such thing as spells. The world is always as it is, and always as it seems. And love is just our own kind voice that we whisper into our own blood.





Squirrel Problem
 

I watch a squirrel get run over by a car on my walk to work. She is lying dead in the street and still has an acorn in her little hands. I am amazed at how she is able to hold on to her acorn after being tumbled like that, after bouncing so high off the street. I walk over to the squirrel and see that her face is blown to bits and looks like uncased sausage spilling onto the asphalt. But that acorn is still so tight in her hands. I pick her up by her tail, take off my dress shirt and swaddle her in it, then put her in my bag. I know right where she is as I walk into work, everybody looking at me, everybody asking me about my shirtlessness. The world is as steady as if it were sewn into the skin of the universe.





The One About the Robbers
 

You tell me a joke about two robbers who hide from the police. One robber hides as a sack of cats and the other robber hides as a sack of potatoes. That is the punch line somehow, the sack of potatoes, but all I can think about is how my dad used to throw me over his shoulder when I was very small and call me his sack of potatoes. I've got a sack of potatoes he would yell, spinning around in a circle, the arm not holding me reaching out for a sale. Does anyone want to buy my sack of potatoes? No one ever wanted to buy me. We were always the only two people in the room.





Rendezvous with America
 


                                                      I
  
 Time unhinged the gates
 Of Plymouth Rock and Jamestown and Ellis Island,
 And worlds of men with hungers of body and soul
 Hazarded the wilderness of waters,
 Cadenced their destinies
 With the potters'-wheeling miracles
 Of mountain and valley, prairie and river.
  
                                 These were the men
                                   Who bridged the ocean
                                   With arches of dreams
                                   And piers of devotion;
  
 Messiahs from the Sodoms and Gomorrahs of the Old World,
 Searchers for Cathay and Cipango and El Dorado,
 Mystics from Oubangui Chari and Uppsala,
 Serfs from Perugia and Tonle Sap,
 Jailbirds from Newgate and Danzig,
 Patriots from Yokosuka and Stralsund,
 Scholars from Oxford and Leyden,
 Beggars from Bagdad and Montmartre,
 Traders from the Tyrrhenian Sea and Mona Passage,
 Sailors from the Skagerrak and Bosporus Strait,
 Iconoclasts from Buteshire and Zermatt.
  
                                                       II
  
             These were the men of many breeds
              Who mixed their bloods and sowed their seeds.
              Designed in gold and shaped of dross,
              They raised the Sword beside the Cross.
  
              These were the men who laughed at odds
              And scoffed at dooms and diced with gods,
              Who freed their souls from inner bars
              And mused with forests and sang with stars.
  
              These were the men of prose and rhyme
              Who telescoped empires of time,
              Who knew the feel of spinal verve
              And walked the straight line of the curve.
  
              These were the men of iron lips
              Who challenged Dawn's apocalypse,
              Who married Earth and Sea and Sky
              And died to live and lived to die.

              These were the men who dared to be
              The sires of things they could not see,
              Whose martyred and  rejected bones
              Became the States' foundation-stones.
  
                                                  III
  
                  Into the arteries of the Republic poured
                          The babels of bloods,
                           The omegas of peoples,
                           The moods of continents,
                           The melting-pots of seas,
                           The flotsams of isms,
                           The flavors of tongues,
                           The yesterdays of martyrs,
                           The tomorrows of utopias.
  
                  Into the matrix of the Republic poured
                           White gulf streams of Europe,
                           Black tidal waves of Africa,
                           Yellow neap tides of Asia,
                           Niagaras of the little people.
  
                                                  America?
                         America is the Black Man's country,
                          The Red Man's, the Yellow Man's,
                          The Brown Man's, the White Man's.
  
                                                  America?
 An international river with a legion of tributaries!
 A magnificent cosmorama with myriad patterns and colors!
 A giant forest with loin-roots in a hundred lands!
 A cosmopolitan orchestra with a thousand instruments playing
                                                 America!
  
                                                       IV
  
         I see America in Daniel Boone,
 As he scouts in the Judas night of a forest aisle;
      In big Paul Bunyan, as he guillotines
 The timber avalanche that writhes a mile.
  
         I see America in Jesse James,
 As his legends match his horse's epic stride;
      In big John Henry, as his hammer beats
 The monster shovel that quakes the mountainside.
  
        I see America in Casey Jones,
As he mounts No. 4 with the seal of death in his hand;
        In Johnny Appleseed, as his miracles
Fruit the hills and valleys and plains of our Promised Land.

         I see America in Joe DiMaggio,
 As his bat cuts a vacuum in the paralyzed air;
      In brown Joe Louis, surfed in white acclaim,
 As he fights his country's cause in Madison Square.
  
         I see America in Thomas Paine,
 As he pinnacles the freedoms that tyrants ban;
    In young Abe Lincoln, tanned by prairie suns,
 As he splits his rails and thinks the Rights of Man.

                                         A blind man said,
                                     "Look at the kikes.
                                               And I saw
 Rosenwald sowing the seeds of culture in the Black Belt,
 Michelson measuring the odysseys of invisible worlds,
 Brandeis opening the eyes of the blind to the Constitution,
 Boas translating the oneness in the Rosetta stone of mankind.
  
                                         A blind man said,

                                               And I saw
 La Guardia shaping the cosmos of pyramided Manhattan,
 Brumidi verving the Capitol frescoes of Washington at Yorktown,
 Caruso scaling the Alpine ranges of drama with the staff of song,
 Toscanini enchanting earthward the music of the spheres.
  
                                         A blind man said,

                                               And I saw
 Lin Yutang crying the World Charter in the white man's wilderness,
 Dr. Chen charting the voyages of bacteria in the Lilly Laboratories,
 Lu Cong weaving plant-tapestries in the Department of Agriculture,
 Madame Chiang Kai-shek interpreting the Orient and the Occident.

 Sikorsky blue-printing the cabala of the airways,
 Stokowski imprisoning the magic of symphonies with a baton,
 Zvak erecting St. Patricks's Cathedral in a forest of skyscrapers,
 Dvok enwombing the multiple soul of the New World.

 Marian Anderson bewitching continents with the talisman of art,
 Fred Douglass hurling from tombstones the philippies of freedom,
 Private Brooks dying at the feet of MacArthur in Bataan.

             America can sing a lullaby
              When slippered dusk steals down the terraced sky;
              Then in a voice to wake the Plymouth dead
              Embattled hordes of tyranny defy.
  
              America can join the riotous throng
              And sell her virtues for a harlot song;
              Then give the clothes that hide her nakedness
              To help her sister nations carry on.
  
              America can worship gods of brass
              And bow before the strut of Breed and Class;
              Then gather to her bosom refugees
              Who champion the causes of the Mass.
  
              America can loose a world of laughter
              To shake the States from cornerstone to rafter;
              Then gird her mighty loins with corded strength
              In the volcanic nightmare of disaster.
  
              America can knot her arms and brow
              And guide across frontiers the untamed plow;
              Then beat the plowshares into vengeful swords
              To keep a rendezvous with Justice now.
  
                                                       VII
 
                                                Sometimes
                                                Uncle Sam
 Pillows his head on the Statue of Liberty,
 Tranquilizes himself on the soft couch of the Corn Belt,
 Laves his feet in the Golden Gate,
 And sinks into the nepenthe of slumber.
  
 And the termites of anti-Semitism busy themselves
 And the Ku Klux Klan marches with rope and faggot
 And the money-changers plunder the Temple of 
        Democracy
 And the copperheads start boring from within
 And the robber barons pillage the countryside
 And the con men try to jimmy the Constitution
 And the men of good will are hounded over the Land
 And the People groan in the tribulum of tryanny.
  
                                        Then
       Comes the roar of cannon at Fort Sumter
       Or the explosion of Teapot Dome
       Or the Wall Street Crash of 29
       Or the thunderclap of bombs at Pearl Harbor!
  
                                        VIII
  
      I have a rendezvous with America
      At Plymouth Rock,
      Where the Mayflower lies
      Battered beam on beam
      By titan-chested waves that heave and shock
  
 And cold December winds
 That in the riggings pound their fists and scream.
   Here,
    Now,
 The Pilgrim Fathers draw
 The New World's testament of faith and law:
 A government of and by and for the People,
 A pact of peers who share and bear and plan,
 A government which leaves men free and equal
 And yet knits men together as one man.
  
 I have a rendezvous with America
 At Valley Forge.
 These are the times that try men's souls
 And fetter cowards to their under goals.
 Through yonder gorge
 Hunger and Cold, Disease and Fear,
 Advance with treasonous blows;
 The bayonets of the wind stab through
 Our winter soldiers' clothes,
 And bloody footsteps stain the deep December snows.
      Here,
      Now,
 Our winter soldiers keep the faith
 And keep their powder dry . . . 
 To do or die!
  
 I have a rendezvous with America
 This Seventh of December.
 The maiden freshness of Pearl Harbor's dawn,
 The peace of seas that thieve the breath,
 I shall remember.
    Then
 Out of yonder Sunrise Land of Death
 The fascist spawn
 Strikes like the talons of the mad harpoon,
 Strikes like the moccasin in the black lagoon,
 Strikes like the fury of the raw typhoon.
                              The traitor's ruse
                               And the traitor's lie,
                               Pearl Harbor's ruins
                               Of sea and sky,
                               Shall live with me
                               Till the day I die.
   Here,
    Now,
 At Pearl Harbor, I remember
 I have a rendezvous at Plymouth Rock and Valley Forge
 This Seventh of December.

                     In these midnight dawns
   Of the Gethsemanes and the Golgothas of Peoples,
   I put my ear to the common ground of America.
                      From the brows of mountains
                      And the breasts of rivers
                      And the flanks of prairies
                      And the wombs of valleys
       Swells the Victory March of the Republic,
        In the masculine allegro of factories
        And the blues rhapsody of express trains,
        In the bass crescendo of power dams
        And the nocturne adagio of river boats,
        In the sound and fury of threshing machines
        And the clarineting needles of textile mills,
        In the fortissimo hammers of shipyards
        And the diatonic picks of coal mines,
        In the oboe rhythms of cotton gins
        And the sharped notes of salmon traps,
        In the belting harmonics of lumber camps
        And the drumming derricks of oil fields.
  
                                               X
  
                        In these midnight dawns
 Of the vulture Philistines of the unquiet skies
 And the rattlesnake Attilas of the uptorn seas  
                         In these midnight dawns
 Of the Gethsemanes and the Golgothas of Peoples,
                                 America stands
     Granite-footed as the Rocky Mountains
      Beaten by the whirlpool belts of wet winds,
      Deep-chested as the Appalachians
      Sunning valleys in the palms of their hands,
      Tough-tendoned as the Cumberlands
      Shouldering the truck caravans of US 40,
      Clean-flanked as the lavender walls of Palo Duro
      Washed by the living airs of canyon rivers,
      Eagle-hearted as the Pacific redwoods
 Uprearing their heads in the dawns and dusks of ages.





An Ex-Judge at the Bar
 

Bartender, make it straight and make it two--
 One for the you in me and the me in you.
 Now let us put our heads together: one
 Is half enough for malice, sense, or fun.
  
 I know, Bartender, yes, I know when the Law
 Should wag its tail or rip with fang and claw.
 When Pilate washed his hands, that neat event
 Set for us judges a Caesarean precedent.
  
 What I shall tell you now, as man is man,
 You'll find in neither Bible nor Koran.
 It happened after my return from France
 At the bar in Tony's Lady of Romance.
  
 We boys drank pros and cons, sang Dixie; and then,
 The bar a Sahara, we pledged to meet again.
 But lo, on the bar there stood in naked scorn
 The Goddess Justice, like September Morn.
  
 Who blindfolds Justice on the courthouse roof
 While the lawyers weave the sleight-of-hand of proof?
 I listened, Bartender, with my heart and head,
 As the Goddess Justice unbandaged her eyes and said:
  
 "To make the world safe for Democracy,
 You lost a leg in Flanders fields--oui, oui?
 To gain the judge's seat, you twined the noose
 That swung the Negro higher than a goose.
  
 Bartender, who has dotted every i?
 Crossed every t? Put legs on every y?
 Therefore, I challenged her: "Lay on, Macduff,
 And damned be him who first cries, Hold, enough!'
  
 The boys guffawed, and Justice began to laugh
 Like a maniac on a broken phonograph.
 Bartender, make it straight and make it three--
 One for the Negro . . . one for you and me.





The Town Fathers
 

At the Courthouse Square
 On the Fourth of July,
 Beneath Old Glory's
 Pyrotechnic sky,
 The town fathers met,
 Minus Bible and rye.
  
 Against the statue
 Of Confederate dead
 The Mayor spat
 His snuff and said,
 "We need a slogan!
 And he palmed his head.
  
 The Sheriff's idioms
 Dynamited assent.
 The Judge croaked a phrase
 Latinistically bent.
 And the Mayor pondered
 With official intent.
  
 On a neon billboard,
 As high as a steeple,
 The travelers puzzle
 The amazing sequel:
 The Blackest Land
 And The Whitest People.





Old Houses
 

Aunt Martha bustles
 From room to room
 Between attic and basement,
 With duster and broom.
  
 Like an oven grenade,
 In cobwebby corners
 Her broom explodes
 A babel of wonders.
  
 Her summer crusade
 Havocs the bugs.
 Like an enfilade,
 She rakes the rugs.
  
 The sound and fury
 Of table and bed
 Whirs a panic of sparrows
 To the oaks overhead.
  
 Untenable grows
 The vast of the house
 For even the ghost
 Of Lazarus' mouse.
  
 The fogies convert
 Back fences to staffs
 And sow their gossip
 With Pharisee laughs:
  
 Aunt Martha's scowl
 Is a lithograph's.
  
 As the fogies watch
 Her attic lairs
 Jettison the junk
 Of heirloom wares,
 She shouts: "Old houses
 Need cleaning upstairs!





The Unknown Soldier
 

I was a minuteman at Concord Bridge,
 I was a frigate-gunner on Lake Erie,
 I was a mortarman at Stony Ridge,
 I fought at San Juan Hill and Chteau Thierry,
 I braved Corregidor and the Arctic Sea:
 The index finger brings democracy.
  
 These States bred freedom in and in my bone--
 Old as the new testament of Plymouth Bay.
 When the Founding Fathers laid the Cornerstone
 And rued the thirteen clocks that would not say
 The hour on the hour, I nerved myself with them
 Under the noose in the hand of the tyrant's whim.
  
 I've seen the alien ships of destiny
 Plow the sea mountains between the hemispheres.
 I've seen the Gulf Stream of our history
 Littered with derelicts of corsair careers.
 I've heard the watchman cry, "The bars! The bars!
 When midnight held the funeral of stars.
  
 I saw horizontal States grow vertical,
 From Plymouth Harbor to the Golden Gate,
 Till wedged against skyscapes empyreal
 Their glories elbowed the decrees of fate.
 These States bred freedom in and in my bone:
 I hymn their virtues and their sins atone.
  
 The tares and wheat grow in the self-same field,
 The rose and thorn companion on the bush,
 The gold and gravel cuddle in the yield,
 The oil and grit and dirt together gush.
 The Gordian knot to be or not to be
 Snares not the free.
  
 My faith props the tomorrows, for I know
 The roots of liberty, tough-fibered, feed
 On the blood of tyrants and martyrs; the judas blow
 Tortures the branches till they twist and bleed;
 And yet no Caesar, vitamined on loot,
 Can liberty uproot!
  
 I am the Unknown Soldier: I open doors
 To the Rights of Man, letters incarnadine.
 These shrines of freedom are mine as well as yours;
 These ashes of freemen yours as well as mine.
 My troubled ghost shall haunt These States, nor cease
 Till the global war becomes a global peace.

                                                And when
                                                I go
                                                In calm
                                                Or blow
                                                From mice
                                                And men,
                                                Selah!
                                                What . . . then?





The Dictionary of the Wolf
 

"We all declare for liberty, Lincoln said.
 "We use the word and mean all sorts of things:
 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread.
 Rifle the basket that thy neighbor brings.
  
 The grizzled axman squinted at Honest Abe,
 The six feet four of him, gaunt, sad of face,
 The hands to split a log or cradle a babe,
 The cracked palm hat, the homespun of his race.
  
 "The wolf tears at the sheep's throat: and the sheep
 Extols the shepherd for cudgeling tyranny;
 The wolf, convulsed with indignation deep,
 Accuses the shepherd of murdering liberty.
  
 "But the dictionary of the wolf is writ
 In words the rats of time chew bit by bit.





The Shipwright
 


    Down in the shipyard, day and night,
            The Galahads of the dock,
    Hard as the sinews of basin rock,
            Build an ocean cosmopolite.
  
    The rivets stab and the hammers bite
    Into the beams and plates of steel
    Of the Diesel heart and the belly keel.
  
                                  We,
The workers of the world strike catholic notes
 On woods and irons, wring from brassy throats
                         Epics of industry.
  
                              Day and night
                        The diapason puts
              The bent-winged gulls to flight
  And shakes the harbor and quakes the ground
  And leaps at the suns like Prometheus bound.
  
  Our matrix shapes our citizen of the world
  To cross the churning mountains of the sea,
       Nor fashions a canoe to sail a lake
                        In cool felicity.





On the Eve of a Birthday
 

As my Scotch, spared the water, blondly sloshes 
About its tumbler, and gay manic flame 
Is snapping in the fireplace, I grow youthful: 
I realize that calendars aren't truthful
And that for all of my grand unsuccesses 
External causes are to blame.

And if at present somewhat destitute, 
I plan to alter, prove myself more able, 
And suavely stroll into the coming years 
As into rooms with thick rugs, chandeliers, 
And colorfully pyramided fruit
On linened lengths of table.

At times I fear the future won't reward 
My failures with sufficient compensation, 
But dump me, aging, in a garret room 
Appointed with twilit, slant-ceilinged gloom 
And a lone bulb depending from a cord 
Suggestive of self-strangulation.

Then, too, I have bad dreams, in one of which 
A cowled, scythe-bearing figure beckons me. 
Dark plains glow at his back: it seems I've died, 
And my soul, weighed and judged, has qualified 
For an extended, hyper-sultry hitch
Down in eternity.

Such fears and dreams, however, always pass. 
And gazing from my window at the dark, 
My drink in hand, I'm jauntily unbowed.
The sky's tiered, windy galleries stream with cloud, 
And higher still, the dazed stars thickly mass 
In their long Ptolemaic arc.

What constellated powers, unkind or kind, 
Sway me, what far preposterous ghosts of air? 
Whoever they are, whatever our connection, 
I toast them (toasting also my reflection),
Not minding that the words which come to mind 
Make the toast less toast than prayer:

Here's to the next year, to the best year yet; 
To mixed joys, to my harum-scarum prime; 
To auguries reliable and specious;
To times to come, such times being precious, 
If only for the reason that they get
Shorter all the time.





The Idols of the Tribe
 

A State which, in the epoch of race poisoning, dedicates itself to the cherishing of its best racial elements, must some day be master of the world.                                                                                                                               --Mein  Kampf 

                                      I
  
                       The veldt men pray
                       Carved wood and stone
                       And tear their flesh
                       To vein and bone.
  
                       The idols scowl
                       In the brassy sun
                       Unmindful of
                       Appeasement done.
  
                       Yea, warriors cringe,
                       Whose tauntings dare
                       The regnant brute
                       In regal lair.
  
                       As tribal gods
                       The brave confound,
                       They bruise their heads
                       Against the ground.
  
                       Kennings of death
                       Encyst the square,
                       The mourners drool
                       And children scare.
  
                       Hyena laughs
                       Spear to the stars,
                       Dark bodies fall
                       Like ruptured spars.

                       Witch doctors whine
                       Edicts anew
                       And saint their mugs
                       Of chloral brew.
  
                       Fear grapples fear,
                       Crinkles the knife:
                       And life is death
                       And death is life.
  
                       And he who dies
                       Bequeaths the chief
                       His herd and flock,
                       But not his grief.
  
                       Who dares to mock,
                       Who dares to shove
                       The idols folk
                       Are schooled to love?
  
                       And graybeards croak
                       One fool alone
                       Reviled the hakims
                       Of wood and stone:
  
                       And headmen staked
                       The wretch to die
                       From dooms that crawl
                       And dooms that fly.
  
                       Ages fag out
                       In cyclic nights,
                       But sire and son
                      Repeat the rites.
  
  
                                     II
  
 The rule-or-ruin class, in idols of the tribe,
 Creates narcissine images of itself;
 Defend its fetishes from the merest gibe,
 Like iron captains of the Guelf.
  
 The black-veldt god
 Behold, hair kinked and flat,
 Against the sun's needling myriapod
 A cooling mat.
 The low wide nostrils ventilate
 The long head in the incandescent air.
 Insufferable sunrays cannot penetrate
 Black tissues as the fair.
 The python arm with reach to spare
 Are at the beck of tribal law:
 The black-veldt god is not aware
 Of civilizations buried in the jungle's maw.
  
 The yellow god
 Behold, his mongoloid eye fold,
 The color of his sod.
 The cheekbones arched and bold,
 The broad index of face,
 The stoic mold
 Herald the myth of race.
 Lulled by the incense wisdom of repose,
 Millenniums of candlelight,
 The vegetarian god turns up his nose
 At odors of the carnivorous white.
  
 The Nordic god
 Behold, his blue-gray eyes
 Far-famed to conquer with a single prod
 A people mazed in a hinterland of whys.
 Hairy as the ape, of lip as thin,
 With Mongol, one in blood, with African,
 He makes a pseudo-science of his skin
 And writes his autobiography Superman.
  
 Race biases sow
 Hemlocks to maim and blind,
 Pile up Sinais of woe,
 Jettison the freedoms of mind,
 Breed the hydras of stealth,
 Set kind razeeing kind,
 Convert to potter's fields the commonwealth.
  
 Drink, O Fool, the bias of the tribe,
 Autograph the epitaph of pain,
 Press to the heart the fangs of the moccasin bribe,
 Rape beauty's flesh behind the crib of grain,
 Let dust bowls blight the soul's topography,
 Eat, O Fool, the racist shibboleth--
 Damn the soul to sodomy!
 Damn the soul to death!
  
  
                                      III
  
                        How many times
                         Does a Southern town
                         Waste white genius
                         To keep the Blacks down?

                         How many times
                         Does progress stop
                         To find the maimed
                         A mythical prop?
  
                         How many times
                         Do a Fhrer's claws
                         Dig up dry bones
                         Of the gray Lost Cause?
  
                        How many times
                         Does the ermine class
                         Throw scraps of hate
                         To the starved white mass?
  
 Five roads, the spokes of a county wheel,
 Mortise the hub of our Courthouse Square:
 Our graybeards fable our Daniel Boone,
 Who brothered the red chiefs where
 Five dark and bloody frontier paths,
 Crossbones old as the skull of the moon,
 Witnessed the sacrament pipe of peace,
 Grim as the grin of a dead buffoon.
  
                   Gone are scalping-knives,
                    Gone are red frontiers,
                    Gone are homeborn chiefs,
                    Gone are pioneers.
  
                  Yet the town Five Points
                  Worships myths of race;
                    Like the veldt men, hates
                    Alien norm and face.
  
                    Sky the Jim Crow sign,
                    Dam the ghetto's wrath,
                    Gibbet freedom's sons--
                    Tell it not in Gath!
  
 Out of the burial-crags of night
 The felon winds hawk down;
 Their devil claws riprap the roofs
 That visor the town.
  
 The stores on Main Street lean,
 Tome to mummy tome;
 The houses squat like smoking hulls
 Half-convexed on a shoal of foam,
 And glowworm windows in the deaf-dumb streets
 Are greeting cards of home.
  
                   Idols of the tribe
                    Jail the spirit fast.
                    Scorn of lesser breeds
                    Flash and bone outlast.
  
                    Vandal Z's of wind,
                    Beggar vale and hill,
                    As the myths of race
                    Loot the people's will.
  
 Upon the courthouse Justice stands,
 Eyes fated not to see;
 The town clock christens now the first-born hour
 Of a day of hate to be.
  
 Nor man nor beast prowls in his world,
 But on the Courthouse Square
 A statue of the Lost Cause bayonets
 Contemporary air.
  
                   The skull and bones
                    Of yesterday
                    Haunts those who travel
                    The American Way.
  
                    Nobler to grope
                    In the dusk of dawn
                    Than to stumble back
                    In midnight's spawn.
  
                    Mein Kampf is not
                    A bible writ
                    With hand of gore
                    And heart of grit.
  
                    Mein Kampf is lepra
                    That whores the soul,
                    And the brothels of race
                    Nordic bawds control.
  
                    Yet thunderbolt hells
                    Of chastening rods
                    Smite ever Gomorrahs
                    Of tribal gods!





Abraham Lincoln of Rock Spring Farm
 

I
  
 Along the Wilderness Road, through Cumberland Gap,
 The black ox hours limped toward Sunday's sun,
 Across a buff clay belt with scrawls of stone,
 Where bird and beast quailed in the bosom brush
 From February's fang and claw; the stars,
 Blue white, like sheer icicles, spired aglow
 As if the three wise men barged in the East
 Or priests in sackcloth balked the Scourge of God.
  
 Foursquare by the rite of arm and heart and law,
 The scrubby log cabin dared the compass points
 Of Rock Spring farm, man's world, God's universe,
 The babel of the circumstance and era.
 The frozen socket of its window stared
 Beyond the spayed crabapple trees, to where
 The skulls of hills, the skeletons of barrens,
 Lay quiet as time without the watch's tick.
  
 Not knowing muck and star would vie for him,
 The man Tom sank upon ax-split stool,
 Hands fisted, feet set wide to brace the spirit,
 Big shoulders shoved, dark hazel eyes glazed by
 Grotesqueries of flame that yawled and danced
 Up, up, the stick-clay chimney. While fire imps combed
 The black and bristling hair, the acids of thoughts
 Made of the orby face an etching-plate.
  
  
 II
  
 Near pyrotechnic logs, the purling kettle,
 Aunt Peggy puffed her pipe on God's rich time:
 A granny at a childbed on the border,
 Where head and backbone answered the tomahawk
 Her wise old eyes had seen a hundred Nancys
 In travail tread the dark winepress alone;
 Her wise old hands had plucked a stubborn breed
 Into the outer world of pitch and toss.
  
 The cabin that her myth and mission entered
 Became a castle in which Aunt Peggy throned
 A dynasty of grunts and nods and glances.
 The nest, the barn, the hovel had schooled her in
 The ABC of motherhood, and somehow
 She'd lost her ego in the commonweal:
 She sensed so accurately a coming child
 That rakes dubbed her the St. Bernard of Sex!
  
 And now her keyhole look explored Tom Lincoln
 Beneath the patched homespun, the hue and cry
 Of malice, until she touched his loneliness,
 The taproot that his fiber gave no tongue.
 Then, lulling the wife, troubled in flesh and mind,
 She eased the sack quilts higher and mused the while:
 There's but one way of coming into the world,
 And seven times seventy ways of leaving it!
  
  
 III
  
 The woman Nancy, like a voyager sucked
 Into the sea's whale belly by a wreck,
 Buoyed to the surface air of consciousness
 And clutched the solace of her corn-husk bed.
 Her dark face, sharped in forehead, cheekbone, chin,
 Cuddled in dark brown hair; her eyes waxed grayer
 With wonder of the interlude: her beauty
 And courage choked Aunt Peggy's hyperbole!
  
 Out of the fog of pain, the bog of bygones,
 The bag of cabin cant and tavern tattle,
 She picked the squares to piece tomorrow's quilt:
 She puzzled now, as then, about her father
 Who let wild Lucy Hanks bundle and carry
 Flesh of his flesh beyond the Cumberland Gap;
 A strange roof is no roof when imps of fear
 Pilfer the fatherless in blossom time.
  
 Year in, year out, the daughter tinkered with
 The riddle of her birth; the mother chided
 The woman Nancy as she had the child,
 "Hush thee, hush thee, thy father's a gentleman.
 The butt of bawd, grand jury, Sunday bonnet,
 Lucy, driven, taught her daughter the Word,
 And Nancy, driven, taught her son the Word,
 And Abraham, driven, taught his people the Word!

 The man Tom bit his fingernails, then rammed
 His pockets with the hector hands that gave
 Raw timber the shape of cabinet and coffin,
 And in his lame speech said: "Aunt Peggy, listen,
 Now that our Nancy's time is come, I'm haunted
 By my own nothingness. Why breed nobodies?
 He tapped the dirt floor with the iron-capped boot
 That aided fist and skull in border fights.
  
 Aunt Peggy counseled: "Tom, you say the say
 Poor Joseph probably said in that low stable
 Ere Jesus came into this mishmash world.
 She paused, then boxed the ears of cynicism:
 "It's true, down in the barnyard, blood speaks loud,
 Among the hogs, the chickens, the cows, the horses;
 But, when it comes to Man, who knows, who knows
 What greatness feeds down in the lowliest mother?
  
 The man Tom turned and spat: his naked surmise
 Ranged out and out. Aunt Peggy's innermost said:
 "Your father Abraham, bred like Daniel Boone,
 Conquered a land with gun and ax and plow,
 Baptized it in his blood! I say, I've said,
 What's in a baby is God Almighty's business;
 How the elders wring it out is worry enough!
 The best, the worst--it's all, all human nature.

 The tavern, Tom remembered, the New Year's Eve,
 The clubfoot scholar bagged in Old World clothes,
 With arrowy eyes and a hoary mushroom beard.
 An Oxford don, he hymned the Bastille's fall
 In spite of the hair-hung sword; his betters set
 Him free to hail new truths in new lands, where
 He seined with slave and master, knave and priest,
 And out of all fished up the rights of man:
  
 "As Citizen Lincoln asks, What's human nature?'
 His full mug says a clear mind puts the question
 Which ties the fogey scholar in a knot!
 My new idea fed to his new baby
 Would fetch the New World and the New Year peace!
 The sum of anything unriddles the riddle:
 The child whose wet nurse is the mother-of-all
 Grows like a pine unmarked by rock or wind.
  
 "To make a New World and a New Year, Plato
 And Jesus begged the boon of little children!
 Now Citizen Lincoln asks, What's human nature?'
 It's what we elders have: no baby has it.
 It's what our good and bad graft on the neutral.
 It's what our rulers feed the boy and girl.
 It's what society garbs nature in.
 It's a misnomer: call it human nurture!
  
  
 VI
  
 Aunt Peggy hovered closer, with flawless rites
 Grown lyrical from habit: muffled pain sounds
 Dragged from the bed of cleated poles; she hawed
 Tom Lincoln, as one turns a nag aside,
 Then swooped her way, even as a setting hen
 Carves a dictatorship from yard to nest.
 And Tom again was squeezed into a cell
 Whose inmates were the ghosts of unsuccess.
  
 Later his memories climbed a gala peak,
 His Nancy's infare that ran riotous:
 The bear meat, venison, wild turkey, duck,
 The maple sugar hanging for the whiskey,
 The red ham, gourds of syrup, bowls of honey,
 The wood coal pit with brown and juicy sheep,
 The guzzling, fiddling, guttling, monkeyshining:
 A continent sprawled between that day and this!
  
 A havenot on the frontier is no havenot;
 A Crusoe without Friday has no conscience:
 Yet Tom's grub living gnawed him like the teeth
 Of slavery, land titles, melancholy.
 He, like his forebears, visioned a Promised Land
 And tidied ways and means to fly the barrens
 That doomed the flesh to peck, to patch, to pinch,
 And wrung the soul of joy and beauty dry.
  
  
 VII
  
 The black ox hours limped by, and day crawled after.
 White prongs of ice, like dinosaur fangs, gleamed in
 The cavernous mouth of Rock Spring; snowbirds shivered
 And chirped rebellion; a cow with jags and gaps
 Chewed emptily; hogs squealed in hunger fits;
 And scrags of dogs huddled against the chimney,
 Which shoveled smoke dust into the throats and noses
 Of ragged winds kicking up snow in the desert.
  
 Nancy lay white, serene, like virgin milk
 After the udder's fury in the pail.
 Beneath the sack quilts and the bearskin robe,
 In yellow petticoat and linsey shirt,
 The baby snuggled at her breast and gurgled--
 An anonymity of soft red wrinkles.
 Aunt Peggy, hovering, grinned, "He's Sabbath-born.
 Remember Sunday--it's red-letter day!
  
 Like ax and helve, like scythe and snath, the bond
 Held Tom and Nancy; she smiled at his halt smile,
 His titan's muss in picking up the baby.
 Tom frowned and spat, then gulped, "He's legs! All legs!
 Aunt Peggy beamed, "Long legs can eat up miles.
 Tom gloomed, "The hands--look at the axman's hands!
 And Nancy mused, "The Hankses' dream, the Lincolns',
 Needs such a man to hew and blaze the way.





DELTA
 

Doubt not
the artist and his age
(though bald as the pilled head of garlic),
married or divorced
and even vying downstage,
are both aware
that God or Caesar is the handle
to the camel's hair.
 
Ye weeping monkeys of the Critics' Circus
(colorless as malic acid in a Black Hamburg grape),
what profit it to argue at the wake
(a hurrah's nest of food and wine
with Auld Lang Syne
to cheer the dead),
if the artist wrought
(contrary to what the black sanders said)
for Ars',
the Cathedra's, or the Agora's sake?
No critic a Gran Galeoto
between the Art-lover and the work of art,
the world-self of the make-
believe becomes the swimming pool of a class,
the balsam apple
of the soul and by the soul and for the soul,
or silvered Scarahaeus glass
in which Necessity's figuranti of innocence and guilt
mirror themselves as they pass.
 
If brass,
in the name
of Id or Sinai or Helicon, wakes up the trumpet,
is it to blame?
 
Although
the moment's mistone
and the milieu's groan
sharp an unbearable ache
in the f of the age's bone,
this pain is only the ghost of the pain
the artist endures,
endures,
--like Everyman--
alone.
 
The artist
is
a zinnia
no
first frost
blackens with a cloven hoof;
an eyeglass
--in the eye of a dusty wind--
to study the crosses and tangles in warp and woof;
an evergreen cherry
parasitic upon a winter sun;
a paltry thing with varicose veins
when the twelve fatigues are done.
 
Under the Lesbian rule of the seeress Nix,
blood and black bile
mix:
in the second of a bestiary-goat's caprice,
Elan,
the artist's undivorceable spouse
becomes
a Delilah of Dlice
or
a Xanthippe bereft
of sonnets from the Portuguese.
 
In Chronos Park
the Ars-powered Ferris wheel revolves
through golden age and dark
as historied isms rise and fall
and the purple of the doctor's robe
(ephemeral as the flesh color of the fame flower)
is translated into the coffin's pall.
 
The St. John's agony
of the artist
in his gethsemane
without a St. John's fire--
the Vedic god of the snaky noose discovers;
his far far cry,
like the noise of block tin,
crackles the sky:
"Wayfaring man
unneighbored by
a wayfaring tree
(though one may rue
this bark of the Moreton Bay laurel),
it is true
a something trans-Brow or cis-Brow
--or both--
wills one to the wings of the eagle,
or to the teats of the sow.
Yet, no lip need sneer to the beard of an ape of God,
Thou thing of no bowels, thou!'
So, I say as the Sire
who chastens and rewards,
Let thy blue eyes
resist white stars of red desire.'
 
Like the shape of Africa,
the raison d'tre of Art is a question mark:
without the true flight of the bat,
it is a hanker in the dark.
Not as face answers face in water,
but as windows answer each other,
one viewer,
lyrical as Hafiz in his cups,
discovers a lark;
his companion,
flat as an open Gladstone bag,
spies out an ark.
 
The blow of a fist on the nape,
this question came from a Dog,
"What color can escape
the fluky flues in the cosmic flux?
Perhaps the high-C answer lies
in the wreck the sea sucks
back into her bowels. Let
the Say be said:
"In Philae the color is blue;
in Deir-el-Baheri, red;
in Abydos, yellow--
and these are by the ravens fed.
 
Art
is not barrel copper easily separated
from the matrix;
it is not fresh tissues
--for microscopic study--
one may fix;
unique as the white tiger's
pink paws and blue eyes,
Art
leaves her lover as a Komitas
deciphering intricate Armenian neums,
with a wild surmise.
 
At once the ebony of his face
became moodless--bare
as the marked-off space
between the feathered areas of a cock;
then, his
spoon-shape straightened.
His glance
as sharp as a lance-
olate leaf, he said:
"It matters not a tinker's dam
on the hither or thither side of the Acheron
how many rivers you cross
if you fail to cross the Rubicon!
 
Postscript:
He was robbed and murdered in his flat,
and the only witness was a Hamletian rat.
But out of Black Bourgeoise came--
for John Laugart--
a bottle of Schiedam gin
and Charon's grin
and infamy, 
the Siamese twin
of fame.
 





ETA
 

Her neon sign blared two Harlem blocks.
In Aunt Grindle's
Elite Chitterling Shop
the variegated dinoceras of a jukebox
railed and wailed
from everlasting to everlasting:
Come back, Baby, come back--I need your gravy.
Come back, Baby, come back--I'm weak and wavy.
The talk of the town, I'm Skid Row bound--
and I don't mean maybe!
 
(O scholars)
this is the ambivalence of classical blues--and the
coins came from the blue-devils' pocket of Dipsy Muse.
 
Across an alp of chitterlings, pungent as epigrams,
Doctor Obi Nkomo
the alter ego
of the Harlem Gallery
--as a news-waif hallooed, "The Desert Fox is dead!--
clicked his tongue
--a residual habit from the veld--
and
--stout as a peasant in the Bread-and-Cheese War--
said,
"The lie of the artist is the only lie
for which a mortal or a god should die.
 
Because nobody was a nobody to him,
when from his thin charcoal lips
irony escaped, it was malice toward none.
The therapy of his slips
by design into primitive objets d'art
humanized the patrons of the Harlem Gallery
as much as the masterworks
he salvaged from the Lethe
of the American Way in Black Manhattan.
Mr. Guy Delaporte III cried out before the Regents,
"Mr. Curator, what manner of man
is this?
 
Unharassed by the ignis fatuus of a lost job,
Doctor Nkomo clicked throatily and, with a chuckle
whispered to me, "It's not this buckle-
head's right or wrong if he does right or wrong.
Like a humming disk came the strophe
of a rebel Bantu song.
 
Hubris is an evil the Greeks
(Euripides, Sophocles, Aeschylus)
boned and fleshed to wear the mask.
Pride is the lust-
sinewed wench the churchman speaks
of first in the Table of Deadly Sins:
Doctor Nkomo's All hail to Man
was a vane on the wing
to winnow the grain
in person, place and thing.
 
Too many (perhaps) of the Regents' corralled hours
Doctor Nkomo and I
left gored in bull rings of pros and cons:
without a horse-opera god, the Ultra dons
the matador's black of the wherefore and the why,
or hoists the white flag
and lets the red cells in the marrow die.
 
His ide fixe ebbed and flowed across the dinner table:
"Absurd life shakes its ass's ears
in Cendrars'--not Nkomo's--stable.   
If,
anchored like hooks of a hag-fish to sea weeds
and patient as a weaver in haute-lisse tapestry,
a Rivera or a Picasso,
with a camel-hair alchemy,
paints in fresco-buono
the seven panels of a man's tridimensionality
in variforms and varicolors--
since virtue has no Kelvin scale,
since a mother breeds
no twins alike,
since no man is an escape running wild from
self-sown seeds--
then, no man,
judged by his biosocial identity
in toto
can be
a Kiefekil or a Tartufe,
an Iscariot or an Iago.
 
Is philosophy, then, a tittle's snack?
History, a peacock's almanac?
He laughed down at me,
a kidney without anchorage,
and said: "You must see through the millstone,
since you're not like Julio Sigafoos and me--
an ex-savage.
 
His ebony forefinger an assagai blade,
he mused aloud as the box played in Harlem's juke:
"Curator of the Harlem Ghetto, what is a masterpiece?
A virgin or a jade,
the vis viva of an ape of God,
to awaken one,
to pleasure one--
a way-of-life's aubade.
 
Black as cypress lawn,
the crag of a woman crabsidled in.
The breath of a fraxinella in hot weather,
her unlooked-for grin
evaporated; then,
like a well's spew
of mud and oil and raw gas,
she blew
her top.
Dipsy Muse slumped like Uhlan
when his feet failed to prop,
his squeal the squeal
of a peccary ax-poled in its pen.
 
The
stem and stern
of the Elite Chitterling Shop
pitched and ditched
in the chatter and squawks, in the clatter and guffaws,
as a
Yarmouth yawl yaws
when struck by a rogue-elephant sea.
Scragged beyond the cavernous door,
clamorous as a parrot against the rain,
Dipsy Muse's vanity scrabbled in vain
like an anchor along the neck-gorge of a sea-floor.
The jukebox
railed and wailed:
The black widow spider gets rid of her man,
gets rid of her daddy as fast as she can.
If you fool around, I know what I'll do--
like the black widow spider I'll get rid of you.
A giraffine fellow whose yellow skin
mocked the netted pattern of a cantaloupe
opened his rawhide pocketbook
to sniff of dope a whiff,
with a galley curse and an alley gag;
then--laughing, choking, brimstoning his spouse,
he caved in like Ben Franklin's beggarly bag.
Doctor Nkomo sighed:
"The nicks and cuts under a stallion's tail
spur him to carry it higher;
but the incised horsetail of a man
drains the bones of his I-ness drier.
 
A black outsider with all his eggs but one
in the White Man's basket, he quaffed his beer,
stretched his beanpole legs;
then
--a rubberneck Robin Hood in a morris dance--
readied a hobby with another color for a ride
beyond the Afrikaner's stance.
"O, Romeo, he said, "O Casanova,
prithee, what is chivalrous--what, barbaric?
(Why gnaw one's thoughts to the bone?)
When a cavemen painted a rubric
figure of his mate with a gritstone,
Eros conquered Thanatos.
 
His eyes glistening dots of an ice plant,
he said: "My Western friends
--with deserts to be turned into green pastures--
rent diving bells to get the bends,
curfew morals, incubate tsetse flies,
stage a barroom brawl of means and ends
in a cul-de-sac.
(Eagles dying of hunger with cocks in their claws!)
That rebel jukebox! Hear the ghetto's dark guffaws
that defy Manhattan's Bible Belt!
Aeons separate my native veld
and your peaks of philosophy:
I made the trek, Curator,
on Man's vegetable ivory,
in threescore years and ten.
 
A whale of a man, I thought, a true,
but not a typical, mammal.
He absorbs alien ideas as Urdu
Arabic characters.
 
In a sepulchral corner, I glimpsed
a Scarlet Sister Mary on the make,
her lips dark and juicy like a half-done T-bone steak.
 
The giraffine fellow eyed us with a dog-ape look
and outed his impatience in a sigh;
a single-acting plunger
cast the die,
"Mister, who are you?
His catarrhal eye
baited by Doctor Nkomo's hair
(the silvery gray patina of a Japanese alloy),
he was but a squeaking Cleopatra boy
when the reply
came like the undershot of a Poncelet water wheel:
 
"Obi Nkomo, my dear Watson; but that is nil,
a water stair that meanders to no vessel. If you ask
what am I, you dash on rocks the wisdom and the will
of Solon and Solomon.
Am I a bee
drugged on the honey of sophistry?
Am I a fish from a river Jordan,
fated to die as soon as it reaches an Asphalt Sea?
 
Not a sound came from
the yellow giraffine fellow--
not a sound
from the bowels
of this Ixion bound
to the everlasting revolving ghetto wheel.
 
Nearer the ground than Townsend's solitaire,
Doctor Nkomo
raked his hair
 his brain 
but he did not blink the cliff of ice.
"What am I? What are you?
Perhaps we
are twin colors in a crystal.
When I was a Zulu
lad, I heard an old-wives' tale
for seven-foot-spear Chakas to be.
In a barnyard near a buffalo trail
a hunter discovered an eagle
eating dung with chickens.
He carried the feathered rex to a mountain top,
although it raised the dickens.
The hunter explained, You're not a chicken, Aquila.'
He launched the ungainly bird into space.
A fouled umbrella!
In the wing lock
of habit, it tumbled in disgrace
 down  down  down
a ghostified cock!
 
"Out of the visaing face
of the sun swooped the falcon baron
clarioning the summons of an aeried race.
Twice
the barnyard eagle answered the Solar City wight;
thrice
he spiraled the simoom-blistered height--
braked and banked and beaked
upward, upward, into transfiguring light.
Old Probabilities, what am I?
Mister, what are you?
An eagle or a chicken come home to roost?
I wish I knew!
 
His character (in the Greek sense)
phrased a nonplus--needed a metaphor's
translation. As an African prince,
kings and chiefs peacocked themselves
behind him;
and he, himself tough-conscienced, had slain
heathenism, the Giant Grim,
without a backward cry.
Scot and plot,
caste and class,
rifted right angles to the curving grain.
 
The dream of Abraham's bosom bottled long ago,
he walked the Pork Barrel's porphyry
street with the man in the ears;
and the glassy
rivers of talk
--Heraclitean, Fabian, Marxian--
in the lights and shadows of the illuminating gas,
bona fides,
limned a figure and cast
of Homo Aethiopicus who knew
all riverine traffickers pass
beyond the Seven Walls of Water--to join
 the Last of the Greeks 
of the Romans, the Last.
 
Once in a while
his apology
shaped itself like the symbol
Q
in a skipper's log.
During the falconry
in the chamber of the Regents,
Mr. Delaporte III flew
off at a tangent and off the handle.
Doctor Nkomo's Dandie Dinmount terrier
epithet sprang
across the tables.
My gavel big-talked in slang.
Like a turtle's head,
the session withdrew
into its shell.
The old Africanist bowed cavalierly and said:
"I've called the gentleman a liar
--it's true--
and I am sorry for it.
 
Wealth of the fettered,
illth of the lettered,
left his realism, like rock dust, unweathered:
one who eyes
the needle of the present to knit the future's garb.
In his own buttoned guise
he seemed to speak to the man Friday in Everyman
boned and lined and veined
for the twelve great fatigues to the Promised Land:
 
"The golden mean
of the dark wayfarer's way between
black Scylla and white Charybdis, I
have traveled; subdued ifs in the way;
from vile-canaille balconies and nigger heavens, seen
day beasts and night beasts of prey
in the disemboweling pits of
Europe and America,
in the death-worming bowels of
Asia and Africa;
and, although a Dumb Ox (like young Aquinas), I
have not forgot
the rainbows and the olive leaves against the orient sky.
 
"The basso profundo
Gibbon of Putney
--not the lyric tenor, Thomas of Celano--
hymns the Dies Irae!





The Orange Bottle
 

The clear orange bottle was empty. 
It had been empty a day.
It suddenly seemed so costly
and uncalled for anyway.
  
Two years had passed. They had passed
more or less the way years should.
Maybe he'd changed. Or maybe
the doctors had misunderstood.
  
It was June. The enormous elm tree
was green again, and the scent
of hyacinth reached through the window
and followed wherever he went.
  
And the sky was the firmament!
His life was never better.
Each small white spotless cloud that passed
was like a long-wished-for letter.
  
But then he remembered his promise.
It came like a mild cramp,
and it sat there all day in the back of his mind
like a gas bill awaiting a stamp.
  
He saw three faces that Sunday,
mother, sister, niece,
all with the same kind, brown, scared eyes
that brought him no peace.
  
The sidewalk sparrows were peeping.
His whole house smelled like a flower.
But he remembered his promise.
The drugstore said one hour.
  
Back home again, he was tired.
The label said caution, said warning.
He left the clear orange bottle
on the lip of the sink till morning.
  
The insert said warning, said caution.
The insert said constipation.
It said insomnia, vivid dreams,
and hypersalivation,
     and increased urination,
     and a spinning sensation.
  
It also said night sweats, and
agranulocytosis,
and strongly suggested a full glass of water
be drunk with all doses.
  
The insert said all this,
the insert he never read.
But he didn't have to read it
to know what it said.
  
The bedroom was calm with moonlight
and the breeze through the screen was cooling.
Through the elm leaves the shivery light on the wall
came like quicksilver pooling.

But just before five, something woke him--
a close whisper--or maybe a far cry--
and the bedroom was queasy with light the color
of lapis lazuli.

He lay there listening hard
till six, till seven, till eight...
At nine he remembered the bottle.
But nine, nine was too late. 

"Don't take me! cried the Clozapine.
"Don't take me! cried the pill. 
By ten he was feeling restless,
with a whole day left to kill.

"Don't take me! cried the Clozapine.
"Yes, don't! cried the medication. 
And the bright yellow morning seemed suddenly edged
with a shady fascination. 

Why should he go to his workplace?
Who was his supervisor?
He had a sickening feeling
that he was becoming wiser.

His room filled up with interest.
He had begun to think!
He thought of the knives in the kitchen
and the bottles under the sink.

He thought as he switched the stove on
or stood at his shaving mirror,
or reached for his belt in the wardrobe. 
Thinking made things clearer. 

Even the bedroom window,
the open window full of sun,
continually hinted
at something that should be done.

But he was crooked and useless.
 He was a piece of shit.
 And so, as everyone knew he would,
 he failed to go through with it.
  
 "Don't take me! cried the Clozapine.
 "Don't take me! cried the drug.
 Just then, the telephone rang.
 Just then, he ripped out the plug.
  
 "Don't take me! cried the Clozapine.
 "Don't take me! cried the poison.
 And the door of the house creaked open,
 and the cellar door lilted and murmured,
 and the garden gate groaned and yawned
 and let a little noise in.
  
 There, just outside his window,
 lurked life like a cheap cartoon.
 He shut the sash, locked it, and checked it,
 and checked it all afternoon.
  
 He lowered the blinds on that world,
 no longer an agent of it,
 but then, with one finger, pulled down a slat
 and set his eye above it.
  
At first it was grimly amusing,
at last it was grimly grim,
to watch all those hunched, hurried people,
who made like they weren't watching him.
  
The neighbors were thinking out loud.
They knew he was no fucking good.
So he slumped on a stool in the corner
like a bad little snaggletooth should.
  
They called him a dirty pig, and laughed,
and said he shouldn't exist.
Sometimes they made a tsking sound,
or oinked at him, or hissed.
  
They hissed that he was to blame
for everything, and everyone knew it,
and that if he weren't such a pussy
he'd know what to do, and he'd do it.
  
He lay on his side on the rug
 unable to move at all
except for his big right toe,
   which dug and dug at the wall,
      which dug at the wall,
             which dug.
  
"Don't take me! cried the Clozapine.
"Don't take me! cried the cure.
And they begged him to sew his mouth shut
just to make goddamn sure.
  
"Don't take me! cried the Clozapine.
"Don't take me! cried the poison.
And the gate to the wicked city gaped,
and the gates of the temple screamed and screamed,
and the gates of the garden groaned and yawned,
and the gates of the ziggurat gabbled in grief,
and sucked all life's sorrows and joys in.
  
 His thoughts were advancing like wolves.
He lay still for an hour and a half,
then reared up onto his rickety legs
like a newborn calf.

Then     rug 
                         hall 
                                      stairs
porch 
             stoop 
                         street
and the blacktop humanly warm
on the soles of his naked feet.

His walk was stiffened by fear, 
but it took him where he was going,
into the terrible world 
of children and daffodils growing,
       and friendly people helloing,
        and the Super out doing the mowing,
        and the two old sisters out in wool sweaters with their wrinkled
            cheeks pinkly glowing,
       and the pretty lady who would give birth by Christmas barely
          showing but showing,
       and the policeman helping to keep the lazy afternoon traffic 
          flowing,
       and time itself slowing,
       and none of them, none of them knowing

that an odious axis was forming,
that it would not be controlled,
that schemes were afoot, that a foot
was a thing for a jackboot to hold,

that the street was a movie set,
that it was not warm and sunny,
that a creditor was calling
who could not be paid with money, 

that the world was like a sliver
of iron held in the hand,
and his mind the lodestone above it
that made it stir or stand,

that the air was slowly changing
to a color they didn't know,
that he was a famous doctor
on a television show.

But what could he do? Even friends
would take these facts for lies,
and he couldn't tell who the enemies were,
though he felt the hot breath of their eyes,

so he kept his big mouth shut 
and tried to play along,
and plowed down the street toward the coffeeshop
as if nothing at all were wrong.

He tried not to notice the numbers 
painted on garbage cans.
He tried and he tried not to look
at the black unmarked sedans.

The coffeeshop smelled like coffee,
but it felt different inside.
A new waitress went by. She winked. 
He kept his eyes open wide.

Everything screamed "Run away!
But he wasn't really there!
So he stood by the gumball machines
and smiled and tried not to stare.

"The power is yours! said a T-shirt.
"Look for lightning! reported the weather.
And the stranger who offered the Sports section said,
"It's all there, Chief. Just put it together.

Then wild-eyed out of the kitchen
stormed a small, hard old man,
shouting in a strange language
and waving a frying pan,

shoving him out the door
and into the chattering street,
shoving him, waving, shouting, 
and pointing at his feet,
    at his bare, gray feet.

Then came the dark blue uniform,
the badge glinting in the sun,
and the belt jangling like a storm trooper's
as the boots broke into a run.

"Take that! cried the patrolman.
"Take that! cried Johnny Law.
Street, knee, neck--
cuffs, curb, jaw.

And the flatfoot pushed him, bleeding, 
into the sleek cruiser,
and he heard all the gawkers thinking
that he was a pig and a loser,

and his chin throbbed,
and the handcuffs ate at his wrist,
and he would be hacked into pieces soon
and would not be missed. 

"Don't take me! cried the victim.
"Don't take me! cried the threat.
But the angry back of a head
was the only response he could get.

Lying on his side like a child 
at the end of a big day,
he gazed up through the window
and watched it all slip away.

The little pen where they put him
had a toilet but no stall.
Here and there a message
scarred the gloss-white wall.

Time passed. But you couldn't tell it
on the trapped fly ticking the ceiling,
or the flickering light overhead,
or the sore on his chin congealing,
      or on the sound of the other pigs in the other pens, squealing.

When the men came, he was ready.
He talked. They took it all down.
And soon they were back in the cruiser,
on their way across town.

Then, into the mirrored building,
over the waxed lobby floors,
down miles of echoing hallways,
through the heavy brown doors,

into a humming beige room
with a bed and a river view,
and an outside lock, and jailers
who wore white instead of blue.

"Take that, smiled the doctor. 
"Take that, smiled the nurse. 
He pressed his lips still tighter,
and things got worse and worse.

"Please! threatened the nurse.
"Please! growled the doctor.
He raised his fists to cover his mouth,
but the nurse was too close, and he clocked her.

Now into the room came the big men,
who did not clamor or shout,
but pinned him with ease to the bed,
strapped him down, and went out.

And the doctor was there again, trailing
a spider web of cologne,
and the doctor told what would happen next,
in an expert monotone,

and the nurse took a needle
and emptied it into his arm,
and they both left, content 
that he could do no more harm,

and he fought, and the straps cut his shoulders, 
and he gnawed at his lip, and it bled,
and he held his bladder for three long hours,
then shivered and pissed the bed.

When the doctor came a fifth time,
it was long past dawn.
They'd found him a room, said the doctor,
gently restraining a yawn.

The next two days were sleep, 
and words through a fine white mist.
Then he woke inside a machine
whose motion he couldn't resist:

       "Tick-tock, said the clock. 
       "Creak, creak, said the bed.
       "Drip, drip, said the sink.
        "Throb, throb, went his head.
       "Ho-hum, sighed the night nurse. 
        "Heh-heh, said the sicko.
       "Why? Why? screamed the patient.
       "Howl, howl! cried the psycho. 
       "Wolf! Wolf! cried the boy. 
       "Gobble, gobble! sang the freaks. 
       "Sa, sa! cried the king.
       "Tick-tock, went the weeks.
       "Bang, bang, said the tv.
       "Teeter-totter, went his brain.
       "Click, click, went the checkers.
       "Pitter-patter, went the rain.
        "Bring-bring, said the pay phone. 
        "Snip, snip, went Fate.
        "Jangle-jingle, went the keys.
        "Clank-clink, went the gate.
        "Bye-bye, said the nurse.
        "Bye-bye, said the guard.
        "Bar-bar, said the doctor.
        "Baa-baa, said the lamb. 
        "My, my, said his mother. 
        "Boohoo! cried Bo Peep. 
        "Bow-wow, said the wolf.
        "Baa-baa, said the sheep.

In the car away from that place, 
the family had a pleasant chat.
He seemed fine again, and humble, 
though his speech was oddly flat.

He said that the halfway house
where he would be residing
was located on a quiet block and had
green vinyl siding.

There he met new people
and watched the television,
which did not watch him back
or speak to him with derision,

and he performed certain tasks,
meant to teach certain skills,
and he got small checks from the government
to pay his enormous bills.

Each night he fell asleep, 
and each morning he got up,
and he washed down his medicine
and squashed the paper cup, 

feeling, in all, much better, 
more in touch with common sense, 
and also slightly bored
by the lack of consequence.

And the church bells rang
and a dinner bell tinkled
and the school bell tolled
and called all the good girls and boys in.
And all of them brought all their toys in.
And all of them swallowed their poison.





Monstrance Man
 

As a boy he had trouble speaking,
past three before a real word preened
from his lips. And for the longest time,
malaprops haunted him. His older sister
did what she could to train the bitten seal
of his brain to twirl the red ball 
on the nose of eloquence, and his grandmother
tired of insisting he utter the names
of toys or foods--for every desire
was coded--and gave him whatever
he grunted and pointed to. 
O, the man then a boy
thought, when I tower among them
I should invent my own speech
and leave others empty and afraid
that they did not know it, could not ask
or plead their case in the one tongue
that mattered. I shall have them
look upon the simplest things,
the man then a boy thought, 
and fill up with stolen awe,
and point with their faces,
their pupils wide as blackened coins,
and hope with all the revenue
shattered heart-glass can muster
that someone had grasped
their need as need and not
as the monstrous coupling
of sounds in a trance of whims.
Then, the grind of his teeth
vowed, then the plazas of my city
will fill with my name,
and their blood will matter 
as little to them as to me.





Temple You
 

What is mysterious about loss, 
flush of arm pulled from a wilted sleeve,

summer's urine-tang in autumn leaves?
Let John Keats light another fag.

Or Bront refuse the doctor
on her black sateen settee.

For whatever part of you 
may be taken away, you said,

is the scar I will visit first
with my mouth, each time, 

as gold visits the thieved till, 
sun the obliterated sill, 

saying praise you for leaving
me this you, this living still.





Temple On My Knees
 

When this day returns to me
I will value your heart, 
long hurt in long division,
over mine. Mouth above mine too--
say you love me, truth never more
meant, say you are angry.
Words, words we net with our mouths.
Soul is an old thirst but not as first
as the body's perhaps,
though on bad nights its melancholy
eats us out, to a person.
True, time is undigressing.
Yet true is all we can be:
rhyming you, rhyming me.





How I Might Sound if I Left Myself Alone
 

Turning to watch you leave,
I see we must always walk toward

other loves, river of heaven
between two office buildings. 

Orphaned cloud, fish soup poppling,
book spined in the open palm. Unstoppable light.

I think it is all right.
Or do tonight, garden toad

a speaking stone,
young sound in an old heart.

Annul the self? I float it,
a day lily in my wine. Oblivion?

I love our lives,
keeping me from it.





Rehearsal
 

I am walking through water with one of my sisters,
               the river banked with tiger lilies, the sun
like having a lemon juiced into your eye, our senile dog

ecstatic behind us,
               and I am yammering
about my discovery--

a chest deep pool, sentried by trees
               that caterpillars were killing
with their yearly carnival tents.

We reach then ruin the pool with oils and shampoos.
               We scrub too much skin
from our heels, then debate

whether to sunbathe naked:
               that is, who is hiding in the woods.
We joke so long and rough

the joke morphs, till we're practicing for
               our future rapes:
we both have numbers that we know are up.

My sister's ears are speared
               with porcupine quills and steel,
but she's placed her straw hat carefully over her stomach.

As she talks I watch
               while dragonflies and other
less showy insects land

on her burning shoulders.
               The dragonflies present their stenciled wings.
I can't remember what the others do. 

My sister spits
               to clean each sunglass mirror.
 She wants me to hear
  
 how, when it happens,
               she'll do this scream--
 but when the scream comes it's just like she's opened
  
 a shaken bottle of sparkling water:
               I am speechless only for the view
 of her throat's cushioned corridor.
  
 But when the scream ends her eyes
               have broken off from the rest of her face.
 She takes our green net bag full of oranges,
  
 and slams it down on the baking rocks,
               beating the ground till the oranges soften
 and streak the air with the smell of their breaking.





The Cricket and the Grasshopper
 

The senseless leaf in the fevered hand
Grows hot, near blood-heat, but never grows
Green. Weeks ago the dove's last cooing strain
Settled silent in the nest to brood slow
Absence from song. The dropped leaf cools
On the uncut grass, supple still, still green,
Twining still these fingers as they listless pull
The tangle straight until the tangle tightens
And the hand is caught, another fallen leaf. 
The poetry of the earth never ceases 
Ceasing--one blade of grass denies belief
Until its mere thread bears the grasshopper's
Whole weight, and the black cricket sings unseen,
Desire living in a hole beneath the tangle's green.





Filicudi
 

You have a beautiful mouth,
Luigi, the man-boy says. 

The rubber raft
has floated far 
from shore. 

The choice
is this:

medusa sea,

a boil 
of jellied lashes,

or 

face 
the kiss.





Sapphic Fragment
 

Do I still long for my virginity?--Fragment 107
I never longed for my virginity.
I heard it on the radio after the hurricane. 

There, in the aftermath, was the voice of a man--
once the sweet, screwed-up boy whose hooded, 

jessed spirit I tried to possess with the ruthlessness 
I mistook for power. Here he was on NPR, 

so gentle, so familiar with devastation, 
his timbre woke the teenage falconer in me 

who once saw his kindness as weakness, 
saw a boy as an unfledged goshawk--

a creature to trap and be trapped with
in darkened mews. I knew the rules: 

neither of us could sleep until the molting bird 
grew ravenous enough to take the raw mouse 

from my hand. Breaking the falcon
broke us both, left us scared 

and less aware of love than fear.





Chicken Little In Love
 

I'm through! I'm through!
she says and resays.
The years pass.
Her feathers gray.
Her eggs 
lay themselves
less frequently. 
The sky falls.





The Last Time I Slept in This Bed
 

I was involved in the serious business
of ripping apart my own body.

I'd run my fingers over it,
seeking but never finding

the right point of entry,
so having to tear one myself,

though midway through
I'd always tire,

and let night enter
like a silver needle,

sewing my eyelids shut.
This was not an original practice,

but thinking, for a time, that it was
felt like being able to choose

when spring would arrive:
engineering an April

that opened like a parasol,
even in thoroughest winter.





From "Romanticisms
 

Mortal oddment, there's no wish in the blood
But beat, but stay gift-strong, but make demands
To keep within veins this ore's diffuse gold,
These voices that know without being known--
These voices that riddle thought with herself,
Ridicule thought in her flimsy eternal
Gowns a child can tear in half with a breath--
That chorus arterial, unbribable,
Blowing song through self as a child blows
A dandelion apart--
                                      All those weeds?--
Thistle's down and thistle's thorn, dumb yellow
Globes below that bind grass to their hollow creed,
Wind's meager flute, sere song, the whole field's late
Doom? Heart-blood? Voices, you? That's my portrait?--


I kept repeating, repeating, kept re--
To repair, to repair my, or not my--the
Mind's bower, but whose--who mines urgency--
Or whose mind regrets all those violets rooted
In violence--or I only mean thought, in thought,
Not violence, thinking, and the stupid leaf
Unfolding, mine, mine, mind. Here's the plot
All untended: Psyche and, and--some thief
Unnamed--no, some unnamed leaf, and the sun,
Yes, only the sun that through open eyes
Turns the livid leaf green. Not leaf. Meant wound--
Or is it wind, is it wind that split in half by
A gnat, by a blade of grass, always heals its gale--
What is the wound that is being healed, healed--





What the Dead Know
 


                             Air here is like the water
 Of an aquarium that's been lived in for a while--clear and still
                              Beyond the rigors
 Of glass; appearing cold (and clear) as spring streams
                              Fed by snow and ice,
 But unexpectedly warm to feel, and inviting; side-lit--
                              A vitality of shadows
 Once you come into it, and long bars of light
                              Burning like spots,
 Remarkable for the absence of dust in their sharp crossfires;
                              Heavy, as crystal
 Is heavy, as if to move here would mean pushing against a force
                              Palpable, and strong;
 Yet rich with prospects of life, comfortable
                              With the idea of life,
 As if, put on its slide, every drop is stocked with wonders,
                              Swarming, about to burst--

                              Beautiful in a way,
 One element sustaining another, our message brought home
                              So that the living
 Might come to see. Harder to say that without them
                              We are nothing--
 Water without air; or to speak of our isolation,
                              Or our special loneliness;
 Or say as they look right through us, at their plants,
                              Pictures, books,
 Windows, reflections, and blank white walls,
                              That we need them,
 To orient ourselves and to tell us who we are;
                              Or that with each look
 They are swimming to within our sights; or that we are always casting
                              Wider and wider
 And that even now they are fighting to avoid our nets.





Please Refrain from Talking During the Movie
 

When I can't make you understand I repeat myself
 I repeat
  
 If you don't stop asking me all these questions how
 Will I understand anything
  
 Please refrain from talking during the movie
  
 I need a life that isn't just about needing
 To escape my life
  
 Please God please may Carrie please fall for me
  
 I want to show off my hidden camera
 I'm an informer but I have my limits
  
 You hurt him once before now what
 If she's there I don't know if I can go
  
 Please refrain from talking during the movie
  
 Leave a message if you can't reach me
 To exit press enter and don't forget your receipt
  
 When I think I read new things I want
 A life where I read and think new things
  
 Please refrain from talking during the movie
  
 I want to know nothing
 Again
  
 Please God please may Carrie please fall for me
  
 I repeat myself when I can't
 Make you understand I repeat





Three Horse Operas
 

                                                       for Patti Smith
At the end of Bing Crosby's Riding High his horse
 Will be buried in the clay of the racetrack where he fell,
 As a lesson for all of us. Sad, waggish Bing,
 The Mob didn't want Broadway Bill to win, so the jockey
 Pulled on the reins until the thoroughbred, straining
 Over the finish line first, collapsed, heart attack.
  
 I loved you like a guitar string breaking
 Under the conviction of a clumsy hand--
 Something like that . . . I suppose I must have
 Been thinking of you and your complex and beautiful band,
 Except the image demands I hold the guitar,
 If not you, and the broken string, as
  
 Over and over loudspeakers call riders to the starting gate.
 The track bartender and a teller, a sharpshooter and the chess master
 Wrestler, the petty con man and a cop, reprise their parts.
 The heist gang dons clown masks, and
 Sherry will betray George, and Johnny can't love Fay,
 And the fortune in the suitcase just blows away.





Deep Deuce
 

As phantoms direct life from the shadows,
  
                                                                              I feel
 I leaned on something,
                                          and it broke.
  
 My father on the porch with his crosswords said,
 this must be what it feels like to be dead;
  
 When I returned from the dead there was no one to greet me,
 but still you are glad--
  
 I wander the ruins the way my tongue
 wanders my missing teeth,
 the bricks and mortar of Deep Deuce
 rotted like molars in an ancient mouth;
  
 Here Charlie Christian might have walked--
  
 The astrologer counseled patience
 and creative imaging:
  
                                  Step One: Visualize
 an object that symbolizes the accursed influence. Picture yourself throwing 
 it into a furnace.
  
                                  Step two: Visualize
 the person who is responsible for the curse. Imagine one end of a rope
 is tied around your waist and the other around that person. Picture yourself cutting
 the rope with a chainsaw as you call out, "You have no power over me!
  
                                  Step three: Repeat
 twice a day for eleven days . . .
  
 You visualize her green boots inside the furnace . . .
  
--No. You are in a crematorium and you see
 her perfect and corruptible body on a tray sliding into fire;
  
 Then you see yourself cutting the rope that ties you together with a saw;
  
 And then at last your own imperfect and corruptible body--I mean, me--calls out
  
 and I jump in after her.





The Great Awakening
 

                                                               Oh, de wars and de scrapes                                                               And de sprees am done--sprees am done                                                               De foe am beat.                                                               De Turks am drowned--Turks am drowned.                                                               All safe and sounds                                                               To our wives we come . . .                                                               --Otello, by T. D. Rice
Dreams may come from the enemy--
  
 from the business of the past day--
  
 from a disordered body--
  
 from moral evil--
  
 from God,
  
 through the medium of the Angels, and departed saints, as forewarnings to stir up and prepare the mind for the scenes ahead. 
     I fell into a slumber; and in it I dreamed that two devils entered the room, each with a chain in his hand; they laid hold on me, the one at my head, the other at my feet, and bound me fast, and breaking out the window, carried me a distance from the house and laid me on a spot of ice, and while the weaker devil flew off in flames of fire, the stronger one set out to carry me down to hell.
    I put my hands together and said, Lord I submit to go and preach thy gospel; only grant my peaceful hours to return, and open the door.
    Here I received the solemn news of the death of our only child.
  
    The vibration of the earth shook down the trees, thousands of willows were swept off like a pipe stem, about waist high, and the swamps became high ground, and high land became low ground, and two islands in the river were so shaken, washed away and sunk, as not to be found.
  
 From this I infer some trouble is at hand,
 But the film was already starting--
  
 The sounds came in waves, higher
 and higher, at the top of it
 someone screaming--
  
 Now what you call your great disappointment,
 I call the Great Awakeneing--
  
 When I heard (though not always
 in these old forgotten words I remember) the first of three visions--
  
 Yet if you tell me they are only 
 my dear dead returning,
 I would not disbelieve you.
  
 2.
  
 It is an odd sort of fortune to have lived an adventurous life.
  
 In my disgust, I left school and devoted
 all my blighted spirit to minstrelsy;
 I had no natural aptness for the banjo,
 but for dancing--
 such a remarkable gift few ever saw.
  
 The first part of our performances
  we gave with white faces;
 and by practicing to knock spin and toss the tambourine
 back in my room,
 I was now the "Scotch Girl in plaid petticoats.
  
 Besides my Highland Fling, I took the principal lady parts
 in the negro ballets;
 for a lad, I danced "Lucy Long so admirably 
 a planter in one of the Southern States insisted on purchasing me, 
 until the door-tender kicked that planter down the stairs.
  
 Old Ephraim was one of the most comical specimens 
 of the negro species,
 the blackest face, largest mouth, whitest teeth;
 What could he do?
 Why, he could fetch water, black our boots, take care of our baggage.
  
 My father said of Howie Gray
 who worked beside him every day at the South Station PO
 and put both his sons through college, 
 "He's not an uppity Negro.
 My father meant that as a compliment.
  
 There were tears in his eyes when Howie Gray died.
  
 3.
  
 Every man his own radio--
  
 It hath been thought that the dying speeches of such as have been executed among us
 might be of singular use to correct the crimes wherein too many do live
  
   Billington, disregarding the commotion he was causing and the certainty of apprehension, reloaded and stalked his enemy.
  
    She concealed her crime until the time of her delivery, and then being delivered alone by her self in a dark room, she murdered the harmless and helpless infant.
  
    Foster didn't say a word. He just picked up a steal boomer and smashed Pikin over the head with it.
  
   I went forth to be delivered in the field, and dropping my child by the side of a little pond (whether alive or stillborn I cannot tell), I covered it over with dirt and snow and speedily returned home.
  
    He struck the helpless Kling again and again
  
    Mr. Spooner strove to speak, when down, Brooks took him by the throat and partly strangled him. Ross and Buchanan came out. Ross took Mr. Spooner's watch and gave it to Buchanan. Brooks and Ross took him up and put him in the well head first. Before they carried him away, I, Buchanan, pulled off his shoes.
  
    Eight streaks of splattered blood. Eight murderous strokes of an axe or knife.
  
    Was found, by a person with a dog, crossing the fields, in a piece of woods a little distance from Brandywine to the Turk's Head, two dead infants.
  
 Now what you call your Great Awakening, 
 I call Much Ado, 
 I call The Big Sleep--
  
 But when did I become someone on whom
 everything is lost?
  
 Like the dream I lifted from my father like a Band-Aid--
  
 Where I checked hats, 
 that instantly, embarrassingly disappeared--
  
 My earnest offers to return the $1.00 gratuity 
raining down on dead ears--
  
 I thought I was boyish. 
 It availed me nothing.





Hollywood & God
 

If only God would save me, 
 I would know how to hurt you.
  
 If only God would save me, 
 I would know who to sell my soul to.
  
 Anything is an autobiography, 
 but this is a conversation--
  
 William Burroughs insisted
 literature lagged 50 years behind painting, 
  
 thinking no doubt about abstraction, collage, 
 fragmentation, his cut-ups.
  
 But whatever that meant (why always 50 years?), or however 
 he presumed to rile other writers, 
  
 poetry probably does lag behind any credible media theory about it--
  
 so that if I put a pine tree
 into a poem,
  
 a grove of pine trees
 and beyond them the sea,
  
 you'd think it was the same tree Wordsworth put there;
 instead of two obligatory centuries of nature studies, all those
  
 Technicolor vistas, torch songs, couples 
 drifting through leaves in Salem commercials. 
  
 Into one life and out another, 
  
 the way a junkie playing a writer, 
 a writer playing a priest,
  
 so that when I finally blurted out, 
 You-betrayed-me / I-wounded-you / We're-so-unhappy
  
 you assumed the burden of personal urgency, 
 supposed it was me speaking at the limits of my self-control
  
 and not The Damned Don't Cry, 
 Temptation, and Leave Her to Heaven.
  
 You open your mouth and a tradition dribbles out.
  
 But that's mimesis--
  
 how almost impossible to avoid mimesis, 
 anybody's hardest truths prompting the most fractured constructions, 
  
 the way to think about God might be
 to disobey God, 
  
 if only God's wish to remain hidden, 
  
 so that if everything is an autobiography, 
 this is a conversion.
  
 As my lives flash before me, 
  
 why must the yearning for God
 trump all other yearnings?
  
 You often hear converts confess
 the drinking, his pills, her sexual addiction,
  
 concealed inside them a yearning for God--
 why not the other way around?
  
 The admission of Jesus into your life
 concealing instead the wish, say, a need
  
 To be fucked senseless drunk drugged & screaming
 Oh God! Oh God! on a hotel bed . . .
  
 God embraces our yearnings.
  
 That afternoon my father heard his diagnosis of inoperable cancer,
 my aunt Barbara demanded we get him to Lourdes
  
 She demanded this with a glass of vodka in her hand--
 she demanded this running her fingers up and down my leg--
 she demanded this before she passed out in her car--
  
 In the movie of my life, 
 my father died
  
 after I forgave him,
  
 & when my secret tormentor said may the ghosts of your dreams 
 gnaw at your belly like a wolf under your jacket,
  
 did she really want revenge, 
 or was she just killing time?
  
 For me God is a hair shirt, or he's nothing; 
 for me God is a pain in the ass;
  
 that's mimesis, again, 
  
 this hour I tell you things in confidence,
 I might not tell everybody, but I'll tell you.
  
 The world is a road under the wall to the church, 
 the world is a church, & the world is a road, 
  
 & the world is a stone wall.
  
 Still, he wanted her the way the Cardinal wanted the Caravaggio,
 & when the ill-advised possessor of the painting resisted--
 one night Papal Guards searched his house.
  
 Of course contraband came to light, some illegal rifles, 
 & when the ill-advised possessor of the painting went to prison--
 the Cardinal got his Caravaggio.
  
 But I wasn't a Cardinal, nephew to the Pope,
 and you--
 you were not a Caravaggio. 
  
 So I asked you to be in my movie.





Confession
 

I have a brief confession
that I would like to make.
If I dont get it off my chest
I'm sure my heart will break.

I didn't do my reading.
I watched TV instead--
while munching cookies, cakes, and chips
and cinnamon raisin bread.

I didn't wash the dishes.
I didn't clean the mess.
Now there are roaches eating crumbs--
a million, more or less.

I didn't turn the TV off.
I didn't shut the light.
Just think of all the energy
I wasted through the night.

I feel so very guilty.
I did a lousy job.
I hope my students don't find out
that I am such a slob.





Your Invitation to a Modest Breakfast
 


 It's too cold to smoke outside, but if you come over,
 I'll keep my hands to myself, or won't I.
 I would like to tell you about the wall eaten up
  
 by the climbing plant--it was so beautiful.
 Various things have been happening to me,
 all of them sexual. The man on the bus
  
 took off his pants so I could see him better.
 Another man said, "Ignore him darlin'.
 Just sit on my lap. But I'm not one of those
  
 who's hungriest in the morning,
 unlike the man at the bakery
 who eats egg after egg after egg.
  
 Listen. Come over: the cold has already eaten
 the summer. I need another pair of ears:
 from the kitchen I can't tell if I'm hearing wind chimes
  
 or some gray woman with failing arms
 dropping a pan full of onions and potatoes.
                                     This morning I need four hands--
  
 two to wash the greens, one to lift a teakettle,
 one to pour the milk. This morning, one little mouth
 will not do. We could play a game
  
 where we crouch on the tiles, two yellow dogs
 drinking coffee from bowls. We could play a game
 where we let the breakfast burn.
  
 Outside there's a world where every love scene
 begins with a man in a doorway;
 he walks over to the woman and says "Open your mouth.





Leisure, Hannah, Does Not Agree with You (2)
 

--After Catullus
My house disgusted me, so I slept in a tent.
 My tent disgusted me, so I slept in the grass. The grass disgusted me,
so I slept in my body, which I strung like a hammock from two ropes.
 My body disgusted me, so I carved myself out of it.
  
 My use of knives disgusted me because it was an act of violence.
 My weakness disgusted me because "Hannah means "hammer.
 The meaning of my name disgusted me because I'd rather be known
 as beautiful. My vanity disgusted me because I am a scholar.
  
 My scholarship disgusted me because knowledge is empty.
 My emptiness disgusted me because I wanted to be whole.
 My wholeness would have disgusted me because to be whole
 is to be smug. Still, I tried to understand wholeness
  
 as the inclusiveness of all activities: I walked out into the yard,
 trying to vomit and drink milk simultaneously. I tried to sleep
 while smoking a cigar. I have enough regrets to crack all the plumbing.
 I'm whole only in that I've built my person from every thought I've ever loved.





It Was Alive, Though Differently
 

It had a secret name
 which in later years came to mean
 I will continue to stand here.
  
 It had a food mouth
 and a shrieking mouth.
  
 Popular wisdom indicated
 that Its hands could heat stones
 and that a man could cook
 meat on those stones.
  
 That being said,
 It had a poverty hand
 and a riches hand.
  
 They were
 the same hand.
  
 A little ways above the hands
 the mouths spoke together
 but for two
 different reasons,
 like the music was behaving
 but the orchestra was broken.
  
 *
  
 Even in less
 benevolent moments,
 It was known to use Its own
body as a tent and as the gifts
 inside of the tent.
  
 Early people said It had a mother hand
 and a father hand, and that together
 they made a clapping sound.
  
 Its hands delivered the children
 from madness.
  
 The hands saw the riverbank sliding
 into the river
 to make
 a more shallow river.
  
 They scooped the mud up.
 The hands were giving thanks.
  
 *
  
 The hands smelled like exodus.
 The hands were the law.
  
 One hand grew older, and the other
 hand younger.
  
 They said, fairly often,
 We'd like to try that again.
  
 Both were restless
 and wanted rest.
  
 One hand said, I will go where you go,
 while the other hand continued
 on alone.





Photo of a Man on Sunset Drive: 1914, 2008
 

Groundbreaking Ceremony, City of South Miami, Sunset Drive Improvements
And so it began: the earth torn, split open
 by a dirt road cutting through palmettos
 and wild tamarind trees defending the land
 against the sun. Beside the road, a shack
 leaning into the wind, on the wooden porch,
 crates of avocados and limes, white chickens
 pecking at the floor boards, and a man
 under the shadow of his straw hat, staring
 into the camera in 1914. He doesn't know
 within a lifetime the unclaimed land behind
 him will be cleared of scrub and sawgrass,
 the soil will be turned, made to give back
 what the farmers wish, their lonely houses
 will stand acres apart from one another,
 jailed behind the boughs of their orchards.
 He'll never buy sugar at the general store,
 mail love letters at the post office, or take
 a train at the depot of the town that will rise
 out of hundred-million years of coral rock
 on promises of paradise. He'll never ride
 a Model-T puttering down the dirt road
 that will be paved over, stretch farther and
 farther west into the horizon, reaching for
 the setting sun after which it will be named.
 He can't even begin to imagine the shadows
 of buildings rising taller than the palm trees,
 the street lights glowing like counterfeit stars
 dotting the sky above the road, the thousands
 who will take the road everyday, who'll also
 call this place home less than a hundred years
 after the photograph of him hanging today
 in City Hall as testament. He'll never meet
 me, the engineer hired to transform the road
 again, bring back tree shadows and birdsongs,
 build another promise of another paradise
 meant to last another forever. He'll never see
 me, the poet standing before him, trying
 to read his mind across time, wondering if
 he was thinking what I'm today, both of us
 looking down the road that will stretch on
 for years after I too disappear into a photo.





Amrica
 


 I.
 Although Ta Miriam boasted she discovered
 at least half a dozen uses for peanut butter--
 topping for guava shells in syrup,
 butter substitute for Cuban toast,
 hair conditioner and relaxer--
 Mam never knew what to make 
 of the monthly five-pound jars
 handed out by the immigration department 
 until my friend, Jeff, mentioned jelly.
  
  
 II.
 There was always pork though, 
 for every birthday and wedding, 
 whole ones on Christmas and New Year's Eve,
 even on Thanksgiving day--pork, 
 fried, broiled, or crispy skin roasted--
 as well as cauldrons of black beans, 
 fried plantain chips, and yuca con mojito.
 These items required a special visit
 to Antonio's Mercado on the corner of Eighth Street
 where men in guayaberas stood in senate
 blaming Kennedy for everything--"Ese hijo de puta!
 the bile of Cuban coffee and cigar residue
 filling the creases of their wrinkled lips;
 clinging to one another's lies of lost wealth,
 ashamed and empty as hollow trees.
  
 III.
 By seven I had grown suspicious--we were still here.
 Overheard conversations about returning
 had grown wistful and less frequent.
 I spoke English; my parent's didn't.
 We didn't live in a two-story house
 with a maid or a wood-panel station wagon
 nor vacation camping in Colorado.
 None of the girls had hair of gold;
 none of my brothers or cousins
 were named Greg, Peter, or Marcia;
 we were not the Brady Bunch.
 None of the black and white characters
 on Donna Reed or on the Dick Van Dyke Show
 were named Guadalupe, Lzaro, or Mercedes.
 Patty Duke's family wasn't like us either--
 they didn't have pork on Thanksgiving,
 they ate turkey with cranberry sauce;
 they didn't have yuca, they had yams
 like the dittos of Pilgrims I colored in class.
  
 IV.
  A week before Thanksgiving
 I explained to my abuelita
 about the Indians and the Mayflower,
 how Lincoln set the slaves free;
 I explained to my parents about
 the purple mountain's majesty,
 "one if by land, two if by sea,
 the cherry tree, the tea party,
 the amber waves of grain,
 the "masses yearning to be free,
 liberty and justice for all, until
 finally they agreed:
 this Thanksgiving we would have turkey,
 as well as pork.
  
  
 V.
 Abuelita prepared the poor fowl
 as if committing an act of treason,
 faking her enthusiasm for my sake.
 Mam set a frozen pumpkin pie in the oven
 and prepared candied yams following instructions
 I translated from the marshmallow bag.
 The table was arrayed with gladiolas,
 the plattered turkey loomed at the center
 on plastic silver from Woolworth's.
 Everyone sat in green velvet chairs
 we had upholstered with clear vinyl,
 except To Carlos and Toti, seated
 in the folding chairs from the Salvation Army.
 I uttered a bilingual blessing
 and the turkey was passed around
 like a game of Russian Roulette.
 "DRY, To Berto complained, and proceeded
 to drown the lean slices with pork fat drippings
 and cranberry jelly--"esa mierda roja, he called it.
 Faces fell when Mam presented her ochre pie--
 pumpkin was a home remedy for ulcers, not a dessert.
 Ta Mara made three rounds of Cuban coffee
 then Abuelo and Pepe cleared the living room furniture,
 put on a Celia Cruz LP and the entire family
 began to merengue over the linoleum of our apartment,
sweating rum and coffee until they remembered--
 it was 1970 and 46 degrees--
 in Amrica.
 After repositioning the furniture,
 an appropriate darkness filled the room.
 To Berto was the last to leave.





II [What is this tint that in the shrill cress]
 

What is this tint that in the shrill cress
 Will never cease to trouble us and in the fields
 Gives prick and praise for Beauty?
 And said birds that feed on berries
 Are pervious--and shook the snow from his thighs.
 I thought of nothing carefully, but of snow, and the birds.
 Then kissed the cup and sipped a little
 Though almost choked drank slowly
 Tickled with strange measure
 She faked a pretty anger
 I entertained the night with fantastic, empty pleasure
 We went as far as the ivie-bush
 And ivie-crowns upon our heads
 And carried her kiss untouched and entire
 Then all was fresh, inclined
 To wriggle and nussle and lascivious
 Ardent leaps. In the thickest of the wood
 Bid him kiss close and often
 And directed him to her fancie
 The ground had a sweeter scent, the boughs a blush
 One fruit, rare and rich, would outdo many together
 She was wild to climb the tree
 Nor would she be forbidden
 She seized the apple and put it in her bosom.





How to Judge
 

To those whose city is taken give glass
pockets. To those whose quiver gapes give queens
 and pace their limbs with flutes, ropes, cups of soft
 juice. To those whose threshold vacillates give
 that bruise the dust astonished. To falling
 heroes give raucous sibyls' polished knees.
 To those who sip nectar give teeth. And if
 they still sip nectar--give green chips of wood.
 To swimmers give clocks or rank their hearts
 among new satellites as you would
 Garbo's skint lip. To scholars, give dovecotes
 to virgins, targets. Justice has nothing on them.
 Virgil, sweetheart, even pretty fops need
 justice. If they think not let creditors
 flank them and watch their vigour quickly flag.
 To exiled brides give tiny knives and beads
 of mercury then rob them of prudence
 for prudence is defunct. To those who fist
 clouds, give powder. And if their sullen
 wallets flap, give nothing at all. Still
 I have not addressed lambent fops
 swathed in honey, the stuttering moon
 Martyrs, Spartans, Sirens, Mumblers, Pawns
 Ventriloquists--or your sweet ego
  
 The Beloved Ego in the plummy light
 is you. When I see you in that light
 I desire all that has been kept from me
 etcetera. For you. Since your rough shirt
 reminds me of the first grass
 pressing my hips and seeds heads
 fringing the sky and the sky
 swaying lightly to your scraped
 breath, since I hear
 panicked, my sister calling
 since the gold leaves have all
 been lost, and you are at least
 several and variegated
 I toss this slight thread back
  
 The beloved ego on cold marble
 blurs inscription. Hey Virgil
 I think your clocked ardour is stuck
 in the blue vein on my wrist. It stops
 all judgement





Envoy
 

I have tried to say
 that, although Love is not judgement
 analysis too is a style
 of affect
 since the scale that rends me vulnerable
 has cut, from abundance, doubt
 (not that identity shunts
 civic ratio or consequence) Sure --
 I would prefer to respond to only
 the established charms (and forget inconvenience)
 but her hair was also a kind of honey
 or instrument.
  
 All that is beautiful, from which I choose
 even artifice, which I hold above nature
 won't salve these stuttered accoutrements





[It was Jessica Grim the American poet...]
 

It was Jessica Grim the American poet
 who first advised me to read Violette Leduc.
 Lurid conditions are facts. This is no different
 from the daily protests and cashbars.
 I now unknowingly speed towards
 which of all acts, words, conditions --
 I am troubled that I do not know.
 When I feel depressed in broad daylight
 depressed by the disappearance of names, the pollen
 smearing the windowsill, I picture
 the bending pages of La Btarde
 and I think of wind. The outspread world is
 comparable to a large theatre
 or to rending paper, and the noise it makes when it flaps
 is riotous. Clothes swish through the air, rubbing
 my ears. Promptly I am quenched. I'm talking
 about a cheap paperback which fans and
 slips to the floor with a shush. Skirt stretched
 taut between new knees, head turned back, I
 hold down a branch,





[Sometimes I want a corset like...]
 

Sometimes I want a corset like
 to harden me or garnish. I
 think of this stricture--rain
 language, building--as a corset: an
 outer ideal mould, I feel
 the ideal moulding me the ideal
 is now my surface just so very
 perfect I know where to buy it and I
 take it off. I take it off. If all things fall
 and we are just emperors, serious
 and accurate and fugitive
 in such dormant lines of gorgeousness
 the day is a locksmith
 dew lies long on the grass
 and I a rustic ask: what is
 a surface--and respond
 only omniscience, the crumpling face
 as the domestic emotions elucidate
 themselves a sea of mist
 exists so strangely side by side
 the potent mould of anarchy and scorn.





Monday
 

          
          First all belief is paradise. So pliable a medium. A time not very long. A transparency caused. A conveyance of rupture. A subtle transport. Scant and rare. Deep in the opulent morning, blissful regions, hard and slender. Scarce and scant. Quotidian and temperate. Begin afresh in the realms of the atmosphere, that encompasses the solid earth, the terraqueous globe that soars and sings, elevated and flimsy. Bright and hot. Flesh and hue. Our skies are inventions, durations, discoveries, quotas, forgeries, fine and grand. Fine and grand. Fresh and bright. Heavenly and bright. The day pours out space, a light red roominess, bright and fresh. Bright and oft. Bright and fresh. Sparkling and wet. Clamour and tint. We range the spacious fields, a battlement trick and fast. Bright and silver. Ribbons and failings. To and fro. Fine and grand. The sky is complicated and flawed and we're up there in it, floating near the apricot frill, the bias swoop, near the sullen bloated part that dissolves to silver the next instant bronze but nothing that meaningful, a breach of greeny-blue, a syllable, we're all across the swathe of fleece laid out, the fraying rope, the copper beech behind the aluminum catalpa that has saved the entire spring for this flight, the tops of these a part of the sky, the light wind flipping up the white undersides of leaves, heaven afresh, the brushed part behind, the tumbling. So to the heavenly rustling. Just stiff with ambition we range the spacious trees in earnest desire sure and dear. Brisk and west. Streaky and massed. Changing and appearing. First and last. This was made from Europe, formed from Europe, rant and roar. Fine and grand. Fresh and bright. Crested and turbid. Silver and bright. This was spoken as it came to us, to celebrate and tint, distinct and designed. Sure and dear. Fully designed. Dear afresh. So free to the showing. What we praise we believe, we fully believe. Very fine. Belief thin and pure and clear to the title. Very beautiful. Belief lovely and elegant and fair for the footing. Very brisk. Belief lively and quick and strong by the bursting. Very bright. Belief clear and witty and famous in impulse. Very stormy. Belief violent and open and raging from privation. Very fine. Belief intransigent after pursuit. Very hot. Belief lustful and eager and curious before beauty.Very bright. Belief intending afresh. So calmly and clearly. Just stiff with leaf sure and dear and appearing and last. With lust clear and scarce and appearing and last and afresh.
        




Autumn
 

The rusty leaves crunch and crackle, 
Blue haze hangs from the dimmed sky, 
The fields are matted with sun-tanned stalks-- 
Wind rushes by. 

The last red berries hang from the thorn-tree, 
The last red leaves fall to the ground. 
Bleakness, through the trees and bushes, 
Comes without sound.





Portraits
 

Mother came to visit today. We
hadn't seen each other in years. Why didn't
you call? I asked. Your windows are filthy, she said. I know,
I know. It's from the dust and rain. She stood outside.
I stood in, and we cleaned each one that way, staring into each other's eyes, 
rubbing the white towel over our faces, rubbing
away hours, years. This is what it was like
when you were inside me, she said. What? I asked,
though I understood. Afterwards, indoors, she smelled like snow
melting. Holding hands we stood by the picture window,
gazing into the December sun, watching the pines in flame.







Living Tree
 

It's said they planted trees by graves 
to soak up spirits of the dead
through roots into the growing wood. 
The favorite in the burial yards
I knew was common juniper.
One could do worse than pass into 
such a species. I like to think
that when I'm gone the chemicals
and yes the spirit that was me
might be searched out by subtle roots 
and raised with sap through capillaries 
into an upright, fragrant trunk,
and aromatic twigs and bark,
through needles bright as hoarfrost to 
the sunlight for a century
or more, in wood repelling rot
and standing tall with monuments
and statues there on the far hill,
erect as truth, a testimony,
in ground that's dignified by loss,
around a melancholy tree
that's pointing toward infinity.







The Color Green
 

Two floors up, at the corner of Hearst and Shattuck,
he's clamped for good                                    
in an iron lung. When it's time to eat
he nudges his head a sweaty mile
to the edge of the pillow. It takes a while.
  
His brilliant bloodshot light-blue eyes
steer me from cupboard to fridge:                     
he would like his chicken burrito
cut into bite-size pieces,                                            
a bent straw for his glass of water, please.                
 
How does the body live its only life
in a cage? I watch him compute the distance
from bar to bar, and squeeze
between them
with a violent compression, a fury of bursting free
that doesn't last.                     
  
His will is a crowbar, angled to pry up                                             
the rooted intractable weight
of matter. I watch him slyly, I check out
the way he does it. He
does it. But pain in its absolute privacy                                  
weighs what it weighs.
 
I come here to study the soul, posing one question               
a dozen ways, most of them silent. 
"If I'm only a body, he laughs,                       
"I'm up shit creek. His laugh                         
a gritty eruption of rock, salt and breath.
 
Like me he writes poems                                             
but he does it letter by letter  
on a propped keyboard, the mouth-stick
wobbling between his teeth.
That kind of speed keeps a poet accountable.                         
He won't ever say, "The grass is very green
when it's only green. 





Flour and Ash
 

"Make flour into dough, she answers,
 "and fire will turn it into food.
 Ash is the final abstraction of matter.
 You can just brush it away.
  
 She tacks a sheet of paper to the wall,
 dips her hand in a palette of flour and ash,
 applies the fine soft powders with a fingertip,
 highlighting in chalk and graphite,
 blending, blurring with her thumb.
 Today she is working in seven shades of gray.
  
 Outside the door, day lilies 
 in the high flush of summer-
 about-to-be-fall. Her garden burns
 red and yellow in the dry August air
 and is not consumed.
  
 Inside, on the studio wall, a heavy 
 particulate smoke
 thickens and rises. Footsteps grime the snow.
 The about-to-be-dead line up on the ramp
 with their boxy suitcases,
 ashen shoes.
  
 When I get too close she yanks me back. 
 She hovers over her creation
 though she too has a mind
 to brush against that world
 and wipe it out.





Blood Honey
 

Apprehended and held without trial,
our friend was sentenced:
brain tumor, malignant.
Condemned each day to wake
and remember.

Overnight, a wall sprang up around him,
leaving the rest of us
outside.

Death passed over us this time.
We're still at large. We're free
to get out of bed, start the coffee,
open the blinds.
The first of the human freedoms.

If he's guilty
we must be guilty; we're all made of
the same cup of dust--

It's a blessing, isn't it? To be able,
days at a time,
to forget what we are.


             *

These numbered days
have a concentrated sweetness
that's pressed from us,
the dying man most of all.

Today we eat brunch at Chester's,
poached egg on toast,
orange juice foaming in frosted glasses.

He remembers the summer he packed blood oranges,
stripped to the waist,
drinking the fresh-squeezed juice in the factory
straight from the tap.
He cups his left hand under his chin
as if to a faucet, laughing.

He is scooping sweetness from the belly of death
--honey from the lion's carcass.

We sit with our friend
and brood on the riddle he sets before us:
What is it, this blood honey?

          *


A shadow is eating the sun.
It can blind you
but he's looking right at it,
he won't turn away.

Already his gaze is marked
by such hard looking,
though just now he asked,
plaintive as a child,
Why won't it go away?

Day after day breaks
and gives him
back to us
broken.

Soon the husk of his knowing
won't know even that.

          *

A man lies alone in his body in a world
he can still desire.
Another slice of pie? he asks.

As long as he's hungry
he's still one of us.
Oh Lord, not yet.

He drums out a jazz beat on the bedrail
with his one good hand
when the words stumble.
See? he says. I can trick the tumor.

He can still taste and see.
The world is good.

He hauls himself up in bed,
squinting his one good eye at the kingdom
through a keyhole
that keeps getting smaller
and smaller.
It is good. It is very good.





Venice Beach
 

                                       Annihilating all that's made
                                       To a green thought in a green shade.                                                           --Andrew Marvell
These are all thoughts--of course. At the edge of the ocean with nowhere to go,
the nearest land three thousand miles away and under different management, 

the diving sun another thirty thousand times that, there is no reality, 
only these parlous notions, messages, statements, stylings on the edge of extinction. 

Little petillas. A kind of spontaneous zoo of human recency and arrival 
and promontory variorum. Imprudent comb-over thoughts, 

rigid and proud eye-catching false thoughts, little jiggling thoughts, 
intricate braided-beard thoughts the product of much misplaced patience, 

product placement thoughts (which are rather elementary, 
and are almost a contradiction in terms), unlike myriad highly-evolved 

dog thoughts (no mutts here), pushing a baby in a three-wheeled stroller 
whilst running very hard in no shirt and six-pack thoughts, 

this a development on the now-obsolete egg and paddle 
(what it does to the infant to be impelled at such a rate into the future 

whilst facing backwards like an Aeroflot passenger is not recorded--
not that forward is necessarily better), high-concept silky-swishing Afghan hound thoughts, 

intrusive bum thoughts, hapless and homeless panhandler thoughts
(a smarte carte loaded with undesirables never far to seek),

low-slung belly-dragging beagle thoughts little better 
than the serpent in the Bible, holding hands Adam and Eve thoughts,

foot-shuffling Zimmer frame thoughts, "revolution in mobility wheelchair and gravel thoughts, 
pushed by most likely an illegal attendant borderline thoughts,

candy-striped T-shirt and shorts thoughts, cut-off thoughts, 
paired with sometimes nothing more than a bikini top, those three-quarter length 

thin and probably amphibious trousers, worn without socks, that men go in for,
suggestive of adaptability and resourcefulness thoughts,

standard over-loud mobile thoughts, ("our relationship is...),
lying immobile on the grass on your back mobile thoughts 

(these are different), tourist thoughts, an unexpected preponderance of Russian thoughts 
(though with residential qualifications), borscht belt leopard skin thoughts 

dripping with gold and eccentric lamentations, dog and baby both thoughts 
(these last thought to be ideally-balanced), high-stepping poodle thoughts

like a four-wheel drive with little intelligence in rough country, 
furiously texting in the glare with all thumbs to the pump thoughts, 

being at least half elsewhere, baseball cap thoughts rife with determination, 
slightly dated straw hat thoughts, reverse baseball cap also thoughts.





LV
 

The luncheon voucher years 
(the bus pass and digitized medical record 
always in the inside pocket come later, 
and the constant orientation to the nearest hospital). 
The years of "sir (long past "mate, much less "dearie), 
of invisibility, of woozy pacifism,
of the preemptive smile of the hard-of-hearing,

of stiff joints and the small pains
that will do me in. The ninth complement
of fresh--stale--cells, the Late Middle Years 
(say, 1400 AD--on the geological calendar),
the years of the incalculable spreading middle, 
the years of speculatively counting down 
from an unknown terminus, 

because the whole long stack--
shale, vertebrae, pancakes, platelets, plates--
won't balance anymore, and doesn't correspond anyway 
to the thing behind the eyes that says "I
and feels uncertain green and treble
and wants its kilt as it climbs up to the lectern to blush 
and read "thou didst not abhor the virgin's womb. 

The years of taking the stairs two at a time 
(though not at weekends) 
a bizarre debt to Dino Buzzati's Tartar Steppe, 
the years of a deliberate lightness of tread,
perceived as a nod to Franz Josef
thinking with his knees and rubber-tired Viennese Fiaker. 
The years when the dead are starting to stack up. 

The years of incuriosity and novarum rerum 
incupidissimus, the years of cheap acquisition
and irresponsible postponement, or cheap
postponement and irresponsible acquisition,
of listlessness, of miniaturism, of irascibility, 
of being soft on myself, of being hard on myself,
and neither knowing nor especially caring which.

The years of re-reading (at arm's length).
The fiercely objected-to professional years, 
the appalling indulgent years, the years of no challenge 
and comfort zone and safely within my borders.
The years of no impressions and little memory.

The years of standing in elevators
under the elevator lights in the elevator mirror, 
feeling and looking like leathered frizz,
an old cheese-topped dish under an infrared hot plate.

The years of one over the thirst 
and another one over the hunger, of insomnia
and sleeping in, of creases and pouches and heaviness
and the hairdresser offering to trim my eyebrows.
The years of the unbeautiful corpse in preparation. 
The years to choose: sild, or flamber
...?





Dolphins at Seven Weeks
 

          
          Inward lush unpetaling purpose in pink blooms of sleep, and I no longer needed to be separate. I was living there then, at the edge of the sea. And my friends came to visit, trying for a baby, not sure how to read me on that island of dozy sunlight. And there it was: familiarity edged with fear, the way we'd feed each other sandwiches and wonder if we should have wanted something other. We walked the folded cliffs over conifer fronds and mud runneling rocks slick with dropped fruit and rotting camellias to pause at the first ridge. We looked through high pines at the blue moving tides, then his finger caught a snag in the water and another and we saw--glinting fins wheeling the sheen, thousands playing in pods coming closer like the souls slippering into our bodies, attaching to matter as flippers angle into a ferrying strand. We too are a species, I realized. We too could know that as joy.
        




Kauai
 

We've come back to the site of her
conception. She calls it why 

and cries all night, 
sleepless, wild.

It seems the way is always
floating and the goal-- 

to live so the ghosts we were 
don't trail us and echo.

I think we are inside a flower,
under a pollen of stars vast as scattered sand.

The air pulses with perfume,
flowers calling to flowers and the ferrying air.

But my eyes are thin and elsewhere.
I am thinking, maybe 

even coming into the soul 
is a difficult birth, squeezed by the body's vise.

My bent legs like pincers
or the vegetable petals of some tropical flower.

Even my mind gripped by the folds 
of the flesh, how the cells keep twinning 

themselves out toward complexity.
The tulip trees of the valley

spread their bone canopies into slick green leaves 
and fire flowers deep as cups.

Their cups fill with rain, rain 
drinks the leaves drinking rain.

I can't begin to explain.
How on this porous peak of stone in the sea

our daughter came into me.
Little flick of a fish I could not see.

I was just learning to be human 
and upright among all that life.

And what was real was stranger
than night with its dust of unnamed suns.

It was the beyond in us. And she was.





The Labor of Stagger Lee: Boar
 

pigs prey to piggishnesses. get ate from the rooter to the tooter. 
I'm a hog for you baby, I can't get enough go the wolfish crooner. 
the gust buffeted porker roll in the hay or laid down 
              in twig rapine. let me in, let me in. 

              no drum-gut, Stagger's stomach a tenement: 
his deadeye bigger than his brick house. 
Stagger Lee live by the want and die by the noose, 
whose greedy void like a whorehouse 
              full of empties getting full. can't get enough! 
rumored Stagger would root through pussy 
to plumb a fat boy. here piggy! what Lee see he seize. 
manful, ham-fisted. sorry Billy, 
              your name mud and who love dirt like swine? 
they get in it like a straw house. it'll be cold out 
before Lee admit his squeals weren't howls. 
he got down. he get dirty.





Girl-Watching
 

In the years I've been at this
(Lots, not to be precise)
You'd think that once or twice
At least I would have seen
Some anomalies. I mean
Some major ones. As in
Not feet but little wheels,
Or crests like cockatiels'.
Where are they keeping the girls
With a chrome exterior,
Or an extra derriere?
Apparently nowhere.
Assuming my sample's valid,
The pool is limited 
To the standard types I've tallied;
Such variance as there is
In the usual congeries
Of physiognomies--
And yet enough of it 
To be worth the looking at. 
The walking by, for that,
Of the same girl over and over
Would be no cross to bear
If it were that one there.





Judo
 

I.e., the kind of verse
That doesn't try to force
People to their knees
(Seeing as it sees
To people's being thrown
By forces of their own).





Why I Never Applied Myself to Pool
 

Not that I lacked an eye entirely,
But give me an oblique enough kiss
To visualize, and my eye said "See ya later.
A little practice might have sharpened it,
But what was needed here was not as much
A sharper as a higher order eye,
A whole other orb altogether.





Nose Job
 

An unexpected consequence
Of mine (and one that shows how well
It really went, in a scary sense)
Is at its most perceptible
When I happen to observe a nose
With the hump of which my nose is rid
(Though not my psyche, you'd suppose)
And feel the sighting visited
By what a lord might call a kind
Of pity: distant, tinged with scorn...
A thing you'd more expect to find
In someone to his beauty born.





Sonnet
 

you have lipstick on your collar I say
to my father the priest that's just the Blood
of Christ my son he replies by and by
(the milky thigh of Mary in my mind)
William Blake's eyes aligning in the snow
a statue outside London simply called
"The Heretic where birds sit and shit and
live out their days in unconscious praise 
of that third space between language and the
mute object as sunlight pours through 
the stained glass at the Lincoln Park Zoo
where I saw the lions pacing and you 
told me to always remember that the cage
is for the protection of the captor





Bon Courage
 

Why are the woods so alluring? A forest appears 
to a young girl one morning as she combs 
the dreams out of her hair. The trees rustle 
and whisper, shimmer and hiss. The forest 
opens and closes, a door loose on its hinges, 
banging in a strong wind. Everything in the dim 
kitchen: the basin, the jug, the skillet, the churn, 
snickers scornfully. In this way a maiden 
is driven toward the dangers of a forest, 
but the forest is our subject, not this young girl.

She's glad to lie down with trees towering all around.
A certain euphoria sets in. She feels molecular, 
bedeviled, senses someone gently pulling her hair, 
tingles with kisses she won't receive for years. 
Three felled trees, a sort of chorus, narrate 
her thoughts, or rather channel theirs through her, 
or rather subject her to their peculiar verbal 
restlessness...our deepening need for non-being intones 
the largest and most decayed tree, mid-sentence. 
I'm not one of you squeaks the shattered sapling,

blackened by lightning. Their words become metallic 
spangles shivering the air. Will I forget the way home?
the third blurts. Why do I feel like I'm hiding in a giant's nostril?
the oldest prone pine wants to know. Are we being freed 
from matter? the sapling asks. Insects are well-intentioned, 
offers the third tree, by way of consolation. Will it grow
impossible to think a thought through to its end? gasps the sapling, 
adding in a panicky voice, I'm becoming spongy! The girl 
feels her hands attach to some distant body. She rises 
to leave, relieved these trees are not talking about her.





Hoffnung
 

He fancies his chances are good with her, 
unaware that in the years since the war 

she has come to prefer women whose cunts 
taste like mustard. To pin one's hopes on 

a bark-colored moth, its wings crinkled 
like crepe paper, a moth affixed high 

on the kitchen wall, frozen for days where 
it will likely die in noble clinging mode

just under the cobwebby heating vent, 
is to confirm your need for more friends 

and a greater daily quota of sunlight. 
To raise C.'s hopes that T. can stop 

drinking and then to liken those 
hopes to fields of undulating grain, 

alfalfa perhaps, is to wish C. hip deep 
in acres of unscythed denial. The blind 

typist hopes she'll be hired tonight without 
her disability becoming an issue. L. said he felt 

hope's rhizomes race throughout his body, 
radiating in all directions, like some incipient 

disease he'd been fighting since childhood. 
Hope, he said, it's as insidious as bitterness. 

If mother earth only knew how much we 
loved one another she would creak, shudder, 

and split like a macheted melon, releasing 
the fiery ball of molten hope at her core.





Sea Foam Palace
 

(Bubbling and spuming
as if trying to talk under
water, I address you thus:)
Must I pretend not to love 
you (in your present bloom, 
your present perfection--soul 
encased in fleshly relevance)
so you won't believe me 
just another seabed denizen 
vying for your blessed attention? 
Some of us (but not you) 
are so loosely moored 
to our bodies we can 
barely walk a straight line, 
remaining (most days) only 
marginally conscious. 
We stagger and shudder 
as buckets of blood or sperm
or chocolate mousse or spittle 
or lymph or sludge sluice 
continually through us... 

I love the way you wear your 
face, how you ride this life. 
I delight in the sight of you,
your nervous, inquisitive eyes,
though I try to act otherwise.
Being stoned out of thy mind
only amps up thy fearsome 
brain wattage. Pardon my 
frontal offensive, dear chum. 
Forgive my word-churn, my 
drift, the ways this text message 
has gotten all frothy. How was it 
you became holy to me? Should 
I resist, furiously? Is this your 
true visage, shaken free, flashing 
glimpses of what underlies 
the world we can see? Do not forget me 
murmurs something nibbled 
by fish under the sea.

After dark you're quick-silvery, 
wet/slick/glistening. Don't 
make me chase you, dragging 
my heavy caresses, a pair of
awkward, serrated claws, 
hither and yon. Give me a swig 
of whatever you're drinking, 
to put me in tune with the cosmos's
relentless melt, with the rhythms 
of dish-washing, corn-shucking, 
hard-fucking, bed-wetting, and 
the folding of bones of other loves 
into well-dug graves...may we 
never become lost to the world.





Save the Candor
 

Every tripod-
toting birder
knows it never
nests on urban

girders. Even 
fences set its
scalded-crimson
head askew, its

waddle swinging,
wings akimbo.
Few have got it
on their lists and

fewer still have
caught it singing,
this endangered
North American

candor, cousin
of the done-in 
dodo, big-eyed
Big Sur tremor-

tenor--only
ten or twenty
hang glide over
Modoc County,

humbly numbered
(as their days are)
for us crazy
crown- and throat- and

belly-gazers.
Any niche as
fragile as a
candor's renders

its extinction
certain. We can 
sabotage its
habitat with

half a laugh or
quarter murmur,
fluster coveys
worth of candors

off their branches,
which, abandoned,
soon are little
more than snarking-

grounds for minor
birds, the common 
snipe, the yellow-
bellied bittern.





Aria
 

What if it were possible to vanquish
All this shame with a wash of varnish
Instead of wishing the stain would vanish?

What if you gave it a glossy finish?
What if there were a way to burnish
All this foolishness, all the anguish?

What if you gave yourself leave to ravish
All these ravages with famished relish?
What if this were your way to flourish?

What if the self you love to punish--
Knavish, peevish, wolfish, sheepish--
Were all slicked up in something lavish?

Why so squeamish? Why make a fetish
Out of everything you must relinquish?
Why not embellish what you can't abolish?

What would be left if you couldn't brandish
All the slavishness you've failed to banish?
What would you be without this gibberish?

What if the true worth of the varnish
Were to replenish your resolve to vanquish
Every vain wish before you vanish?





Corn Maze
 

Here is where 
You can get nowhere 
Faster than ever
As you go under
Deeper and deeper

In the fertile smother
Of another acre
Like any other
You can't peer over
And then another

And everywhere
You veer or hare
There you are
Farther and farther
Afield than before

But on you blunder
In the verdant meander
As if the answer
To looking for cover
Were to bewilder

Your inner minotaur
And near and far were
Neither here nor there
And where you are
Is where you were





Lacrimarium
 

Were there a tear 
To spare, where better
To be sure the gesture
Would linger than here
In its own little bottle
Blown from a hot bubble
To mirror a tear.

And were there more
Than one could bear,
So much the better
In the hereafter for
The begetter, a little
Vessel to stopper
Sorrow beyond measure.

And were there a tear
Too few, far better to hire
A weeper, for where
But in a tearful little
Jigger does it figure
No one need settle for
Less than a fair share.





Beaded Baby Moccasins
 

If love is like a doll's shoe--
the color of nascent snow
that laces over the ankle 
or the polychromatic beaded baby moccasins 
we saw lying in the museum drawer
that belonged to an infant from a sea tribe of seal hunters.
Or the rutilant pink blossoms 
of the locust tree that bloomed in the dark 
while I slept dreaming of my arrival 
on a red-eye wearing a long to the floor skirt--
not of a postulant, but of a flower vendor
or a woman covering disfigurement. 
Freud believed that religious faith 
is a wish-fulfilling illusion.
I can't locate faith in a carved or uncarved pew.
I'm more focused on the altar boy's shoes. 
Under his white robe he's wearing a man's black loafers 
vastly oversized for his small feet with
sufficient spare space for a coyote den in each toe.
I want to buy him a kite.
If love is a mezzanine floor we will not fall from, 
a hand holding back my hair from my face 
as I'm sick on the side of the bus. 
The mouth so at home in the vicinity of pavement.
Pew also means to enclose, as in men who were 
as willingly pewed in the parish church 
as their sheep were in night folds.
Freud also believed civilized life imposes suffering,
yet he always wore a dinner jacket.
We delaminate layers of old paint
bleach sheets in the shade.
I take out the oily ham from the beans,
the unflattering photos from the folio, 
the quotes about repressed homosexuality 
being the reason Sigmund's patient Little Hans
is afraid of horses.





Devotions
 

1


Nothing passes, Lord, but what you allow.
Mornings the milky sap on my knuckles
burns. Last night the piglets fought then suckled 
in the barn. Still no word. Our one cow
grazes but won't come in. The pamphlets say: 
Patience is required. I say, let's try again
but John blames the state, the neighbors, the way 
we wrote our bios, filling out the forms.
Across the road our neighbor starts his truck
while God, feather by feather, downs a wren--
swollen, its black eyes shiny, small dark tongue.
In the drainpipe, something slithers wet and stuck. 
A race runner? A ground skink shedding skin?
Lizards, John tells me, can't bear live young.


2


John tells me: lizards can't bear live young.
Another of God's mysteries: hard rain
muddying the corn. The kind woman 
at the agency said, it takes longer for certain
types of couples. Trash smoke rises like prayer,
the neighbor burning insulation from his shed.
He shows his son how to bind fence where 
a crippled chicken pecks at scattered feed.
They talk, lean close. Rusted toys fill
the side yard: old trucks, a bicycle tire,
a punctured red bucket now a sieve.
In the back acre, ram mounts ewe, the whole
field coupling late spring. When John walks by, 
I kiss him. Most days we keep to ourselves.


3


I kiss him most days. We keep to ourselves 
by the roadside. Two greasy boxes; a sign:
FREE. We take the runt, her warm body beside
us in the truck, milk-breathed and unwormed.
I imagine her shuddering out of the womb, wet
ground covered with slime. Strange to think
of her moving inside some animal's gut, 
the source of each day's warm alien kick. 
At home John makes her a bed from old 
field shirts, a soap and vinegar bath for fleas
while in my lap she chews my hand and shivers.
I brush her fuzzy scruff, the too-large head.
She nips at my finger that holds a piece of cheese, 
her wet tongue asking what a man can mother. 


4


Even I doubt how a man can mother 
when I see the neighbor shout, chuck a stone 
at his son. When I shoot him a look, he turns: 
mind your own business. The hot sun withers
the peonies John planted on the side of the hill,
dirt gone hard with the sudden change of weather.
Sweating, I mow the lawn, pick up shell 
casings in the yard, the crow's strict feathers.
All day I want to break something, stick 
a fork in the fan blades to feel the pinch.
Coming home late again from the shop, 
John carries two rabbits slung from a hook. 
He cleans, for hours, his rifle on the porch.
Above us: the moon rises. An easy shot.


5


Above us the sun rises, bright and hot,
steaming the back pond where black flies stall.
In the pasture, our neighbor castrates his bulls
using a spreading tool with red rubber slats. 
The restless cattle graze an unshorn meadow.
On TV: a baby in Toledo in a locked car. 
The mother went to work and forgot, windows
up in summer's heat. The camera blurs
over the lot as a medic lifts the blanketed heap
from the back seat in the crew's full view.
Gawkers circle. The mother weeps. Watching, 
I can peaches, letting the pale fruit darken. 
Beyond the window, bulls still graze the field.
They feed. The bloodless sacks swing, blacken.


6


Steer feed. The bloodless sacks hang, blackened.
On the radio: Haggard's I'd rather be gone. 
John tends to ordinary things: replaces the drain-
pipe in the kitchen sink, sharpens knives again.
I watch the neighbor teach his son to paint 
the tool shed all afternoon. Soon, they wrestle,
throw a ball, the boy laughing into his father's chest.
In the paper I read the births and deaths,
hear a sudden hammering from behind,
John cursing the warped floorboards, pushing hard
the back door, which still won't budge an inch.
Again today no miracles at hand, 
just, in the field, wrens who stab at milkweed pods,
a nuthatch bargaining from its split branch.


7


A nuthatch bargains from its split branch.
Our neighbor stops by, complains our fence
breaks his field. It must be moved eight inches.
The puppy--Annie, we call her--pushes
her nose in everything, the front yard, the garden,
finds, across the road, the neighbor's trash--
drags stripped wire, eggshells that harden
like the bones she buries off his porch.
I want to say we are consoled by her,
but each day John jumps when he hears the phone. 
We walk over and over down the worn 
path to the empty mailbox: Maybe soon.
Some nights we make love. We sleep arm to arm.
We wake to our neighbor yelling at his son. 


8


Again we wake, our neighbor yelling at his son, 
poor kid standing by the porch. Tracking mud,
he backs from the shouting, his father's raised fist. 
Later I will see him sulking near our feed shed,
knotting an old piece of garden hose, kicking dust.
I'll smile, ask if he's OK. But right now 
I listen to John's quiet breathing beside me. 
Faith, they say, is Abraham asked to slaughter 
his boy on a mountaintop. But sometimes 
it's just the peeling shed in gray weather, 
the leather harness softened, then gone rough.
All day today the back pond will teem with carp. 
The clover will brighten. For now we lie together 
into late morning. Some days, it is enough.

Here, in the private life
my team invents,
I'm in a floodlit kitchen

and I am chopping

Isn't this the past

Should I feel nostalgic?

This corn is highly

The Eye
 

These brown piles
of stubble

hills

have failed.

They should be more

                       

It should be difficult
but not impossible

to transmute
latitude

into a thought

a god could
hold.

                       

Barred light:

dunes coming on
and on.

                       

The eye, yes,
must move

to prevent 
blank spots

from making themselves
known.





Pandemania
 

There are fewer introductions
In plague years,
Hands held back, jocularity
No longer bellicose,
Even among men. 
Breathing's generally wary,
Labored, as they say, when
The end is at hand.
But this is the everyday intake
Of the imperceptible life force,
Willed now, slow--
Well, just cautious
In inhabited air.
As for ongoing dialogue,
No longer an exuberant plosive
To make a point,
But a new squirreling of air space,
A new sense of boundary.
Genghis Khan said the hand
Is the first thing one man gives
To another. Not in this war.
A gesture of limited distance
Now suffices, a nod,
A minor smile or a hand
Slightly raised,
Not in search of its counterpart,
Just a warning within
The acknowledgment to stand back.
Each beautiful stranger a barbarian
Breathing on the other side of the gate.





For Clifford Bernel
 

Lonnie didn't want to eat with Clifford.
 I tried to keep my eyes away from his mouth,
 Which opened uncontrollably,
 His thick saliva oozing over him.
 And he couldn't talk.
 So I ate my lunch with Lonnie, heard him talk
 About the dive which broke his neck, about
 His motorcycle shop in Chico, while
 Another nurse gave Clifford lunch.
  
                                                 Every day
 His parents came to push his chair around
 The grounds. A grim, determined pair;
 I wondered what disasters they had seen.
 The nurses talked with them about
 Their son. His eyes are beautiful, they said.
 One day a nurse who put her stethoscope
 To Clifford's chest could not detect a beat.
 "His heart has stopped, she said in quiet awe.
 The P.A. speakers cried:
 CODE BLUE, C-2, STAT! CODE BLUE, C-2, STAT!
 The doctors, nurses and technicians ran
 Into our crowded room. The squeaking
 Crash cart could not be heard above
 The urgent, human sounds the doctors made:
 A swirl of orders filled the air. "I need
 The mallet quick, goddamnit, QUICK, I said!
 Encapsulated in my iron lung,
 I noted that doctors weren't the calm
 Professionals portrayed by Robert Young
 And Richard Chamberlain, but people just
 As scared of death as everybody else.
 Then, they took me, iron lung and all,
 And parked me in a room
 Where women patients spend their lives.
  
 The room was quiet as a stone; no clocks
 Or television sets marked the time,
 Which passed as slowly as Moses climbing Mount Sinai,
 Until the social worker, Mrs. Mintzer,
 Came to talk to me about Shakespeare. All his tragedies,
 She said, contain a point where things begin
 To fall apart. The bold protagonist,
 No matter what his cunning, skill or strength,
 Can see his fall foreshadowed by a small
 Event. Macbeth saw Banquo at the feast
 And after that it went from bad to worse
 Until the murd'rous thane became a corpse
 Without a head. She paused to think a while.
 Now Clifford led a fairly normal life,
 She pointed out, despite his cerebral palsy.
 Playing cards and camping with his family
 Were not beyond his reach.
 The point where things fell apart occurred
 Five years ago, when he fell and broke
 His shoulder bone.
 "Clifford died, she said.
 And tried to comfort me with her sympathy
 For my awful loss.

 I didn't mourn his death at all.
 "Too bad he died so young, I said,
 At twenty-three. But all I cared about
 Was the space in my crowded room.
 The p.m. nurses took me back into my room.
 I asked one to play my tape,
 Appalachian Spring.
 She reached into my bedside stand and slipped.
 "There's blood all over the floor, Clifford's.
 I thought they'd cleaned up all that mess.
  
 I spent the weekend after that in the solarium.
 I read and overheard the nurses in the next room.
 "They say he wrote exquisite poetry
 About the way he felt when people stared
 At him as if he were a freak.
                                     
                                                 And so
 I learned of my insensitivity,
 Insensitivity so great I failed
 To recognize a person
 Caught in much the same predicament as I.
 Such numbness isolates me more
 Than any iron lung.





The Man in the Iron Lung
 


 I scream
 The body electric,
 This yellow, metal, pulsing cylinder
 Whooshing all day, all night
 In its repetitive dumb mechanical rhythm.
 Rudely, it inserts itself in the map of my body,
 Which my midnight mind,
 Dream-drenched cartographer of terra incognita,
 Draws upon the dark parchment of sleep.
 I scream
 In my body electric;
 A dream snake bites my left leg.
 Indignant, I shake the gods by their abrupt shoulders,
 Demanding to know how such a vile slitherer
 Could enter my serene metal shell.
 The snake is punished with death,
 The specialty of the gods.
 Clamp-jawed still in my leg,
 It must be removed;
 The dream of the snake
 Must be removed,
 While I am restored
 By Consciousness, that cruelest of gods,
 In metal hard reluctance
 To my limited, awkward, dclas
 Body electric,
 As it whispers promises of health,
 Whooshes beautiful lies of invulnerability,
 Sighs sibilantly, seraphically, relentlessly:
 It is me,
 It is me.
  
  
                                                                                                 March, 1988





The Morning Routine
 

I tell my attendants,
 Right there,
 When they rub me where it itches.
 They rub for a few seconds, then move on,
 There's so much of it to wash,
 "It being me, a former person,
 Now something that must be washed every day
 In so little time.
 Fifty minutes outside my breathing machine,
 And all I can do is stare
 As my breath recedes like the woman
 Who would not love me.
 It's almost over,
 I say over and over to myself
 As soon as the machine is turned off.
 An idiotic mantra perhaps,
 But it helps when the ache descends into my eyes
 And my words quit coming out right.
 Left hand, I say.
 Right foot? the attendant says, guessing.
 I begin to fantasize about gusts of air
 Rushing down my windpipe with hurricane force.
 Garish and impossible, they're respiratory porn.
 My re-entry is stalled
 By the attendant straightening a sheet
 That no one will see.
 Enraged, I squeeze my eyes closed.
 Christ.
 "What?
 Never mind.
 Once back in and turned on,
 I cough violently and with conviction.
 Shocked by the force of the inrushing air,
 I feel my lungs expand like birthday balloons,
 My terror-flattened mind pops up into 3-D,
 As I return to the land of breathing.
  
                                                                                                 January, 1990
  





Breathing
 

Grasping for straws is easier;
 You can see the straws.
 "This most excellent canopy, the air, look you,
 Presses down upon me
 At fifteen pounds per square inch,
 A dense, heavy, blue-glowing ocean,
 Supporting the weight of condors
 That swim its churning currents.
 All I get is a thin stream of it,
 A finger's width of the rope that ties me to life
 As I labor like a stevedore to keep the connection.
 Water wouldn't be so circumspect;
 Water would crash in like a drunken sailor,
 But air is prissy and genteel,
 Teasing me with its nearness and pervading immensity.
 The vast, circumambient atmosphere
 Allows me but ninety cubic centimeters
 Of its billions of gallons and miles of sky.
 I inhale it anyway,
 Knowing that it will hurt
 In the weary ends of my crumpled paper bag lungs.
  
  
                                                                                                                         July, 1988





Bean Spasms
 

for George Schneeman
New York's lovely weather 
                                                    hurts my forehead 

                                                   in praise of thee 
                                                                               the? white dead

                           what are they 
    of the tiny cloud my brain:

                                    it's very ritzy in fact

drifting up into smoke the city's tough blue top:

                                         & go to the moon.





Curse Two: The Naming
 

Katherine, Katherine, Katherine, Katherine.
 Black hair, small cold eyes, whom you loved.
 Cock-tease Katherine, chewer of souls.
 The door blew open and she blew in, a ghoul.
 Black air, small cold wind, taking everything.
 Fish-eater Katherine, whose nails dig blood.
 I'm going to call her pinch-cunt, pickle-lip,
 piss-dribble, shit-smear, goat's-meat breath.
 I want to throw stones at her mother's corpse,
 send her children to name-change foster homes.
 May the coat she is wearing burst into flames
 and boil the flesh blistering off her bones.
 May she be refused in both heaven and hell
 and wander the earth forever without rest--
 a hungry ghost clinging to the rocks and trees.





Ghost
 

At first you didn't know me.
 I was a shape moving rapidly, nervous
  
 at the edge of your vision. A flat, high voice,
 dark slash of hair across my cheekbone.
  
 I made myself present, though never distinct.
 Things I said that he repeated, a tone
  
 you could hear, but never trace, in his voice.
 Silence--followed by talk of other things.
  
 When you would sit at your desk, I would creep
 near you like a question. A thought would scurry
  
 across the front of your mind. I'd be there,
 ducking out of sight. You must have felt me
  
 watching you, my small eyes fixed on your face,
 the smile you wondered at, on the lips only.
  
 The voice on the phone, quick and full of business.
 All that you saw and heard and could not find
  
 the center of, those days growing into years,
 growing inside of you, out of reach, now with you
  
 forever, in your house, in your garden, in corridors
 of dream where I finally tell you my name.





The Attic
 

It's September: I've moved into town,
 into the attic of an old barn--a big open room I reach
 by climbing a ladder that rises through a hole in the floor.
 The room is long and high, with windows at each end,
 a row of skylights that leak rain, and shake
 and chatter in the northeast winds. I sleep beneath
 the roof's steep pitch, my mattress flat on the boards,
 looking up at the high ceiling, where morning
 diffuses downward in grains of bright dust.
  
 This was the old painter's studio.
 The light in those famous canvases is still here
 --he couldn't carry it away with him--
 though his paintings took away everything else,
 opening space with a stroke of blue or yellow.
 I think of his violent loves, the stories
 they still tell about him here.
 But how quiet and alive his paintings were,
 how they quiver with the life not yet realized.
  
 The town is quiet in September.
 Sometimes I hear people talking in the street.
 Last night someone said they were going to wait for Michael,
 and a voice said that Michael had gone home.
 I walk the narrow path down to the marsh.
 Wind hard in the dunes. Rain as I'm returning,
 cutting through twisting streets, past gardens bent
 low with rain, their colors a wash of gold.
  
 I feel the air surround my body, feel it move
 between my legs and between each finger,
 as I walk, not mastering space, but in it.
 And when the clouds open, the sky
 suddenly wide and high, no roof of leaves,
 it seems there's nowhere to go but into wind or water.
 I climb the narrow stairs that keep turning,
 twisting inward until they meet the ceiling,
 which opens and I rise through the floor,
 released into an openness I never learn to expect.
  
 At the yellow table I sit and read
 an interview with Picasso's lover, Francoise Gilot,
 the only one to leave him and have another life.
 She says she was not destroyed by him, as the others were:
 "Because I am of the stuff that cannot be destroyed.
 I felt something blow through me then.
 Some devouring wind. Surely, then,
 I am of the stuff that can be destroyed.
 Haven't I felt it? The breaking of all I was?
 Don't I sit and count my losses,
 here in this room where all the life I knew has ended,
 so bare with desire I seem to be eating sky?
  
 That's how it is here: I'm lonely, sad;
 the wind blows along the roof and I can't sleep.
 Rain runs down the walls and streams across the floor,
 leaving dirty puddles on the boards.
A yellow table and a cupboard painted blue,
 three chairs that don't match, or even balance rightly,
 a dented bucket, its metal reflecting darkly
 what is, what cannot be taken away.
 What's beautiful here? The whole thing
 is beauty, a clarity not in things
 but around them, complete. And still,
  
 I seem to remain, somehow, myself,
 to remain at least something, at a loss
 to know how much can be taken from me
 and leave me only changed, not ruined,
 alert in an emptiness so alive
 I recognized it as my life. What would be left,
 the shape of it then, this life? I said some beauty,
 or radiance, an endless space I fall into
 or am taken up by, a brightness that holds me,
 gathers light in the center of empty space,
 like a vision of the life I have not lived.





Multiple Sclerosis
 

For ten years I would not say the name.
 I said: episode. Said: setback, incident,
 exacerbation--anything but be specific
 in the way this is specific, not a theory
 or description, but a diagnosis.
 I said: muscle, weakness, numbness, fatigue.
 I said vertigo, neuritis, lesion, spasm.
 Remission. Progression. Recurrence. Deficit.
  
 But the name, the ugly sound of it, I refused.
 There are two words. The last one means: scarring.
 It means what grows hard, and cannot be repaired.
 The first one means: repeating, or myriad,
 consisting of many parts, increasing in number,
 happening over and over, without end.





Eating Babies
 

1
  
 FAT
 is the soul of this flesh.
 Eat with your hands, slow, you will understand
 breasts, why everyone
 adores them--Rubens' great custard nudes--why
 we can't help sleeping with
 pillows.
  
 The old woman in the park pointed,
 Is it yours?
 Her gold eye-teeth gleamed.
  
 I bend down, taste the fluted
 nipples, the elbows, the pads
 of the feet. Nibble earlobes, dip
 my tongue in the salt fold
 of shoulder and throat.
  
 Even now he is changing,
 as if I were 
 licking him thin.
  
  
 2
  
 HE SQUEEZES his eyes tight
 to hide
 and blink! he's still here.
 It's always a surprise.
  
 Safety-fat,
 angel-fat,
  
 steal it in mouthfuls,
 store it away
 where you save
  
 the face that you touched
 for the last time
 over and over,
 your eyes closed
  
 so it wouldn't go away.
  
  
 3
  
 WATCH HIM sleeping. Touch
 the pulse where
 the bones haven't locked
 in his damp hair:
 the navel of dreams.
 His eyes open for a moment, underwater.
  
 His arms drift in the dark
 as your breath
 washes over him.
  
 Bite one cheek. Again.
 It's your own
 life you lean over, greedy,
 going back for more.





Duck/Rabbit
 

We remember the rabbit when we see                                                 the duck, but we cannot experience                                                 both at the same time                                                   --E.H. Gombrich, Art and Illusion
WHAT do you remember? When I looked at
 his streaky glasses, I wanted
 to leave him. And before that? He stole those
 cherries for me at midnight. We were walking
 in the rain and I loved him.
 And before that? I saw him coming
 toward me that time at the picnic,
 edgy, foreign.
  
 But you loved him? He sat in his room with
 the shades drawn, brooding. But you
 loved him? He gave me
 a photo of himself at sixteen, diving
 from the pier. It was summer. His arms
 outstretched. And before that?
 His mother was combing his soft curls
 with her fingers and crying. Crying.
  
 Is that what he said? He put on the straw hat
 and raced me to the barn. What did he
 tell you? Here's the dried rose, brown
 as tobacco. Here's the letter that I tore
 and pasted. The book of blank pages
 with the velvet cover. But do you still
  
 love him? When I rub the nap
 backwards, the colors lift,
 bristle. What do you mean?
 Sometimes, when I'm all alone,
 I find myself stroking it.





Dinner at George & Katie Schneemans
 

She was pretty swacked by the time she
 Put the spaghetti & meatballs into the orgy pasta
         bowl--There was mixed salt & pepper in the
 "Tittie-tweak pasta bowl--We drank some dago red
         from glazed girlie demi-tasse cups--after
 which we engaged in heterosexual intercourse, mutual
         masturbation, fellatio, & cunnilingus. For
 dessert we stared at a cupboard full of art critic
         friends, sgraffitoed into underglazes on vases. We did
 have a very nice time.
  
  





After Peire Vidal, & Myself
 

for Shelley
Oh you, the sprightliest & most puggish, the brightest star
 Of all my lively loves, all Ladies, & to whom once I gave up
 My heart entire, thenceforth yours to keep forever
 Locked up in your own heart's tiniest room, my best hope, or
 To throw away, carelessly, at your leisure, should that prove
 Your best pleasure, Who is that dumpy matron, decked out in worn & 
         faded
 Shabby army fatigues which pooch out both before & behind, now
         screeching
 Scoring me painfully in philistine Commedia dell'arte farce, low
         summer fare
 Across a pedestrian Ferry's stretch of water in some meshugganah Snug
         Harbor
 And once more, even, fiercely pecking at me in the cold drab Parish
         Hall of
 Manhattan's Landmark Episcopal Church, where a once Avant-garde
         now Grade School
 Poetry Project continues to dwell, St. Mark's Church-in-the-Bouwerie,
         whose
 Stones hold in tight grip one wooden leg & all of Peter Stuyvesant's
         bones?
 Who is that midget-witch who preens & prances as she flaunts her lost
         wares,
 Otherwise hidden beneath some ancient boy's flannel-shirt, its tail out
 & flapping, & who
 Is shrieking even now these mean words:
                                                             "Hey     Ted!     "Hey, you Fat God!
 & called me, "Fickle!         "Fickle!
                                                                  & she points a long boney finger
 at me, & croons, gleefully.
                                                         "Limbo!     "That's where you really live!
 & She is claiming to be you
  
                                                 as she whispers, viciously,
                                                                                                             "Alone, &
 In Pain, In Limbo, is where you live     in your little cloud-9 home     Ted!
 Pitiful!
                She has a small purse, & removing it from one of her
         shopping bags
 She brings out from inside that small purse, my withered heart; &
 lifting it
 high into the air over her head with her two hands, she turns it upside
         down
 unzips its fasteners, & shakes it out over the plywood floor, happily.
         "Empty,
 she cries loudly, "just like I always knew it would be! "Empty!
         "Empty "Empty
  
 I watch her, and think,
                                      That's not really you, up there, is it,
                 Rose?     Rochelle?     Shelley?
                                                                  O, don't be sad, little Rose! It's still
 Your ribbon I wear, your favor tied to the grip of my lance, when I
         ride out to give battle,
                                                   these golden days.





The Origin of Order
 

Stellar dust has settled. 
It is green underwater now in the leaves 
Of the yellow crowfoot. Its vacancies are gathered together 
Under pine litter as emerging flower of the pink arbutus. 
It has gained the power to make itself again 
In the bone-filled egg of osprey and teal. 

One could say this toothpick grasshopper 
Is a cloud of decayed nebula congealed and perching 
On his female mating. The tortoise beetle, 
Leaving the stripped veins of morning glory vines 
Like licked bones, is a straw-colored swirl 
Of clever gases. 

At this moment there are dead stars seeing 
Themselves as marsh and forest in the eyes 
Of muskrat and shrew, disintegrated suns 
Making songs all night long in the throats 
Of crawfish frogs, in the rubbings and gratings 
Of the red-legged locust. There are spirits of orbiting 
Rock in the shells of pointed winkles 
And apple snails, ghosts of extinct comets caught 
In the leap of darting hare and bobcat, revolutions 
Of rushing stone contained in the sound of these words. 

The paths of the Pleiades and Coma clusters 
Have been compelled to mathematics by the mind 
Contemplating the nature of itself 
In the motions of stars. The patterns 
Of any starry summer night might be identical 
To the summer heavens circling inside the skull. 
I can feel time speeding now in all directions 
Deeper and deeper into the black oblivion 
Of the electrons directly behind my eyes. 

Flesh of the sky, child of the sky, the mind 
Has been obligated from the beginning 
To create an ordered universe 
As the only possible proof of its own inheritance.





44th Birthday Evening, at Harriss
 

Nine stories high Second Avenue 
On the roof there's a party 
All the friends are there watching 
By the light of the moon the blazing sun 
Go down over the side of the planet 
To light up the underside of Earth 
There are long bent telescopes for the friends 
To watch this through. The friends are all in shadow. 
I can see them from my bed inside my head.
 44 years I've loved these dreams today. 
17 years since I wrote for the first time a poem 
On my birthday, why did I wait so long? 
                                                                         my land a good land 
its highways go to many good places where 
many good people were found; a home land, whose song comes up 
from the throat of a hummingbird & it ends
 where the sun goes to across the skies of blue. 
I live there with you.





Around the Fire
 

What I'm trying to say is that if an experience is 
proposed to me--I don't have any particular interest 
in it--Any more than anything else. I'm interested in
 anything. Like I could walk out the door right now and go some 
where else. I don't have any center in that sense. If you'll look 
in my palm you'll see that my heart and my head line are 
the same and if you'll look in your palm you'll see that it's 
different. My heart and my head feel exactly the same. Me, 
I like to lay around of a Sunday and drink beer. I don't feel 
a necessity for being a mature person in this world. I mean 
all the grown-ups in the world, they're just playing house, all 
poets know that. How does your head feel? How I feel is 
what I think. I look at you today, & I expect you to look 
the same tomorrow. If you're having a nervous breakdown, I'm
 not going to be looking at you like you're going to die, because 
I don't think you are. If you're a woman you put yourself 
somewhere near the beginning and then there's this other place 
you put yourself in terms of everybody. "The great cosmetic strange-
ness of the normal deep person. Okay. Those were those people--and
 I kept telling myself, I have to be here, because I don't have 
a country. How tight is the string? And what is on this particular 
segment of it? And the photographer, being black, and the writer, 
me, being white, fell out at this point. And he didn't want to 
look at it--I mean it's nothing, just some drunk Indians riding 
Jersey milk cows--but I wanted to see it, I mean it was right 
in front of my eyes and I wanted therefore to look at it. 
And death is not any great thing, it's there or it's not. I mean 
God is the progenitor of religious impetuousity in the human beast. 
And Davy Crockett is right on that--I mean he's gonna shoot a bear, 
but he's not gonna shoot a train, because the train is gonna run 
right over him. You can't shoot the train. And I always thought 
there was another way to do that. And it is necessary to do that 
and we bear witness that it is necessary to do it. The only distinction 
between men and women is five million shits.





So Going Around Cities
 

to Doug & Jan Oliver
"I order you to operate, I was not made to suffer.
 Probing for old wills, and friendships, for to free
 to New York City, to be in History, New York City being
 History at that time. "And I traded my nights
 for Intensity; & I barter my right to Gold; & I'd traded
 my eyes much earlier, when I was circa say seven years old
 for ears to hear Who was speaking, & just exactly who
 was being told. & I'm glad
                   I hear your words so clearly
                   & I would not have done it
                                 differently
                   & I'm amused at such simplicity, even so,
 inside each & every door. And now I'm with you, instantly,
 & I'll see you tomorrow night, and I see you constantly, hopefully
 though one or the other of us is often, to the body-mind's own self
 more or less out of sight! Taking walks down any streets, High
 Street, Main Street, walk past my doors! Newtown; Nymph Rd
             (on the Mesa); Waveland
 Meeting House Lane, in old Southampton; or BelleVue Road
             in England, etcetera
 Other roads; Manhattan; see them there where open or shut up behind
             "I've traded sweet lines for answers 
 They don't serve me anymore. They still serve me on the floor.
             Or,
 as now, as floor. Now we look out the windows, go in &
             out the doors. The Door.
 (That front door which was but & then at that time My door).
             I closed it
 On the wooing of Helen. "And so we left schools for her. For
 She is not one bit fiction; & she is easy to see;
             & she leaves me small room
 For contradiction. And she is not alone; & she is not one bit
             lonely in the large high room, &
 invention is just vanity, which is plain. She
 is the heart's own body, the body's own mind in itself
             self-contained.
 & she talks like you; & she has created truly not single-handedly
 Our tragic thing, America. And though I would be I am not afraid
             of her, & you also not. You, yourself, I,
 Me, myself, me. And no, we certainly have not pulled down
             our vanity: but
 We wear it lightly here,
                                        here where I traded evenly,
                                                                                     & even gladly
 health, for sanity; here
                                     where we live day-by-day
                                                                              on the same spot.
 My English friends, whom I love & miss, we talk to ourselves here,
             & we two
 rarely fail to remember, although we write seldom, & so must seem
             gone forever.
 In the stained sky over this morning the clouds seem about to burst
             What is being remembering
 Is how we are, together. Like you we are always bothered, except
             by the worst; & we are living
             as with you we also were
 fired, only, mostly, by changes in the weather. For Oh dear hearts,
 When precious baby blows her fuse / it's just our way
             of keeping amused.
 That we offer of & as excuse. Here's to you. All the very best.
             What's your pleasure? Cheers.





New Personal Poem
 

to Michael Lally
You had your own reasons for getting
 In your own way. You didn't want to be
 Clear to yourself. You knew a hell
 Of a lot more than you were willing
                  to let yourself know. I felt
 Natural love for you on the spot. R-E-S-P-E-C-T. Right.
 Beautiful. I don't use the word lightly. I
 Protested with whatever love (honesty) (& frontal nudity)
 A yes basically reserved Irish Catholic American Providence Rhode
                  Island New Englander is able to manage. You
 Are sophisticated, not uncomplicated, not
 Nave, and Not simple. An Entertainer, & I am, too.
 Frank O'Hara respected love, so do you, & so do we.
 He was himself & I was me. And when we came together
 Each ourselves in Iowa, all the way
 That was love, & it still is, love, today. Can you see me
 In what I say? Because as well I see you know
 In what you have to say, I did love Frank, as I do
 You, "in the right way.
 That's just talk, not Logos,
                  a getting down to cases:
 I take it as simple particulars that
                  we wear our feelings on our faces.





Something Amazing Just Happened
 

for Jim Carroll, on his birthday
A lovely body gracefully is nodding
 Out of a blue Buffalo
                                     Monday morning
                                                                  curls
 softly rising color the air
                                          it's yellow
 above the black plane
                                     beneath a red tensor
  
 I've been dreaming. The telephone kept ringing & ringing
 Clear & direct, purposeful yet pleasant, still taking pleasure
 in bringing the good news, a young man in horn-rims' voice
                                                                                                    is speaking
 while I listen. Mr. Berrigan, he says, & without waiting for an answer
             goes on,
 I'm happy to be able to inform you that your request for
             a Guggenheim Foundation Grant
 Has been favorably received by the committee, & approved. When
             would you like to leave?
  
 Uh, not just yet, I said, uh, what exactly did I say with regards to
             leaving, in my application  I'm a little hazy at the moment.
  
 Yes. Your project, as outlined in your application for a grant for the
             purpose
 of giving Jim Carroll the best possible birthday present you could get
             him, through our Foundation, actually left the project, that is,
             how the monies
 would be spent, up to us. You indicated, wisely, I think, that we knew
             more about what kind of project we would approve than you did,
             so we should
 make one up for you, since all you wanted was money, to buy Jim a
             birthday gift.
  
 Aha! I said. So, what's up?
  
 We have arranged for you and Jim to spend a year in London, in a
             flat off of King's Row.
 You will receive 250 pounds a month expenses, all travel expenses
             paid, & a clothing allowance of 25 pounds each per month.
             During the year,
 At your leisure, you might send us from time to time copies of your
             London works. By year's end I'm sure you each will have enough
             new poems for two books,
 Which we would then publish in a deluxe boxed hardcover edition,
             for the rights to which we shall be prepared to pay a considerable
             sum, as is your due.
 We feel that this inspired project will most surely result in The first
             major boxed set of works since Tom Sawyer & Huckleberry
             Finn! Innocents Abroad
 in reverse, so to speak! We know your poems, yours & Jim's, will tell it
             like it is, & that is what we are desperate to know! So, when
             would you like to leave?
 Immediately, I shouted! & Jim! I called, Jim! Happy Birthday! Wake up!

Twelve Twelve Twelve
 

a.) When I was twelve, I lived
 on the grounds of a mental asylum.
  
  
 b). My Filipino mother was a psychiatrist,
 so that meant we lived
 in the doctor's quarters--
 one of the three big brick houses
 that edged the institute.
  
  
 c). My younger sister and I practiced Herkies--
 our favorite cheerleading jumps--
 off the patients' bleachers near the softball field.
  
  
 d). When I was twelve, I aced
 the experiments
 with celery and food coloring;
 they let me skip a whole grade
 and get right to The Dissections.
  
  
 e). I secretly wished my supply
 of grape Bubble Yum would never run out
 but I couldn't figure out how to blow bubbles
 and snap the lavender gum like Sara could.
  
  
 f). We sold gift wrap and crystals
 for a junior high fund-raiser and my mom still asks
 Where are all the crystals I bought?
 and
 Why don't you display them in your house?
  
 g). When I was twelve, I worried about
 the darkening hair on my legs.
 My mother bought me my first training bra--
 no cup, just little triangle pieces stitched together--
 and then a slice of New York-style cheesecake
 to bring home.
  
  
 h). Home.
  
  
 i). When I was twelve, our house
 always smelled of fried lumpia
 or ginger.
  
  
 j). We had zinnias
 as wide as my outstretched hand
 nodding at us in our garden.
  
  
 k). My school had to create
 a whole new bus stop
 just for my sister and me,
 and everyone stopped talking and stared
 when we stepped onto the bus each morning,
 smelling of grape gum and ginger roots.
  
  
 l.) Just who are these girls?





Dear Amy Nehzooukammyatootill,
 

(a found poem, composed entirely of e-mails from various high school students)
If I were to ask you a question about your book
 and sum it up into one word it would be, Why?
 I think I like Walt Whitman better than you. I just don't
 get literature, but for a fast hour and a half read, your book
  
 takes the cake. I like how you organized the lines
 in that one poem to represent a growing twisting bonsai tree.
 Are you going to get a rude reaction when you meet
 that one guy in that one poem? I guess you never know.
  
 You are very young to be a poet. I also like how your poems take
 up an entire page (it makes our reading assignment go faster).
 In class we spend so much time dissecting your poems
 and then deeply analyzing them. I think I like Walt Whitman
  
 better than you, but don't take offense--you are very good too!
 You are young, You are young and pure and really just want
 to have a good time. Thank you we have taken a debate
 and you are a far better poet than Walt Whitman. And I loved
  
 how your poems were easy to read and understand. Hello
 my name is Alicia. We read you book and I just loved it.
 We also read Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass. There
 was no competition there. I liked your book a whole lot better.
  
 It was an easy read. But poetry is not my favorite type
 of literature. Sometimes I am offered drinks and guys
 try to talk to me but I too just brush it off and keep dancing.
 Every once and a while the creepy mean guys try to offer you
  
 things and then they say something. What would you do?
 Lastly, I was wondering if you ever wrote a poem that really
 didn't have a deeper meaning but everyone still tried
 to give it one anyways? Walt Whitman is better than you.





Are All the Break-Ups in Your Poems Real?
 

If by real you mean as real as a shark tooth stuck
 in your heel, the wetness of a finished lollipop stick, 
the surprise of a thumbtack in your purse-- 
then Yes, every last page is true, every nuance, 
bit, and bite. Wait. I have made them up--all of them-- 
and when I say I am married, it means I married 
all of them, a whole neighborhood of past loves. 
Can you imagine the number of bouquets, how many 
slices of cake? Even now, my husbands plan a great meal 
for us--one chops up some parsley, one stirs a bubbling pot 
on the stove. One changes the baby, and one sleeps 
in a fat chair. One flips through the newspaper, another 
whistles while he shaves in the shower, and every single 
one of them wonders what time I am coming home.





The Rolling Saint
 

Lotan Baba, a holy man from India, rolled on his side for             four thousand kilometers across the country in his quest for             world peace and eternal salvation.                                                                                                                     --Reuters 
He started small: fasting here and there,
 days, then weeks. Once, he stood under
 a banyan tree for a full seven years, sitting
             for nothing--not even to sleep. It came
             to him in a dream: You must roll
             on this earth, spin your heart in rain,
                         desert, dust. At sunrise he'd stretch, swab
                         any cuts from the day before, and lay prone
                         on the road while his twelve men swept
             the ground in front of him with sisal brooms.
             Even monkeys stopped and stared at this man
             rolling through puddles, past storefronts
 where children would throw him pieces
 of butter candy he'd try and catch
 in his mouth at each rotation. His men
             swept and sang, swept and sang
             of jasmine-throated angels
             and pineapple slices in kulfi cream.
                         He rolled and rolled. Sometimes
                         in his dizzying spins, he thought
                         he heard God. A whisper, but still.





What I Learned From the Incredible Hulk
 

When it comes to clothes, make
 an allowance for the unexpected.
 Be sure the spare in the trunk
 of your station wagon with wood paneling
  
 isn't in need of repair. A simple jean jacket
 says Hey, if you aren't trying to smuggle
 rare Incan coins through this peaceful
 little town and kidnap the local orphan,
  
 I can be one heck of a mellow kinda guy.
 But no matter how angry a man gets, a smile
 and a soft stroke on his bicep can work
 wonders. I learned that male chests
  
 also have nipples, warm and established--
 green doesn't always mean envy.
 It's the meadows full of clover
 and chicory the Hulk seeks for rest, a return
  
 to normal. And sometimes, a woman
 gets to go with him, her tiny hands
 correcting his rumpled hair, the cuts
 in his hand. Green is the space between
  
 water and sun, cover for a quiet man,
 each rib shuttling drops of liquid light.





Red Ghazal
 


 I've noticed after a few sips of tea, the tip of her tongue, thin and red
 with heat, quickens when she describes her cuts and bruises--deep violets and red.
  
 The little girl I baby-sit, hair orange and wild, sits splayed and upside down
 on a couch, insists her giant book of dinosaurs is the only one she'll ever read.
  
 The night before I left him, I could not sleep, my eyes fixed on the freckles
 of his shoulder, the glow of the clock, my chest heavy with dread.
  
 Scientists say they'll force a rabbit to a bird, a jellyfish with a snake, even
 though the pairs clearly do not mix. Some things are not meant to be bred.
  
 I almost forgot the weight of a man sitting beside me in bed sheets crumpled
 around our waists, both of us with magazines, laughing at the thing he just read.
  
 He was so charming--pointed out planets, ghost galaxies, an ellipsis
 of ants on the wall. And when he kissed me goodnight, my neck reddened.
  
 I'm terrible at cards. Friends huddle in for Euchre, Hearts--beg me to play
 with them. When it's obvious I can clearly win with a black card, I select a red.
  
 I throw away my half-finished letters to him in my tiny pink wastebasket, but
 my aim is no good. The floor is scattered with fire hazards, declarations unread.





After the Auction, I Bid You Good-Bye
 

You elbow me with your corduroy jacket
 when a box chock-full of antique marbles comes up.
 I can't hear your whispers above the auctioneer's racket.
  
 The clipped speech of the auctioneer cracked
 me up when you impersonated him in bed. Like a wild, thick mop
 I soak up every copper smell from your corduroy jacket.
  
 In two days, I will drive you to the airport, packed
 with other couples pressed tightly at the top
 of the escalator. Lines sear my cheek from your corduroy jacket
  
 when we hug--then a quick kiss good-bye tacked
 on at the end. I'll finger the rim on the paper coffee cup
 you leave in my car. When I hear your name I can't forget
  
 how your long torso pressed against my bare back,
 bluish in this early light. Your fingers shot into me, popped
 my spine into a wicked arch. There is no lack
  
 of how it haunts me still--what I bid--lost, sacked
 and wrapped for other girls. I should have looked up
 to see who else was bidding, but I studied the folds in your jacket.
 My limit is spent, loud and certain as the auctioneer's racket.





First Anniversary, With Monkeys
 

Periyar Nature Preserve

 There is no crumbly frozen cake to thaw.
 Today, we are in the jungle. I mean mosquito. I mean
  
 tigers and elephants sludging their way
 to the lake for a drink and Don't make sudden moves
  
 or snakes startled from an afternoon nap
 will greet you fang first. I think we are lost. Too hot
  
 for any cold confection to survive. Even my tube
 of sunblock is as warm as a baby's bottle. You get
  
 to those places I can't reach, those places I dared
 not even whisper before I walked down the aisle
  
 in white. You never worried if our families
 would clash, if they would clang like the clutch
  
 of pale monkeys clanging the thin branches of the treetrops,
 begging for our trail mix. You never worried
  
 about my relatives staring at your pale, muscled calves--
 things not usually seen outside of the bedroom. You wore
  
 hiking shorts anyway. And still, they lavished ladle-fuls
 of food on your plate. I think we are lost. My eyes are dark
  
 and wet as that wild deer that walked right past us,
 a little off the trail. I think we are lost, but for once
  
 I don't mind. Eventually you turn us back to a place
 not on any map, but I know I can trace it back with my finger
  
 if we ever need it again. We made it one year
 without a compass and we're not about to start now.





This Is a Fucking Poem
 

don't expect too much.
  
 Well I expect you to go into the
 fucking human tunnel
 I'm going.
  
 pink grimy glossed
 entabulature, welted
 and tattooed. Enfolded in
 ropy ceiling-hangings
 but it isn't a room,
  
 and bumblingly sliding
 out, little legs of 
  
 a little girl, bum on the wall/opening
  
 pink legs sticking out like a
 hermit crab's, she's coming!
  
 shudder out the little-girl
 legs with a little
 girl head mostly eyes, no ears,
 bug brain, aimless
  
 Send her to school
  
 It's cold, and where should she
 go, she will eat her
 legs with her mandibles
  
 her eyes will retract inside.
  
 Stroke her riding hood
 Settle down, little
  
 nobody will hurtcha
  
 by breaking off your little legs,
 six little legs,
 if you come.





Swallowtails
 

The Emperor thought of his heart as a water wheel
 flooding the rice fields of all creation
 and bloodied the water for a better harvest.
 His warriors hoped for a life with wings.
 His swallowtails wrote him the same lines
 --the secret of life is a resurrected worm-- 
 He told them eventually time would run backwards
 in their hands, now empty where a crossbow went.
  
 A theory works if it answers the exceptions.
 The writing in the air of swallowtails,
 from here to where the time changes at Mexico Beach,
 is like writing all the armies of the afterlife
 waiting underground in China.
  
 We are attuned to shadows. They strafe the shore.
 An osprey spins above the trees.
 But when a large one stops suddenly above the house,
 all the laws have been broken.
 A theory that a moment is a warehouse where armies are stacked
 to the ceiling, then one falls, is the last exception.
 The osprey's underside is streaked like a zebra swallowtail.
 It misses the fish that dove out of the reach of shadows
 as the lovers jumped into theirs from the Bay Bridge to Fort Walton.
 If any should meet hovering over a milkweed or reflection,
 they might say didn't I know you in another life,
 the kind of thing said often in Fort Walton or the Orient
 and didn't plum blossoms freeze in the Emperor's courtyard.





The Appeal of Antiques
 

The intriguing comfort of an imagined past
 is entered through objects
 the same way we continue the present
 but without nostalgia
 Parents so long for happiness they say
 one life is not enough
 and live through their children
 But children also live backwards through past candles
 crank telephones   carriages
 the ascendant animals that lived not in imagination
 but in Kansas and before
 there was an Oklahoma with its spotted sun
  
 In those days a metaphor for Hell was the corn sheller
 field corn shriven  shooting out cobs
 the grindstone   razor strop   even the ladder of progress
 from which Les Westfield slipped
 on a mossy rung though his son held the ladder
 and fell two stories:
 one the feudal structure of the family   two the harmonic
 of almost fatal necessity
 as the maple stump entered his hip along with the difficult
 remission of breath itself
 an antique whose furious elaborations mimicked the rose





No More
 

No more lines on the luminescence of light, of whatever variation.
No more elegies of youth or age, no polyglottal ventriloquism.
No more songs of raw emotion, forever overcooked.
No more the wisdom of banality, which should stay overlooked.
No more verbs of embroidery.
No more unintentional phallacy.
No more metaphor, no more simile. Let the thing be, concretely.
No more politics put politically: let the thing be concretely.
No more conditional set conditionally--let the thing be already.
No more children pimped out to prove some pouting mortality.
No more death without dying--immediately.
No more poet-subject speaking into the poem-mirror, watching the mouth move, fixing the thinning hair.
No more superiority of the interiority of that unnatural trinity--you, me, we--our teeth touch only our tongues. 
No more Gobstoppers: an epic isn't an epic for its fingerprints.
No more reversals of grammar if as emphasis.
No more nature less natural; no more impiety on bended knee.
No more jeu de mot, no more mot juste. 
No more retinal poetry.





The Sacred Circle
 

Numanah, Grandfather, grant me the grace
 of a new song far from this lament
 of lame words and fossils of a losing game.
 No more flat pebbles skimmed between the wetness
 of tongue and thigh and eye again!
 I never asked to be the son of a stained mattress
 who contemplated venison stew and knew
 the shame hidden in grease clouds stuck to the wall
 behind the woodstove where Grandmother cooked.
 I only wanted to run far, so far from Indian land.
 And, God damn it, when I was old enough I did.
 I loitered in some great halls of ivy
 and allowed the inquisition of education:
 electric cattle prods placed lovingly
 to the lobes of my earth memories.
 I carried the false spirit force of sadness
 wrapped in a brown sack in the pocket
 of a worn, tweed coat.
 In junkie alleyways I whispered of forgotten arrows
 in the narrow passages of my own discarded history.
 Then, when I was old enough
 I ran back to Indian land.
 Now I'm thinking of running from here.
  
                                                 Pine Ridge, South Dakota
                                                 February 1988





I Flew into Denver April
 

I flew into Denver April.
 Rock salt and sand peppered the asphalt
 reflecting myself on a downtown street
 where I'd paused on my route to smell lilacs.
 The wanton winds chortled wickedly
 over remnant snows in gray clumps of doom
 and my heart soared gladly at winter's death
 but an hour later I had whiskey breath
 at a dead end bar full of Indians.
 A Winnebago woman waltzed with me
 and told me how handsome I truly was
 so I bought her drinks and felt her hips
 and somewhere between the grinds
 and dips she lifted my wallet and split.





Marias Return
 

          The whit'ning ground
           In frost is bound;
    The snow is swiftly falling;
 While coldly blows the northern breeze,
 And whistles through the leafless trees,
    In hollow sounds appalling.
  
           On this cold plain,
           Now reach'd with pain,
    Once stood my father's dwelling:
 Where smiling pleasure once was found,
 Now desolation frowns around,
    And wintry blasts are yelling.
  
           Hope's visions wild
           My thoughts beguil'd,
    My earliest days delighting,
 Till unsuspected treach'ry came,
 Beneath affection's specious name,
    The lovely prospect blighting.
  
           With many a wile
           Of blackest guile
    Did Henry first deceive me:
 What winning words to him were giv'n!
 He swore, by all the pow'rs of Heav'n,
    That he would never leave me.
  
           With fondest truth
           I lov'd the youth:
    My soul, to guilt a stranger,
 Knew not, in those too simple hours,
 That oft beneath the sweetest flow'rs
    Is couch'd the deadliest danger.
  
           With him to roam
           I fled my home;
    I burst the bonds of duty;
 I thought my days in joy would roll;
 But Henry hid a demon's soul
    Beneath an angel's beauty!
  
           Shall this poor heart
           E'er cease to smart?
    Oh never! never! never!
 Did av'rice whisper thee, or pride,
 False Henry! for a wealthier bride
    To cast me off for ever?
  
           My sire was poor:
           No golden store
    Had he, no earthly treasure:
 I only could his griefs assuage,
 The only pillar of his age,
    His only source of pleasure.
  
           With anguish wild,
           He miss'd his child,
    And long in vain he sought her:
 The fiercest thunder-bolts of heav'n
 Shall on thy guilty head be driv'n,
    Thou Disobedient Daughter!
  
           I feel his fears,
           I see his tears,
    I hear his groans of sadness:
 My cruel falsehood seal'd his doom:
 He seems to curse me from the tomb,
    And fire my brain to madness!
  
           Oh! keenly blow,
           While drifts the snow,
    The cold nocturnal breezes;
 On me the gath'ring snow-flakes rest,
 And colder grows my friendless breast;
    My very heart-blood freezes!
  
           Tis midnight deep,
           And thousands sleep,
    Unknown to guilt and sorrow;
 They think not of a wretch like me,
 Who cannot, dare not, hope to see
    The rising light to-morrow!
  
           An outcast hurl'd
           From all the world,
    Whom none would love or cherish,
 What now remains to end my woes,
 But here, amid the deep'ning snows,
    To lay me down and perish?
  
           Death's icy dart
           Invades my heart:
    Just Heav'n! all-good! all-seeing!
 Thy matchless mercy I implore,
 When I must wake, to sleep no more,
    In realms of endless being!





The Rain-bow
 

The day has pass'd in storms, though not unmix'd
 With transitory calm.   The western clouds,
 Dissolving slow, unveil the glorious sun,
 Majestic in decline.   The wat'ry east
 Glows with the many-tinted arch of Heav'n.
 We hail it as a pledge that brighter skies
 Shall bless the coming morn.   Thus rolls the day,
 The short dark day of life;   with tempests thus,
 And fleeting sun-shine chequer'd.   At its close,
 When the dread hour draws near, that bursts all ties,
 All commerce with the world, Religion pours
 Hope's fairy-colors on the virtuous mind,
 And, like the rain-bow on the ev'ning clouds,
 Gives the bright promise that a happier dawn
 Shall chase the night and silence of the grave.





Farewell to Matilda
 

              Oui, pour jamais              Chassons l'image              De la volage              Que j'adorais.              PARNY.
Matilda, farewell! Fate has doom'd us to part,
 But the prospect occasions no pang to my heart;
 No longer is love with my reason at strife,
 Though once thou wert dearer, far dearer than life.
  
 As together we roam'd, I the passion confess'd,
 Which thy beauty and virtue had rais'd in my breast;
 That the passion was mutual thou mad'st me believe,
 And I thought my Matilda could never deceive.
  
 My Matilda! no, false one! my claims I resign:
 Thou canst not, thou must not, thou shalt not be mine:
 I now scorn thee as much as I lov'd thee before,
 Nor sigh when I think I shall meet thee no more.
  
 Though fair be thy form, thou no lovers wilt find,
 While folly and falsehood inhabit thy mind,
 Though coxcombs may flatter, though ideots may prize,
 Thou art shunn'd by the good, and contemn'd by the wise.
  
 Than mine what affection more fervent could be,
 When I thought ev'ry virtue was center'd in thee?
 Of the vows thou hast broken I will not complain,
 For I mourn not the loss of a heart I disdain.
  
 Oh! hadst thou but constant and amiable prov'd
 As that fancied perfection I formerly lov'd,
 Nor absence, nor time, though supreme their controul,
 Could have dimm'd the dear image then stamp'd on my soul.
  
 How bright were the pictures, untinted with shade,
 By Hope's glowing pencil on Fancy pourtray'd!
 Sweet visions of bliss! which I could not retain;
 For they, like thyself, were deceitful and vain.
  
 Some other, perhaps, to Matilda is dear,
 Some other, more pleasing, though not more sincere;
 May he fix thy light passions, now wav'ring as air,
 Then leave thee, inconstant, to shame and despair!
  
 Repent not, Matilda, return not to me:
 Unavailing thy grief, thy repentance will be:
 In vain will thy vows or thy smiles be resum'd,
 For love, once extinguish'd, is never relum'd.





To a Young Lady, Netting
 

While those bewitching hands combine,
 With matchless grace, the silken line,
 They also weave, with gentle art,
 Those stronger nets that bind the heart.
  
 But soon all earthly things decay:
 That net in time must wear away:
 E'en Beauty's silken meshes gay
         No lasting hold can take:
  
 But Beauty, Virtue, Sense, combin'd,
 (And all these charms in thee are join'd)
 Can throw that net upon the mind,
 No human art can e'er unbind,
         No human pow'r can break.





from from Sir Proteus
 

 
 I.
  
 Ille Ego
  
 Oh! list to me: for I'm about
    To catch the fire of Chaucer,
 And spin in doleful measure out
    The tale of Johnny Raw, sir;
  
 Who, bent upon a desperate plan
    To make the people stare,
 Set off full speed for Hindoostan
    Upon Old Poulter's mare.
  
 Tramp! tramp! across the land he went;
    Splash! splash! across the sea;
 And then he gave his bragging vent--
    "Pray who can ride like me?
  
 "For I'm the man, who sallied forth
    To rout the classic forces,
 And swore this mare was far more worth
    Than both fierce Hector's horses.
  
 "Old Homer from his throne I struck,
    To Virgil gave a punch,
 And in the place of both I stuck
    The doughty Mother Bunch,
  
 "To France I galloped on my roan,
    Whose mettle nought can quail;
 There squatted on the tomb of Joan,
    And piped a dismal tale.
  
 "A wild and wondrous stave I sung,
    To make my hearers weep:
 But when I looked, and held my tongue,
    I found them fast asleep!
  
 "Oh! then, a furious oath I swore,
    Some dire revenge to seek;
 And conjured up, to make them roar,
    Stout Taffy and his leek.
  
 "To Heaven and Hell I rode away,
    In spite of wind and weather:
 Trumped up a diabolic lay;
    And cursed them all together.
  
 "Now, Proteus! rise, thou changeful seer!
    To spirit up my mare:
 In every shape but those appear,
    Which Taste and Nature wear.





Sonnys Purple Heart
 

But it's too late to say you're sorry. -- The Zombies
                                   I
  
 Man, if you're dead, why are you leading
 me to drink after five sober years?
 Sonny, can I get a witness?
 I had a Snow White vision of the prodigal
 son returning to America
 that day of my final hangover.
 I tried to clear the mixture
 of cobwebs and shooting stars
 from my brain with spit-warm
 Budweiser, but the hair of the dog
 just was not doing the trick.
 I ended up pummeling myself
 seven times that day and named each egg
 white load for a Disney dwarf.
 The first was Dopey.
 The final was Sleepy, I think, or Droopy.
  
                                   II
  
 Last year you scrawled a letter to me
 about your first and final visit
 to the Vietnam Memorial and how your eyes
 reflected off the shiny black stone
 and shot back into your brain like guidons
 unfurling the stench of cordite and the boy screams
 of men whose souls evaporated
 into morning mists over blue-green jungles.
 You had to be there, you said.
 That's where you caught the cancer, you said.
  
                                   III
  
 Sonny. Tonight I had a dream of Mom's death
 twenty years too late and now my eyes
 will not close like I imagine the lid
 on her cheap casket did.
 I was not there when she died.
 Home on leave from Basic Training,
 you stood in for me
 because I was running scared
 through the drugged-out alleys of America,
 hiding from those Asian shadows
 that would finally ace you and now, now
 in the dark victory of your Agent Orange cancer,
 it gives me not one ounce of ease
 to say fuck Nixon and Kissinger,
 fuck all the generals and all
 the armies of God and fuck me,
 twenty years
 too late.
  
                                   IV
  
 History is history and thank God for that.
 When we were wise-ass American boys
 in our fifth grade geography class,
 we tittered over the prurient-sounding
 waves of Lake Titticaca  Titti  ca-ca
 and we never even had the slightest
 clue that Che was camping out
 en las montaas de Bolivia  
 We never knew American chemists would
 kill you slicker than slant-eyed bullets.
  
                                   V
  
 Damn Sonny. Five sober years done squeaked
 by like a silent fart and I'm on autopilot,
 sitting in a bar hoisting suds with ghosts,
 yours and my slowly evolving own.
 When we were seventeen with fake I.D.'s,
 we got into the Bucket of Blood
 in Virginia City and slurped sloe gin fizzes
 while the innocent jukebox blared
 "She's Not There by the Zombies.
 Later that drunken night you puked purple
 splotches onto my new, white Levis
 and a short, few years into your future
 this lost nation would award
 you two purple hearts,
 one of which your mother pressed
 into my hand that bright day
 we filed you under
 dry desert dirt.





This Is the Time of Grasshoppers and All That I See Is Dying
 

Colleen,
 this is the time of grasshoppers
 and all that I see is dying except
 for my virulent love for you.
  
 The Cowturdville Star-Times,
 which usually has a typo
 in every damn column,
 says the grasshoppers this year
 "are as big as Buicks and
 that's not bad, but then we
 get two eight-point pages
 of who had dinner with whom
 at the bowling alley caf and
 who went shopping at Target
 in Rapid City and thus the high
 church of Adrian the Obscure is sacked.
  
 Even my old Dylan tapes are fading,
 becoming near-comic antiques.
 The grasshoppers are destroying
 our yard and they're as big as
 my middle finger saluting God.
 The grass is yellow. The trees
 look like Agent Orange has hit
 but it's only the jaw-work of those
 drab armored insects who dance
 in profusion and pure destruction.
  
 Sweet woman, dear love of my life,
 when you're not angry and sputtering
 at everything and everyone, you
 become so childlike, so pure.
 Your voice seems to have grown
 higher recently, almost a little-girl pitch.
  
 Today, like most days, I have you
 home for your two-hour reprieve
 from the nursing home prison.
 We're sitting at the picnic table in
 the backyard staring at the defoliation
 of lilacs, brain matter, and honeysuckle.
 You're eating a Hershey Bar and
 a crystal glob of snot is hanging
 from your nose.
 I reach over, pinch it off,
 and wipe it on my jeans.
 You thrust the last bite
 of chocolate into my mouth
 as a demented grasshopper
 jumps onto your ear.
 You scream. I howl
 with laughter until you do too.
 Happiness comes with a price.
  
 This is the times of grasshoppers
 and all that I see is dying except
 for my swarming love for you.
  
 Last night on PBS some
 lesioned guy being screwed to death
 by legions of viral invisibility
 blurted the great clich of regret:
 I wish I could be twenty
 again and know what
 I know now  
  
 My own regrets are equally foolish.
 And, I wonder, how the hell
 is it I've reached a place
 where I'd give what's left
 of my allotment of sunsets
 and frozen dinners
 for some unholy replay
 of just one hour in some nearly
 forgotten time and place?
  
 Darling,
 in the baked soil of the far west,
 I first saw the ant lions, those
 hairy little bugs who dug funnel
 traps for ants in the dry earth.
 At twelve, looking over the edge
 of one such funnel surrounded by
 a circle of tiny stones in the sand,
 I aimed a beam of white light
 from my magnifying glass
 and found I could re-create
 a hell of my own accord.
  
 Poverty and boredom
 made me cruel early on.
 The next summer while digging
 postholes I found a cache of
 those grotesque yellow bugs
 we called Children of the Earth
 so I piled matches atop them
 and barbecued their ugliness.
 I was at war with insects.
  
 In my fifteenth summer I got
 covered with ticks in the sagebrush
 and that fall I nervously lost my cherry
 in a cathouse called the Green Front
 and got cursed with crabs but that's
 not what I want to sing about
 at all come on now.
 This is no bug progression.
 This ain't no insect sonata.
  
 This is only misdirection,
 a sleight of hand upon the keys
 and the unholy replay of just
 one hour in some nearly
 forgotten time and place
 that I'd like to return to
 will remain myth or maybe
 a holy, tumescent mystery.
  
 And let's not call
 these bloodwords
 POETRY or a winter count
 of desperate dreams
 when reality is much simpler.
  
 Colleen,
 I swear to Christ
 this is the time of grasshoppers
 and all that I see is dying except
 for my sparkling love for you.





This Is Just To Say
 

I have eaten
the plums
that were in
the icebox

and which
you were probably
saving
for breakfast

Forgive me
they were delicious
so sweet
and so cold





For Jane
 

I know that rarity precedes extinction,
Like that of the purple orchid in my garden,
Whose sudden disappearance rattled me.

Jane, in her way, is also beautiful.
And therefore near extinction, I suppose.
She is certainly rare and fragile of bone.

She insists she is dying, day by dubious day,
And spends her evenings looking at photographs
Of her mother, who never believed in love.

Rare Jane, I worship you. But I can't deny
You access to the endless
With its river of cold stars.





Revolutionaries, 1929
 


Revolutionaries [Alois Lindner, Erich Muhsam, Guido Kopp], 1929 by August Sander

 Twelve years on, the beard that Lenin wore
Still sharpens revolutionary chins
To dagger-points held ready for the war
In which the outgunned proletarians
Will triumph thanks to these, their generals,
Whose rounded shoulders and round glasses say
That sedentary intellectuals
Raised in the bosom of the bourgeoisie
Can also learn to work--if not with hands,
Then with the liberated consciousness
That shrinks from nothing since it understands
What's coming has to come. The monuments
To which the future genuflects will bear
These faces, so intelligently stern,
Under whose revolutionary stare
Everything that is burnable must burn.





The Butchers Apprentice, 19111914
 


The Butcher's Apprentice, 19111914 by August Sander

 The high white collar and the bowler hat,
The black coat of respectability,
The starched cuff and the brandished cigarette
Are what he has decided we will see,
Though in the closet hangs an apron flecked
With bits of brain beside the rubber boots
Stained brown from wading through the bloody slick
That by the end of every workday coats
The killing floor he stands on. He declines
To illustrate as in a children's book
The work he does, although it will define
Him every time the photograph he took
Is shown and captioned for posterity--
Even as his proud eyes and carriage say
That what he is is not what he would be,
In a just world where no one had to slay.





Professional Middle-class Couple, 1922
 


Professional Middle-class Couple, 1922 by August Sander

 What justifies the inequality
That issues her a tastefully square-cut
Ruby for her finger, him a suit
Whose rumpled, unemphatic dignity
Declares a life of working sitting down,
While someone in a sweatshop has to squint
And palsy sewing, and a continent
Sheds blood to pry the gemstone from the ground,
Could not be justice. Nothing but the use
To which they put prosperity can speak
In their defense: the faces money makes,
They demonstrate, don't have to be obtuse,
Entitled, vapid, arrogantly strong;
Only among the burghers do you find
A glance so frank, engaging, and refined,
So tentative, so conscious of its wrong.





Big Country
 

Fiddle no further, Fhrer. Rome is built.
It took all day. Now let us so
love the world. I'm just thinking out loud.
My stigmata bring out my eyes.

The smallpox uses every part of the blanket,
and the forest is a lady's purse.
The Indian is a pink Chihuahua peeking 
his head from the designer zipper.

Out here it's mostly light from the fifteenth
century slamming into the planet.
I can't see the forest for the burn unit.
All the planet does is bitch bitch bitch.

I know it's last minute but could you put
out my eyes? At the subatomic level, 
helmeted gods help themselves to gold.
Up here? The body's an isolation ward.





Thats Incredible!
 

I will pull an airplane with my teeth
and I will pull an airplane with my hair.
I write about cats. Cats, when you read this, 
write about me. Be the change you want to see.

I've legally changed my name to Whites Only.
Changed it back, I should say.
DO NOT  TRY THIS AT HOME made me 
the man I am today.

That, and the University of Phoenix.
Old man, take a look at my life.
Charles Simic, in the gloaming, with a roach,
take a look at my life. I'm a lot like you.

A man stands up and says I will catch
a bullet in my teeth! That's incredible!
He eats a sword, hilt first, and spits 
up a million people persons.

A dolphin pulls an airplane with its blowhole
and keeps the black box for itself.
Bottleneck dolphins don't even have bones, 
yet here we are, giving them medals...

This is my ass. And that is a hole
in ground zero. I know which is which.
It's the one with the smoke pouring out.
This is my handle; this is my spout.





Be Myself
 

I took back the night. Wrested it
from the Chinese, many of whom
were shorter than me. 
Two billion outstretched Chinese
hands, give or take a few
thousand amputees.

A cheap knockoff, the night
proved to be--Nokla
not Nokia on the touchscreen.
Well, even Old Peng gotta eat,
Confucius say. Or maybe that
was Cassius Clay. 

In me, folks, a movable object
meets a resistible force. I haven't 
worked a day since the accident
of birth. Born of woman,
my father the same. Make love
then war. I'll bring round the car.

These children that I spit on
are immune to my consultations.
I'll have none myself. It isn't 
(Write it!) a fiasco. I am small, 
I contain platitudes.





The Second Sex
 

After the first sex, there is no other.
I stick my gender in a blender
and click send. Voil! 
Your new ex-girlfriend.

You cuckold me with your husband.
I move a box with Ludacris.
The captain turns on, we begin our descent.
Be gentle with me, I'm new to this.

I say the wrong thing. I have OCD.
My obsessive compulsions are disorderly.
I say the wrong thing, did I already say?
I drive my dominatrix away.

The coyote drives her in a false-bottomed van.
He drops her in the desert. The bluffs are tan.
She'll get a job at Chili's picking up butts.
I feel ya, Ophelia, I say to my nuts.
And there is pansies. That's for thoughts.





Currying the Fallow-Colored Horse
 

And to the curious I say, Don't be nave.

The soul, like a trinket, is a she.

I lay down in the tweed of one man that first frost night.

I did not like the wool of him.

You have one mitochondrial speck of evidence on your cleat.

They can take you down for that.

Did I forget to mention that when you're dead

You're dead a long time.

My uncle, dying, told me this when asked, 

Why stay here for such suffering.

A chimney swift flits through the fumatorium. 

I long for one last Blue democracy, 

Which has broke my heart a while.

How many minutes have I left, the lover asked, 

To still be beautiful?

I took his blond face in my hands and kissed him blondly

                                                                                      On his mouth.





Gouldian Kit
 

What makes you think I'm an eccentric, he said, in London
To the rag of the reporters who had gathered to report 

On his eccentricities--the tin sink light enough for traveling, but 
Deep enough to swallow his exquisite hands in water filled with ice.

A budgerigar accompanies, perched atop the fugue of Hindemith. 
                                
                                 You are trembling now like the librarian reading 
                                 To herself out loud in her Arctic room

Composed entirely of snow.

A broadcast (high fidelity) bound by the quiet of the land and
The Mennonite who told him

                                We are in this world, but are not of this world,

You see. From the notebook of your partial list of symptoms, phobias:

Fever, paranoia, polio (subclinical), ankle-foot phenomenon, 
The possibility of bluish spots. Everything one does is fear

Not being of this world or in this world enough.

                                There is no world I know, without some word of it.





Pluralisms
 

to challenge sleep to go against
the one-eyed god 
of victimhood:
Polyphemus by way of Redon 

rising, open eye ripe 
with stupid gazing.
How dare you look at me? 
plural tense: now and then, to bed and back again and

one more war.
The oral rinse of moral sense can lift the fence
of expectation, expand the dome

of tolerance. I, too, arose from
the unthinkable, used to Nobody
responding loud as circumstance.





A Fable
 

Purveyor of rot and whatnot, 
entrepreneur of I forgot, 
with wrists hard as hammers--
that birthmark a slot--

grip it, strip it, flip it hard--
ramp my shard.
If fear be sexy, a synch 
& a match--

Gone the way of wax & worms--
gone like November 2011--
sweet by nature, mean by culture--

"Goodbye, luck, you idiot, 
said the Fox to the Grapes. 
"I love you, replied the Grapes.





The Dead House
 

Fireplace blocked,
sealed with
cardboard, and taped.
Furniture trashed,
paneling smashed.
On the second floor

mid-corridor, 
a rotting cat
furry and fey
in a nap 
of gore 
glued flat

to a spot
on the floor, 
ether-sweet 
in a frieze of decay,
up-staring, popeyed,
pissed.

The screens I installed
belled out, belled in.
Every window
cracked, broken,
or forgotten, left open. 
The in-gusting Atlantic 

left smelling sick. 
A shade softly crashed
on a sash,
 finish nails and a bare
 molly bolt fanfared
me from the gloom.

Google the address:
from outer space 
it's a bare green blot, 
treeless, erased,
terns where we made love,
gulls where we fought.





Once, I
 

Once, I
was seven Spanish bullocks in a high meadow,
sleepy and nameless. 

As-ifness strange to myself, but complete.

Light on the neck-nape
of time
as two wings of one starling, 

or lovers so happy 
neither needs think of the other.





A Chair in Snow
 

A chair in snow 
should be
like any other object whited
& rounded

and yet a chair in snow is always sad

more than a bed 
more than a hat or house
a chair is shaped for just one thing 

to hold 
a soul its quick and few bendable 
hours

perhaps a king 

not to hold snow 
not to hold flowers





An hour is not a house
 

An hour is not a house,
a life is not a house,
you do not go through them as if 
they were doors to another.

Yet an hour can have shape and proportion, 
four walls, a ceiling.
An hour can be dropped like a glass.

Some want quiet as others want bread.
Some want sleep.

My eyes went 
to the window, as a cat or dog left alone does.





I sat in the sun
 

I moved my chair into sun
I sat in the sun
the way hunger is moved when called fasting.





A Woman Without A Country
 

As dawn breaks he enters
A room with the odor of acid.
He lays the copper plate on the table.
And reaches for the shaft of the burin.
Dublin wakes to horses and rain.
Street hawkers call.
All the news is famine and famine.
The flat graver, the round graver,
The angle tint tool wait for him.
He bends to his work and begins.
He starts with the head, cutting in
To the line of the cheek, finding
The slope of the skull, incising
The shape of a face that becomes
A foundry of shadows, rendering--
With a deeper cut into copper--
The whole woman as a skeleton,
The rags of her skirt, her wrist
In a bony line forever
                                        severing
Her body from its native air until
She is ready for the page, 
For the street vendor, for
A new inventory which now
To loss and to laissez-faire adds
The odor of acid and the little,
Pitiless tragedy of being imagined.
He puts his tools away, 
One by one; lays them out carefully 
On the deal table, his work done.





Cityscape
 

I have a word for it--
the way the surface waited all day
to be a silvery pause between sky and city--
which is elver.

And another one for how
the bay shelved cirrus clouds
piled up at the edge of the Irish Sea, 
which is elver too.

The old Blackrock baths 
have been neglected now for fifty years,
fine cracks in the tiles 
visible as they never were when

I can I can I can
shouted Harry Vernon as 
he dived from the highest board 
curving down into salt and urine

his cry fading out 
through the half century it took 
to hear as a child that a glass eel
had been seen 

entering the seawater baths at twilight--
also known as elver--
and immediately
the word begins

a delicate migration--
a fine crazing healing in the tiles--
the sky deepening above a city 
that has always been

unsettled between sluice gates and the Irish Sea 
to which there now comes at dusk
a translucent visitor
yearning for the estuary.





Proprietary
 

In a precisely lighted room, the CFO speaks
of start-to-start dependencies.
Says let me loop back with you.

Says please cascade as appropriate.
It's that time of morning, so we all can smell
the doughnut factory. If scent were white

noise, doughnuts would be that scent.
The factory won't sell at any price.
The building next to it burns the animals

we experiment on. I have worked
on a few preclinical reports in my time. 
The rhesus monkeys become

so desperate that they attempt suicide,
over and over again. I am legally obligated
to spare you the particulars.

How could things be any different?
Here many choice molecules have been born.
Here. This pill will dissolve like sugar.

Your last five months will be good ones.





Nothing
 

My mother is scared of the world.
She left my father after forty years.
She was like, Happy anniversary, goodbye;

I respect that.
The moon tonight is dazzling, is full
of itself but not quite full.

A man should not love the moon, said Milosz.
Not exactly. He translated himself
into saying it. A man should not love translation;

there's so much I can't know. An hour ago,
marking time with someone I would like to like,
we passed some trees and there were crickets

(crickets!) chirping right off Divisadero.
I touched his hand, and for a cold moment
I was like a child again,

nothing more, nothing less.





Order
 

For once, he was just my father.
We drove to the Computing Center
in a Monte Carlo Landau
not technically ours. Lexington,

1977. That fall. The color
had settled, too, undone
orange-brown and dull yellow,
crimson. And it was something,

yet not, the pile of leaves
just a pile of leaves. Sorry to think
what thinking has done to landscape:
He loved punched cards,

program decks and subroutines,
assembly languages
and keypunch machines.
Even my father looked small

next to a mainframe.
The sound of order;
the space between us.
We almost laughed, but not for years--

we almost laughed. But not. For years,
the space between us,
the sound of order
next to a mainframe.

Even my father looked small.

Everyday Escapees
 

My poor students, all I ask of them
is to grow antennae, lie down with lava
and rise with snow, grow tongues from
their math assignments and no, Melissa,

your mother won't approve of the bioluminescent
smear on your communion dress. The world fidgets
in uneasy relationship to our statements
about it nevertheless producing silver

buds from ragged limbs like the luster
in late Frank Sinatra songs. Finally,
when I got off the sixth floor, I felt
like I was walking out into the sky

and aren't we all pedestrians of air?
Doesn't it feel all wrong to turn our backs
on the ocean? On an ant? On those Chagall
windows you have to go through a gauntlet

of ancient armor to get to? What was her name,
that night nurse so deft her blood draws
didn't wake me up? Don't get me wrong, I want
to wake up. I want my old dog to show me

all that wolf-light she hides inside
even though she thinks I won't understand,
even though her vet and I conspire
to keep her alive forever.





Emerald Spider Between Rose Thorns
 

Imagine, not even or really ever tasting
a peach until well over 50, not once
sympathizing with Blake naked in his garden
insisting on angels until getting off the table
and coming home with my new heart. How absurd
to still have a body in this rainbow-gored,
crickety world and how ridiculous to be given one
in the first place, to be an object
like an orchid is an object, or a stone,
so bruisable and plummeting, arms
waving from the evening-ignited lake,
heading singing in the furnace feral and sweet,
tears that make the face grotesque,
tears that make it pure. How easy
it is now to get drunk on a single whiff 
like a hummingbird or ant, on the laughter
of one woman and who knew how much I'd miss
that inner light of snow now that I'm in Texas.





Muscadine
 

peach of a grape

                           in his fingertips

                                                        like holding home

            he noses its musk

Taste, he says

                         and parts my lips with a globe and 

                                                                                   a thumb I lick

                                                        I bite the thick skin

                           His Arkansas aches

                                                                      sweet

                           His hand vines my chin my throat

My face flames

                                To the lady on the bus

Better to marry than to burn

Mama Said ...
 

                             (there'll be days like this.)
                                                --The Shirelles
These folks 'bout to respect me into the grave.

At eighty Mama said, (mama said)
           "People think you change when you're old
             but you still got a girl inside. 

And men could see her, too 
         --that pink silk dress--
soothe that hotel bellboy
         "Boy, I'm old enough 
          to be your mama.
He coy 
          "well, you ain't.

But seventy is prime time 
for me to own what "elder brings.

I reap myself with the respect they sow.

They don't know I got the road 
wide open in me.





Hum for the Bolt
 

It could of course be silk. Fifty yards or so
of the next closest thing to water to the touch,
or it could just as easily be a shaft of wood 

crumpling a man struck between spaulder and helm. 
But now, with the rain making a noisy erasure 
of this town, it is the flash that arrives 

and leaves at nearly the same moment. It's what I want 
to be in this moment, in this doorway, 
because much as I'd love to be the silk-shimmer 

against the curve of anyone's arm, 
as brutal and impeccable as it'd be to soar 
from a crossbow with a whistle and have a man 

switch off upon my arrival, it is nothing 
compared to that moment when I eat the dark,
draw shadows in quick strokes across wall

and start a tongue counting 
down to thunder. That counting that says, 
I am this far. I am this close.





The Sandhills
 


The language of cranes
we once were told
is the wind. The wind 
is their method,
their current, the translated story 
of life they write across the sky. 
Millions of years
they have blown here
on ancestral longing,
their wings of wide arrival, 
necks long, legs stretched out 
above strands of earth
where they arrive
with the shine of water, 
stories, interminable
language of exchanges 
descended from the sky
and then they stand,
earth made only of crane 
from bank to bank of the river 
as far as you can see
the ancient story made new.





The Vacation
 

Once there was a man who filmed his vacation. 
He went flying down the river in his boat
with his video camera to his eye, making
a moving picture of the moving river
upon which his sleek boat moved swiftly 
toward the end of his vacation. He showed
his vacation to his camera, which pictured it, 
preserving it forever: the river, the trees,
the sky, the light, the bow of his rushing boat 
behind which he stood with his camera 
preserving his vacation even as he was having it 
so that after he had had it he would still
have it. It would be there. With a flick
of a switch, there it would be. But he
would not be in it. He would never be in it.





Ararat
 

Wrapped in gold foil, in the search
 and shouting of Easter Sunday,
 it was the ball of the princess,
 it was Pharoah's body
 sleeping in its golden case.
 At the foot of the picket fence,
 in grass lank with the morning rain,
 it was a Sunday school prize,
 silver for second place, gold
 for the triumphant little dome
 of Ararat, and my sister
 took me by the hand and led me
 out onto the wide, wet lawn
 and showed me to bend into the thick nests
 of grass, into the darkest green.
 Later I had to give it back,
 in exchange for a prize,
 though I would rather have kept the egg.
 What might have coiled inside it?
 Crocuses tight on their clock-springs,
 a bird who'd sing himself into an angel
 in the highest reaches of the garden,
 the morning's flaming arrow?
 Any small thing can save you.
 Because the golden egg gleamed
 in my basket once, though my childhood
 became an immense sheet of darkening water
 I was Noah, and I was his ark,
 and there were two of every animal inside me.

 Yeats saw the betterment of the workers
 by religion--slow in any case
 as the drying of the moon
 He was not understood--
 I rang the bell
  
 for him to sit down
 Yeats left the lecture circuit
 yet he could say: no one
 so well loved
 as Morris

Fooled Me for Years with the Wrong Pronouns
 

You made me cry in cruel stations,
So I missed many trains. You married others 
In plausible buildings. The subsequent son
Became my boss. You promised me nothing
But blamed me for doubting when who wouldn't.
If I knew how to please you--who have found 
Out my faults. In dreams I'm wild with guilt. Have pity
Kill it. Then, when I've lost all hope,
Kiss me again, your mouth so open--
I'd give anything for one more night--
That I go without thought. Don't bite. No,
Mark me. My husband already knows
Exactly what owns me.





Reading Primo Levi Off Columbus Circle
 

Re-reading him in Bouchon
past noon, it is mobbed midtown,
like an ant farm seen through painkillers.
God, what a bust it's all been,

capitalism, communism, feminism,
this lust to liberate.
Che should have stayed in medicine. 
The girls here admit they can't wait 

to marry and get to the alimony,
before they hit thirty. The men,
heads skinned like Lager inmates,
know only the revolutions

in diets and spinning classes.
Still, one table away,
these two, with gnarled empretzled hands,
seem unhappy in the old way.





The Long Evenings of Their Leavetakings
 

My mother was married by the water. 
She wore a gray coat and a winter rose.

She said her vows beside a cold seam of the Irish coast.

She said her vows near the shore where
the emigrants set down their consonantal n:

on afternoon, on the end of everything, at the start of ever.

Yellow vestments took in light.
A chalice hid underneath its veil.

Her hands were full of calla and cold-weather lilies.

The mail packet dropped anchor.
A black-headed gull swerved across the harbor.

Icy promises rose beside a crosshatch of ocean and horizon.

I am waiting for the words of the service. I am waiting for 
keep thee only and all my earthly. 

All I hear is an afternoon's worth of never.





Topiary
 

I cannot know twisted Henriette of the plant kingdom
 Engrafted with a crutch. And yet her bulbous concerns
 Effuse a solid blue from inside,
 Like a steel Dryad, and her gaze effaced
  
 Shines with distended power. Otherwise
 These clusterjewels would not dazzle us so,
 As limbs proliferate through her pulped brain
 From dendrites where creation flared
  
 And this crippled tree would seem defaced,
 J'Accuse! beneath the lace of this clipped sister
 And would not glisten in synaptic blasts
  
 Would not, from all the reaching boughs of self,
 Burst like ripe sapphires: for here there is no place
 That does not see you. You shake forth a nest.





Beautiful Poetry
 

"Being so caught up  So mastered.                                        --Yeats
I was too shy to say anything but Your poems are so beautiful.
 What kinds of things, feelings, or ideas inspire you,
 I mean, outside the raw experiences of your life?
 He turned a strange crosshatched color
 as if he stood in a clouded painting, and said, Thanks,
 but no other phenomena intrude upon my starlit mind.
  
 I see you are wondering what this is all about. Don't mind
 me, I'm talking to myself again. Yes, poetry is nice and often beautiful,
 yet it doesn't beget much attention, money, or even a simple thanks
 for placing the best words in the best order. That's when I forget all about your
 incessant demands, and the restless subject leaps the stream in Technicolor--
 until the Remembrancer appears and says, Stop this wasteful life.
  
 Doctor, lawyer, thief. These fancies of yours could cost a life
 or worse, two. Meanwhile, he perceives my gifted body upholding my mind
 as I'm explaining my stuff on the Unicorn Tapestries, cheeks starting to color,
 feathers ruffling, quiet shudders. He shrugs, Your content sounds too beautiful
 but I'd like to read it sometime. Okay. He says all the right things, like I love you
 Hyacinth Girl. Things get interesting until the sudden blow: Thanks
  
 For the memories. What I'll think seeing his new work in The New Yorker is Thanks
 for nothing, asshole, as he drops me for that prolific pastoral life
 with his wife upstate. The more I think about it, it all depends upon your
 phantom attention. Surely a world embroiders itself in one's mind
 at any moment, words resounding, ardent present clarifyingly beautiful
 And beautifully truthful. You know? Here I should put in a lapis color
  
 Or a murky midnight blue. Or have the crowd stagger by in a riot of color
 pinning down the helpless beast with spears and ritualistic thanks
 to their gods. What one really wants to get at is the real, the eternally beautiful
 like The White Album or something. That's what makes one perilous life
 worth living. All the brute indifference, humiliation, and failure can put one in the    
             mind
 to give up, freak out, kill somebody, heart battered, so mastered. Oh you
  
 Wherever I go, on the subway, in my cubicle, at play, in sleep, it's always you
 of the air, overpowering my senses like a Dutch master in one pure color,
 its fiction at full speed, walls breaking, a clarity panorama for the mind
 hunting for meaning and finding it at last! Now look at all the work I did, and not
             one thanks
 Not even flowers. Off you rush to watch him accept another award in that life
 We can only dream of. From where you sit it all seems so beautiful
  
 And I finally understand you. For that I can't express enough thanks
 As the subject is the best color for me in the difficulty of this lonely life.
 It's always caught up in my mind, what could be more beautiful.





Murderer [Part I]
 

I
  
 The whole of human history  
  
             The whole of human history 
             seems to be the story of men who kill,
             and of men who are killed;
             of murderers who light their cigarettes
             with trembling hands,
             and of poor, unlucky kids staring into the eyes
             of those who bring them their deaths.
  
             But history is not about murderers, after all.
             It is just the story of some poor kids.
             The whole history of the world
             is just the story of millions of poor kids
             overwhelmed by the fear of death, or
             by the fear of bringing death to others.
  
             My mother had closed her eyes
             and was breathing softly.
             Every so often, her right hand,
             abandoned on the white sheet,
             would shift slightly, opening and closing
             like the hand of a sleeping baby.
  
             The nurse came into the room just then,
             as I had begun to tell the story of Jaco.
             She opened the door as slowly as possible,
             but I felt her presence behind my shoulders
             bending over the bed,
             looking at my mother.
  
             She is sleeping, said the nurse.
             Don't wake her.
  
             I didn't turn around,
             but continued my story in a low whisper.
             When I got to the part about the grenade,
             I heard the nurse tiptoeing out,
             closing the door behind her,
  
             silently.
  
 The grenade exploded a few feet away, while Jaco was helping to carry two wounded soldiers down the hill to the hospital tent. By the time I got to him, he was stretched out on the grass, breathing heavily. Everyone around him had been killed. He watched as I approached, and when I was close, he smiled.
     He had just been promoted to lieutenant, even though he had not yet turned nineteen. Six months ago, when we were getting ready to leave Italy, Ercolani had taken me aside and said: Look out for Jaco. He's like a brother to me. Make sure nothing bad happens to him.
     I was irritated: War isn't a game. It doesn't play by the rules. If something bad happens to him, tough luck.
     But from that day on, I kept my eye on Jacoboni: he was about the same age as me, but seemed much younger. In any event, he turned out to be a good officer: he did his duty like all the others, like a good kid. He took war seriously, convinced he would go home in one piece, back to his family in Monterotondo, near Rome. And it was perhaps because of this that he smiled as I sat down next to him.
      I saw right away that it was hopeless. The grenade had torn open his abdomen and his intestines were cascading down his leg past his knees and coiling onto the ground.
       We were surrounded by the dead: hundreds of them in the forest around us. Most were Italian, but there were a few Germans: they had advanced this far before we had finally pushed them back. Their dead lay alongside ours.
  
 It began to rain.
  
             The rain on the oak leaves
             made a soft music, like women whispering.
             Every so often, it would intensify
             as it darted here, and there through the trees,
             rising and then fading away.
  
             The green reflection of the forest
             washed everything the color of water,
             gave an extraordinary lightness to things:
             to the solid trunks of the trees,
             to the bodies lying in the grass.
  
             Glimpsed through the branches of the trees,
             the sky appeared light and remote:
             A sky made of silk,
             luminous and pure, serene,
             scrubbed of clouds and fog.
  
             The rain was coming from who knows where.
             Or maybe it was not even rain,
             just the memory of some rain
             falling from the depths of past summers,
             falling from some childhood summer long ago.





Murderer [Part IV]
 

IV

So it did not come as a surprise--a relief, almost--when we heard the tac-tac-tac of machine guns and the thud of grenades rising up from the woods below. The Germans were advancing again through the tangle of bomb-shattered branches, clearing a path with axe-blows, foreheads crushed beneath the overhang of great steel helmets, gleaming eyes fixed dead ahead.
     The rest of that day was bitter, and many of us fell forever headlong in the grass. But toward evening the voice of battle began to diminish, and then from the depths of the forest we could hear the song of the wounded: the serene, monotonous, sad-hopeful song of the wounded, joining the chorus of birds hidden in the foliage as they welcomed the return of the moon.
     It was still daylight, but the moon was rising sweetly from behind the forested mountains of Reims.
  
 It was green against a white and tender sky 
             
             A moon from the forest of Ardennes,
             a moon from the country of Rimbaud, of Verlaine,
             a delicate green moon, round and light,
             entering the room of the sky from behind a screen of branches
             as if stepping delicately out of the earth,
             rising up from the grass, causing the tree-branches to blush
             transparent and sweet.
  
             Like startled birds, we had settled again around Jaco:
             I can't stand it any more, he smiled.
             Don't let me suffer.
             But now his smile was tired:
             a tired smile
             in a face clenched like a fist.
  
             Jaco's suffering gnawed away at us,
             sinking into our bones.
             There is nothing so terrible, or so sweet,
             so touching, as that animal, man,
             when he gives over to death.
             I felt my shirt sticking to my back. My face
             and the faces of the others were beaded with sweat,
             like the sweet face of Nazzareno Jacoboni.
             And little by little I became aware
             that everyone had slowly turned toward me,
             pinning me down with their eyes.
  
             Along with Jaco's terrible, unbearable suffering,
             something else was sinking into us, little by little,
             something which was not ours.
             Something strong, strange, insistent,
             was slowly being born within us.
             Jaco stared at me,
             even he now stared at me,
             expecting something,
             and I felt a new idea forming inside me,
             and inside the others.
             
             I can't go on, said Jaco.
             I looked away to the green moon hanging behind the trees:
             It had taken on the round shapeliness
             of a fragrant leaf: a laurel leaf,
             perhaps, or sage, or mint,
             a great green leaf, transparent with evening daylight.
             The sun had not yet settled into the forest,
             and his last warm rays struck the trunks of the trees
             leaving some of them wounded, bleeding.
             Others--the oaks, the beeches, poplars and birches--
             reflected the light in a strange way,
             as if they were made of glass.
  
             That glassy light, which the sun, just before it sets,
             draws from the earth's waters,
             drinks from its grass, from its leaves,
             from the trunks of its trees,
             to slake its thirst.
  
             All of them stared at me,
             but I was not aware of what I was doing.
             I felt my hands moving,
             but I did not know what I was doing until
             I found myself standing
             and saw them looking up at me,
             and Jacoboni smiling at me strangely,
             and felt something cold and smooth in my hands.
  
             And finally I was aware that I was standing
             with a rifle in my hands.
             I closed my eyes, and fired.
             I fired with my eyes closed,
             one shot after another.
             
            And then, when the echo of the shots
             had melted into the woods,
             there was a great silence.
  
             With my eyes still closed,
             rifle still in hand,
             I turned and took a few steps.
             Suddenly I heard: Murderer! Murderer!
  
             It was the voice of woman, terrible,
             the voice of a sister, desperate,
             the voice of a mother, of a lover.
             And at that moment nothing could have been more terrible
             than that voice of a woman,
             that voice of a mother, of a sister,
             of a lover, crying:
  
             Murderer!
  
     I opened my eyes and saw one of the girls running toward me, her hands like claws, as if she intended to tear me apart. She screamed again: Murderer! and then stopped abruptly a few paces away, filthy, disheveled, with a great bewilderment, spreading across her face, a wondrous pity. I stood in front of her, rifle in my hands, tears in my eyes.
     And they were certainly a marvelous thing, those tears, not only for her, but for me as well.
  
 My mother . . . 
  
             My mother was lying on her back,
             her eyes were closed, and she seemed to be asleep;
             Even her hand, abandoned on the sheets,
             had dozed off.
             I fell silent,
             looking at the moon rising inch by inch
             over the olive trees of Settignano.
             It gave me great solace,
             that moon and those trees.
             That bright silver moon over silvery trees,
             that moon in the shape of an olive leaf,
             clean and transparent,
             shining like a vein of silver, pulsing
             through green marble
             in the incensed darkness of a church.





Today We Fly
 

One Sunday morning,
 instead of studying The Illiad,
 I escaped with Bino to Florence,
 to see what miracles the aviator Manissero
 would perform.
  
 Whether he would demonstrate the art of Daedalus
 or the folly of Icarus.
  
 We found the whole city festooned with banners
 on which was written: Today We Fly.
 They were everywhere: Via Cerretani,
 Via Cavour, Via Calzaioli, along the embankments.
 There was even one stretched across the Arno
 with an enormous red Today We Fly
 reflected in the yellow water

like the famous In Hoc Signo Vinces of Ponte Milvio.
 
We almost expected that Florence itself
would lift off,
with its towers, its statues, its red roofs,
with its cathedral's nodding cupola
rising slowly through the clouds
like a balloon.
 
Every window, doorway and marketplace
was crammed with upturned faces,
scanning the sky for some sign
of the direction the wind might take,
and whether there would come with it
the smell of rain.
 
We were most afraid of the wind from Bologna,
proud enemy to the north.
Almost as bad would have been the wind from the south,
from Empoli, called the scirocco;
or Petrarch's east wind from Arezzo,
with its Grecian-accented gusts.
But even a soft westerly breeze from Pistoia--
even that sweet breath from the ballads of Cino,
full of dolce stil novo--
would have spelled disaster.
 
Luckily the sky that Sunday was clear,
and the air was still.
The leaves on the trees around the parade ground
stood at ease,
and the outlines of the hills were crisp,
sharply etched in the crystalline air.
Just wait. Today we really will fly,
said Bino with a smile.
 
For overnight Today We Fly had become a catchphrase,
fit for every occasion:
for a straw hat rolling along the pavement;
for a parasol blown around the corner;
for a dress tangled up between the knees,
or blown flapping like a flag around rounded hips.
 
It was the happy time of the first aeroplanes,
before the War
when it was fashionable for women
to wear enormous hairdos
as wide as their dresses were narrow.
And those gigantic wings of hair,
which were the objects of so many of our teenage jokes,
have remained braided together in my heart
with the fluttering Today We Fly:
maliciously good-natured mementos
of my adolescence.
 
We hurried over the parade grounds,
and there was Manissero
crouched in the cockpit of his machine:
a contraption of woven reeds and papery cloth,
with a motor so small it made you think a horsefly
was pinned to the frame behind his shoulders.
 
The crowd had assembled, holding its breath,
waiting for the miracle to happen,
when suddenly the leaves began to tremble,
and the blades of grass of nod.
A few tiny white clouds sprouted
like windowsills on Monte Morello,
and the women's wings of hair began to come untucked
from their padded nests of false braids.
 
Manissero jumped out of his cockpit
at the first sign of this unfortunate breeze,
waved amicably to the crowd with a gloved hand,
and yanked off his leather helmet
while a banner was unfurled above the grandstands:
 
Because of Unsettled Weather, Today We Will Not Fly.
 
It was hard to imagine anything more settled
than the weather that day:
a magnificent, paradisiacal Sunday in spring.
But all it took was this delicate breeze,
this perfumed zephyr from Pistoia,
to spoil everything.
 
We returned to Prato with heavy hearts,
and I took up my study of the abandoned Illiad,
quiet and discouraged.
 
Thursday morning the rumor began to spread
that the following Sunday,
if the weather was favorable,
Manissero would attempt to fly
from Florence to Prato and back:
thirty kilometers round trip!
 
By Saturday, Via Magnolfi, the Corso,
Via del'Oche, Via Firenzuola--all the streets of Prato
were crisscrossed with white banners
carrying those fateful words:
 
Today We Fly.
 
By noon Sunday
rivers of people from the surrounding the countryside
were flooding into the city through its five gates,
and by three o'clock
the cathedral square was awash
with a restless and noisy crowd,
pale, perspiring, noses in the air.
I stood among them with my classmates,
all of us impatient, barely kept in check
by the stern gaze of our principal
and the softer reprimands of the teachers.
 
We began to hear a new word:
Velivolo!
dancing above the buzz of the crowd.
But that name for aeroplane, recently coined by d'Annunzio,
seemed too delicate for the gaping mouths of dumbstruck farmers:
it was still fresh, still smelled of varnish,
and was as sweet and sharp in the mouth
as mint candy.
Velivolo!
 
Suddenly a white wing appeared in the blue sky
and the reed-and-paper bird
grew larger, came closer,
hovered over the cathedral square.
 
A cry, only one, but from a thousand throats;
a cry more of fear than joy:
then sudden silence,
bursting with anguish.
Manissero was perhaps two hundred meters above our heads,
and it seemed miraculous.
Miraculous not just because he was flying,
but because he was flying over Prato,
in the virgin sky of Prato!
which only the kites of children had dared to caress
until today.
 
As long as the flying was over Florence,
things were fine:
certain facts, in Florence, are understandable,
are legitimate, and fit within in the logic of history.
 
But over Prato!
Over Prato where for centuries now
nothing miraculous had happened.
Not on the ground,
and not in the sky.
Especially not in the sky.
 
Over Prato!
Where it seemed that miracles had become impossible,
caught as we were
between the historic pride of Florence
and the ancient jealousy of Pistoia.
Sacrificed,
reduced to poor relations,
robbed not only of everything that we had,
which would have been bad enough,
but of everything we might have wanted to have.
 
Yet here was Manissero flying in our sky,
in the neglected sky of Prato.
And he was flying, or so it seemed,
better than he might have flown in the sky of Florence.
Better than in any other sky in Tuscany!
 
After a moment, though, the suspicion began to grow
that he might fly as far as Pistoia.
Everyone held their breath,
balanced on one foot,
hearts stopped between beats:
 
The treacherous sky of Pistoia!
 
Some us took out our keys,
ready to rattle them against such a betrayal.
The rest of us set our lips
to whistle in defiance.
But Manissero veered to the right,
and after a wide turn over Prato
he headed back toward Florence.
 
The city detonated with joy.
I lost myself in the crowd, beyond thought,
proud citizen of Prato to my bones.
It wouldn't be too much to say that all of us, that day,
felt we held a piece of sky in our hands.
 
That night, in my dreams, the Achaean army,
assembling beneath the walls of Troy,
came to a halt, astonished at what lay before them:
stretching from tower to tower
immense white banners
on which great red letters spelled out:
Today We Fly.
 
And then Troy, the city of Priam--
which from a distance resembled nothing more than Prato--
detached itself gently from the earth,
hovered with its banners snapping in the breeze,
and drifted away into the clear sky,
swinging gently from side to side.
 
Maddened Achilles ran along below, commanding:
Stop! Stop!
 
And from the buzz of his accent
you might have thought he was from Pistoia.
 
Beloved Priam, from the top of the Trojan gates.
answered sweetly:
Too Late. Too Late.
 
And his voice had all soft accents of Prato,
taking flight.





Xian of Eight Rivers
 

China is made of earth, of sun-dried mud.
 
In this part of China everything is made from the earth:
the houses, the walls around cities, and villages,
the tombs scattered over the countryside.
Even the people.
 
There are hills below that appear to be piles of mud
set out to dry in the sun, naked,
without a single tree or bush.
They crowd around the landscape
like the coils of bulging intestines
tossed on the ground outside butchers' shops,
slowly unraveling.
 
Sometimes we fly so low that we almost touch them.
 
And then I notice that the wind has brushed
some kind of pattern into the earth: a mysterious alphabet
written in the mud,
struggling to communicate something precise.
But there is not a single animal
or human being in the yellow desert below.
 
Not a single village.
  
 Suddenly we are landing: Xian,
 the geographic center of China,
 where Chinese civilization was born,
 in the cradle of the Yellow River.
  
 In front of the terminal,
 three children are playing with a lump of earth:
 they are bundled up in jackets
 and brightly printed cotton trousers.
 I join them in their game
 until a young woman comes out of the terminal
 to call me in for dinner.
 One of the children grabs me by my overcoat,
 to keep me from leaving.
 So do the other two, clinging to me,
 asking me not to go.
  
 The young woman comes out again,
 and yells at them to stop.
  
 They let go, disappointed.
 One of them calls to me as I turn away:
 Come back soon!
  
 We eat quickly and then prepare to take off for Lanchow.
 My three new friends wave goodbye to me. The littlest one
 gives me a present: a pebble,
 a precious gift.
 In this part of China there are no stones.
 You have to go to Karelia to find stone,
 very far north; or to the Caucasus;
 or to southern Siberia, along the slopes of the Pamir,
 slanting toward the steppes of Central Asia.
  
 I put the pebble in my pocket,
 to take back home, to show what a precious gift
 I was given by a little Chinese girl: a pebble
 from the cradle of Chinese civilization.
  
 A civilization made of earth,
 a civilization without bones,
 without a skeleton for support.
 A civilization of assembled customs,
 which suddenly unravel,
 dissolving into thousands of separate gestures,
 thousands of calligraphic icons,
 thousands of smells, colors, flavors,
 thousands of different shades. And then just as suddenly
 they solidify again into tradition, memory, habit.
  
 It is this absence of stone, of solid, durable material,
 which makes China such an exquisite thing.
 Everything is reflected:
 an unimaginable number of movements,
 of patterns, thoughts, images,
 of which we see the copies in immense numbers,
 but never the originals.
  
 The originals were destroyed long ago.
  
 Here are the four elements out of which China is made:
 Earth, Wood, Porcelain, Silk.
 The most durable of these is Silk.
  
 I should add a fifth element: Poetry,
 which is the most durable of all.





The Totality of Facts
 

The laughing gull that flew behind the fencepost
 and never came out was the beginning
 and then a hand smaller than my hand covered Wisconsin
 with a gesture for explanation.
 In the afternoon there are pauses between the words
 through which commas can grow like daisy fleabane.
 A fish with an osprey in its back emerges from the Sound
 and nothing can be learned by more analysis.
 The book of her hair opens to its binding and I leaf through
 the glorious pages of appreciation and that's not all.
 We could not have turned fast enough to catch
 light and leftovers from so much of what happened:
 the swift figures behind you like a planet's dark
 companion, ships entering and leaving the hall closet
 the real and imagined between which is no difference.





Eight Presidents
 

October five. Seven years older in dog years and then your November
 the day record snowfalls hit Randolph New Hampshire in forty-three
 and I am thinking of something intimate and impossible to waste:
 Brazil's undiscovered caverns of amethyst     endless smooth oval stones
 along Washington's moody Pacific chewing a continent. But I am wrong.
 We pass St. Michael's the cemetery that asks the public to mow and weed it
 and perhaps draw larger conclusions about the already wasted and tidy up names
 frayed at the edges by the ions that bind     by age the chemical salt of time
 that jostles stones over at their bases to remind us or alter their sentiments.
 We read and read and each time nothing new has come up on their markers.
 At home we hear the fishermen bring up their nets smack water to scare them.
 By now the flounder's secret pocket where its heart and everything separate
 from meat and bone is cleaned and empty as a silk purse not a nickel left
 down in the freezer. Nothing really shines but this: I have loved you
 eight presidents. Forty years. Five point seven in dog.





Moon Missing
 

I was so worried the hickory I recognized
 had died from salt burn in the last hurricane
 I may have passed by vervain and apple haw
 like they didn't matter, but this spring
 it put out seven shoots from its base.
 Still, the oldest trick is the moon missing,
 then the "new moon appears,
 though we know it's the old one, and we pretend
 to be taken in like the mother or baby
 behind the bath towel.
 Really it's the moon winking,
 being the stone that holds stones and now footprints.
 And when I tell Frances, I see she is a moon
 motionless in the doorway, skin reflecting
 a lamp, a face that awakens on paper.





Section 16 from 'Draft 85: Hard Copy'
 

I won't quote a word,
 but that notable double-crossing chess game
 reveals trouble in the desert,
 trouble in the lineage, trouble in the choices,
 trouble in the allegory.
  
 What more to say about the Father of everything
 from the inevitable, suspicious, atheist
 daughter
 watching the claim made around the one--
 the beautiful, longed-for, pensive son.
  
 They are all male singletons:
 one A, one I and one One
 (undercounting various brothers
 who do not matter in the tally;
  
  
 nor enumerating most sisters,
 though they certainly existed).
  
 Single, except for the One who sent an
 androgyne messenger
 who rammed the ram into the thicket,
 who filled the curly ewe,
 who took her mewling newborn sheep.
  
 Thereupon the regime of human sacrifice
 was declared theologically finished.
 But not politically and ideologically finished.
  
 Clear enough?





Section 29 from 'Draft 85: Hard Copy'
 

So she stole her father's teraphim.
 What, in the name of monotheism,
 was that about?
  
 Those rare black stones.
 Sacred knick-knacks, idols,
 symbolic lion grabbed at that got chipped,
 cover them with the ass of female claim,
 settle in for the duration, and refuse
 ("being in the way of women)
 to rise.
  
 Say you are neither disloyal nor pilferer.
 And sit tight on the icons and rocks of meaning
 gathered from the paternal household,
 the talismanic counterfoils, even
 the fewest and smallest
 from the fierce storehouses of articulation
 and defensiveness.
 You will remake these goods in your own blood
  
 "I didn't take enough.
 "So go get more.
 Tokens from the broken labyrinth.

[I asked myself / What, Sappho, can...]
 

I asked myself
  
 What, Sappho, can
 you give one who
 has everything,
 like Aphrodite?





[Its no use / Mother dear...]
 

It's no use
  
 Mother dear, I
 can't finish my
 weaving
             You may
 blame Aphrodite
  
 soft as she is
  
 she has almost
 killed me with
 love for that boy





[To an army wife, in Sardis...]
 

To an army wife, in Sardis:
  
 Some say a cavalry corps,
 some infantry, some, again,
 will maintain that the swift oars
  
 of our fleet are the finest
 sight on dark earth; but I say
 that whatever one loves, is.
  
 This is easily proved: did
 not Helen--she who had scanned
 the flower of the world's manhood--
  
 choose as first among men one
 who laid Troy's honor in ruin?
 warped to his will, forgetting
  
 love due her own blood, her own
 child, she wandered far with him.
 So Anactoria, although you
  
 being far away forget us,
 the dear sound of your footstep
 and light glancing in your eyes
  
 would move me more than glitter
 of Lydian horse or armored
 tread of mainland infantry





Sonnet 123: No, Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change
 

No, Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change:
Thy pyramids built up with newer might
To me are nothing novel, nothing strange;
They are but dressings of a former sight.
Our dates are brief, and therefore we admire
What thou dost foist upon us that is old,
And rather make them born to our desire
Than think that we before have heard them told.
Thy registers and thee I both defy,
Not wondering at the present nor the past;
For thy records and what we see doth lie,
Made more or less by that continual haste.
   This I do vow, and this shall ever be:
   I will be true, despite thy scythe and thee.





Sonnet 121: 'Tis better to be vile than vile esteemed
 

'Tis better to be vile than vile esteemed
When not to be receives reproach of being, 
And the just pleasure lost, which is so deemed
Not by our feeling but by others' seeing.
For why should others' false adulterate eyes
Give salutation to my sportive blood?
Or on my frailties why are frailer spies, 
Which in their wills count bad that I think good?
No, I am that I am; and they that level
At my abuses reckon up their own:
I may be straight though they themselves be bevel;
By their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown, 
    Unless this general evil they maintain:
    All men are bad and in their badness reign.





Sonnet 133: Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
 

Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
For that deep wound it gives my friend and me:
Is't not enough to torture me alone,
But slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be?
Me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken,
And my next self thou harder hast engrossed;
Of him, myself, and thee I am forsaken,
A torment thrice threefold thus to be crossed. 
Prison my heart in thy steel bosom's ward, 
But then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail;
Whoe'er keeps me, let my heart be his guard:
Thou canst not then use rigour in my jail.
    And yet thou wilt; for I, being pent in thee, 
    Perforce am thine, and all that is in me.





Sonnet 139: O, call not me to justify the wrong
 

O, call not me to justify the wrong
That thy unkindness lays upon my heart;
Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue;
Use power with power, and slay me not by art.
Tell me thou lov'st elsewhere; but in my sight, 
Dear heart, forbear to glance thine eye aside;
What need'st thou wound with cunning when thy might
Is more than my o'erpressed defense can bide?
Let me excuse thee: ah, my love well knows
Her pretty looks have been mine enemies;
And therefore from my face she turns my foes,
That they elsewhere might dart their injuries--
    Yet do not so; but since I am near slain,
    Kill me outright with looks and rid my pain.





Sonnet 142: Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate
 

Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,
Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving.
O, but with mine compare thou thine own state,
And thou shalt find it merits not reproving;
Or if it do, not from those lips of thine,
That have profaned their scarlet ornaments
And sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine, 
Robbed others' beds' revenues of their rents.
Be it lawful I love thee as thou lov'st those
Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee:
Root pity in thy heart, that, when it grows, 
Thy pity may deserve to pitied be. 
    If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,
    By self-example mayst thou be denied.





Sonnet 147: My love is as a fever, longing still
 

My love is as a fever, longing still
For that which longer nurseth the disease,
Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,
Th' uncertain sickly appetite to please.
My reason, the physician to my love,
Angry that his prescriptions are not kept, 
Hath left me, and I desperate now approve
Desire is death, which physic did except.
Past cure I am, now reason is past care, 
And frantic-mad with evermore unrest;
My thoughts and my discourse as madmen's are,
At random from the truth vainly expressed:
    For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,
    Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.





In a Hotel
 

In a hotel, even prayer feels adulterous,
the skyline smudged in light, a distraction 
just before dusk. In the lobby

a woman tells a stranger what she will do
for three hundred dollars, what
she will do for four. Some have the custom 

of opening a book randomly with a question in mind. 
Some have the custom of forgetting. 
At six my friend beat his father at chess, 

beat his father's friends so easily 
he wondered if they tried.
At seven he shook the governor's hand.

Don't call it a failure; call it knowledge:
the peculiar taste that filled his mouth 
as if he had bitten his cheek.

Whatever he risked did not matter, whatever 
he could imagine was already lost. 
Bored, the other boy coughed into his hands.





Sostenuto
 

              Night. Or what


                                       they have of it at altitude
like this, and filtered
                           air, what was

in my lungs just an hour ago is now
                            in yours,
                                         there's only so much air to go

                around. They're making
more people, my father would say,

                               but nobody's making more land.
                                                          When my daughters
were little and played in their bath,

                           they invented a game whose logic
              largely escaped me--
                                         something to do with the

                                                     disposition
of bubbles and plastic ducks--until
               I asked them what they called it. They

                             were two and four. The game
was Oil Spill.
              Keeping the ducks alive, I think,

                                        was what you were supposed to
                                                    contrive, as long
            as you could make it last. Up here

                           in borrowed air,
in borrowed bits of heat, in costly
                                           cubic feet of steerage we're
                            a long

              held note, as when the choir would seem
to be more
                            than human breath could manage. In

                                       the third age, says the story, they
 divided up the earth. And that was when
              the goddess turned away from them.





The Weavers
 

As sometimes, in the gentler months, the sun
will return
                          before the rain has altogether
                                                      stopped and through

this lightest of curtains the curve of it shines
with a thousand
                            inclinations and so close
                                                        is the one to the

one adjacent that you cannot tell where magenta
for instance begins
                           and where the all-but-magenta
                                                      has ended and yet

you'd never mistake the blues for red, so these two,
the girl and the
                          goddess, with their earth-bred, grass-
                                                      fed, kettle-dyed

wools, devised on their looms
transitions so subtle no
                           hand could trace nor eye discern
                                                       their increments,

yet the stories they told were perfectly clear.
The gods in their heaven,
                           the one proposed. The gods in
                                                       heat, said the other.

And ludicrous too, with their pinions and swansdown,
fins and hooves,
                           their shepherds' crooks and pizzles.
                                                       Till mingling

with their darlings-for-a-day they made
a progeny so motley it
                           defied all sorting-out.
                                                      It wasn't the boasting

brought Arachne all her sorrow
nor even
                           the knowing her craft so well.
                                                      Once true

and twice attested.
It was simply the logic she'd already
                            taught us how
                                                       to read.





The Rosehead Nail
 

Blacksmithing demonstration, mountain arts and crafts fair, Monteagle, TN

"But can you forge a nail? the blond boy asks,
And the blacksmith shoves a length of iron rod
Deep in the coal fire cherished by the bellows
Until it glows volcanic. He was a god
Before anachronism, before the tasks
That had been craft were jobbed out to machine.
By dint of hammer-song he makes his keen,
Raw point, and crowns utility with rose:
Quincunx of facets petaling its head.
The breeze-made-visible sidewinds. The boy's
Blonde mother shifts and coughs. Once Work was wed
To Loveliness--sweat-faced, swarthy from soot, he
Reminds us with the old saw he employs
(And doesn't miss a beat): "Smoke follows beauty.





Bye-bye
 

The animal of winter is dying, 
its white body everywhere 
in collapse and stabbed at
by straws of light, a leaving 
to believe in as the air 
slowly fills with darkness 
and water drains from the tub 
where my daughter, watching it 
lower around her, feeling it 
go, says about the only thing 
she can as if it were a long-
kept breath going with her 
blessing of dribble and fleck.
Down it swirls a living drill
vanishing toward a land
where tomorrow already 
fixes its bright eye on a man
muttering his way into a crowd,
saying about the only thing
he can before his body
goes boom. And tomorrow, 
I will count more dark shapes 
tumbling from the sky, birds 
returning to scarcity, offering 
in their seesawing songs 
a kind of liquidity.





Song of the Shattering Vessels
 

Either the world is coming together,
or else the world is falling apart--
     here--now--along these letters,
     against the walls of every heart. 

Today, tomorrow, within its weather,
the end or beginning's about to start--
     the world impossibly coming together
     or very possibly falling apart.

Now the lovers' mouths are open--
maybe the miracle's about to start:
      the world within us coming together,
      because all around us it's falling apart. 

Even as they speak, he wonders,
even as the fear departs:
     Is that the world coming together?
     Can they keep it from falling apart?

The image, gradually, is growing sharper;
now the sound is like a dart:
     It seemed their world was coming together,
     but in fact it was falling apart.

That's the nightmare, that's the terror,
that's the Isaac of this art--
     which sees that the world might come together
      if only we're willing to take it apart. 

The dream, the lure, is the prayer's answer,
which can't be plotted on any chart--
    as we know the world that's coming together
    without our knowing is falling apart.





The Fury That Breaks
 

After Csar Vallejo
The fury that breaks a grown-up into kids,
a kid into scattered birds
and a bird into limp eggs,
the fury of the poor
takes one part oil to two parts vinegar.

The fury that breaks a tree into leaves,
a leaf into deranged flowers
and a flower into wilting telescopes,
the fury of the poor
gushes two rivers against a hundred seas.

The fury that breaks the true into doubts,
doubt into three matching arches
and the arch into instant tombs,
the fury of the poor
draws a sharpening stone against two knives.

The fury that breaks the soul into bodies,
the body into warped organs,
and the organ into eight doctrines,
the fury of the poor
burns with one fire in two thousand craters.





From "The Invention of Influence
 

Freud could never be certain, he said,
in view of his wide and early reading,
whether what seemed like a new creation
might not be the work instead
of hidden channels of memory leading
back to the notions of others absorbed, 
coming now anew into form
he'd almost known within him was growing. 
He called it (the ghost of a) cryptomnesia. 
So we own and owe what we know.











Quatrains for a Calling
 

Why are you here?
Who have you come for
and what would you gain?
Where is your fear?

Why are you here?

You've come so near,
or so it would seem;
you can see the grain
in the paper--that's clear.

But why are you here

when you could be elsewhere,
earning a living
or actually learning?
Why should we care

why you're here?

Is that a tear?
Yes, there's pressure 
behind the eyes--
and there are peers.

But why are you here?

At times it sears.
The pressure and shame
and the echoing pain.
What do you hear

now that you're here?

The air's so severe.
It calls for equipment,
which comes at a price.
And you've volunteered.

Why? Are you here?

What will you wear?
What will you do
if it turns out you've failed?
How will you fare?

Why are you here

when it could take years
to find out--what?
It's all so slippery,
and may not cohere.

And yet, you're here...

Is it what you revere?

How deep does that go?
How do you know?
Do you think you're a seer?

Is that why you're here?

Do you have a good ear?
For praise or for verse?
Can you handle a curse?
Define persevere.

Why are you here?

It could be a career.





Avalon
 

To the Metropolitan Police Force, London:
the asylum gates are locked and chained, but undone
by wandering thoughts and the close study of maps.
So from San Francisco, patron city of tramps,
I scribble this note, having overshot Gloucester
by several million strides, having walked on water.

City of sad foghorns and clapboard ziggurats,
of snakes-and-ladders streets and cadged cigarettes,
city of pelicans, fish bones and flaking paint,
of underfoot cable-car wires strained to breaking point...
I eat little--a beard of grass, a pinch of oats--
let the salt-tide scour and purge me inside and out,
but my mind still phosphoresces with lightning strikes
and I straddle each earthquake, one foot either side
of the fault line, rocking the world's seesaw.
At dusk, the Golden Gate Bridge is heaven's seashore:
I watch boats heading home with the day's catch 
or ferrying souls to glittering Alcatraz,
or I face west and let the Pacific slip
in bloodshot glory over the planet's lip,
sense the waterfall at the end of the journey.

I am, ever your countryman, Ivor Gurney.








The Day
 

It hangs on its
                stem like a plum
at the edge of a
               darkening thicket.

It's swelling and
               blushing and ripe
and I reach out a
               hand to pick it

but flesh moves
               slow through time
and evening
               comes on fast

and just when I
               think my fingers
might seize that
               sweetness at last

the gentlest of
               breezes rises
and the plum lets
               go of the stem.

And now it's my
               fingers ripening
and evening that's
               reaching for them.





An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations
 

Compiling this landmark anthology of poetry in English
 about dogs and musical instruments is like swimming through bricks. 
 To date, I have only, "On the Death of Mrs. McTuesday's Pug,
 Killed by a Falling Piano, a somewhat obvious choice. 
 True, an Aeolian harp whispers alluringly 
 in the background of the anonymous sonnet, "The Huntsman's
       Hound, 
 but beyond that--silence. 

 I should resist this degrading donkey-work in favor of my own
       writing, 
 wherein contentment surely lies. 
 But A. Smith stares smugly from the reverse of the twenty pound
       note, 
 and when my bank manager guffaws, 
 small particles of saliva stream like a meteor shower 
 through the infinity of dark space 
between his world and mine.





The Unthinkable
 

A huge purple door washed up in the bay overnight,
its paintwork blistered and peeled from weeks at sea.
The town storyteller wasted no time in getting to work:
the beguiling, eldest girl of a proud, bankrupt farmer
had slammed that door in the face of a Freemason's son,
who in turn had bulldozed both farm and family
over the cliff, except for the girl, who lived now
by the light and heat of a driftwood fire on a beach.

There was some plan to use the door as a jetty
or landing-stage, but it was all bullshit, the usual idle talk.
That's when he left and never returned. Him I won't name--
not known for his big ideas or carpentry skills,
a famous non-swimmer, but last seen sailing out,
riding the current and rounding the point in a small boat
with tell-tale flashes of almost certainly purple paint.








Tarp
 

I have seen the black sheets laid out like carpets
under the trees, catching the rain

of olives as they fell. Also the cerulean brightness
of the one covering the bad roof

of a neighbor's shed, the color the only color 
inside the winter's weeks. Another one

took the shape of the pile of bricks underneath.
Another flew off the back of a truck,

black as a piano if a piano could rise into the air.
I have seen the ones under bridges,

the forms they make of sleep. I could go on
this way until the end of the page, even though 

what I have in my mind isn't the thing
itself, but the category of belief that sees the thing 

as a shelter for what is beneath it.
There is no shelter. You cannot put a tarp over

a wave. You cannot put a tarp
over a war. You cannot put a tarp over the broken

oil well miles under the ocean. 
There is no tarp for that raging figure in the mind

that sits in a corner and shreds receipts
and newspapers. There is no tarp for dread,

whose only recourse is language
so approximate it hardly means what it means:

He is not here. She is sick. She cannot remember
her name. He is old. He is ashamed. 







On Gardens
 

When I read about the garden
designed to bloom only white flowers,
I think about the Spanish friar who saw one
of my grandmothers, two hundred years 
removed, and fucked her. If you look 
at the word colony far enough, you see it
traveling back to the Latin
of inhabit, till, and cultivate. Words 

that would have meant something
to the friar, walking among the village girls
as though in a field of flowers, knowing
that fucking was one way of having
a foreign policy. As I write this, there's snow
falling, which means that every
angry thought is as short-lived as a match.
The night is its own white garden:

snow on the fence, snow on the tree
stump, snow on the azalea bushes,
their leaves hanging down like green
bats from the branches. I know it's not fair
to see qualities of injustice in the aesthetics
of a garden, but somewhere between
what the eye sees and what the mind thinks 
is the world, landscapes mangled

into sentences, one color read into rage.
When the neighbors complained
the roots of our cypress were buckling
their lot, my landlord cut the tree down.
I didn't know a living thing three stories high
could be so silent, until it was gone.
Suddenly that sky. Suddenly all the light
in the windows, as though every sheet

of glass was having a migraine.
When I think about that grandmother 
whose name I don't even know, I think of
what it would mean to make a garden
that blooms black: peonies and gladiolas
of deepest purple, tulips like ravens.
Or a garden that doesn't bloom at all: rocks
poised on clean gravel. When the snow stops,

I walk to see the quiet that has colonized
everything. The main street is asleep, except
for the bus that goes by, bright as a cruise ship. 
There are sheet cakes of snow on top
of cars. In front of houses, each lawn
is as clean as paper, except where the first cat
or raccoon has walked across, each track
like a barbed-wire sash on a white gown.








Artifice
 

The plastic Great Horned Owl, stuck with glue
on the stamped tin, corbelled cornice lip
impresses no one--not the starlings that dip
and stitch, nor pigeons as they fluff and coo
around its feet. And vinyl siding's too
regular--each molded, faux-grained strip
identical, but for dents, and that drip
of bird shit from a sill. What if all you
might say speaks like crafted, ersatz things:
mimicry in a tongue you barely know?
Your owl signs death, the cornice stone, the fake
clapboard conjures farmhouse. While just below
the ledge, a wren's mindless gestures make
an altar of twigs, in veneration of wings.







Hall of Records
 

There's a clever thing, stabs at her hand
on every corner now, revising the screed. 
Watch her huff at the tiny screens that send
her chimpish copy up the line, to speed
the raising of the giddy, pixelled hall: 
cornerless, mirror-tiled, the gorging sphere
a fast-receding shell enclosing all
we say or see, never to disappear,
bigger with each second, and the next,
its facets auto-replicant, until
the Record of what was--each fingered text
and pic, the starry shards the hours distill--
impounds what is, slaves us in its spell,
sorting the diamonds in our dazzling cell.








Party Ship
 

You are a
land I can't 
stand leaving
and can't not.
My party ship
is pulling out.
We all have
hats. I try to
toot some notes
you'll understand
but this was not
our instrument
or plan.





The Storm-struck Tree
 

As the storm-struck oak leaned closer to the house--
The remaining six-story half of the tree listing toward the glass box 
Of the kitchen like someone in the first tilt of stumbling--
The other half crashed into the neighbors' yards, a massive
Diagonal for which we had no visual cue save for 
An antler dropped by a constellation--
As the ragged half leaned nearer, the second storm of cloying snow 
Began pulling on the shocked, still-looming splitting, and its branches dragged 
Lower like ripped hems it was tripping over
Until they rustled on the roof under which I
Quickly made dinner, each noise a threat from a body under which we so recently 
Said, Thank goodness for our tree, how it has accompanied us all these years,
Thank goodness for its recitation of the seasons out our windows and over
The little lot of our yard, thank goodness for the birdsong and squirrel games 
Which keep us from living alone, and for its proffered shade, the crack of the bat
Resounding through September when its dime-sized acorns 
Land on the tin awning next door. Have
Mercy on us, you, the massively beautiful, now ravaged and charged
With destruction.
We did speak like that. As if from a book of psalms
Because it took up the sky





Still Start
 

As if engine
parts could be
wrenched out
at random and
the car would 
still start and
sound even,
hearts can go
with chambers
broken open.








Album
 

Death has a life
of its own. See
how its album
has grown in
a year and how
the sharp blot of it
has softened 
till those could
almost be shadows
behind the
cherry blossoms
in this shot.
In fact you
couldn't prove
they're not.







Round
 

Perhaps you covet something of 
               its emptiness, its uselessness 

in matters of yearning or feeling 
               another's yearn, that it can't 

know a damn thing, yet damns 
               everything it touches: the water 

it gathers along its passage, 
               the air it pushes through,

swallow-like. It is no bird,
               though you envy the song 

you hear only after it's gone, 
               even if it sings through paper, 

a goat, the neck of a man 
               wearing a scarf that tufts just as 

the rest of him flies out of
               his shoes and collapses in dirt.

Or, how it is like the dirt
               receiving him, the privilege 

of not knowing if he was 
              kind or unkind, as you

chamber another, waiting for 
              someone to come for his shoes.








Sestina: Like
 

With a nod to Jonah Winter
Now we're all "friends, there is no love but Like,
 A semi-demi goddess, something like
 A reality-TV star look-alike,
 Named Simile or Me Two. So we like
 In order to be liked. It isn't like
 There's Love or Hate now. Even plain "dislike

 Is frowned on: there's no button for it. Like
 Is something you can quantify: each "like
 You gather's almost something money-like,
 Token of virtual support. "Please like
 This page to stamp out hunger. And you'd like
 To end hunger and climate change alike,

 But it's unlikely Like does diddly. Like
 Just twiddles its unopposing thumbs-ups, like-
 Wise props up scarecrow silences. "I'm like,
 So OVER him, I overhear. "But, like,
 He doesn't get it. Like, you know? He's like
 It's all OK. Like I don't even LIKE

 Him anymore. Whatever. I'm all like ... 
 Take "like out of our chat, we'd all alike
 Flounder, agape, gesticulating like
 A foreign film sans subtitles, fall like
 Dumb phones to mooted desuetude. Unlike
 With other crutches, um, when we use "like,

 We're not just buying time on credit: Like
 Displaces other words; crowds, cuckoo-like,
 Endangered hatchlings from the nest. (Click "like
 If you're against extinction!) Like is like
 Invasive zebra mussels, or it's like
 Those nutria-things, or kudzu, or belike

 Redundant fast food franchises, each like
 (More like) the next. Those poets who dislike
 Inversions, archaisms, who just like
 Plain English as she's spoke -- why isn't "like
 Their (literally) every other word? I'd like
 Us just to admit that's what real speech is like.

 But as you like, my friend. Yes, we're alike,
 How we pronounce, say, lichen, and dislike
 Cancer and war. So like this page. Click Like.





Out of Water
 

A new embroidery of flowers, canary color,
                        dots the grass already dotty
                        with aster-white and clover.

I warn, "They won't last, out of water.
The children pick some anyway.

In or out of water
children don't last either.

I watch them as they pick.
Still free of what's next
            and what was yesterday
they pick today.





Pathetic Fallacies Are Bad Science But
 

On reading Susanne K. Langer's Mind
If leaf-trash chokes the stream-bed,
reach for rock-bottom as you rake
the muck out. Let it slump dank,
and dry fading, flat above the bank.
Stand back. Watch the water vault ahead.
Its thrust sweeps the surface clean, shores the debris,
as it debrides its stone path to the lake,
clarity carrying clarity.

To see clear, resist the drag of images.
Take nature as it is, not Dame nor Kind.
Act in events; touch what you name. Abhor
easy obverts of natural metaphor.
Let human speech breathe out its best poor bridges
from mind to world, mind to self, mind to mind.

Yet, I admit the event of the wood thrush:
     In a footnote Langer (her book rapids-clean
     like the spring-water aired over sleeked rock)
     says she witnessed an August bird in shock
     when a hawk snatched its mate. It perched, rushed
     notes fluting two life-quotas in one flood,
     its lungs pushing its voice, flushing the keen
     calls, pumped out as the heart pumps blood,
     not in twilight or warning but noon & wrong,
     its old notes whistled too fast but accurate.

I read this drenched in bird-panic, its spine-
fusing loss all song, all loss; that loss mine
awash in unanswered unanswered song.
And I cannot claim we are not desolate.





From "The First, at the Last"
 

All he undertook
goes under, under
the undergrowth he rose from
fly-boy, lovely
in his day. 
All his clothes
--spruce suit & tie--
are underclothes
against ungrounded gray.
All his studies understudy
an unstudied play.
  
           Under the under
          of what I remember
          we are both twenty
          and except with each other
          underemployed.

                 It is summer.
                Under our butter, bread,
                summer's hunger satisfied.





A Visit
 

Fine bitches all, and Molly Dance...               --Djuna Barnes
Come for duty's sake (as girls do) we watch
The sly very old woman wile away from her pious
And stagger-blind friend, their daily split of gin.
She pours big drinks. We think of what
Has crumpled, folded, slumped her flesh in
And muddied her once tumbling blood that, young,
Sped her, threaded with brave power: a Tower,
Now Babel, then of ivory, of the Shulamite,
Collapsed to this keen dame moving among
Herself. She hums, she plays with used bright
Ghosts, makes real dolls, and drinking sings Come here
My child, and feel it, dear. A crooking finger
Shows how hot the oven is.

(Also she is alive with hate.
Also she is afraid of hell. Also, we wish
We might, illiberal, uncompassionate,
Run from her smell, her teeth in the dish.)

Even dying, her life riots in her. We stand stock still
Though aswarm with itches under her disreputable smiles.
We manage to mean well. We endure, and more.
We learn time's pleasure, catch our future and its cure.
We're dear blood daughters to this every hag, and near kin
To any after this of those our mirrors tell us foolishly envy us,
Presuming us, who are young, to be beautiful, kind, and sure.

A Tale Told by Atheneus (Venus Callipygus)
 

Two sisters of ancient Greece both laid claim
To the finest, fairest rear of their time.
Which tail forged ahead? Which bottom's true fame
Topped? Which back was in front, which terce most prime?
A judge chose the elder girl's back matter;
Her finish was more fine and far matter.
She got the prize, and his heart; soon they wed.
"But the younger's sitter's not a smatter
Less meet; I'll marry her, his brother said.
It went so well, their joys were so perfected,
That after them a temple was erected
In honor of Venus Callipygus.
No other church--though I don't know its rite--
Could so, from head to epididymis,
Move me with deep devotion to its site.

        Translated from the French of Jean de La Fontaine, Contes, Part I, 6.





About My Birthday
 

I'd like to assume
 from my April birthday,
 I quickened the womb
 on the 4th of July.

 If you suffered as I
 a sternly fought tendency
 to endless dependency
 you'd know why.





Old Mama Saturday
 

"Saturday's child must work for a living.
"I'm moving from Grief Street.
Taxes are high here
though the mortgage's cheap.

The house is well built.
With stuff to protect, that
mattered to me,
the security.

These things that I mind,
you know, aren't mine.
I mind minding them.
They weigh on my mind.

I don't mind them well.
I haven't got the knack
of kindly minding.
I say Take them back
but you never do.

When I throw them out
it may frighten you
and maybe me too.

                 Maybe
it will empty me
too emptily

and keep me here
asleep, at sea
under the guilt quilt,
under the you tree.





Pourriture Noble
 

A moral tale, for Sauternes, the fungus cenaria, and the wild old
Never prophesy.
You can't. So don't try.
Lust, pride, and lethargy
may cause us misery
or bliss.
The meanest mistake
has a point to make.
Hear this-- 
what his vintner d'Eyquem said
once the lord d'Eyquem was dead:
         "The wine that year promised bad or none.
          He'd let it go too late.
          Rot had crawled through all the vines,
          greasy scum on every cluster
          dangling at the crotches of the leaves.
          Should have been long picked
          but he'd said, No. Wait for me,'
          off to wait on a new woman,
          grapes on the verge of ripe
          when he left. Coupling kept him
          till rot wrapped the grapes like lace
          & by the time she'd kicked him out
          the sun had got them, they hung
          shriveled in the blast.

          Well, he rode home cocky
          & bullied the grapes into the vats
          rot & all, spoiled grapes, too old,
          too soon squeezed dry.
                                                     The wine makes.
          The wine makes thick, gold-colored,
          & pours like honey.
          We try it. Fantastic!

         not like honey, punchy,
         you've never drunk anything like it-- 
         refreshing, in a rush
         over a heat that slows your throat--
         wanting to keep that flavor
         stuck to the edge of your tongue
         where your taste is, keep it
         like the best bouquet you can remember
         of sundown summer & someone coming
         to you smiling. The taste has odor
         like a new country, so fine
         at first you can't take it in
         it's so strange. It's beautiful
         & believe me you love to go slow.

moral:

Age is not
all dry rot.
It's never too late.
Sweet is your real estate.





Private and Profane
 

From loss of the old and lack of the new
From failure to make the right thing do
Save us, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu.
     From words not the word, from a feckless voice
     From poetic distress and from careless choice
     Exclude our intellects, James Joyce.
From genteel angels and apostles unappalled
From Hollywood visions as virgins shawled
Guard our seeing, Grnewald.
     From calling a kettle an existential pot,
     From bodying the ghost of whatever is not,
     John save us, O most subtle Scot.
From pace without cadence, from pleasures slip-shod
From eating the pease and rejecting the pod
Wolfgang keep us, lover of God.
      Couperin come with your duple measure
      Alter our minds against banal pleasure.
Drer direct with strictness our vision;
Steady this flesh toward your made precision.
     Mistress of accurate minor pain,
     Lend wit for forbearance, prideless Jane.
From pretending to own what we secretly seek,
From (untimely, discourteous) the turned other cheek,
Protect our honor, Demetrius the Greek.
     From ignorance of structural line and bone
     From passion not pointed on truth alone
     Attract us, painters on Egyptian stone.
     From despair keep us, Aquin's dumb son;
     From despair keep us, Saint Welcome One;
     From lack of despair keep us, Djuna and John Donne.
That zeal for free will get us in deep,
That the chance to choose be the one we keep
That free will steel self in us against self-defense
That free will repeal in us our last pretense
That free will heal us
      Jeanne d'Arc, Job, Johnnie Skelton,
      Jehan de Beauce, composer Johann,
      Dark John Milton, Charter Oak John,
Strike deep, divide us from cheap-got doubt;
Leap, leap between us and the easy out;
Teach us to seize, to use, to sleep well, to let go;
Let our loves, freed in us, gaudy and graceful, grow.

Northampton Style
 

Evening falls. Someone's playing a dulcimer
Northampton-style, on the porch out back.
Its voice touches and parts the air of summer,

as if it swam to time us down a river
where we dive and leave a single track
as evening falls. Someone's playing a dulcimer

that lets us wash our mix of dreams together.
Delicate, tacit, we engage in our act;
its voice touches and parts the air of summer.

When we disentangle you are not with her
I am not with him. Redress calls for tact.
Evening falls. Someone's playing a dulcimer

still. A small breeze rises and the leaves stir
as uneasy as we, while the woods go black;
its voice touches and parts the air of summer

and lets darkness enter us; our strings go slack
though the player keeps up his plangent attack.
Evening falls. Someone's playing a dulcimer;
its voice touches and parts the air of summer.





Among Women
 

What women wander?
 Not many. All. A few.
 Most would, now & then,
 & no wonder.
 Some, and I'm one,
 Wander sitting still.
 My small grandmother
 Bought from every peddler 
 Less for the ribbons and lace
 Than for their scent
 Of sleep where you will, 
 Walk out when you want, choose
 Your bread and your company. 

 She warned me, "Have nothing to lose.

 She looked fragile but had
 High blood, runner's ankles,
 Could endure, endure.
 She loved her rooted garden, her
 Grand children, her once
 Wild once young man.
 Women wander
 As best they can.





Language Lesson 1976
 

When Americans say a man
 takes liberties, they mean

 he's gone too far. In Philadelphia today I saw
 a kid on a leash look mom-ward

 and announce his fondest wish: one
 bicentennial burger, hold

 the relish. Hold is forget,
 in American.

 On the courts of Philadelphia
 the rich prepare

 to serve, to fault. The language is a game as well,
 in which love can mean nothing,

 doubletalk mean lie. I'm saying
 doubletalk with me. I'm saying

 go so far the customs are untold.
 Make nothing without words,

 and let me be
 the one you never hold.





Why Some Girls Love Horses
 

And then I thought, Can I have more
of this, would it be possible
for every day to be a greater awakening: more light,
more light, your face on the pillow
with the sleep creases rudely
fragmenting it, hair so stiff
from paint and sheet rock it feels
like the dirty short hank
of mane I used to grab on Dandy's neck
before he hauled me up and forward,
white flanks flecked green
with shit and the satin of his dander,
the livingness, the warmth
of all that blood just under the skin
and in the long, thick muscle of the neck--
He was smarter than most of the children
I went to school with. He knew
how to stand with just the crescent
of his hoof along a boot toe and press,
incrementally, his whole weight down. The pain
so surprising when it came,
its iron intention sheathed in stealth, the decisive
sudden twisting of his leg until the hoof
pinned one's foot completely to the ground,
we'd have to beat and beat him with a brush
to push him off, that hot
insistence with its large horse eye trained
deliberately on us, to watch--

Like us, he knew how to announce through violence
how he didn't hunger, didn't want
despite our practiced ministrations: too young
not to try to empathize
with this cunning: this thing
that was and was not human we must respect
for itself and not our imagination of it: I loved him because
I could not love him anymore
in the ways I'd taught myself,
watching the slim bodies of teenagers
guide their geldings in figure eights around the ring
as if they were one body, one fluid motion
of electric understanding I would never feel
working its way through fingers to the bit: this thing
had a name, a need, a personality; it possessed
an indifference that gave me
logic and a measure: I too might stop wanting
the hand placed on back or shoulder
and never feel the desired response.
I loved the horse for the pain it could imagine

and inflict on me, the sudden jerking
of head away from halter, the tentative nose
inspecting first before it might decide
to relent and eat. I loved
what was not slave or instinct, that when you turn to me
it is a choice, it is always a choice to imagine pleasure
might be blended, one warmth
bleeding into another as the future
bleeds into the past, more light, more light,
your hand against my shoulder, the image
of the one who taught me disobedience
is the first right of being alive.





Flowers from a New Love after the Divorce
 

Cut back the stems an inch to keep in bloom.
So instructs the florist's note
enclosed inside the flowers.
Who knew what was cut
could heal again, the green wounds close,
stitching themselves together?

It doesn't matter. The flowers, red
and white, will bloom awhile, then wither.
You sit in an unlit room and watch
the vase throw crystal shadows through the dark.
The flowers' colors are so lovely they're painful.
In a week, you'll have to throw them out.

It's only hope that makes you take out scissors,
separate each bloom and cut
where you last measured. Did you know
Venus was said to turn into a virgin
each time she bathed? She did it
as a mark of love. She did it

so as to please her lovers. Perhaps,
overwhelmed by pain,
she eventually stopped bathing
altogether. It doesn't matter. It's a pleasure
to feel the green nubs stripped, watch the stems
refresh under your blade. They're here

because they're beautiful. They glow
inside your crystal vase. And yet
the flowers by themselves are nothing:
only a refraction of color that,
in a week or two, will be thrown out.
Day by day, the water lowers. The red-

and-white heads droop, blacken at the stems. 
It doesn't matter. Even cut stems heal. 
But what is the point of pain if it heals? 
Some things should last forever, instructs 
the florist's note. Pleasure, 
says one god. Shame, says another.

Venus heads, they call these flowers. 
In a week or two, you'll lose the note, 
have to call the florist up. 
With sympathy, you'll think he says. 
Perhaps: With love. It doesn't matter. 
You've stopped bathing. Alone,

you sit before the crystal
vase refracting you in pieces
through the dark. You watch
the pale skin bloom inside it, wither.
You petal, inch by inch.
You turn red and white together.





Happiness
 

I have been taught never to brag but now
I cannot help it: I keep
a beautiful garden, all abundance,
indiscriminate, pulling itself
from the stubborn earth: does it offend you
to watch me working in it,
touching my hands to the greening tips or
tearing the yellow stalks back, so wild
the living and the dead both
snap off in my hands?
The neighbor with his stuttering
fingers, the neighbor with his broken
love: each comes up my drive
to receive his pitying,
accustomed consolations, watches me
work in silence awhile, rises in anger,
walks back. Does it offend them to watch me
not mourning with them but working
fitfully, fruitlessly, working
the way the bees work, which is to say
by instinct alone, which looks like pleasure?
I can stand for hours among the sweet
narcissus, silent as a point of bone.
I can wait longer than sadness. I can wait longer
than your grief. It is such a small thing
to be proud of, a garden. Today
there were scrub jays, quail,
a woodpecker knocking at the white-
and-black shapes of trees, and someone's lost rabbit
scratching under the barberry: is it
indiscriminate? Should it shrink back, wither,
and expurgate? Should I, too, not be loved?
It is only a little time, a little space.
Why not watch the grasses take up their colors in a rush
like a stream of kerosene being lit?
If I could not have made this garden beautiful
I wouldn't understand your suffering,
nor care for each the same, inflamed way.
I would have to stay only like the bees,
beyond consciousness, beyond
self-reproach, fingers dug down hard
into stone, and growing nothing.
There is no end to ego,
with its museum of disappointments.
I want to take my neighbors into the garden
and show them: Here is consolation.
Here is your pity. Look how much seed it drops
around the sparrows as they fight.
It lives alongside their misery.
It glows each evening with a violent light.





[When the bed is empty . . .]
 

When the bed is empty, we pull the shades to block light,
light of resemblance to remembery, long light of waiting, 
an impatience in the glows of it. The here of the now and the glow 
that days make in the room, without the body but with the stench 
of it. So we say, vacancy and abject,against the was, against 
a philosophy of once and then not. Not-being against. 
A child once grew here. As lines on a wall. As 
growing without knowing what would one day not be. A 
gnawing grows. Grew and was. Protection is curled. Motion-
less. I envy her in her room. Hers with paint and dolls and hand-
prints. Great green and glowing under blankets with a hand 
that nurtures the heart of the mouth, purrs into mouth, loves 
the heart. Heart beating within another--blushing blood-- 
God, the beating, lit, and doing what it does.





Basal Cell
 

The sun is still burning in my skin
 even though it set half-an-hour ago,
 and Cindy and Bob and Bev and John
 are pulling on their sweatshirts
 and gathering around the fire pit.

 John hands me a cold one
 and now Bev comes into my arms
 and I can feel the sun's heat,
 and taste the Pacific on her cheek.

 I am not in Vietnam,
 nor is John or Bob, because
 our deferments came through,
 and we get to remain boys
 for at least another summer
 like this one in Santa Cruz,
 surfing the afternoons in a sweet
 blue dream I'm remembering now,

 as the nurse puts my cheek to sleep,
 and the doctor begins to burn
 those summers away.





The White House
 

He knows how to do what he sets out to do
                                                       with perfectly obvious procedure. The sea
                                                       is dark and forbidding. The horizon
                                                       is dark and forbidding.
 
Even from a distance, the less said the better. The colors in some of these landscapes
                                                       are perfectly desperate.
 
In a portrait there is never anything wrong
                                                      with the mouth. There is never anything wrong
                                                      with anything. Machines are not choosers.
                                                      The next best things are certain. Heaven
                                                      knowing the next best things. The young
                                                      can explain it, but who would they explain
                                                      it to? More promise than performance
                                                      as all sorts of things begin to interfere.
 
An energetic hostess seated me at the counter
                                                      next to a beautiful woman. It is possible
                                                      the timid portion of the population
                                                      unless held firmly in check will imitate
                                                      the silliness of timid people of years ago.
 
Supplication is valued. As soon as I learned the facts I gave up
                                                      on the exchange. She wanted something
                                                      mysterious, as if everything were the same.
 
Life changes and so-called truth changes with it. The businesslike
                                                      haste of the surgeon as he scolds the public.
                                                      To look at him and the thing he can never look at
                                                      shudderingly as the blood is drawn
                                                      is the duty of every patriot.
 
In a constructive age such as this I should have neglected everything
                                                      for the supreme duty of aiding
                                                      in the reconstruction.
 
I took my courage, which starts everywhere and goes
                                                      nowhere, and spoke to her. Here
                                                      one can unquestionably infer the inside
                                                      from the outside.
 
The leaders of the free world, assembled as if by magic,
                                                      seem to have the enemy at their mercy.
                                                      It can be argued that Christ himself spoke
                                                      to the mob. The crowd will stop
                                                      to see almost anything. The crowd will stop
                                                      to see something about almost everything.
   





National Account
 

How do you recognize a lovely place?
The rotten anthropology of superheroes
hovers above the conference table, exhausted
on the idea of dazzling people. A plugged
organization of the moon like a turnpike
undecorated by barely legal children --
true stories end in the moody doctor city
but I always say the wrong thing. Away
from Las Vegas I spend too much time
at the whale facility. I'm bored with awakening
into historical X-rays
of the NO MOMENT. (What showmanship!)
Who does wear a cape underwater?
Now Egypt is miniaturized and it may never rain
again. Hurling bodies and collapsing lungs
used to be honestly scripted activities --
the stillness in the dream of important history.
From now on your stillness will be happening.
In the actual dream remember how the children
were modified, the sputtering, Russel Crotty language?
Friendly Calliope is no longer remedial
in the crisply American landscape. Even snowy
Vermont grows opaque, a diminished suggestion
in the desert mirror. I feel as if I'm speaking to a dear friend
but I'm saying the wrong things. I don't like cockfights
or you'd rather be my daughter, deeply, authentically
factualizing our especially Southern roots.





Penguin
 

Have you seen, have you seen magic shadows? -- Fleetwood Mac, "Nightwatch
My fugues have no apparent relation to past trauma of any kind.
When it came time to rehearse we decided to get glamorous.
We get all done-up for rehearsal. Gradually, imperceptibly, things begin
slipping back into their normal place. My body is slowly rotating
into its proper north-south orientation. My playing is flawless
as it turns out. The audience goes nuts
but what was it all about?
Had I longer to see the aspects and facets of the family,
which as we know are not always tickety-boo but I have drifted away
like a wide-winged bird over many things that are meaningless,
yet my mind is clicking away quite properly on other levels.
I was never in it for the money, but I see where it goes
without ever touching it.
 
It was like a honeymoon -- nothing made sense, sounding utterly
convincing to my own ears -- selfness in training, needing a month of good sleep.
When I woke I saw the sunlight streaming in across the ceiling and thought
oh boy, we were awful yesterday, the obvious response being
to phone the boss and tell him you're sick and go to bed until it's passed,
except Boss is in bed too.
Don't let the lack of his spirit blind your life.
You would expect me to tell you, wouldn't you, if our positions were reversed,
while I look for a suitable shirt, but you
don't have any more to accomplish, nothing at all.
Did you ever love me? Could I grit my teeth
and carry it all off without anyone being the wiser?
 
Any words that have concrete meanings are fine
and completely friendly. The whole history of the human race
is somewhat sad, wouldn't you say, if you look at it
in a certain way? But then, if you squint a bit differently
it isn't sad at all.
 
There were times we were all hurting really bad,
thinking the bed will win. Maybe it was the beginnings of trademark --
if we stayed telepathic we couldn't do that -- surprise, surprise,
and that's how we decided to do the dance
and that's how The Dance came about.
There was a large, grassy clearing in the forest,
the trees around it thick and tall and there was sunlight
on the grass. We knew that people were worshipping
and the way they did it was to gather around a place like this
and allow themselves to become a part of it, greeting it
and letting it greet them feeding their bodies to their souls,
the pity of the tribe was how we imagined it,
seeing behind closed eyelids a lovely scene,
looking down from an open balcony into a central courtyard.
We were in a place that appeared to consist of baskets of flowers.
 
I could see only the top of his brown hair and his moving hands.
There's a lot of color. It's more noticeable than usual -- I mean
there are little prisms, rainbows everywhere
but whether it was guitar or piano I couldn't tell you -- this is
pre-Lindsey. The back room was vicious, everyone on a different drug.
If you turned your back you'd better keep on walking.
We did this every night, playing country rock at the height of glitter,
mixed-bag material. We needed theoretical problems!
My back to him, I said, "You mean us poor, sad little cast-offs,
wouldn't it be nice if we could cheer each other up
so our miser wouldn't cast a pall
on the happiness of the Prince and Princess?
Only I'm foreshadowing with picky surfaces.
The morals are contemporary -- argument
of sounds, accomodation, implosion, but still
the ineffable grace of seeming perishable --
the ordinariness of making love and hearing music.
 
I'm okay by myself, believe me.
It's a thought that gives rise to immense self-compassion. Okay,
I'll deal with this.
I kind of went on the skids.
It was just the four of us finally starting to crank it out, faster
and faster, until it was too fast.
Then one day, it was a Friday, always payday and I was in the bedroom
beginning to sort out what I thought of as my shitpile,
a collection of such things as dresses, belts, stockings, photographs,
 and old magazines all waiting to be put where they belong.





Topeka, Topeka
 

Topeka, half the moon is rotten with shadows pooling in the Sea of Topeka.
Topeka, where first I wet my brain with a 40oz bottle of Topeka.
Topeka, is place name, is damn shame, is a mirror made of sand & Topeka.
Topeka, you are substandard. I am not. Yet I'm the one on my hands & knees, searching for the lost keys in the prairie grass, ripped on acid, loving the fallacy that the black keys equal melancholy, the black keys being Topeka.
Topeka, miscast capital, you're no more political than a handshake with your dream-self upon waking, in my case dream-self lives & dies in Topeka.
Topeka, the sickness cannot be cured of Topeka.
Topeka, tigers laze about the yards, a man with a box balanced on his head, his possessions stuffed to brimming, trots down Topeka Ave.
Topeka, the sickness will go unnoticed. The vaccine is composed of rare sentiments, the kind that love & hate with equal abandon, love & hate, love & hate, love & hate. Topeka.
Topeka, there was a night when the moon didn't appear but it appeared everywhere else in the world, what happened that night? Topeka?
Topeka, I fear for your life, the intersection of 29th & California is a portal to Hell. I died there twenty times in my youth. Today, driving through, I toss a bouquet of roses to mark my third death, the one that had a soundtrack I can't shake free. My sister sings it from the shower every morning. Forecast calls for occasional showers, with the possibility of late-morning sleet, in Topeka.
Topeka, cast off the reliquaries! Call your men to war! Me?  I'll be tugging one last hit from the bong I fashioned out of the shrapnel of Topeka.
Topeka, pop. rarely exceeds one, as in each trip home happens in rewind, stepping back across the creek, bird in hand throwing up the worm, further back, unbreaking  its wing, bird flying off as if resurrected but from among the living, there I am, eight years old, seven, six, now a slug of semen sucked back into my father, now, as the waters roll back across the plains toward the river, a dog coughs up water, lifts its head, sees nothing, puts its head back down, this, Topeka, is your history, although it never happened.





With Delicate Hand
 

Never instead put the bales in the bounty,
resize the type to provide ALLURE.
Look how the picture seems to tell a story.
 
Mother, I'm all dolled up in HOPE.
My breastplate hinge needs a little oil,
I'm hobbling along to kick your crutch.
 
Mother, I'm all doped up with DESIRE.
I've cleaned the machine with delicate
hand, scrubbed the data within an inch of its life.
 
Mother, I'm all diary today, feeling PENSIVE.
The returns keep disappearing, I can't get my hands
around even one. I keep clicking through
 
the channels, the links, little vortex
displays all the characteristics of a MOTIVE,
Mother, but someone's just reported
 
that the election has been made OFFICIAL.
The results seem promising. In one version
you get to keep the crown. The twin diamonds
 
sparkling your eyes sparkle harder, the LIGHT
takes on a decadence like that of old snow.
In the other, your garland consumes itself,
 
your hair falls out like nuclear, your elisions
lisp the windows shut, breaking the view 
in half. Your face becomes but a VAGARY
 
 and there are no backups in storage. I AM 
 a cosmos if I am still breathing. Wind breaks 
 at my neck and spells your name acrostically.
  
Spells your name like my BELOVED. Repetition
of facts and figures keeps me apprised. Dogs
mass in the streets, shaking bones, slurping scrap
 
lifted from the MALFEASANCE of silver plates
hung to dry from row house clotheslines,
the tread's worn down on the spires sagging
 
from the GLORIOUS peaks of this great sky!
Can you hear the clicking through the air vents?
Did you notice the picture twitch on the bedroom wall?
 
Leaves turn pink and blue, SUPERNATURAL
is not dead, is rippling through me, I can feel
my toes, I can see you staring at my nape,
 
I can see you vivid in the dark corner of the day,
taking your damask gown off one strap
at a time, as if I were watching. I have a MANDATE.
 
Nobody else would bother to see you this way.





The Joy of Solipsism
 

Bring the oncoming train into focus.
Tell me your theory of the market.
Pupils dilate, trees fall,
I practice transference in my downtime.
Think of my mother watering
plants. Is
everybody really watching?
Blog me. Add to my Wiki entry.
Date me. Reply to my electronic flirt.
My mother told me she'd nominate
me for that award, if she could bear
the proxy. Show me your tits.
I shaved my balls. I took out
a second mortgage. Motherhood
frightens the elms, carves its sorry
initials into the sky's prolapsed anus.
Each sadness passes through
me like a gallstone. My valve leaks
an amniotic canopy over the
bar I'm fragging. I'm a fragment,
a tender button. I saw my first
beetle in the periphery. Lake Shore
Drive against the ruins, the stain
of lake-effect snow a special effect,
the only weather
exhibiting any real affect.





Girl Sleuth
 

A brenda is missing--where is she?
Summon the seeds & weeds, the desert whooshes. Phone the finch
with the crowded beak;   a little pretenda
                is learning to read
in the afternoon near the cactus caves. Near oleander & pulpy
caves with the click-click of the wren & the shkrrrr of the thrasher,
               a skinny pretenda is learning
to read till the missing brenda
               is found. Drip of syllables like olives near the saguaro.
Nancy Drew will find the secret in raincoats & wednesdays
              & sticks. Nancy whose spine is yellow
              or blue will find the brenda in 1962,
Nancy                   who has no mother,
              who takes suggestions from her father & ignores them.
 
Gleam goes the wren ignoring the thorn. They cannot tell the difference.
Click of the smart dog's nails on linoleum.
                                 Nancy bends over the clues,
of brenda's locket & dress. Word by word
               between syllables a clue. Where has the summer gone, the autumn--
are they missing too? Maybe Nancy
                will parse the secret & read the book report on Nancy Drew:
"neat pretty sly cute. Syllable by syllable
                 & still no brenda!   Nancy 
 puts her hand to her forehead; is the missing 
 girl in the iron bird? is the clue to the girl in the locket?





Partita for Sparrows
 

We bury the sparrows of Europe
with found instruments,
their breasts light as an ounce of tea
where we had seen them off the path,
their twin speeds of shyness & notched wings
near the pawnbroker's house by the canal,
in average neighborhoods of the resisters,
or in markets of princely delphinium & flax,
flying from awnings at unmarked rates
to fetch crumbs from our table half-spinning
back to clefs of griilwork on external stairs
we would descend much later;
 
in rainy neighborhoods of the resisters
where streets were taken one by one,
where consciousness is a stair or path,
we mark their domains with notched sticks
of hickory or chestnut or ash
because our cities of princely pallor
should not have unmarked graves.
Lyric work, flight of arch, death bridge
to which patterned being is parallel:
they came as if from the margins
of a painting, their average hearts half-spinning
 our little hourglass up on the screen.





Glacial Erratics
 

The last ice age had been caused by a wobble.
After it passed they made houses from stars;
 
Visitors would peer in
And see the tongs not slipping,


Roomsized pebbles having been moved far.
 
It's like this more
When we speak than when we write;
 
Loving thus we have been
Loved by ground,
 
The word being
A box with four of its corners hidden;
 
Everything else is round.
  
   





Franciscan Complex
 

Each day the job gets up
And rubs its eyes
 
We are going to live on in dry amazement
 
Workers push the granite bed under the avenue
 
Bed of the married
The re-          the pre-married
 
Making a form as forms become infinite
 
The scrapings       scraping
 
Graywhacke    chert
 
People wait for their bumpy little pizzas
Theories of theories in gravity voices
 
Melpomene goddess of tragedy bathes
 
Mostly the bride never the bridesmaid
 
Angel food in whole foods
 
Consider Tanguy whose lunar responses to childhood
Made everything a horizon
 
Those walking upside down don't know what to think
 
The finch engineering itself to deep spring
 
Or you        life       tired of being cured
 
How many layers
Of giving up are there
 
One of it
 
Two of everything in the arc you save





Summer Garden
 

~~ & thus you entered
 
a forest of solitudes
 
where in this great
 
sense your life had
 
been pursued, till like
 
a shadow breaking off
 
a rising body, a
 
need hovered & grew.
 
Some lined feature of
 
another fate strives to
 
be met, sits low
 
& upright. Those qualities
 
which had been energy
 
or grace past pain
 
wove from the nerves
 
a nest or instinct.
 
Your calms are interesting.
 
Write to us during
 
this terrible government. A
 
universe coughs blue &
 
draws a twiceness from
 
the mitred now, while
 
your garden hand spells
 
the inexhaustible forms~~
 
 

 
 
 FOR  ELIZABETH   ROBINSON





Statueless Architecture
 

I passed through nature
 
into the next. Children
 
running in unsupervised shadows.
 
Last century's fountains learning
 
not to lie. Risk
 
to identify with only
 
one element since one
 
will die but in
 
the summer air around
 
each thought, something is
 
built and avoided. You
 
go through an arch
 
and aren't the arch,
 
just infinity of form,
 
curve's curve of becoming,
 
a phrase tracking it
 
to future's celadon relief.
 
As others dressed as
 
others we were supposed
 
to meet. Citizens walked
 
here without disappointment, seeing
 
no statue or palace
 
with eleven axes, patient
 
in the mindless heat--





Poem Without an End
 

Inside the brand-new museum
there's an old synagogue.
Inside the synagogue
is me.
Inside me
my heart.
Inside my heart
a museum.
Inside the museum
a synagogue,
inside it
me,
inside me
my heart,
inside my heart
a museum


 





Pantoum
 

If there is a word in the lexicon of love, 
it will not declare itself. 
The nature of words is to fail 
men who fall in love with men.

It will not declare itself,
the perfect word. Boyfriend seems ridiculous:
men who fall in love with men
deserve something a bit more formal.

The perfect word? Boyfriend? Ridiculous. 
But partner is . . . businesslike-- 
we deserve something a bit less formal, 
much more in love with love.

But if partner is businesslike,
then lover suggests only sex,
is too much in love with love.
There is life outside of the bedroom,

and lover suggests only sex. 
We are left with roommate, or friend. 
There is life, but outside of the bedroom. 
My friend and I rarely speak of one another.

To my left is my roommate, my friend. 
If there is a word in the lexicon of love,
my friend and I rarely speak it of one another.
The nature of words is to fail.





Effort at Speech Between Two People
 


:  Speak to me.          Take my hand.            What are you now?
   I will tell you all.          I will conceal nothing.
   When I was three, a little child read a story about a rabbit
   who died, in the story, and I crawled under a chair    :
   a pink rabbit    :    it was my birthday, and a candle
   burnt a sore spot on my finger, and I was told to be happy.

:  Oh, grow to know me.        I am not happy.        I will be open:
   Now I am thinking of white sails against a sky like music,
   like glad horns blowing, and birds tilting, and an arm about me.
   There was one I loved, who wanted to live, sailing.

:  Speak to me.        Take my hand.        What are you now?
   When I was nine, I was fruitily sentimental,
   fluid    :    and my widowed aunt played Chopin,
   and I bent my head on the painted woodwork, and wept.
   I want now to be close to you.        I would
   link the minutes of my days close, somehow, to your days.

:  I am not happy.          I will be open.
   I have liked lamps in evening corners, and quiet poems.
   There has been fear in my life.          Sometimes I speculate
   On what a tragedy his life was, really.

:  Take my hand.          Fist my mind in your hand.          What are you now?
   When I was fourteen, I had dreams of suicide,
   and I stood at a steep window, at sunset, hoping toward death   :
   if the light had not melted coulds and plains to beauty,
   if light had not transformed that day, I would have leapt.
   I am unhappy.          I am lonely.          Speak to me.

:  I will be open.          I think he never loved me:
   He loved the bright beaches, the little lips of foam
   that ride small waves, he loved the veer of gulls:
   he said with a gay mouth: I love you.          Grow to know me.

:  What are you now?          If we could touch one another,
   if these our separate entities could come to grips,
   clenched like a Chinese puzzle . . . yesterday
   I stood in a crowded street that was live with people,
   and no one spoke a word, and the morning shone.
   Everyone silent, moving. . . . Take my hand.          Speak to me.





The Speed of Darkness
 

                             I

Whoever despises the clitoris despises the penis 
Whoever despises the penis despises the cunt 
Whoever despises the cunt despises the life of the child.

Resurrection music,        silence,        and surf.


                             II

No longer speaking 
Listening with the whole body 
And with every drop of blood 
Overtaken by silence

But this same silence is become speech 
With the speed of darkness.


                             III

Stillness during war, the lake.
The unmoving spruces.
Glints over the water.
Faces, voices.        You are far away.
A tree that trembles.

I am the tree that trembles and trembles.


                             IV

After the lifting of the mist
after the lift of the heavy rains
the sky stands clear
and the cries of the city risen in day
I remember the buildings are space
walled, to let space be used for living
I mind this room is space
this drinking glass is space
whose boundary of glass
lets me give you drink and space to drink
your hand, my hand being space
containing skies and constellations
your face
carries the reaches of air
I know I am space
my words are air.


                              V

Between        between
the man : act        exact
woman : in curve        senses in their maze
frail orbits, green tries,           games of stars
shape of the body speaking its evidence


                               VI

I look across at the real
vulnerable        involved        naked
devoted to the present of all I care for
the world of its history leading to this moment.


                              VII

Life the announcer.
I assure you
there are many ways to have a child.
I bastard mother
promise you
there are many ways to be born.
They all come forth
in their own grace.


                              VIII

Ends of the earth join tonight
with blazing stars upon their meeting.
These sons,        these sons 
fall burning into Asia.


                               IX

Time comes into it.
Say it.        Say it.
The universe is made of stories, 
not of atoms.


                                X

Lying
blazing beside me
you rear beautifully and up--
your thinking face--
erotic body reaching
in all its colors and lights--
your erotic face
colored and lit--
not colored body-and-face
but now entire,
colors       lights       the world thinking and reaching.


                               XI 

The river flows past the city.

Water goes down to tomorrow
making its children        I hear their unborn voices
I am working out the vocabulary of my silence.


                             XII

Big-boned man young and of my dream 
Struggles to get the live bird out of his throat. 
I am he am I?        Dreaming? 
I am the bird am I?        I am the throat?

A bird with a curved beak.
It could slit anything, the throat-bird.
Drawn up slowly.        The curved blades, not large.
Bird emerges        wet        being born
Begins to sing.


                             XIII

My night awake
staring at the broad rough jewel
the copper roof across the way
thinking of the poet
yet unborn in this dark
who will be the throat of these hours. 
No.        Of those hours. 
Who will speak these days, 
if not I, 
if not you?





Violent Rooms
 

1. 
 
The contours of the girl blur. She is both becoming and fact.
A rancor defines the split. Rip into. Flatten the depth of voice. That
 
urgent flex peels off the steady layers. A girl, I say.
Girl. Gu-erl. Quell. He. He--unbuttons before emergence.
 
As in yard rake pressed to roof of mouth. A fragrant rod.
Suh--sssuh--ssuck. Insistence. Lips go lisp. Our brutish boy.
 
Having not ever been whole. Or simple. Or young. Just split and open.
Not of it. For it. Born a cog of hard wheel at five, six, seven . . .
 
What to know of what has never been?
 


2.  

No common place would do: bar stool, front porch, sea rock.
Such a room should crawl into the soul. Stretch it. Contort it.
 
Could be the straddle of this stranger at the neck. I am this. 
She does not waver. She is twenty-five. The bed is wet. As many
 
as had done this thing before. The wound is rupture. Blood-faced.
Between sailing and anchor. No, between shipwreck and burial.
 
What does the mouth do? It does not mean no, saying no.
It does not mean yes. It gurgles. It swells. It is comfort.
 
 A quick kick. Mighty, mighty.





Desdichada
 

I. 

For that you never acknowledged me, I acknowledge
the spring's yellow detail, the every drop of rain,
the anonymous unacknowledged men and women. 
The shine as it glitters in our child's wild eyes, 
one o'clock at night.       This river, this city, 
the years of the shadow on the delicate skin 
of my hand, moving in time. 
Disinherited, annulled, finally disacknowledged 
and all of my own asking.        I keep that wild dimension 
of life and making and the spasm 
upon my mouth as I say this word of acknowledge
to you forever.        Ewig.        Two o'clock at night.



II. 

While this my day and my people are a country not yet born 
it has become an earth I can 
acknowledge.       I must.        I know what the 
disacknowledgment does.        Then I do take you, 
but far under consciousness, knowing 
that under under flows a river wanting 
the other :  to go open-handed in Asia, 
to cleanse the tributaries and the air, to make for making, 
to stop selling death and its trash, pour plastic down men's throats,
to let this child find, to let men and women find, 
knowing the seeds in us all.        They do say Find. 
I cannot acknowledge it entire.        But I will. 
A beginning, this moment, perhaps, and you.



III.

Death flowing down past me, past me, death
marvelous, filthy, gold,
in my spine in my sex upon my broken mouth
and the whole beautiful mouth of the child;
shedding power over me
death
if I acknowledge him.
Leading me
in my own body
at last in the dance.





Litany
 

Tom, will you let me love you in your restaurant?
I will let you make me a sandwich of your invention and I will eat it and call 
it a carolyn sandwich. Then you will kiss my lips and taste the mayonnaise and 
that is how you shall love me in my restaurant

Tom, will you come to my empty beige apartment and help me set up my daybed?
Yes, and I will put the screws in loosely so that when we move on it, later, 
it will rock like a cradle and then you will know you are my baby

Tom, I am sitting on my dirt bike on the deck. Will you come out from the kitchen
and watch the people with me?
Yes, and then we will race to your bedroom. I will win and we will tangle up 
on your comforter while the sweat rains from our stomachs and foreheads

Tom, the stars are sitting in tonight like gumball gems in a little girl's 
jewelry box. Later can we walk to the duck pond?
Yes, and we can even go the long way past the jungle gym. I will push you on 
the swing, but promise me you'll hold tight. If you fall I might disappear

Tom, can we make a baby together? I want to be a big pregnant woman with a 
loved face and give you a squalling red daughter. 
No, but I will come inside you and you will be my daughter

Tom, will you stay the night with me and sleep so close that we are one person? 
No, but I will lie down on your sheets and taste you. There will be feathers 
of you on my tongue and then I will never forget you

Tom, when we are in line at the convenience store can I put my hands in your 
back pockets and my lips and nose in your baseball shirt and feel the crook 
of your shoulder blade? 
No, but later you can lie against me and almost touch me and when I go I will 
leave my shirt for you to sleep in so that always at night you will be pressed 
up against the thought of me

Tom, if I weep and want to wait until you need me will you promise that someday 
you will need me?
No, but I will sit in silence while you rage, you can knock the chairs down 
any mountain. I will always be the same and you will always wait

Tom, will you climb on top of the dumpster and steal the sun for me? It's just 
hanging there and I want it. 
No, it will burn my fingers. No one can have the sun: it's on loan from God. 
But I will draw a picture of it and send it to you from Richmond and then you 
can smooth out the paper and you will have a piece of me as well as the sun

Tom, it's so hot here, and I think I'm being born. Will you come back from
Richmond and baptise me with sex and cool water?
I will come back from Richmond. I will smooth the damp spiky hairs from the 
back of your neck and then I will lick the salt off it. Then I will leave

Tom, Richmond is so far away. How will I know how you love me? 
I have left you. That is how you will know





Providence
 

What's left is footage: the hours before
             Camille, 1969--hurricane
                         parties, palm trees leaning
in the wind,
            fronds blown back,

a woman's hair. Then after:
            the vacant lots,
            boats washed ashore, a swamp

where graves had been. I recall

how we huddled all night in our small house,
            moving between rooms,
                        emptying pots filled with rain.

The next day, our house--
           on its cinderblocks--seemed to float

           in the flooded yard: no foundation

beneath us, nothing I could see
                          tying us                      to the land.
                          In the water, our reflection
                                                               trembled,
disappeared
when I bent to touch it.





Yellow Goblins
 

Yellow goblins
and a god I can swallow:

Eyes in the evergreens
under ice.

Interior monologue
and some voice.

Weary fears, the
usual trials and

a place to surmise
blessedness.

My father fought in this war, thus I can speak of it.

We kiss on lips, where the tenses attach.

We enter the conundrum 
of another's becoming.

We look for someone who can raise us 
up again to feet, or near to standing.

We tend in our terrors to forget (we 
do not store them) felicities.

I try each day to stay near beings, 
mornings when I am most 
mild. And may I nothing harm, 
in case it is them.





Lenten Song
 

That the dead are real to us
Cannot be denied, 
That the living are more real

When they are dead
Terrifies, that the dead can rise
As the living do is possible

Is possible to surmise, 
But all the stars cannot come near
All we meet in an eye.

Flee from me, fear, as soot
Flies in a breeze, do not burn 
Or settle in my sight, 

I've tasted you long enough,
Let me savor
Something otherwise.

Who wakes beside me now
Suits my soul, so I turn to words
Only to say he changes

Into his robe, rustles a page,
He raises the lid of the piano
To release what's born in its cage.

If words come back 
To say they compromise 
Or swear again they have died,

There's no news in that, I reply,
But a music without notes
These notes comprise, still

As spring beneath us lies, 
Already something otherwise.





Ancestry
 

The damp had got its grip years ago
but gone unnoticed. The heads of the joists
feathered slowly in the cavity wall
and the room's wet belly had begun to bow.

Once we'd ripped the boards up, it all came out:
the smell, at first, then the crumbling wood
gone to seed, all its muscles wasted.
You pottered back and to with tea, soda bread,

eighty years shaking on a plastic tray.
One by one we looked up, nodded, then slipped
under the floor. We moved down there like fish
in moonlight, or divers round an old ship.





I
 

When did I learn the word "I?
What a mistake. For some,
     it may be a placeholder,
     for me it's a contagion.
For some, it's a thin line, a bare wisp,
     just enough to be somewhere
     among the gorgeous troublesome you's.
For me, it's a thorn, a spike, its slimness
     a deceit, camouflaged like a stick insect:
     touch it and it becomes what it is:
ravenous slit, vertical cut, little boy
     standing upright in his white
     communion suit and black secret.












Self-Help
 

What kind of delusion are you under?
The life he hid just knocked you flat.
You see the lightning but not the thunder.

What God hath joined let no man put asunder.
Did God know you'd marry a rat?
What kind of delusion are you under?

His online persona simply stunned her
as it did you when you started to chat.
You see the lightning but not the thunder.

To the victors go the plunder:
you should crown them with a baseball bat.
What kind of delusion are you under?

The kind that causes blunder after blunder.
Is there any other kind than that?
You see the lightning but not the thunder,

and for one second the world's a wonder.
Just keep it thrilling under your hat.
What kind of delusion are you under?
You see the lightning but not the thunder.





A Thank-You Note
 

For John Skoyles
My daughter made drawings with the pens you sent,
line drawings that suggest the things they represent,
different from any drawings she--at ten--had done,
closer to real art, implying what the mind fills in.
For her mother she made a flower fragile on its stem;
for me, a lion, calm, contained, but not a handsome one.
She drew a lion for me once before, on a get-well card,
and wrote I must be brave even when it's hard.

Such love is healing--as you know, my friend,
especially when it comes unbidden from our children
despite the flaws they see so vividly in us.
Who can love you as your child does?
Your son so ill, the brutal chemo, his looming loss
owning you now--yet you would be this generous
to think of my child. With the pens you sent
she has made I hope a healing instrument.





On First Seeing a U.S. Forest Service Aerial Photo of Where I Live
 

All those poems I wrote
About living in the sky
Were wrong. I live on a leaf
Of a fern of frost growing
Up your bedroom window
In forty below.

I live on a needle of a branch
Of a cedar tree, hard-bitten,
Striving in six directions,
Rooted in rock, a cedar
Tree made of other trees,
Not cedar but fir,

Lodgepole, and blue spruce,
Metastasizing like
Bacteria to the fan-
Lip of a draw to draw
Water as soon as it slips
From the snowdrift's grip

And flows downward from
Branch to root--a tree
Running in reverse.
Or I live on a thorn on a trellis--
Trained, restrained, maybe
Cut back, to hold up

Those flowers I've only heard of
To whatever there is and isn't
Above.





Roadside Ditch Natura Morta
 

No one can draw fast enough
To capture the cut
Iris before its form falls
From its former self.
But when we passed a patch
In the ditch,
She told me to stop and she stepped
Down, opening her clasp
Knife. She spared one iris
With an impressionistic
Cocoon on its stem
And cut the flower beside it.
Once home
She rendered in a careful hurry.
She drew into the night as the iris died.
I woke grafted to her
In a vague, translucent hammock of dread.





Allegory
 

1



In the Forest of Wearisome Sadness,
Where one day I found myself wandering alone,
I met my heart, who called to me, asking me where I was going.

The path was long and straight, row after row of conifers receding
To a horizon that because of the geometry
Seemed farther than it really was,
Like the door at the top of a staircase in Versailles.

But as if the forest's maker had been offended by elegance,
A pile of rocks disrupted the rows: the forest once
Had been a field. I remember that field. 

I was carried there by my father, beside him 
My grandfather, who planted the trees. 
Until they were tall enough to survive,
He mowed the field, piling up rocks, taking down brush with a scythe.

How, since I've known the forest almost since birth, could I have been lost?
Why, since the forest is beautiful, is it not a place of delight? 

Repeatedly I asked these questions of my heart, 
But like a good physician, he elected 
To keep silent, leaving me to answer for myself.

Late at night, when I'm lying in bed and cannot sleep,
My heart reads to me from the Romance of Pleasant Thought. 
Always I've heard the story before, and typically, 
Since the stories are true, I am their hero.

I'm riding my tricycle on the sidewalk near the house where I was born.
Because I am unsupervised, I indulge in what seems at the moment 
A daring wish: I ride the tricycle beneath a sprinkler.

Immediately I am overcome with remorse.
The evidence of my trespass is everywhere to be seen,
And for the first time in my life I contemplate a lie. 

Would my shirt dry faster if I stood in the sun, where it's hot,
Or in the shade, where cool breezes rustle the leaves?

In the version of this story that appears now
In the Romance of Pleasant Thought,
I admire not so much my ingenuity
As the evidence of my early devotion to empiricism,
The way I manage terror by examining how things work.

It's done, there's nothing more to say.
My heart is gone from me.
Because he has fallen in love
He has abandoned me.

It's pointless making myself uncomfortable over this
By being mournful or sad.
It's done, there's nothing more to say.
My heart is gone from me.

He does nothing but mock me.
When I tell him pitifully
That I cannot live on my own,
He does not listen.
It's done, there's nothing more to say.


After Charles d'Orleans

Imagine you've been in love forever, since before you were born.
You walk the field. At every third step
You scoop out a handful of wheat
From the seed bag, scattering it broadcast.
As the sun comes up, you're walking in a golden cloud.

Inside the cloud, time no longer exists.
Your back's not bent, your body is a boy's.

Outside, since it's time for wheat, the summer rains are finished.
Otherwise it's oats. Every third year it's clover.
You're tired of walking, of sowing, tired of being in love.

The advantage to people like you,
Though there are many disadvantages, is this:
When the earth no longer needs what you can grow

You plant hundreds, then thousands
Of seedlings, conifers, trees that bear no edible fruit.
You arrange them in rows, you tend them,
You're proud of them.
You make the field disappear.





The Exhibition Was Very Beautiful
 

The Traveler's Vade Mecum, line 907
The exhibition opened on a rainy Thursday, with cello suite. 
They hung the paintings to be viewed from both front and back. 
Luna moths flapped their great green sail-wings.
Stingrays flapped their great gray sail-wings. 
Those visiting the exhibition were encouraged to touch. 
Captions were available in Braille and audio. 
The exhibition tasted like cherries. 
A critic asked if the exhibition was a "facile juxtaposition of ideals.
The mother of the exhibition calls constantly and the father, never.
The exhibition has taken to pouring a little scotch in the coffee. 
When designing layout, remember 
it is crucial how a bias cut fits at the exhibition's hips
and foot traffic turns to the right, not the left. 
They hung the sculptures to be viewed from both above and below.
They painted the walls a shade of "eggshell, minus calcium.
The exhibition did not consider itself an exhibitionist
until the incident at the east window.
The exhibition is very sorry and will refund upon request.
Stingrays flapped their great gray sail-wings. 
Luna moths flapped their great green sail-wings.
No matter how short a trip, the exhibition packs two pairs of shoes. 
The exhibition never knows when it is coming home again.





Flour Is Firm
 

The Traveler's Vade Mecum, line 4234
Baking two parts flour to one part water 
could stop a bullet. So good soldiers 
carried their hardtack over their hearts. 
Break it down with a rifle butt, flood it, 
fry it in pig fat to make hellfire stew.
Gnaw it raw and praise the juice.

Does wheat prepare for this as it grows,
seeking the light in a half-thawed field?
Do stalks know their strength is merely 
in their number? What is ground down
we name flour in promise that it will be 
made useful. Otherwise, it's just dust. 

Sheet iron crackers. 
Teeth-dullers.
Would you call it starving, if a man dies
with hardtack still tucked in his pocket?
Can you call it food, if the bullet comes only
at the moment he gives in and swallows?





The Gift
 

When I got the box home from the gun shop, I let it sit on my kitchen table
in its wax wrapping for hours before I opened it.

Safe from the elements. Protected from rust
and more esoteric forms of corrosion.

My father gave me a rosewood chess set when I turned twelve.
I'd never felt so loved through and through, almost literally, as if I were transparent--

and it probably wasn't love, just a lucky, last-minute guess
at the toy store, which is probably what most love is, anyway.

I took the set into my room, shut the door,
determined to master every fork and zugzwang,

that strange position where you'd be safe
if only you didn't have to make a move.

Now I'd given myself a perfect gift. I imagined the gun at rest
in a velvet sack next to its dainty box of bullets. I wouldn't need many.

And no sequined wrapping paper could have been more beautiful
than the brown waxed sheet the clerk had unrolled

and cut along the steel edge in one long, smooth stroke.
When I finally slit through the layers to open it,

the paper was as delicate and rich as sheets of pastry
in baklava, with a mass of dark chocolate in the center.

I'd never touched a gun. I loved how perfectly its handle fit
my hand: centuries of engineering and design

coming together in the "unit, and I knew it would work.
Unlike toys, religious rituals, erotic techniques, and works of art,

I could depend on it. The only other device I own
that fulfills its function so well is my reading glasses,

and I used a soft gray cloth just like the one I clean them with
to wipe the oil from my fingertips

as I dropped the bullets one by one
into the somber chambers. I just need to know it's there,

like the extra purse I keep hidden in the closet
with a money clip and a neatly folded change of clothes.

I don't need a class in safety or marksmanship.
If I ever use it, it will be at close range.

It may be the only way to get rid of the stranger inside.
It may be the only way

to get inside someone I love
when every other route has been systematically barred.





Catchy Tunes
 

It's not just this. Every written word is a suicide note.
And a love letter, too.

There may be no one to talk to who would get it,
but if you write it down maybe someone will get it after you've left the room,

or in five hundred years, or maybe someone from Sirius, the Dog Star,
will get it. The composer Karlheinz Stockhausen

claimed he was born on Sirius. You remember him:
the genius who said the crashing of planes

into the World Trade Center was the greatest concert ever held,
although he later conceded the audience had not been given the option

to not attend
and that somewhat diminished its perfection.

I heard Stockhausen interviewed at Davies Symphony Hall
before the orchestra played one of his works

that sounded to me like the voices of the parents
in A Charlie Brown Christmas if they'd been arguing about real estate.

No, I was not impressed by Karlheinz.
His daughter Christel was a flautist in the orchestra,

and she joined him for the interview
and said her father would take her and her brother out on the lawn

of their summer house outside Cologne
(this was years before he was on the cover of Sgt. Pepper)

and teach them to read each constellation
as notes on a stave and to sing

the words of their favorite nursery rhymes to the stars'
melody: "The dog ran away in the snow and

"Go get the sleigh in the cellar. It was a game
but it was hard: work and play at once.

Their father explained to them,
"God does not write catchy tunes.

You could tell she meant it to be a charming story,
but the audience sat in silence.

Suffer the little children.





The Delta
 

If you are going there by foot, prepare 
to get wet. You are not you anymore.

You are a girl standing in a pool 
of clouds as they catch fire in the distance.

There are laws of heaven and those of place
and those who see the sky in the water,

angels in ashes that are the delta's now. 
They say if you sweep the trash from your house

after dark, you sweep away your luck.
If you are going by foot, bring a stick,

a third leg, and honor the great disorder,
the great broom of waterfowl and songbirds.

Prepare to voodoo your way, best you can,
knowing there is a little water in things

you take for granted, a little charity
and squalor for the smallest forms of life. 

Voodoo was always mostly charity.
People forget. If you shake a tablecloth

outside at night, someone in your family
dies. There are laws we make thinking

it was us who made them. We are not us.
We are a floodplain by the Mississippi

that once poured slaves upriver to the fields.
We are a hurricane in the making.

We could use a magus who knows something
about suffering, who knows a delta's needs.

We understand if you want a widow 
to stay single, cut up her husband's shoes.

He is not himself anyway and walks
barefoot across a landscape that has no north.

Only a ghost tree here and there, a frog,
a cricket, a bird. And if the fates are kind,

a girl with a stick, who is more at home, 
being homeless, than you will ever be.





Double Vision
 

At Waffle House, they fired her on the spot:
"You talk too much! 
                                        She'd told her customers
That "made gets "mad and "poet goes to "pot
Without the letter e. The "amateurs,
She'd said, "inherit everything: the sand,
The stars, the world that only God possesses.

While washing dishes with a bleeding hand,
She'd told them, "through possession's' double esses'
There's a line that cleaves; things come apart;
Refrain' means both hold back' and go again';
Things join in wholes of which they are a part.

She "touched the people. Was it such a sin?
Her broken pencil left a double line
On my tab, both legible as one design.





Diluvian Dream
 

All afternoon I walk behind the mower,
Imagining, though paradoxically,
That even though the grass is getting lower,
What I have cut is like a rising sea;
The parts I haven't cut, with every pass,
Resemble real geography, a map,
A shrinking island continent of grass
Where shoreline vanishes with every lap.

At last, the noise and smell of gasoline
Dispel my dream. What sea? Peninsulas?
They were the lands my inner child had seen,
Their little Yucatns and Floridas.

But when I'm finished, and Yard goes back to Lawn,
I can't help thinking that a world is gone.





A Word
 

For A.B.
She said God. He seems to be there 
when I call on Him but calling
has been difficult too. Painful. 

And as she quieted to find 
another word, I was delivered 
once more to my own long grappling 

with that very angel here--still 
here--at the base of the ancient 
ladder of ascent, in foul dust

languishing yet at the very
bottom rung, letting go my grip 
long before the blessing.





Dawn at Saint Annas Skete
 

Agion Oros, 2006
The air is cool and is right thick with birdsong
as our bleary crew files out, of a sudden 
disinterred from three sepulchral hours of prayer
into an amber brilliance rioting
outside the cemetery chapel. With bits
of Greek and English intermixed, the monks
invite us to the portico for coffee, 
, a shot of cold .
As I say, the air is cool, animate 
and lit, and in such light the road already 
beckons, so I skip the coffee, pound the shot, 
and pocket two hard biscuits. And yes, the way 
is broad at first, but narrows soon enough.

Idiot Psalm 12
 

A psalm of Isaak, amid uncommon darkness
O Being both far distant and most near,
             O Lover embracing all unlovable, O Tender
             Tether binding us together, and binding, yea
             and tenderly, Your Person to ourselves,
Being both beyond our ken, and kindred, One
             whose dire energies invest such clay as ours
             with patent animation, O Secret One secreting 
             life anew into our every tissue moribund,
             afresh unto our stale and stalling craft, 
grant in this obscurity a little light.





Another Thing
 

Like fossil shells embedded in a stone,
you are an absence, rimmed calligraphy,
a mouthing out of silence, a way to see
beyond the bedroom where you lie alone.
So why not be the vast, antipodal cloud
you soloed under, riven by cold gales?
And why not be the song of diving whales,
why not the plosive surf below the road?

The others are one thing. They know they are.
One compass needle. They have found their way 
and navigate by perfect cynosure.
Go wreck yourself once more against the day
and wash up like a bottle on the shore,
lucidity and salt in all you say.





An Old One Walks
 

Snake walks with that old squiggly stick,
walks slow down by the waterfall,
from stone to stone down by the waterfall,
shuffling on his bare feet
while dancing on the edge of it.
Now shimmer that, now shimmer this,
while now just one,
an Old One steps the beat of it.
How may he walk with that old squirmy stick?
Soft, soft he goes,
and gathers sun.
Soft, soft he goes,
he has no bones.
Soft, soft he goes, 
and gathers wind.
About his neck, 
a bone flute hums the flux of it.
Something congeals and flows.
Snake says, just spirit matters.





The King and Seer
 

The King asks, "Tell me, what is the highest meaning of the holiest truths?
The Seer answers, "Emptiness, without holiness.

The King is a restless seeker.
The Seer is a ruler and thief.

I am seriously watching how trees are always missing some leaves.
They sweep the air looking for them. Nothing distracts them. Nothing.
Where leaves are missing between the branches, beautiful sun porches, 
which disappear when the tree reaches them.

"Who are you? the King asks.
"It is not like that, the Seer says.

The Seer leaves the King alone in his throne room
and starts walking to China, kicking up gravel,
hurrying to find the next king.

On the road between country houses, 
he stops to listen to trees digging the air for crickets.
He wonders whether the King is mad now like the trees,
or dancing and recounting the story without an end.





Pastorals in the Atrium
 

The tour has only started when
I'm ambushed by that flat-lined verdigris I'd know even
as a stumbling sleepwalker: landschap
with tin river, cleaver of sodden pastures--

marvelous for painters, 
says the docent, was the enormity
of the sky, rarely cloudless, and she's already 
turning to an Italian hillscape when I say wait! this is 

my bloodstream, as my finger makes brief
unintended contact with the canvas,
and then my voice an ambulance 
I tell her there should be a diagram 
to indicate the grazing motion, 
how the grinding molars of the Holsteins
make the river go--

or else, self-portrait 
in the glassing-over eye
of a stickleback caged in a jam jar, 
left too long in the sun--

but now the river is across the room because 
the docent has ushered me toward an upholstered bench
and is murmuring, sit, sit, I have here from the staff room
a coffee, here you are--

and I'm making the gesture for 
no, those fields I ate and was made of 
live in me, uncloseable 
parentheses





Lake Ontario Park
 

P.S. You will Do well to try to Innoculate the Indians by means of Blanketts, as well as to try Every other method that can serve to Extirpate this Execrable Race.                                      --General Jeffery Amherst in a letter dated July 16, 1763
Over the warming ground, swings toll like clock tower bells.
Squirrels spiral the trunk of a pine.
We fill a pail with sand. 
The day is robin's eggshell fine.

My mother's shoulder had three shallow scars.
Shining archipelago.
The quiet theaters of our lives. 
Immune is a sung word, skirting sorrow.

Kneeling at no registry of toddlers with amorphous voices.
Night sweats without monument.
The lake has the sea on its breath.
One man has an island.





Jewel of India
 

From the dim hallway, walls swollen with summer damp.

Concave threshold to the morning's livid light.

When my father said Gerrard Street East, his voice.

The passing subway tremors upwards, into me, reverberates in ligaments and membranes. 

On canvas shoes through minor parks, a pinball in a rudderless machine.

My father, transiently animate. Funny in the ebbing language, bantering with shopkeepers.

A lifeguard pours bleach in the fractured blue wading pool, sloshes it out with her legs.

If I could, I'd view a produce stand as he did, fill a paper bag with dillweed, bitter melon, ladyfingers.

Miraculous reversal poster in the window of the Portuguese apothecary.

Who lived where he never resembled somebody. 

Belled, metal restaurant elephant. They're barely open. The woman fills and seals samosas in the uproar of a standing fan.

I have tea. Father, dayflower, I keep arriving at this dead end where the menu says exotic, stamped with sickle chilis. 

The fan blades clatter frantically in their cage. A ghetto blaster spools ghazals. 

Her husband, over the counter, shouts: The pavements here are very bad. You must take your walks on the pitch, in circles. This is what all of us do.





The Ships of Theseus
 

The ship wherein Theseus and the youth of Athens returned had thirty oars, and was preserved by the Athenians...for they took away the old planks as they decayed, putting in new and stronger timber in their place, insomuch that this ship became a standing example among the philosophers, for the logical question of things that grow; one side holding that the ship remained the same, and the other contending that it was not the same.
--Plutarch, Vita Thesel
The answer of course is that the ship
doesn't exist, that "ship
is an abstraction, a conception,
an imaginary tarp thrown
across the garden of the real.
The answer is that the cheap
peasantry of things toils all day
in the kingdom of language,
every ship like a casket
of words: bulkhead, transom,
mast steps. The answer
is to wake again to the banality
of things, to wade toward
the light inside the plasma
of ideas. But each plank
is woven from your mother's
hair. The blade of each oar
contains the shadow of
a horse. The answer
is that the self is the glue between
the boards, the cartilage
that holds a world together,
that self is the wax in
the stenographer's ears,
that there is nothing the mind
won't sacrifice, each item
another goat tossed into
the lava of our needs.
The answer is that this is just
another poem about divorce,
about untombing the mattress
from the sofa, your body
laid out on the bones of the
double-jointed frame, about
separation, rebuilding, about
your daughter's missing
teeth. Each time you visit
now you find her partially
replaced, more sturdily
jointed, the weathered joists
of her childhood being stripped 
away. New voice. New hair.
The answer is to stand there
redrawing the constellation
of the word daughter in
your brain while she tries
to understand exactly who
you are, and breathes out
girl after girl into the entry-
way, a fog of strangers that
almost evaporates when
you say each other's
names. Almost, but not quite.
Let it be enough. Already,
a third ship moves
quietly toward you in the night.





History of My Heart
 

One Christmastime Fats Waller in a fur coat 
Rolled beaming from a taxicab with two pretty girls   
Each at an arm as he led them in a thick downy snowfall 

Across Thirty-Fourth Street into the busy crowd 
Shopping at Macy's: perfume, holly, snowflake displays. 
Chimes rang for change. In Toys, where my mother worked 

Over her school vacation, the crowd swelled and stood 
Filling the aisles, whispered at the fringes, listening 
To the sounds of the large, gorgeously dressed man, 

His smile bemused and exalted, lips boom-booming a bold 
Bass line as he improvised on an expensive, tinkly 
Piano the size of a lady's jewel box or a wedding cake. 

She put into my heart this scene from the romance of Joy, 
Co-authored by her and the movies, like her others 
My father making the winning basket at the buzzer 

And punching the enraged gambler who came onto the court 
The brilliant black and white of the movies, texture 
Of wet snowy fur, the taxi's windshield, piano keys, 

Reflections that slid over the thick brass baton 
That worked the elevator. Happiness needs a setting: 
Shepherds and shepherdesses in the grass, kids in a store, 

The back room of Carly's parents' shop, record-player 
And paper streamers twisted in two colors: what I felt 
Dancing close one afternoon with a thin blonde girl 

Was my amazing good luck, the pleased erection 
Stretching and stretching a the idea She likes me, 
She likes it, the thought of legs under a woolen skirt, 

To see eyes "melting so I could think This is it, 
They're melting! Mutual arousal of suddenly feeling 
Desired: This is it: "desire! When we came out 

Into the street we saw it had begun, the firm flakes 
Sticking, coating the tops of cars, melting on the wet 
Black street that reflected storelights, soft 

Separate crystals clinging intact on the nap of collar 
And cuff, swarms of them stalling in the wind to plunge 
Sideways and cluster in spangles on our hair and lashes, 

Melting to a fresh glaze on the bloodwarm porcelain 
Of our faces, Hey nonny-nonny boom-boom, the cold graceful 
Manna, heartfelt, falling and gathering copious 

As the air itself in the small-town main street 
As it fell over my mother's imaginary and remembered 
Macy's in New York years before I was even born, 

II 

And the little white piano, tinkling away like crazy 
My unconceived heart in a way waiting somewhere like 
Wherever it goes in sleep. Later, my eyes opened 

And I woke up glad to feel the sunlight warm 
High up in the window, a brighter blue striping 
Blue folds of curtain, and glad to hear the house 

Was still sleeping. I didn't call, but climbed up 
To balance my chest on the top rail, cheek 
Pressed close where I had grooved the rail's varnish 

With sets of double tooth-lines. Clinging 
With both arms, I grunted, pulled one leg over 
And stretched it as my weight started to slip down 

With some panic till my toes found the bottom rail, 
Then let my weight slide more till I was over 
Thrilled, half-scared, still hanging high up 

With both hands from the spindles. Then lower 
Slipping down until I could fall to the floor 
With a thud but not hurt, and out, free in the house. 

Then softly down the hall to the other bedroom 
To push against the door; and when it came open 
More light came in, opening out like a fan 

So they woke up and laughed, as she lifted me 
Up in between them under the dark red blanket, 
We all three laughing there because I climbed out myself. 

Earlier still, she held me curled in close 
With everyone around saying my name, and hovering, 
After my grandpa's cigarette burned me on the neck 

As he held me up for the camera, and the pain buzzed 
Scaring me because it twisted right inside me; 
So when she took me and held me and I curled up, sucking, 

It was as if she had put me back together again 
So sweetly I was glad the hurt had torn me. 
She wanted to have made the whole world up, 

So that it could be hers to give. So she opened   
A letter I wrote my sister, who was having trouble 
Getting on with her, and read some things about herself 

That made her go to the telephone and call me up: 
"You shouldn't open other people's letters, I said 
And she said "Yeswho taught you that? 

As if she owned the copyright on good and bad, 
Or having followed pain inside she owned her children 
From the inside out, or made us when she named us, 

III 

Made me Robert. She took me with her to a print-shop 
Where the man struck a slug: a five-inch strip of lead 
With the twelve letters of my name, reversed, 

Raised along one edge, that for her sake he made 
For me, so I could take it home with me to keep 
And hold the letters up close to a mirror 

Or press their shapes into clay, or inked from a pad 
Onto all kinds of paper surfaces, onto walls and shirts, 
Lengthwise on a Band-Aid, or even on my own skin 

The little characters fading from my arm, the gift 
Always ready to be used again. Gifts from the heart: 
Her giving me her breast milk or my name, Waller 

Showing off in a store, for free, giving them 
A thrill as someone might give someone an erection, 
For the thrill of itor you come back salty from a swim: 

Eighteen shucked fresh oysters and the cold bottle 
Sweating in its ribbon, surprise, happy birthday! 
So what if the giver also takes, is after something? 

So what if with guile she strove to color 
Everything she gave with herself, the lady's favor 
A scarf or bit of sleeve of her favorite color 

Fluttering on the horseman's bloodflecked armor 
Just over the hearthow presume to forgive the breast 
Or sudden jazz for becoming what we want? I want 

Presents I can't picture until they come, 
The generator flashlight Italo gave me one Christmas: 
One squeeze and the gears visibly churning in the amber 

Pistol-shaped handle hummed for half a minute 
In my palm, the spare bulb in its chamber under my thumb, 
Secret; or, the knife and basswood Ellen gave me to whittle. 

And until the gift of desire, the heart is a titular, 
Insane king who stares emptily at his counselors 
For weeks, drools or babbles a little, as word spreads 

In the taverns that he is dead, or an impostor. One day 
A light concentrates in his eyes, he scowls, alert, and points 
Without a word to one pass in the cold, grape-colored peaks 

Generals and courtiers groan, falling to work 
With a frantic movement of farriers, cooks, builders, 
The city thrown willing or unwilling like seed 

(While the brain at the same time may be settling 
Into the morning Chronicle, humming to itself, 
Like a fat person eating M&M's in the bathtub) 

IV 

Toward war, new forms of worship or migration. 
I went out from my mother's kitchen, across the yard 
Of the little two-family house, and into the Woods: 

Guns, chevrons, swordplay, a scarf of sooty smoke 
Rolled upwards from a little cratewood fire 
Under the low tent of a Winesap fallen 

With fingers rooting in the dirt, the old orchard 
Smothered among the brush of wild cherry, sumac, 
Sassafras and the stifling shade of oak 

In the strip of overgrown terrain running 
East from the train tracks to the ocean, woods 
Of demarcation, where boys went like newly-converted 

Christian kings with angels on helmet and breastplate, 
Bent on blood or poaching. There are a mountain and a woods 
Between usa male covenant, longbows, headlocks. A pack 

Of four stayed half-aware it was past dark 
In a crude hut roasting meat stolen from the A&P 
Until someone's annoyed father hailed us from the tracks 

And scared us home to catch hell: We were worried, 
Where have you been? In the Woods. With snakes and tramps. 
An actual hobo knocked at our back door 

One morning, declining food, to get hot water. 
He shaved on our steps from an enamel basin with brush 
And cut-throat razor, the gray hair on his chest 

Armorial in the sunlightthen back to the woods, 
And the otherlife of snakes, poison oak, boxcars. 
Were the trees cleared first for the trains or the orchard? 

Walking home by the street because it was dark, 
That night, the smoke-smell in my clothes was like a bearskin. 
Where the lone hunter and late bird have seen us 

Pass and repass, the mountain and the woods seem 
To stand darker than beforewords of sexual nostalgia 
In a song or poem seemed cloaked laments 

For the woods when Indians made lodges from the skin 
Of birch or deer. When the mysterious lighted room 
Of a bus glided past in the mist, the faces 

Passing me in the yellow light inside 
Were a half-heard story or a song. And my heart 
Moved, restless and empty as a scrap of something 

Blowing in wide spirals on the wind carrying 
The sound of breakers clearly to me through the pass 
Between the blocks of houses. The horn of Roland 

V 

But what was it I was too young for? On moonless 
Nights, water and sand are one shade of black, 
And the creamy foam rising with moaning noises 

Charges like a spectral army in a poem toward the bluffs 
Before it subsides dreamily to gather again. 
I thought of going down there to watch it a while, 

Feeling as though it could turn me into fog, 
Or that the wind would start to speak a language 
And change meas if I knocked where I saw a light 

Burning in some certain misted window I passed, 
A house or store or tap-room where the strangers inside 
Would recognize me, locus of a new life like a woods 

Or orchard that waxed and vanished into cloud 
Like the moon, under a spell. Shrill flutes, 
Oboes and cymbals of doom. My poor mother fell, 

And after the accident loud noises and bright lights 
Hurt her. And heights. She went down stairs backwards, 
Sometimes with one arm on my small brother's shoulder. 

Over the years, she got better. But I was lost in music; 
The cold brazen bow of the saxophone, its weight 
At thumb, neck and lip, came to a bloodwarm life 

Like Italo's flashlight in the hand. In a white 
Jacket and pants with a satin stripe I aspired 
To the roughneck elegance of my Grandfather Dave. 

Sometimes, playing in a bar or at a high school dance, I felt 
My heart following after a capacious form, 
Sexual and abstract, in the thunk, thrum, 

Thrum, come-wallow and then a little screen 
Of quicker notes goosing to a fifth higher, winging 
To clang-whomp of a major seventh: listen to me 

Listen to me, the heart says in reprise until sometimes 
In the course of giving itself it flows out of itself 
All the way across the air, in a music piercing 

As the kids at the beach calling from the water Look, 
Look at me, to their mothers, but out of itself, into 
The listener the way feeling pretty or full of erotic revery 

Makes the one who feels seem beautiful to the beholder 
Witnessing the idea of the giving of desirenothing more wanted 
Than the little singing notes of wantingthe heart 

Yearning further into giving itself into the air, breath 
Strained into song emptying the golden bell it comes from, 
The pure source poured altogether out and away.





Greed
 

My ocean town struggles 
to pick up leaves, 
offer summer school, 
and keep our library open. 
Every day now 
more men stand 
at the railroad station, 
waiting to be chosen for work. 
Because it's thought 
the Hispanics will work for less 
they get picked first, 
while the whites and blacks 
avoid the terror 
in one another's eyes.
Our handyman, Santos, 
who expects only
what his hands earn, 
is proud of his half acre in Guatemala, 
where he plans to retire. 
His desire to proceed with dignity 
is admirable, but he knows
that now no one retires, 
everyone works harder. 
My father imagined a life 
more satisfying than the one 
he managed to lead. 
He didn't see himself as uneducated, 
thwarted, or bitter,
but soon-to-be rich. 
Being rich was his right, he believed. 
Happiness, I used to think, 
was a necessary illusion. 
Now I think it's just 
precious moments of relief, 
like dreams of Guatemala.
Sometimes, at night,
in winter, surrounded by 
the significant silence
of empty mansions, 
which once were cottages, 
where people lived their lives, 
and now are owned by banks
and the absent rich, 
I like to stand at my window, 
looking for a tv's futile flickering, 
always surprised to see 
instead
the quaint, porous face
of my reflection,
immersed 
in its one abundance.





Age Appropriate
 

Sometimes, 
mystified by the behavior
of one of my sons, 
my wife will point out 
if it's age-appropriate, 
making me wonder why 
I still shout at ballplayers on tv 
and argue with the dead. 
Last week, my oldest son,
with a wild pitch, turned 
my left ankle into an eggplant. 
I didn't yell at the doctors 
who refused my insurance, 
or get angry with a friend 
who told me to soak it 
in bourbon and garlic. No,
I read Montaigne who said 
self-revelation is the purpose 
of discourse, which, in his day, 
meant knowing whether 
to be flattered if a friend 
didn't use a food-taster, 
or amused if a witch cast a spell 
of weeping on an in-law. 
Blaise Monluc, the king's 
lieutenant general during 
the civil wars, Montaigne says,
threw so many hanged Protestants
down a well you could reach in 
and touch the top one's head. Yes,
Monluc, who was fond of saying 
"When the scaffolds are full, use trees, 
knew what was appropriate. 
On occasion I'll run into a lobby
to avoid greeting a friend, 
not because my mind vanishes 
and I can't remember his name, 
which is true, but because I 
must flee what is darkest in me. 
In other words, when evicted from 
a strange lobby into a stranger street, 
where every scaffold is full 
and bodies dangle in the long 
blue sorrow of the afternoon, 
without context, explanation, or sympathy,
it's good to know, even momentarily, 
how to live, among the relevant, 
the passionate, and the confused.





From "Old English Rune Poem
 

 i (feoh) 
Wealth is a comfort                    to every man
yet every man                              must divide it mightily
If he wishes to have                   the measurer's mercy



 ii (ur)
The ox is steady-hearted             and over-horned
A fierce and famous beast                      it fights with horns
Glorious moor-stepper                that is a noble creature



 v (rad)
Riding is mild for warriors                    at their hearthsides
and strong-bold                             for he mounted on the back
of a mighty horse                          over a distance measured in miles



 vii (gyfu)
A gift is the grace                           and praise of men
and warmth and worthship                    to all exiles
sustenance for him                       who is stripped of all else



 viii (wyn)
Joy is won                            by whoever knows little of woe
sourness or sorrow                        and who has for himself
breath and bliss                              and fullness and a fortified place



 x (nyd)
Need is bound in the breast         yet nonetheless becomes for the

 xv (eolxh)
Elk-sedge is found                          most often in a fen
it waxes in water                             and wounds severely
burns in the blood                          of each man's body
who with his hand                          takes hold of it



 xx (man)
Man in mirth                  is dear to his kin
yet must every one                         betray the other
for that reason                the Lord dooms
wretched flesh                                 be taken by the earth





The Big Bad
 

At last we decoded the terminal message,
Only to find the pattern we had expected
Was false--a false trail of false bread crumbs
Designed to leave pitfalls undetected.

We found a new pattern. We found a hand
Moving pieces we had thought were only
Part of the board, and shifting them to vantage points
We had ignored. We rewrote the battle plan

And reconfigured the satellite array
To show our progress from the very beginning.
The fault should be traceable--and hence correctable--
And once we found it, we'd be winning.

We found a new pattern. We followed its track
To a forest beside an abandoned tunnel
Diving wide as a boxcar into the rock.
A stale breeze blew over rusting shovels

And all of our instruments confirmed a hit.
We set a perimeter. We sent in a scout.
From the interior, nothing looked back at us.
No tracks indicated a force had come out.

But we had a pattern. At dawn, we dispatched
A team of our best, our trackers and stone killers,
To see if the signals were finally a match
And if so, to counterattack. And now we wait.

And now we wait. The tunnel gives nothing back.
The trees are revealing the first signs of gold
But the air is unmoving. The air is still.
It is quiet here, and getting cold.





Busker with Harp
 

For a birth
The fact of the harp swells into the air,
Alien and familiar and entirely too large,
An elephant lost in the suburbs,
And opens with its cry a strange passage

Between the harp itself, the fragile harp,
And the almost guilty knowledge
Of the stroke of luck that brought it here
And the care with which it must depart.





Salvations
 

Like hope
it springs
eternal,
existing in
discrete but
spherical
units, a
mist of total
but encapsulated
salvational
events. If
any two of
these bubbles
bang against
each other no
walls collapse
or double to
a larger chamber
unlike the halls
of soap.





Old Men Pitching Horseshoes
 

Back in a yard where ringers groove a ditch, 
These four in shirtsleeves congregate to pitch 
Dirt-burnished iron. With appraising eye, 
One sizes up a peg, hoists and lets fly--
A clang resounds as though a smith had struck 
Fire from a forge. His first blow, out of luck, 
Rattles in circles. Hitching up his face,
He swings, and weight once more inhabits space, 
Tumbles as gently as a new-laid egg.
Extended iron arms surround their peg
Like one come home to greet a long-lost brother. 
Shouts from one outpost. Mutters from the other.

Now changing sides, each withered pitcher moves 
As his considered dignity behooves
Down the worn path of earth where August flies 
And sheaves of air in warm distortions rise,
To stand ground, fling, kick dust with all the force 
Of shoes still hammered to a living horse.







First Night
 

We brought that newborn home from Maimonides 
and showed her nine blue glittering streets. 
Would she like the semis with hoods of snow? 
The precinct? Bohack's? A lit diner?
Her eyes were huge and her gaze tilted
like milk in a pan, toward shadow.
Would she like the tenement, three dim flights, 
her crib that smelled of Lemon Pledge?
We slept beside her in our long coats,
rigid with fatigue in the unmade bed.
Her breath woke us with its slight catch. 
Would she approve of gray winter dawn?
We showed her daylight in our cupped hands. 
Then the high clocks began booming
in this city and the next, we counted for her, 
but just the strokes, not the laggards
or the tinny echoes, and we taught her
how to wait, how to watch, how to be held,
in that icy room, until our own alarm chimed.





Afterlife
 

I wake to leafless vines and muddy fields, 
patches of standing water. His pocketknife

waits in my dresser drawer, still able to gut fish.
I pick up his green shirt, put it on for the fourth day

in a row. Outside, the rusty nail he hammered 
catches me, leaves its stain on everything.

The temperature drops, the whole shore 
filling with him: his dented chew can, waders,

the cattails kinked, bowing their distress.
At the pier, I use his old pliers to ready the line:

fatheads, darters, a blood worm jig. Today, the lake's 
one truth is hardness. When the trout bite,

I pull the serviceable things glistening into air.





In the Planetarium
 

I read the palms of the other 
kids on the field trip to see 
which ones would grow up

to be astronauts. The lifeline 
on Betty Lou's beautiful hand 
ended the day after tomorrow,

so I told her how the rest
of our lives is vastly over-rated, 
even in neighboring galaxies.

When she asked me how I knew 
so much, I said I watched
War of the Worlds six times

and, if she went with me to
the double-feature tomorrow,
I'd finish explaining the universe.

I smiled winningly. The Halley's Comet 
lecture by our teacher whooshed in
my one ear and out the other.





Years
 


             --for J.P.O.
I have wished you dead and myself dead,
How could it be otherwise.
I have broken into you like a burglar
And you've set your dogs on me.
You have been a hurricane to me
And a pile of broken sticks
A child could kick.
I have climbed you like a monument, gasping,
For the exercise and the view,
And leaned over the railing at the top
Strong and warm, that summer wind.





The Pull Toy
 

You squeezed its leash in your fist, 
It followed where you led:
Tick, tock, tick, tock,
Nodding its wooden head.

Wagging a tail on a spring,
Its wheels gearing lackety-clack,
Dogging your heels the length of the house, 
Though you seldom glanced back.

It didn't mind being dragged 
When it toppled on its side 
Scraping its coat of primary colors: 
Love has no pride.

But now that you run and climb 
And leap, it has no hope
Of keeping up, so it sits, hunched 
At the end of its short rope

And dreams of a rummage sale
Where it's snapped up for a song,
And of somebody--somebody just like you-- 
Stringing it along.





Grubbing
 

The jay's up early, and attacks the lawn
with something of that fervor and despair
of one whose keys are not where they always are, 
checking the same spots over and again
till something new or overlooked appears--
an armored pillbug, or a husk of grain.
He flits with it home, where his mate beds down,
her stern tail feathers jutting from the nest
like a spoon handle from a breakfast bowl.
The quickest lover's peck, and he's paroled
again to stalk the sodgrass, cockheaded, obsessed. 
He must get something from his selfless work-- 
joy, or reprieve, or a satisfying sense
of obligation dutifully dispensed.
Unless, of course, he's just a bird, with beaks--
too many beaks--to fill, in no way possessed
of traits or demons humans might devise,
his dark not filled with could-have-beens and whys.





Labor Day
 

Even the bosses are sleeping late
in the dusty light of September.

The parking lot's empty and no one cares.
No one unloads a ladder, steps on the gas

or starts up the big machines in the shop,
sanding and grinding, cutting and binding.

No one lays a flat bead of flux over a metal seam
or lowers the steel forks from a tailgate.

Shadows gather inside the sleeve
of the empty thermos beside the sink,

the bells go still by the channel buoy,
the wind lies down in the west,

the tuna boats rest on their tie-up lines
turning a little, this way and that.





Gliding O'er All
 

Gliding o'er all, through all,
Through Nature, Time, and Space,
As a ship on the waters advancing,
The voyage of the soul--not life alone,
Death, many deaths I'll sing.





Solomon Grundy
 

Born on Monday and a tiny
world-containing grain of light
passed through each eye like heaven through a needle.

And on Tuesday
he screamed for a small ear in which to hide.

He rolled on Wednesday, rolled his whole body 
full of immense salt spaces, slowly 
from one horizon to the other.

And on Thursday, trembling, crippled, 
broke beyond his given strength and crawled.

And on Friday he stood upright.

And on Saturday he tested a footstep
and the sky came down and alit on his shoulder
full of various languages in which one bird doesn't answer to another.

And on Sunday he dreamed he was flying 
and his mind grew gold watching the moon 
and he began to sing to the brink of speaking





Various Portents
 

Various stars. Various kings.
Various sunsets, signs, cursory insights.
Many minute attentions, many knowledgeable watchers,
Much cold, much overbearing darkness.

Various long midwinter Glooms.
Various Solitary and Terrible Stars.
Many Frosty Nights, many previously Unseen Sky-flowers.
Many people setting out (some of them kings) all clutching at stars.

More than one North Star, more than one South Star. 
Several billion elliptical galaxies, bubble nebulae, binary systems, 
Various dust lanes, various routes through varying thicknesses of Dark, 
Many tunnels into deep space, minds going back and forth.

Many visions, many digitally enhanced heavens,
 All kinds of glistenings being gathered into telescopes: 
Fireworks, gasworks, white-streaked works of Dusk, 
Works of wonder and/or water, snowflakes, stars of frost . . .

Various dazed astronomers dilating their eyes,
Various astronauts setting out into laughterless earthlessness,
Various 5,000-year-old moon maps,
Various blindmen feeling across the heavens in braille.

Various gods making beautiful works in bronze, 
Brooches, crowns, triangles, cups and chains, 
And all sorts of drystone stars put together without mortar. 
Many Wisemen remarking the irregular weather.

Many exile energies, many low-voiced followers,
Watches of wisp of various glowing spindles,
Soothsayers, hunters in the High Country of the Zodiac,
Seafarers tossing, tied to a star . . . 

Various people coming home (some of them kings). Various headlights. 
Two or three children standing or sitting on the low wall. 
Various winds, the Sea Wind, the sound-laden Winds of Evening 
Blowing the stars towards them, bringing snow.





Cathay
 

Wrongheaded and obsequious
on vacation, unnerved
by new surroundings, I miss
the bright feeling of belonging
and the familiar patterns of my country,
its virginity and schizophrenia,
my several stolen bicycles.





Problems of Knowledge
 

Translation broadens language
as divorce and remarriage extend family.

Born to fade and break, facts 
huddle inside black brackets.

Work means inquisition as a child 
separates a cricket's wings from thorax.

Ideas come apart as monads, metastasizing 
rhapsody on the edge of delicate dusk.

Thunder sounds in the distance or television, 
always on in this constant rain.





Furthermore
 

It was something to let him go.

          It was a having to believe, furthermore,

in the voyage
of the other, a Ulysses

without an Ithaca,

was to speak 
of the sea 
without speech 
of the shore--

and to have for a body

the going away of the body, to have for eyes 
the going away of the eyes. And for hearing,

a silence, where once 
were people.

And for comfort, a dwelling
before each
steps into that weather
of which all
strangers speak.





Troubadour
 

Someone enters: That alone
makes me speak.


When you lived, I spoke to you.
We are transitive.


I never dream of speech:
I either speak or don't.


And now that I know
where you will not be--

I do not go there.





Frequency Modulation
 

you are listening to

the transmission via seed pearl, aural irritant

clockwork and sparkgap ultra high and superlow

precious black opal crystal and glass shudders and sings

broad cast scattered the seeds among the apocrypha

each agent at land or sea satellite or space

direct conversion of royal register and groove

high in fidelity to

our regenerative radio hisses and shouts

everything that cannot be owned belongs now to us

irradiant waves oscillate below visible light

to arrive and reside requires no medium but occupies vacuum

and air transformational emission

follow your radiotelegraph

we are your conductor our amplitude varies

we fluctuate the frequency

we are not subject to static interference

we embed the subcarrier

hush y'all

you need not know that language if you know this sound





Convention Centers of the New World
 

We had to sleep in the streets. 
Not on the sidewalks, in the streets.

Cause the sidewalks was full of urine 
and body waste, dead bodies.

And we had to sleep out there,
in the hell of waste and the dead bodies.

I walked from water up to my neck 
to get to the Convention Center.

There was dead dogs, dead rodents,
you had to push all that kind of mess out of the way,

hoping that it didn't touch you. 
I was pushing them out the way,

so many dead bodies coming from the Ninth Ward
up our way and they had people that was drowned up my way.

Now this Convention Center wasn't nothing nice, 
I kid you not.

People still crying and begging to go home. 
There's nothing there.

You have no running water. You have no lights. 
The place stinks. It's contaminated.

I've been there twice. 
I died there, I died.

Me, my ten-year-old daughter, my sister 
and her thirty-two-year-old son,

we lived out there seven days.
Five days we had no food. No water.

Every night and every day the military people 
was throwing down on us

like we was a bunch of wild animals. 
They was on a hunt to kill.

They killed one guy right there in front of us, 
run over him with a police car

and then they shot the man and left him there. 
They didn't cover him up or nothing

and the next day,
it was so hot out there,

when they did come to pick him up, 
his body was stuck to the ground.

So I can understand you want to keep control 
of the people,

but why have those people draw guns on children? 
Women with babies in their stomachs.

Every time you look around we breaking and running, 
trying to get into the Convention Center

and they're drawing guns on people like that. 
I mean, it don't make no kinda sense.

They wouldn't let you leave. 
You had to stay there.

Cause we smelled like -- I'm serious --
because everybody was smelling the same way --

smelling like sewer, like shit, piss. 
That was the scariest time of my life.

And we had to have that on us
because we ain't had no water, we ain't had no sewer.

There wasn't no limit on it because you had to scrub yourself 
just to get the scent out of your skin

Because, like I said, they knew they have a lot of poor people 
like myself don't have no transportation,

don't have no money.
Well I have a car but it got under the water.

Me, my ten-year-old daughter, my sister
and her thirty-two year-old son, we lived out there seven days.

We looked for her for an hour and thirty minutes 
in the Convention Center.

Five days we had no food. No water.
I seen children die, I seen old people die,

I seen murders, I seen rapes.
I seen people murder people then cut their heads off.

We already knew that the killer people 
were putting them in the icebox,

killing little children and raping little children.
The men, the looters, the people that was staying in there.

I am telling you, that was the most horriblest experience 
I have ever seen in my life.

I seen the troops shoot people. They ride around with guns 
almost like we was in a prison camp.

No, the place wasn't on fire. It was some children upstairs 
playing with the fire extinguisher.

Like hell. And like I said, I never in my life grew up in a house 
with millions of people.

You know, I've always had my own room, my own, 
you know, my own, I was always -- just --

In the Convention Center, the buses came in. 
Every night. Every day they was telling us

"The buses is coming, the buses is coming. 
The buses passed right there in front of us and kept going!

The people was there to see the buses so everybody run, 
rushing the buses to get on the damn buses and get out of there.

Every day they was moving us around, go here, go there, 
the buses is gonna meet you here, meet you there.

They was lying. There was never no buses, they was lying. 
They was just making us tired. They had us in there to kill us.

We used to look up at the bridge and see all the buses 
going that way to the Superdome,

or to the hospital, or to the people in those condos, 
getting them all out of there and going back.

Buses going back again, buses leaving out New Orleans again. 
That's how it was.

It was nopd police
but it wasn't our regular district police.

These were special nopd policemen.
We was running from place to place telling them,

"Oh, this person dead, that person dead. 
They said, "Well we can't do nothing about no dead bodies.

Y'all just don't worry.
Y'all just try to get the fuck out of here.

They say, "Y'all go to the bridge.
The bus's going to pick you up on the bridge.

I think it was they job to send the National Guards 
and the armored people in there

to make sure everybody was evacuated. 
They left us out there for five, six, seven days.

We stayed on the bridge nine hours. 
They didn't care about us.

The first thing they dropped into us was boxes of cigarettes. 
Not food. Not water. Boxes of cigarettes.

Two hours later they drop us water. And half of it burst open
cause they was so high up when they dropped it.

Two hours after that they drop us some army food in a box
we got to pour water in to heat up.

We was hungry,
we had no other choice.

The news got us out. Not the National Guard, not the Mayor, not Blanco,
the news people is the only ones who got us out.

Channel 26 got me out. Channel 26.
The rest of them was there to kill us.

I got tired of Convention Centers. I wanted
to come the hell up out of that damn Convention Center.





Archibald Higbie
 

I loathed you, Spoon River. I tried to rise above you,
I was ashamed of you. I despised you
As the place of my nativity.
And there in Rome, among the artists,
Speaking Italian, speaking French,
I seemed to myself at times to be free
Of every trace of my origin.
I seemed to be reaching the heights of art
And to breathe the air that the masters breathed,
And to see the world with their eyes.
But still they'd pass my work and say:
"What are you driving at, my friend?
Sometimes the face looks like Apollo's,
At others it has a trace of Lincoln's."
There was no culture, you know, in Spoon River,
And I burned with shame and held my peace.
And what could I do, all covered over
And weighted down with western soil,
Except aspire, and pray for another
Birth in the world, with all of Spoon River
Rooted out of my soul?





Petit, the Poet
 

Seeds in a dry pod, tick, tick, tick, 
Tick, tick, tick, like mites in a quarrel-- 
Faint iambics that the full breeze wakens-- 
But the pine tree makes a symphony thereof. 
Triolets, villanelles, rondels, rondeaus, 
Ballades by the score with the same old thought: 
The snows and the roses of yesterday are vanished; 
And what is love but a rose that fades? 
Life all around me here in the village: 
Tragedy, comedy, valor and truth, 
Courage, constancy, heroism, failure-- 
All in the loom, and oh what patterns! 
Woodlands, meadows, streams and rivers-- 
Blind to all of it all my life long. 
Triolets, villanelles, rondels, rondeaus, 
Seeds in a dry pod, tick, tick, tick, 
Tick, tick, tick, what little iambics, 
While Homer and Whitman roared in the pines?





After
 

Over treasure and land some texts will say it had
Little to do with slavery or the newly 
Discovered yellow planet

Few men watched the glaciers recede
From shuttles they had built
During the hemorrhage years
When they'd gathered all the genes down from the ledges

I'll be a fig or a sycamore tree 
Or without hands

By then doctors and poets
Would have found a cure for prayer






Or have you shoved the door shut 
In the face of the dark?

Have you body and light the trap 
Of retribution doing unto you

What it does to others? You protest 
In the streets and papers and I leave

For a faraway land 
Where with pill and scalpel

And a distant reckoning 
If he should lick his lips

Or clench his fist I shall find his second left toe 
Infected puffy

From a bump
I'll lance it and squeeze

Out the pus and offer 
Him an antibiotic

I can't refuse therefore I am






The first time I saw you it was hot I was fed up
The second time your wife gave birth to a macerated boy

I had nothing to tell you 
About letting go of the dying 
In the morning you were gone

Had carried your father back to your house
His cracked skull
I didn't know that was your wife
When I raised my voice

To those who were praying
From behind the wall to keep it down

I was trying to listen to your baby's heartbeat 
With a gadget a century old






Anemic
From so much loss giving birth

If you give blood in the desert you won't 
Get it back not your iron pills or magic hat 
I put your thin 
Hemoglobin up to the light and called out

To the donors Donors
If you want to know your blood type
And it's a match
You must donate

Few came some indifferent to my condition 
Not having heard of it 
And willing anyhow






And the world is south
The night a bandit with gasoline

And I'm your dancing lizard mirth
I put my one arm up
And bring my one foot down on a hot zinc top
The nearest hospital was the dawn

She didn't know her daughter on her back was 
The entry wound and she the exit

She ran a brothel so 
The officer said

Where the rebels came and went 
And ran into the government boys

Her girl's femur the size of the bullet






He was from the other side rumors 
Had a bullet through his left arm 
Or had it bitten off by a camel

A camel elephant of the desert never forgets what you are 
If you aren't kind to it

When I met him his bladder was the size 
Of a watermelon his prostate a cantaloupe 
You cannot catheterize 
A man forever

Every hour on the hour his left arm stump 
Hanging his good arm holding 
His penis his buttocks in deep squeeze 
A charge from the rear without spillage

This poor murderous thief desperately single-
Handedly began slapping his own ass 
As if he were dashing a stallion in a raid 
On some unarmed village






The mind in the field 
The brine in the field

Whether I
Is a diphthong codependent on

What isn't there to stay in the field 
The good you act is equal

To the good you doubt 
Most have lost many

You are either prosperous 
Or veteran in the field






A mother offers not necessarily 
Sells her one-eyed son

For an education if you'll bring him back 
And stone dust for one 
With congenital illness

And little boy with malaria 
Same old gas

Money mixed with blood
Transfusion the doctor's perfect record broken

Nobility of taking 
A life you

Who must walk to and from your house
The jeep's upkeep
The donkey-cart ambulance






One boot left behind

The one-boot photo I wanted
On a book military black the quad a clinic's

Special Forces spun
By his dangling heels from

The pickup truck rushed
To a central town altered combative

With two scalp lacerations and blood 
In his auditory canal

I was a lover of loss I tossed
The boot in the capital of suffering





Mimesis
 

My daughter
                        wouldn't hurt a spider 
That had nested 
Between her bicycle handles 
For two weeks 
She waited 
Until it left of its own accord

If you tear down the web I said 
It will simply know 
This isn't a place to call home 
And you'd get to go biking

She said that's how others 
Become refugees isn't it?





Birth
 

          
          1
Three sparrows in the schoolyard while waiting for my daughter to finish up her play with friends whose purity she will come to question in a few weeks and in that way I am reminded of the president when he speaks of enemies to the other side of the mirror but only in that way the three sparrows ruffled up the dirt as their wings and heads spun motorbike doughnuts after one of them had come back with a massive potato chip for the other two to fight over perhaps he was the provider or wasn't hungry but simply couldn't let a good bit of food go to waste

Then a crow came and the winner sparrow went zooming into the orange orchard knowing fully well it would be impossible to alight and reappeared with a chip the size of his beak and a flurry of birds descended on the scene (I even saw a Fletcher) but kept my eyes on that little sparrow and am happy to report he kept what his mouth held though it occurs to me he was also mean and the one who seemed a provider might have been yoked in that way my wife during delivery was rung up like a bar code whenever the nurse knocked or the doctor was called

Abecedarian Requiring Further Examination of Anglikan Seraphym Subjugation of a Wild Indian Rezervation
 

Angels don't come to the reservation.
Bats, maybe, or owls, boxy mottled things.
Coyotes, too. They all mean the same thing--
death. And death
eats angels, I guess, because I haven't seen an angel
fly through this valley ever.
Gabriel? Never heard of him. Know a guy named Gabe though--
he came through here one powwow and stayed, typical
Indian. Sure he had wings,
jailbird that he was. He flies around in stolen cars. Wherever he stops,
kids grow like gourds from women's bellies.
Like I said, no Indian I've ever heard of has ever been or seen an angel.
Maybe in a Christmas pageant or something--
Nazarene church holds one every December,
organized by Pastor John's wife. It's no wonder
Pastor John's son is the angel--everyone knows angels are white.
Quit bothering with angels, I say. They're no good for Indians.
Remember what happened last time
some white god came floating across the ocean?
Truth is, there may be angels, but if there are angels
up there, living on clouds or sitting on thrones across the sea wearing
velvet robes and golden rings, drinking whiskey from silver cups,
we're better off if they stay rich and fat and ugly and
'xactly where they are--in their own distant heavens.
You better hope you never see angels on the rez. If you do, they'll be marching you off to 
Zion or Oklahoma, or some other hell they've mapped out for us.





The Facts of Art
 

                                             woven plaque basket with sunflower design, Hopi, 
                                             Arizona, before 1935

                                             from an American Indian basketry exhibit in 
                                             Portsmouth, Virginia


The Arizona highway sailed across the desert-- 
     a gray battleship drawing a black wake, 
            halting at the foot of the orange mesa, 
                  unwilling to go around.

Hopi men and women--brown, and small, and claylike
      --peered down from their tabletops at yellow tractors, water trucks, 
            and white men blistered with sun--red as fire ants--towing 
                  sunscreen-slathered wives in glinting Airstream trailers 
                         in caravans behind them.

Elders knew these bia roads were bad medicine--knew too
     that young men listen less and less, and these young Hopi men
           needed work, hence set aside their tools, blocks of cottonwood root 
                 and half-finished Koshari the clown katsinas, then
                        signed on with the Department of Transportation,

were hired to stab drills deep into the earth's thick red flesh
     on First Mesa, drive giant sparking blades across the mesas' faces, 
           run the drill bits so deep they smoked, bearding all the Hopi men 
                 in white--Bad spirits, said the Elders--

The blades caught fire, burned out--Ma'saw is angry, the Elders said. 
     New blades were flown in by helicopter. While Elders dreamed
            their arms and legs had been cleaved off and their torsos were flung 
                  over the edge of a dinner table, the young Hopi men went 
                         back to work cutting the land into large chunks of rust.

Nobody noticed at first--not the white workers,
     not the Indian workers--but in the mounds of dismantled mesa, 
           among the clods and piles of sand,
                 lay the small gray bowls of babies' skulls.

Not until they climbed to the bottom did they see
     the silvered bones glinting from the freshly sliced dirt-and-rock wall-- 
           a mausoleum mosaic, a sick tapestry: the tiny remains 
                 roused from death's dusty cradle, cut in half, cracked, 
                        wrapped in time-tattered scraps of blankets.

Let's call it a day, the white foreman said.
     That night, all the Indian workers got sad-drunk--got sick 
          --while Elders sank to their kivas in prayer. Next morning,
                as dawn festered on the horizon, state workers scaled the mesas, 
                        knocked at the doors of pueblos that had them, hollered 
                               into those without them,

demanding the Hopi men come back to work--then begging them--
      then buying them whiskey--begging again--finally sending their white
          wives up the dangerous trail etched into the steep sides 
                to buy baskets from Hopi wives and grandmothers 
                       as a sign of treaty.

When that didn't work, the state workers called the Indians lazy, 
      sent their sunhat-wearing wives back up to buy more baskets-- 
           katsinas too--then called the Hopis good-for-nothings, 
                 before begging them back once more.

We'll try again in the morning, the foreman said. 
     But the Indian workers never returned--
          The bias and dots calls to work went unanswered, 
                as the fevered Hopis stayed huddled inside.

The small bones half-buried in the crevices of mesa--
     in the once-holy darkness of silent earth and always-night-- 
          smiled or sighed beneath the moonlight, while white women 
                in Airstream trailers wrote letters home

praising their husbands' patience, describing the lazy savages:
     such squalor in their stone and plaster homes--cobs of corn stacked 
         floor to ceiling against crumbling walls--their devilish ceremonies 
               and the barbaric way they buried their babies, 
                      oh, and those beautiful, beautiful baskets.





My Brother at 3 A.M.
 

He sat cross-legged, weeping on the steps 
when Mom unlocked and opened the front door. 
        O God, he said. O God.
                He wants to kill me, Mom.

When Mom unlocked and opened the front door 
at 3 a.m., she was in her nightgown, Dad was asleep. 
        He wants to kill me, he told her, 
                looking over his shoulder.

3 a.m. and in her nightgown, Dad asleep, 
What's going on? she asked. Who wants to kill you? 
        He looked over his shoulder.
                The devil does. Look at him, over there.

She asked, What are you on? Who wants to kill you? 
The sky wasn't black or blue but the green of a dying night. 
        The devil, look at him, over there. 
                He pointed to the corner house.

The sky wasn't black or blue but the dying green of night. 
Stars had closed their eyes or sheathed their knives. 
        My brother pointed to the corner house. 
                His lips flickered with sores.

Stars had closed their eyes or sheathed their knives. 
O God, I can see the tail, he said. O God, look. 
        Mom winced at the sores on his lips.
                It's sticking out from behind the house. 

 O God, see the tail, he said. Look at the goddamned tail. 
He sat cross-legged, weeping on the front steps. 
        Mom finally saw it, a hellish vision, my brother. 
                O God, O God, she said.





No More Cake Here
 

When my brother died
I worried there wasn't enough time
to deliver the one hundred invitations
I'd scribbled while on the phone with the mortuary:
Because of the short notice no need to rsvp.
Unfortunately the firemen couldn't come.
(I had hoped they'd give free rides on the truck.)
They did agree to drive by the house once
with the lights on-- It was a party after all.

I put Mom and Dad in charge of balloons, 
let them blow as many years of my brother's name, 
jails, twenty-dollar bills, midnight phone calls, 
fistfights, and er visits as they could let go of. 
The scarlet balloons zigzagged along the ceiling 
like they'd been filled with helium. Mom blew up 
so many that she fell asleep. She slept for ten years-- 
she missed the whole party.

My brothers and sisters were giddy, shredding
his stained T-shirts and raggedy pants, throwing them up
into the air like confetti.

When the clowns came in a few balloons slipped out
the front door. They seemed to know where
they were going and shrank to a fistful of red grins
at the end of our cul-de-sac. The clowns played toy bugles
until the air was scented with rotten raspberries.
They pulled scarves from Mom's ear--she slept through it.
I baked my brother's favorite cake (chocolate, white frosting).
When I counted there were ninety-nine of us in the kitchen.
We all stuck our fingers in the mixing bowl.

A few stray dogs came to the window.
I heard their stomachs and mouths growling
over the mariachi band playing in the bathroom.
(There was no room in the hallway because of the magician.)
The mariachis complained about the bathtub acoustics.
I told the dogs, No more cake here, and shut the window.
The fire truck came by with the sirens on. The dogs ran away.
I sliced the cake into ninety-nine pieces.

I wrapped all the electronic equipment in the house, 
taped pink bows and glittery ribbons to them-- 
remote controls, the Polaroid, stereo, Shop-Vac, 
even the motor to Dad's work truck--everything 
my brother had taken apart and put back together 
doing his crystal meth tricks--he'd always been 
a magician of sorts.

Two mutants came to the door.
One looked almost human. They wanted
to know if my brother had willed them the pots
and pans and spoons stacked in his basement bedroom.
They said they missed my brother's cooking and did we
have any cake. No more cake here, I told them.
Well, what's in the piata? they asked. I told them
God was and they ran into the desert, barefoot.
I gave Dad his slice and put Mom's in the freezer.
I brought up the pots and pans and spoons
(really, my brother was a horrible cook), banged them
together like a New Year's Day celebration.

My brother finally showed up asking why
he hadn't been invited and who baked the cake.
He told me I shouldn't smile, that this whole party was shit
because I'd imagined it all. The worst part he said was
he was still alive. The worst part he said was
he wasn't even dead. I think he's right, but maybe
the worst part is that I'm still imagining the party, maybe
the worst part is that I can still taste the cake.





Dear Ra
 

Dear Ra,There are no more cigarettes in this letter. It's all about spray-paint and traffic jams from here on out. Honk if you're epileptic, honk if it's 2:40 p.m., if you love shells. Honk in the name of freedom and fear of the human body. When I say "human body" I mean the kind that tears like lettuce. And when I say "fear" I mean the kind you feel seconds before crashing into a wall. That's the kind of poem this is. The kind raised on excess television violence.All that's left are ads for brotherhood and blowjobs. An ad for 2:42 p.m. A wad of hair. This isn't Marx. I'm not trying to bite the hand that feeds me sour candy. Run down the deer. Rain. Wear a red jacket and pumps. Pave the road back from my bed. I don't own a bed, it must've been the trap I've crept in and out of since I learned how to sleep alone. The Count of Monte Cristo's funeral. God's earlobe. An army of lamb can stop a film but not the violence of handbags. Not 2:43 p.m. Two forty-four pee em. Speak from a babble and a switch. Piss in a telephone booth. Grow a tree. Kidnap a car thief. Talk to him as though you want to be slammed in his trunk like a bag full of rocks.Talk to me in the woods. To my chest. With your fingers.Even if you kick in the gates, nyc is still nyc. My concussion is still a hotel. The guests are staying lukewarm and I'm picking up the tab. Ask me if I have ever wanted to tear out cables, burn up cradles. Interview my architects about hands. Ask an illegal immigrant how to escape from a political cliche. Does one use hammers? What about the moist area? The brutal caress? The spindle? Where does one learn to speak such a broken language? Are you jealous of films about Vietnam?This poem is dedicated to Jean-Luc Godard. This poem is dedicated to the man who put a gun in my gullet. This poem is a pay-phone.Someone has slashed its chords and ripped out its face. This drink is mixed with a plastic fork. This is an invitation to my Halloween party. Come as a key. Come as a metatextuai tear in the metatextual fabric.Listen to my concert through walls that were built to keep the vermin out of my armpits. Shovel. That's all I ask in return for my sonata on gravel. I mean gravel in a dialectic sense. As in, tomorrow dirt will be glamorous. Asphalt will be categorized as a sound. You will be categorized as an outdated method of psychotherapy. Like confession. Or the couch. Or the chair. I will be classified as a sore loser. Last year's winner must have thrown something hard at my head. Something that shattered like a waltz in a bomb raid. It's almost three o'clock. That makes it exactly several thousand miles since I left your town. I left your mice. I left a confusing note for the exterminators.I've been confused when I should have been reborn as a crusade or a hospital of innocents. I've been bored when I should've been screwed. I've been a hungry year.





Dear Tourists
 

Dear Tourists,

You can grope for moist souvenirs in the basement,
but you'll need patience
because nobody down there will warn you about the floor.

In the street you'll find squirrels; on my scalp, bumps.
If you want proof for the folks back home that you've surged
like a seagull, print your name and number in the bathroom.

If you want a seagull for a pet, talk to my therapist.
If you find her, tell me where she lives, and where her daughter
goes to school. If you want a piece of me, suck my dick.

If you want to sell trips to the general public, take my pulse
or my coffee-table picture-books about Italy.
If there's a house in the trees, throw up a hammer

and see what falls down. The bleeding kid isn't
the best prize and you can't return it, so be careful where
you walk when you've had a few.

If there's a nettle between your shoulder blades 
and you're having trouble breathing, tell the teacher, 
but don't tell her it was me cause it wasn't.

I was just watching, maybe even laughing at your gurgling sounds. 
That incident belongs to somebody else's amusement park. 
I don't ever want to see it again on this side of the blunt tracks.





Nurse Marble
 


Knowledge is Power. That is what the billboard says and I agree. I am an adult, therefore I understand the threat of passengers. The threat to Our Children, who don't understand the threat of these bird-like, twitchy people. They pose two kinds of threat. To begin with, there is the one we all know about, the predatory threat, the hawk-like passengers that prey on children as they sit in front of their computers or televisions. The terrorist threat. That threat is easy to handle. You shoot it. You contain it. You confiscate. You stitch. You bleed from various orifices and sockets, but you survive, you rebuild house and rinse the child. The more serious threat is the diseases passengers carry with them. Internal terrorism. Children love those diseases. It makes them babble like possessed. Their make-up looks like oil in the moonlight. Such children cannot be cleaned off. Kill them. Or turn them into entertainment. Art.






Lady Day
 

for Billie Holiday
Lady could pour you a song,
Coffee and a little cream.
Stir it the whole night long
Into a brown-sugar dream.

Lady could wrap you a note
Up in a velvet night--
Sometimes Manhattan satin,
Always Harlem delight.

Lady Day could sing it
Like nobody ever has
At the Shim Sham Club, Hot Cha Cha, 
Joints that swung on jazz.

Her bittersweet songs told Heartbreak,
Meet your sister Pain,
But Lady melted yesterdays
Into beautiful rain. 





You Learn By Living
 

for Eleanor Roosevelt
Who showed the world the world itself
     Was awkward, shy and plain.
A high-born leader in a long,
     Low decade full of pain.

Poor farmers, blacks, homeless, the least
     Advantaged hoped to see,
Magnificently unarrayed,
     Pure human dignity.

A lady first, the great first lady
     Looked fear in the face,
And said, There is no room for fear
     When courage take its place.





Swim, Girl, Swim
 

for Gertrude Ederle
As Europe woke from sleep,
Young Trudy Ederle
At Cap Gris Nez in France
Dived into a daunting sea.

Many had tried to make
This superhuman swim--
Thirty-five punishing miles.
Chances, at best, were slim.

When Fury found the waves,
Far from the western shore,
Her trainer shouted, "Let's turn back!"
But Trudy cried, "What for?"

Under an English moon,
The celebration began
After the fastest crossing
By woman or by man.





Jook Joint Saturday Night
 

Jook joint's about to come alive!
It's like a bee outside a hive;
And when the hive begins to hum,
It's like a dim and distant drum;
And when the drum begins to beat,
It's like a circus down the street;
And when the street begins to fill,
It's like a sudden summer chill;
And just as summer simmers down,
It's like the fireworks over town.
Don't matter what the preachers say--
This congregation's here to stay
'Cause when the jook joint comes alive
Is when the Delta blues arrive!

"Mister Johnson

Mister Johnson
That all you want is Fame?
Mister Johnson
Now what you got to offer?
Mister Johnson
Salvation is my name
With a rhythm on a riff
That's practically God
Oh Lord, I'm a pure
Undivining rod
I'm a flickerin' candle
With the blackest light
I'm the darkest angel
And I own the night
Mister Johnson
That instrument you got there
Mister Johnson
It's Lucifer's guitar
Mister Johnson
I'll tune it for you, baby
Mister Johnson
They won't know who you are
I'm a cutthroat seller,
The Magician of Deal
Who can stoke sweet fire
That'll make you feel
Like a hothouse flower
On double defrost
Who won't give a nickel
For the petals it lost
Mister Johnson
You slink on back to livin'
Mister Johnson
In devil-may-care control
Mister Johnson
Don't thank me for the favor
Mister Johnson
I thank you for your soul

Caelica 83: [You that seek what life is in death]
 

You that seek what life is in death, 
Now find it air that once was breath. 
New names unknown, old names gone: 
Till time end bodies, but souls none.
            Reader! then make time, while you be,
            But steps to your eternity.





Elegy for Philip Sidney
 

Silence augmenteth grief, writing increaseth rage,
Staled are my thoughts, which loved and lost the wonder of our age; 
Yet quickened now with fire, though dead with frost ere now, 
Enraged I write I know not what; dead, quick, I know not how.

Hard-hearted minds relent and rigor's tears abound, 
And envy strangely rues his end, in whom no fault was found. 
Knowledge her light hath lost, valor hath slain her knight, 
Sidney is dead, dead is my friend, dead is the world's delight.

Place, pensive, wails his fall whose presence was her pride; 
Time crieth out, My ebb is come; his life was my spring tide. 
Fame mourns in that she lost the ground of her reports; 
Each living wight laments his lack, and all in sundry sorts.

He was (woe worth that word!) to each well-thinking mind 
A spotless friend, a matchless man, whose virtue ever shined; 
Declaring in his thoughts, his life, and that he writ, 
Highest conceits, longest foresights, and deepest works of wit.

He, only like himself, was second unto none, 
Whose death (though life) we rue, and wrong, and all in vain do moan;
Their loss, not him, wail they that fill the world with cries, 
Death slew not him, but he made death his ladder to the skies.

Now sink of sorrow I who live--the more the wrong! 
Who wishing death, whom death denies, whose thread is all too long; 
Who tied to wretched life, who looks for no relief, 
Must spend my ever dying days in never ending grief.

Farewell to you, my hopes, my wonted waking dreams, 
Farewell, sometimes enjoyd joy, eclipsd are thy beams. 
Farewell, self-pleasing thoughts which quietness brings forth, 
And farewell, friendship's sacred league, uniting minds of worth.

And farewell, merry heart, the gift of guiltless minds, 
And all sports which for life's restore variety assigns; 
Let all that sweet is, void; in me no mirth may dwell: 
Philip, the cause of all this woe, my life's content, farewell!

Now rhyme, the son of rage, which art no kin to skill,
And endless grief, which deads my life, yet knows not how to kill, 
Go, seek that hapless tomb, which if ye hap to find 
Salute the stones that keep the limbs that held so good a mind.





The Lullaby of a Lover
 

     Sing lullaby, as women do, 
Wherewith they bring their babes to rest, 
And lullaby can I sing too 
As womanly as can the best. 
With lullaby they still the child, 
And if I be not much beguiled, 
Full many wanton babes have I 
Which must be stilled with lullaby.

     First lullaby my youthful years; 
It is now time to go to bed, 
For crooked age and hoary hairs 
Have won the haven within my head. 
With lullaby, then, youth be still; 
With lullaby content thy will; 
Since courage quails and comes behind, 
Go sleep, and so beguile thy mind.

     Next, lullaby my gazing eyes, 
Which wonted were to glance apace. 
For every glass may now suffice 
To show the furrows in my face; 
With lullaby then wink awhile, 
With lullaby your looks beguile; 
Let no fair face nor beauty bright 
Entice you eft with vain delight.

     And lullaby, my wanton will; 
Let reason's rule now reign thy thought, 
Since all too late I find by skill 
How dear I have thy fancies bought; 
With lullaby now take thine ease, 
With lullaby thy doubts appease. 
For trust to this: if thou be still, 
My body shall obey thy will.

     Eke lullaby, my loving boy, 
My little Robin, take thy rest; 
Since age is cold and nothing coy, 
Keep close thy coin, for so is best; 
With lullaby be thou content, 
With lullaby thy lusts relent, 
Let others pay which hath mo pence; 
Thou art too poor for such expense.

     Thus lullaby, my youth, mine eyes, 
My will, my ware, and all that was. 
I can no mo delays devise, 
But welcome pain, let pleasure pass; 
With lullaby now take your leave, 
With lullaby your dreams deceive; 
And when you rise with waking eye, 
Remember then this lullaby.





Church Monuments
 

While that my soul repairs to her devotion, 
Here I intomb my flesh, that it betimes 
May take acquaintance of this heap of dust; 
To which the blast of death's incessant motion, 
Fed with the exhalation of our crimes, 
Drives all at last. Therefore I gladly trust

My body to this school, that it may learn 
To spell his elements, and find his birth 
Written in dusty heraldry and lines ; 
Which dissolution sure doth best discern, 
Comparing dust with dust, and earth with earth. 
These laugh at jet, and marble put for signs,

To sever the good fellowship of dust, 
And spoil the meeting. What shall point out them, 
When they shall bow, and kneel, and fall down flat 
To kiss those heaps, which now they have in trust? 
Dear flesh, while I do pray, learn here thy stem 
And true descent: that when thou shalt grow fat,

And wanton in thy cravings, thou mayst know, 
That flesh is but the glass, which holds the dust 
That measures all our time; which also shall 
Be crumbled into dust. Mark, here below, 
How tame these ashes are, how free from lust, 
That thou mayst fit thyself against thy fall.





The Old Cloak
 

 
         This winter's weather it waxeth cold,
              And frost it freezeth on every hill, 
         And Boreas blows his blast so bold
              That all our cattle are like to spill. 
         Bell, my wife, she loves no strife;
              She said unto me quietlye, 
         Rise up, and save cow Crumbock's life!
              Man, put thine old cloak about thee!

He.   O Bell my wife, why dost thou flyte?
               Thou kens my cloak is very thin: 
          It is so bare and over worn,
               A crick thereon cannot renn. 
          Then I'll no longer borrow nor lend;
              For once I'll new apparell'd be; 
          To-morrow I'll to town and spend;
              For I'll have a new cloak about me.

She.  Cow Crumbock is a very good cow:
              She has been always true to the pail;
          She has helped us to butter and cheese, I trow, 
              And other things she will not fail.
          I would be loth to see her pine.
              Good husband, counsel take of me:
          It is not for us to go so fine--
              Man, take thine old cloak about thee!

He.   My cloak it was a very good cloak,
              It hath been always true to the wear; 
          But now it is not worth a groat:
              I have had it four and forty year'. 
          Sometime it was of cloth in grain:
              'Tis now but a sigh clout, as you may see: 
          It will neither hold out wind nor rain;
              And I'll have a new cloak about me.

She.  It is four and forty years ago
              Sine the one of us the other did ken; 
          And we have had, betwixt us two,
              Of children either nine or ten: 
          We have brought them up to women and men:
              In the fear of God I trow they be. 
          And why wilt thou thyself misken?
              Man, take thine old cloak about thee!

He.   O Bell my wife, why dost thou flyte?
              Now is now, and then was then: 
          Seek now all the world throughout,
              Thou kens not clowns from gentlemen: 
          They are clad in black, green, yellow and blue,
              So far above their own degree. 
          Once in my life I'll take a view;
              For I'll have a new cloak about me.

She. King Stephen was a worthy peer;
              His breeches cost him but a crown; 
          He held them sixpence all too dear,
              Therefore he called the tailor 'lown.'
          He was a king and wore the crown,
              And thou'se but of a low degree: 
          It's pride that puts this country down: 
              Man, take thy old cloak about thee!

He.   Bell my wife, she loves not strife,
              Yet she will lead me, if she can; 
          And to maintain an easy life
              I oft must yield, though I'm good-man. 
          It's not for a man with a woman to threap,
              Unless he first give o'er the plea: 
          As we began, so will we keep,
              And I'll take my old cloak about me.





The Glories of Our Blood and State
 

The glories of our blood and state
     Are shadows, not substantial things; 
There is no armour against Fate; 
     Death lays his icy hand on kings: 
               Sceptre and Crown 
               Must tumble down, 
And in the dust be equal made 
With the poor crooked scythe and spade.

Some men with swords may reap the field, 
     And plant fresh laurels where they kill: 
But their strong nerves at last must yield; 
     They tame but one another still: 
               Early or late 
               They stoop to fate, 
And must give up their murmuring breath 
When they, pale captives, creep to death.

The garlands wither on your brow;
     Then boast no more your mighty deeds!
Upon Death's purple altar now
      See where the victor-victim bleeds.
               Your heads must come
               To the cold tomb:
Only the actions of the just
Smell sweet and blossom in their dust.





The Cruel Mother
 

She sat down below a thorn,
     Fine flowers in the valley;
And there she has her sweet babe born,
     And the green leaves they grow rarely.

"Smile na sae sweet, my bonnie babe,"
     Fine flowers in the valley,
"And ye smile sae sweet, ye'll smile me dead,"
     And the green leaves they grow rarely.

She's taen out her little penknife,
     Fine flowers in the valley,
And twinn'd the sweet babe o' its life,
     And the green leaves they grow rarely.

She's howket a grave by the light o' the moon,
     Fine flowers in the valley,
And there she's buried her sweet babe in,
     And the green leaves they grow rarely.

As she was going to the church,
     Fine flowers in the valley,
She saw a sweet babe in the porch,
     And the green leaves they grow rarely.

"O sweet babe, and thou were mine,"
     Fine flowers in the valley,
"I was cleed thee in the silk so fine,"
     And the green leaves they grow rarely.

"O mother dear, when I was thine,
     Fine flowers in the valley,
Ye did na prove to me sae kind,"
     And the green leaves they grow rarely.





The Man of Double Deed
 

There was a man of double deed,
Who sowed his garden full of seed;
When the seed began to grow,
'Twas like a garden full of snow;
When the snow began to melt,
'Twas like a ship without a belt;
When the ship began to sail,
'Twas like a bird without a tail;
When the bird began to fly,
'Twas like an eagle in the sky;
When the sky began to roar,
'Twas like a lion at my door;
When my door began to crack,
'Twas like a stick across my back;
When my back began to smart,
'Twas like a penknife in my heart;
And when my heart began to bleed,
'Twas death, and death, and death indeed.





The Good Life
 

When some people talk about money
They speak as if it were a mysterious lover
Who went out to buy milk and never
Came back, and it makes me nostalgic
For the years I lived on coffee and bread,
Hungry all the time, walking to work on payday
Like a woman journeying for water
From a village without a well, then living
One or two nights like everyone else
On roast chicken and red wine.





What It Looks Like To Us and the Words We Use
 

All these great barns out here in the outskirts,
black creosote boards knee-deep in the bluegrass.
They look so beautifully abandoned, even in use.
You say they look like arks after the sea's
dried up, I say they look like pirate ships,
and I think of that walk in the valley where
J said, You don't believe in God? And I said,
No. I believe in this connection we all have
to nature, to each other, to the universe.
And she said, Yeah, God. And how we stood there,
low beasts among the white oaks, Spanish moss,
and spider webs, obsidian shards stuck in our pockets,
woodpecker flurry, and I refused to call it so.
So instead, we looked up at the unruly sky,
its clouds in simple animal shapes we could name
though we knew they were really just clouds--
disorderly, and marvelous, and ours.





[I rose from marsh mud]
 

I rose from marsh mud, 
algae, equisetum, willows,
sweet green, noisy
birds and frogs

to see her wed in the rich
rich silence of the church,
the little white slave-girl
in her diamond fronds.

In aisle and arch
the satin secret collects.
United for life to serve
silver. Possessed.





[Were it but Me that gained the Height]
 

World like a coat, silver clasps,
            ermine lined, warm with the dead inside,
rolling around in the red center--I thought

everything had a purpose--this was back when
            I still drank--and wasn't I a special
traveler, nestled in that pocket amongst the

butterscotch candies, the matchbooks?
            Unessential but accounted for, a steady
thing to touch. World like a 

morning glory, withered every
            evening, world like a bristling dog,
terrified of thunder--I can't believe

how I believed, or how that belief
            assumed a shape around my body,
taking on the imprint of my heat,

gaining solidity. When
            anyone questioned me, I held
it forth, let them touch the sleeve--I

needed nothing. World like an
            egret, still and white on the highway
divider, world like a regret

typed out and then erased--I cannot
            hold you any closer without
everyone seeing, I cannot

hold you at all, it seems, your
            evergreens, your curling potato vine;
it's all too much much, and I a bit of

goosedown, a thistle fluff, naked and
            hatless, unaccounted for and extra,
the world like a world like a world.





[At last, to be identified!]
 

A dirigible powered us through the first leg,
            traversing snow-capped mountains where goats
leapt from crags, and men with wrinkled
            apples faces looked up, pointed.

Smiling
            to cold air, I slept under a bear skin,
                        touched your lips in the night.

            On our pleasant soap
bubble journey, we dropped baskets down
            each morning, hooked meats, cheeses;
            in later weeks, nothing. Still, we took notes,

detailing the weather conditions, the migrating
            elk numbers and their steady decrease.
Northward by cracked compass,
            the sleet sheeting the balloon drove us low, then lower--

In time we cut through the ice, sank
fathoms into the sea, chaperoned by seals
            that are not mermaids at all.

Else you think this a hoax, know my hand--
down here still--please send help.





[To Love thee Year by Year]
 

They call it sacrifice--            imagine me a tiny poppy
            on a field of green felt--brief blip of color,

                        limitless expanse. I've never felt foreign,
or like a lash in his eye. If it's not love, it's

                        very like. Most days it feels the same--
            exacting--he tweezes the stray

thoughts from my speech, cleans up my
            heart with a tortoiseshell comb.
Every lady should have such a man,
            edging her lawn with a sharp rotary blade.

                        Year by year--let's call it always--
            editor and editrix. Engaged
                        against a flurry of typos, showered in

revisionist white out. I erase his crow's feet,
            buff away his frown. My head--he
yawns it open, scoops out dark foam,
            yesses I've regretted, the tiny poppy
everyone sees flapping to pieces--

And so, we are growing taller, sweeter,
ratified in the glow of the big correction.





Book of Memory
 

In my seeing there was a blank and he filled that blank
with words, there were words for darkness which made it lift,
there were words for cover which ripped them off,
there were legs that crossed and hearts that crossed,
promises red and read, and the pluck of banjo had a name
for that twang, and the way he called the world into notice,
that had a word, too. Once I saw I couldn't unsee
and the worst was that the light glaring from the letters
left blue haze under my eyelids. There are no photographs
of this time, and I can only go by what others
tell me: I was blurred and erratic, I drew a circle
of white chalk around me and called myself inviolate,
I watched for horses on the horizon, my walls
were under siege from smaller men who called themselves
heroes. They say I reached over the balustrade and picked
up the tiny ships and threw them over the edge of the world.
I tore my hair, cut one breast from my body and plattered it
as around my fortifications one man pulled another man
behind his chariot. If they say that's how I was,
that's how I was. I have no words for the one in the mirror
who apes me every morning. She's not the one I remember
imagining as a young girl. There must be a way to unsee
how I tap the glass and she taps back, and which wall,
which Cassandra weeping--everything I saw I spoke to his ear,
and the wall crashed into place between us, the horse 
had a bellyful of it, the blank was full of small soldiers,
and he turned from my beauty and said my name.





Questions About the Wife
 

I'm having trouble understanding the wife.
The wife seems like she is only there as a foil to your actions.
I want to know how the wife feels when you drag her
and your son down into the basement to start a new religion.
The religion has something to do with cowering
before a force greater than yourself and then being buried alive.
I want to know how the wife behaves in small, enclosed spaces:
if she is trying to comfort your son by telling him Daddy likes
to play funny games, or if she is already visualizing
herself walking into a women's shelter, your son
on her back and maybe, because this is a fantasy,
she carries a burning torch, like an angry villager, or a goddess.
Does the wife merit any revenge after you weed whack
the coffee table? Does she agree with you that the coffee table
is yours to destroy because you built it? What has she built
in the house that is hers to destroy? What kind of childhood
has the wife endured that allows her to understand you?
In her past life or lives, was the wife ever a shepherdess?
Does she see you as a sort of Pan, goatish, and pricked
by ticks, but also very well-endowed? When the wife transforms
into a tree can she still think or is she just a green haze
inside, an idea of growing? I would like to see the wife
peel off that bark, leaving only enough for modesty's sake,
although as this is your poem, we can take a bit more off.
I want to see her uproot herself, pick up the house and shake it.
How many people fall out?
The wife has something about her the Germans
would call unheimlich. I sometimes catch a glimpse of the wife
out of the corner of my eye but then I look away.
I cannot look directly at the wife. The wife is a conflagration
of everything dear. I wonder sometimes if she is faking;
There is a certain note she holds too long
so the orgasm is more operatic, less genuine.
When she cries, Oh my God, really, she should stutter.
Let's say the wife wakes up in the morning.
You have already made breakfast. Does your kindness feel oppressive?
Does she want to take your weed whacker through the house?
Has she ever, in a fit of anger, destroyed your pornography?
When you found a picture of the wife online with a foreign handprint
smacked red on her ass, how quickly did your shock turn to arousal?
Are you aware the wife is breaking down in public places,
and sometimes cannot move for thirty minutes? Sometimes
her arm goes entirely numb from the shoulder down. I think the wife
might need some fine-tuning, some elbow grease,
some wrenching apart, and then reassembling.





Vow
 

They were not traditionalists. 
They could bear the innovations 
               of plot. They could not 
wait to landscape the plot. They had plans
                              for a bed of pansies because pansies 
                              hardly ever die
                                                            in a cold snap, 
                              because pansies are hardy despite the name. 
When they shoved the trowel
                                             into the soil 
it was with his hand
                                             on the handle and hers                                                                            adding force. 
They knew there were only
                                                            nine types of people in the world 
and they knew which ones 
would close the deal. They knew 
the shirkers by sight.
                                             They had options. 
They knew about Required Communication.
                              About how I feel and you feel. 
When there was a question
                                             of who did the dishes 
                                             and who did the cat box, 
                                             it was settled in-house 
                              and never required an outside contractor.

But the pansies got stem spot, leaf rot, and mildew. 
When they looked at their options
               it seemed there weren't really that many
                                                                                            after all.
They swore to uphold the bonds
                                                      and the principles 
                                                      and the yelling.
They swore to oral sex.
They dressed to the nines and they walked the aisle.
They stood up and received the standard narration.





You Are the Penultimate Love of My Life
 

I want to spend a lot but not all of my years with you. 
We'll talk about kids
                              but make plans to travel. 
I will remember your eyes
                              as green when they were gray. 
Our dogs will be named For Now and Mostly.
               Sex will be good but next door's will sound better.

There will be small things.
I will pick up your damp towel from the bed,
                                                            and then I won't. 
I won't be as hot as I was
                              when I wasn't yours 
and your hairline now so
               untrustworthy. 
When we pull up alongside a cattle car
                              and hear the frightened lows,
                              I will silently judge you
                              for not immediately renouncing meat. 
You will bring me wine
                              and notice how much I drink.

                                              The garden you plant and I plant 
                              is tunneled through by voles, 
                                                             the vowels
                                                             we speak aren't vows, 
               but there's something
                              holding me here, for now, 
               like your eyes, which I suppose
                                                             are brown, after all.





Wild Kingdom
 

for Milan Kundera
This is your foreign correspondent,
Aristotle, for The Poetics,
reporting live from the Mediterranean
where the skulls and bones of a few Egyptians
crown the tradeships of His Majesty,
wave back and forth:
starfish--moons--Februaries.

To my right, our military advisor,
Hernando Cortez,
oversees operations at the Aztec/
Mexican border
where to the left of a stone no longer rising from water
a dove collects
its nest egg
upon the skeleton of a hummingbird.

To my left, our scribe-in-residence,
St. Nickle-and-Dime-Em-To-Debt,
scribbles furiously to a mortgaged future
where the last rites of man
and of-man
are delivered at the near-twin
births of the lyric and gunpowder.





Mamas Boy
 

for Michel Tournier, The Four Wise Men
At least once a month a man
boards a bus bound for Detroit,
one bag, a few books. Nevertheless
he always tells himself
I just might
leave Cincinnati for good
just cut out
never look back...

When he arrives in the Motor City he drinks
and drinks it all in until he's dead drunk
on all fours, a two-year-old
mama's boy, bawling
all night night after night
for the salt-sweet milk of his sister-mother
turning in her sleep from a hard back
turning toward the Canadian border...

When at long last he takes
a bus back to the Queen City,
long after the only rest
stop, he notices the first
signs: merciless thirst,
gorging hunger, swollen ankles,
what the folks down south
call sugar.





I Accidentally Ate Some Chicken and Now Im in Love with Harry Whittington
 

Harry Whittington: the man accidentally shot by Dick Cheney
Have you ever been in a situation
where somebody you thought was your friend
did something that hurt you very much,
and then they tried to blame it on you,
and then you had a heart attack?
Just wondering.

I thought Jack Abramoff was my buddy--
a small fish with a large chicken.
What a dick.

Why'd he have to remind me of my first wife,
Jacqueline Bouvier-Kennedy-Onassis-Bono-Crowe-Pitt-Degeneres-Federline?

Of course, that speaks volumes to and of itself.

On the other hand, everything tastes like chicken.
And cooked people taste like butter.

I barely touched the clam chowder
but I ate the chicken fried steak.
Then I ate hot beignet and sludgy chicory
and I accidentally drove the hot n' sporty.
Now I may try the chicken fries.

Why poo'ed vindaloo?

The founding fathers risked life and limb
just so I could trust the kung pao ham.
But the former potions master
spiked my polyjuice with mango juice,
and now I like drinks with chicks in them.

Doesn't anyone care about my feelings?
All I wanted to do was kill little birds.
Because, you know, that's fun.

I forget, which one am I banging,
that Plame bitch or the Ambassador to Switzerland?
I'd ask Dick which of the two he's screwing
but he never answers my emails.

In other news, I've been up to my neck in new food intern activity.
The skewers are kind of like hot wings,
except they are made with chicken tenders.
The backwash is kinda long,
but watch the whole thing for the slo-mo matrix-esque finale.
Way cooler than any other stick figure theater.

A barn-raised quail just said
"Bugs Bunny isn't real.

Is there no end to the horrors
this shooting will reveal?





Nocturne
 

Where are you now,
my poems, 
my sleepwalkers?
No mumbles tonight?
Where are you, thirst,
fever, humming tedium?
The sodium streetlights 
burr outside my window, 
steadfast, unreachable, 
little astonishments 
lighting the way uphill.
Where are you now,
when I need you most?
             It's late. I'm old. 
                         Come soon, you feral cats 
                                      among the dahlias.





Tombo
 

In Safeway yesterday, a young man sat on the floor, 
           pulled off his shoes, granted audience to us, 
his fellow seekers, and picked his naked feet. 
           He smiled, our brother, at the story he told 
of deliverance at the hand of Master Tombo, 
           lord and creator, whose round energy
lives in us surrounds us surrounds our milk
           our butter our eggs: see Him there,
in the Slurpee glaze upon the freezer case?
           In that elder by the yogurt shelves?
I believed his happiness and coveted 
           a tidy universe. He picked his feet
while a child whimpered by the melons, her nanny's
           mango aura made the cold blown air
touch my brain, I smelled myself in my aging body 
           and felt my silly bones collapse again.
I wanted Tombo's dispensation to save
           this faint believer and the indifferent world
that rivers through and past me. Down my aisle 
           lavender respired from the flower stall
and Security spoke kind words to our prophet.
          Oh I love and hate the fickle messy wash
of speech and flowers and winds and the tides
           and crave plain rotund stories
to justify our continuity. To the Maya corn was god,
           spilled blood made corn grow,
the blood gods shed watered needy ground
           and became People who worshipped the corn.
Tombo's grace carries us, convinced, from one 
           inarticulate incoherent moment to the next.
Tonight the wet streets and their limelight sigh.
          Orion turns, burning, unchanged again.
Bread rises somewhere and its ovens scent the trees.
           My poor belief lives in the only and all
of the slur of what these are, and what these are 
          streams toward loss in moments we live through.
As children we were lost in our opaque acts 
           but fresh and full in time. I remember
how I touched a girlish knee, how one boy
           broke another's face, how we all stood
in hard gray summer rain so it would run
          down the tips of noses to our tongues.





Miltons God
 

Where i-95 meets the Pike, 
a ponderous thunderhead flowered;

stewed a minute, then flipped
like a flash card, tattered
edges crinkling in, linings so dark 
with excessive bright

that, standing, waiting, at the overpass edge, 
the onlooker couldn't decide

until the end, or even then,
what was revealed and what had been hidden.





Squirrels
 

Something blurred, warmed
in the eye's corner, like woodsmoke 
becoming tears;
but when you turned to look

the stoop was still, the pumpkin
and tacky mum pot wouldn't talk--
just a rattle
at the gutter and a sense

of curtains, somewhere, pulled.
Five of them later, scarfing the oak's
black bole, 
laying a dream of snakes.

Needy and reticent
at once, these squirrels in charred November
recall, in Virgil, 
what it is to feel: 

moods, half-moods, 
swarming, then darting loose; obscure
hunches that refuse
to speak, but still expect

in some flash of luck
to be revealed. The less you try
to notice them,
the more they will know of you.





Observer
 

Not seeing me, not even looking, 
K. on her silver cruiser charms her way

through the last long moment 
of the changing light: 

snow boots and a Seychelles Warbler's 
old blue tights,

a rolled-up yoga mat in her basket
wobbling like a wild tiller as she pedals. 

It feels illicit and somewhat right 
to stand across the intersection 

without shouting 
her name, or even waving.

According to the internet
tutorial, the fact that photons 

turn into tiny loyal billiard balls
as soon as we start watching suggests

no error of method 
or measurement, but rather, 

as far as anyone can tell, 
an invisibly unstable world, 

a shaking everywhere 
that seeing must pin down and fix.

So, that morning I stumbled on you
out, alone, bending through

the traffic at Orange and Edwards Streets:
a someone else then 

whom I, alone, 
can never otherwise see--

there has to be a kind of speech
beyond naming, or even praise,

a discipline 
that locates light and lets it go.





Thicket
 

We come gnawed by need on hands and knees.


As a creature (nosing) grubble-seeks a spring.


As bendy-spined as bandy snakes through saltshrub yaupon 
                                                                                                      needle-brake.


For darkling green;
for thorn-surround.


This absorbing


quaggy
crample-ground.


Of briar-canes (intervolved with kudzu-mesh) and mold.


Of these convoluted vines we grasp to suck.


To taste the pith--
the lumen the cell-sap pulse.


To try to know


some (soursharp) something about something.


Lumen is as lumen does.


A little room for turmoil to grow lucid in.'


In here where Clary set her cart-tongue down (and dug, and brailled).
In here where Tynan breathed.


We grasp to suck to taste what light.


Let loose the bale that bows us down.


--Bow down.





From the Middle
 

How much of everything is pure
Getting ready. Dressing, pushing the button
Asquint through its machined furl
Only to unbutton, the eyes-open moment

Revealed. Ask any animal: nudity isn't
The same as nakedness. Once you've seen
A dangling, you can't unsee it, and
From that anything might ensue.

There's the rub. Taking the long view
You could say the future is romantic
I suppose. Also something you
Could never do without, though its bric-

a-brac is purely theoretical, until
It's arranged. Or not. Then, a miracle?





Rilke Rereading Hlderlin
 

Footnotes to the tower. For "He spends the summer
There, in a state of violent agitation,
Read: "It's there, in his agitation's most violent
State that Hlderlin suspends the summer--
Like a yellow pear above the untroubled water.

For the lost, disheveled decades of derangement,
Translate I was struck by Apollo as you
Must change your life. For sonnets that sing their own
Spontaneous, Orphic necessity to praise,
Think naked as a lightning rod he waited.

For necessity insert Anangke. But for
Anangke, "Lord, just one more summer, please.
For summer, the lyre. Hlderlin in his tower.
Until autumn, when the leaves start falling. Whoever
Has nowhere to go will never get home now.





One Canoe
 

Recalcitrant elephants
begin to attack.
The angry young males
of murdered mothers.

Any Martian could see it
how we did it

The historian of the future
is amazed. So much feeling

once in so many bodies. 
But maybe they were different
didn't think or feel that much.

Apocalypse is easy
Thinking's hard

Should we summon
a Roman Stoic to narrate?
Someone secretly thrilled
by the gore?

The clouds move through
an Adirondack sky unscored 
by satellite towers. 

People want what they want
& what they want is never one thing.

All that desire
sliming a space rock

Shivering the air 
a loon's cry. 
There is only so much
you can care for or carry

& for this there is 
no one canoe





Best Laid
 

it's clear 
the wind
won't let up 
and a swim's out-- 
what you planned
is scotched.
forget the calls,
errands at the mall--
yr resolve's
superfluous
as a clitoris.
how miraculous
the gratuitous--
spandrels,
cathedrals. 
on a sea
of necessity
let's float
wholly 
unnecessary
& call
that free





Every Day a Shiny Bright New Day
 

it's good not to drink
it's good not to piss
in the sink & it's good
not to think

the clarion ring
of a glass clinking
with ice good to hear it
fade into a past
you can't sing

your dumb blues
is over. admit
it was always
borrowed. you paid
no dues you did
no time

but the time spent
sodden. what you thought
I think. your 
higher power's
drunk. god's
the biggest alky
in the sky

the clouds are whiskey
sours passing by





Sun In Days

I tried to live that way for a while, among
the trees, the green breeze, 
chewing Bubblicious and by the edge of the pool      spitting it out. 
The book open on my chest, a towel
at my back      the diving board thwoking,
and leaving never arrived      Cut it out
my mother said     my brother 
clowning around with a water gun     Cut it out.
The planes arrowed into silence, fourteen,
fifteen, sixteen, always coming 
home from summer     over the bridge to Brooklyn.
The father stabbed on Orange Street,
the Betamax in the trash, 
the Sasha doll the dog chewed up, hollow 
plastic arms gaping. Powdered pink lemonade, 
tonguing the sweet grains 
                                                       liquid-thick. 
I could stand in that self for years
wondering is it better to 
anticipate than to age     Imagining 
children with five different men,
a great flood that would destroy 
your possessions     and free you to wander. 
Bathing suits and apples and suntan oil
and a mother bending over you
shadow of her face on yours. It's gone,
that way, the breeze, the permanent pool.
A father saying "ghost and the sheets
slipping off the oak tree's bough.
When I wake, leaves 
in the water. You could say green
forever and not be lying.

The pond near the house in Maine
where we lived for one year 
to "get away from the city     the pond
where the skaters     on Saturdays came,
red scarves     through white snow,
voices drawing near and     pulling
away, trees against the clouds. Trying to live
off the land for a while. Too hard
in the end my father said.     What did he say? 
Forget it     you weren't listening     He wore
fishing overalls most days and stank of guts.
Our shouts slipping, the green garbage cans
edging the white scar pond,
so many days like secrets about to be
divulged . . .
                                         White snow;
to stink of fish guts but     to be trying
to live:               the pond near the house
and the sound of voices     drawing near.

As you aged you got distracted, indebted. 
In the hospital around my mother
the machines     beeped,
the long leads of the heart monitor,
drooping parabolas. 
It's not worth dying for     she said. What
was it she meant? Swollen shells, the desiccated brown 
seedpods we used to pinch onto our noses 
and skate about     putting on airs. 
Then the books opened
their pages and with our red woolen
scarves flying and the Freezy Freakies' 
once-invisible hearts reddening 
into the cold we disappeared. 
Evian bottles skitter against the chain-link fence.
It's gone     that way     the green 
planes arrowing into silence     gum wrappers
slipping to the ground.
O wild West Wind     be thou our friend 
and blow away the trash. 
Salvage us from     the heap of our making and
Cut it out my mother said     Stop worrying
about the future, it doesn't
belong to us and we don't belong to it.

The surface more slippery, slick
and white the ice. I stand at the pond's edge 
gather the information     darkening there 
hello algae     hello fish pond 
my mind in the depths     going. 
On the beach I dig, tunnel 
to the hands of the woman who stitched 
this red shirt     holes all the way to China.
It got so easy to     get used to it, 
the orchestration of meaning 
against the night, life 
a tower you could climb on
not a junk heap     pale picture books
yellowing on the shelves. It got 
so     I close my eyes 
and walk along the hospital hall.
The iris quivering in the March light,
a nurse taking my mother's pulse
not paid enough to help us 
as we wished to be helped. And your hope 
left behind     turning the pages of magazines, 
the models in Prada. As a girl
it was a quest, to feel exploded every second,
pudding pops     and Vietnam vets 
standing on the corner shaking their Styrofoam
cups.     Holding her 
cup my mother stands, petting the dog,
it's 1982     the sun tunneling in     she drinks her coffee
Cut it out or     Forget it or     Hello. 
Look, I've made a telephone for us.
Put that cup to your ear, and I'll put it to mine,
and listen     I just need to find
one of those Styrofoam cups 
and what about you     where did you
go what kind of night is it there 
electric synthetic blackened or burnt.

At night they come to you
distorted and bright, like an old print on a light box, 
present,     present,          not quite. 
Are we inventing them as we sleep, 
or are they still     happening
in a time we can't touch?
The hockey game on the blue
tv glowing and slowing     I come home 
to a man slumped on the couch not-quite-saying
a greeting     all the gone ones there 
the slap of skates     all gone
and the commentator it's going on forever
the blade moving along rink
says What a slapshot what a shot.
You make a life, it is made of days and
days, ordinary and subvocal, not busy 
becoming what they could be,               dark furlings of 
tiny church feelings, mysterious, I mean,
and intricate like that high-windowed light--

intricate and mysterious          I come home. 

Near our house we hung out 
on the Promenade after school the boys smoking
the security systems in the Center blinking     a disco 
party blue red/blue red the East River
reflecting scraped sky     cornices and clouds
we could hear the roar of cars across 
it and taste the chemical air
of the offices the fathers worked in
we'd been there to pick them up 
for the long weekend in the Catskills
the hum-gray computers, the ibm Selectrics 
massive on the desks, eleven, twelve, 
thirteen, riding the graffitied subways,
flirting, the boys     grabbing us calling     hey     hey.
Changeable one day to the next.
Jon talking of atheism
blond hair in strips          At night the bomb mushrooming
over the Statue of Liberty, white 
blinding everywhere.          Oh, she said, don't worry
just a dream          just a dream.
Everyone is scared of Russia. 
Imagine          she laughed     We used to 
have to hide under our desks! 

Forget it     you weren't listening     I was trying
Don't worry it gets you nothing
to tell you something     the air cold 
the maples bare your mother pregnant
Come on the horses are     past the window
with a son much younger than you
of the house she rode them past
the river where all the Catholic kids sailed ice boats
uncles taking cash to wire home to Ireland.
The future isn't here yet, it's always
going to be,     but I'm holding you,
walking the Promenade, thirty-six,
the ferry crossing the river again.

and for a while               rain on the dirt road 
and the pastured gray horse     holding Chex Mix
up to its fuzzed mouth     pockets of time 
all summer     eating ghosts in the arcade 
Pac-Man alive quarter after quarter 
I keep trying     Cut it out she said and 
forget it     I was trying to tell you 
my father cooking fish in the kitchen
licking his thumb     to turn the page.

In the meantime you try 
not to go into a kind of exile--
Oh, you read too many books, says my friend
Dan     Here's the tv. And the small voices
of children     enter the room, they sound
so narrow and light and possible. But
don't you think we're always making the same
standing at the car rental
kind of mistake we began by making
at the last minute, rushing to call
our fathers before setting off 
for vacation.     It's warmer 
this August than it has been for decades.
Still the sun bathing us isn't preposterous
or cold.          Grace: imagine it

and all the afterworld fathers sleeping
with their hair perfectly          combed
faces mortician-clean 
unlike 
                                        the ones they wore.
In the motel Reagan on tv     his hair 
in that parted wave     the milk prices up,
my mother says, inflation.     Key Food 
on Montague, the linoleum tiles dirty and cracked,
the dairy case goose-pimpling my skin.
Those tiles are still there.
She is dead now     and so is he.
I know it seems bare to say it
bare to     bare linoleum tiles.

You who come after me
I will be underfoot but     Oh, 
come off it, start again. We all live 
amid surfaces and                    and I 
wish I had the     Start over     Come on thou
Step into the street, amidst 
the lightly turning trash,
your hair lifting in the wind     Remember
I have thought of you 
the lines of our skates converging
in a future etc. etc., the past 
the repository of what can be salvaged, grace
watering the basil
                                       on the windowsill, until 
the day comes of looking back at it all, 
like a projectionist at a movie
slipping through the reel, the stripped sound of time-- 

I tried to live that way for a while
Bubblicious and          spitting it out
Only forget it you          were
if I could hear your voice     again     I could pretend 
Rise and shine she called in the

Water Table
 

My earliest wish was not to exist,
to burst in the backyard 
without violence, 
no blood, no fleshy bits, 
mute button pressed
alone behind the rectory 
where no one would see me.

This wasn't a plea to be found 
or mourned for, but to be unborn 
into the atmosphere. To hang 
in the humid air, as ponds vent upward 
from the overheated earth,
rise until they freeze
and crystallize, then drop 
into the aquifer.





Forecast
 

The pack is filing 
from my nowheresvilles
filling the halfway hotels, 
braving the ruts and calling 
one another via satellite. 
A dollar says hello.

At home I try growing
a new life, one of many 
women bored by 
my womb's mystery. 

Who has time 
to run a thumb 
between her legs
and calculate 
the temperature--
chipper and bitter
netherworld weathergirl.





Sample
 

When you said no, 
             I went for your dresser, 
opened the top drawer, 
             broke the paper seals 
on the two sterile cups, 
             and wiped my dirty 
thumbs inside. 

             Because our stubborn love 
won't die, I have to kill it, 
            will it dead. Or so 
I thought until I passed 
             a cycle on my own. 
You've no idea 
             what's grown 
inside me
             since I bled.





Lisbon
 

We meet midway to walk white cobbles 
under a fish-flesh gray sky. 
Europe is collapsing; we are collapsing

always and again no matter how hard
we love one another. I don't understand 
our failure, where the feed loops 

back and spits us into another country, 
another junior suite reenacting this same,
same beat of a scene that begins, rises,

never ends, always ends--
Our intentions don't meet, 
their courses set differently 

by a force you don't believe in,
could be as simple as life. I want 
to be the wife you don't want. 

You won't let go of my wrist. 
I resist, threaten, bully, acquiesce. 
We write the next act of The Alchemist

in New York, Lisbon, a beach, 
a bar, star-crossed maybe 
from different galaxies. You approach, 

I retreat. You retreat, I reproach.
The manic two-step jitters 
over North Africa's dunes 

farther than our hero, Santiago, can see. 
I rise in the night to find the sharp knife
that came with the pears as a courtesy.





Sirens
 

My transgressions pile against the garden wall
(built when Rome began to weaken, scarred 

by a cannonball.) I gossiped; I snubbed 
a dinner guest. I watch until the wall writhes 

with awful feral cats fed by shrunken widows 
and the odd librarian. I've begun to be depleted 

by your absence; one of love's worst symptoms. 
For years, I'd had the sense to hold myself apart. 

I've been here long enough to kill 
two mint plants and a lavender, 

then resurrect their better part.
I'd like to let you die on the vine. 

Not you, the You I Dream, 
who follows through on waking. 

See how the watcher sees the storm 
but doesn't get wet. Be that. 

Be what? 
Be wiser than the heart.





"Knocks on the door
 

Knocks on the door.
Who?
I sweep the dust of my loneliness
under the rug.
I arrange a smile
and open.





Doors
 

An open door says, "Come in.
A shut door says, "Who are you?
Shadows and ghosts go through shut doors.
If a door is shut and you want it shut,
     why open it?
If a door is open and you want it open,
     why shut it?
Doors forget but only doors know what it is
     doors forget.





The Witch Has Told You a Story
 

You are food.
You are here for me
to eat. Fatten up,
and I will like you better.

Your brother will be first,
you must wait your turn.
Feed him yourself, you will
learn to do it. You will take him

eggs with yellow sauce, muffins
torn apart and leaking butter, fried meats
late in the morning, and always sweets
in a sticky parade from the kitchen.

His vigilance, an ice pick of hunger
pricking his insides, will melt
in the unctuous cream fillings.
He will forget. He will thank you

for it. His little finger stuck every day
through cracks in the bars
will grow sleek and round,
his hollow face swell

like the moon. He will stop dreaming
about fear in the woods without food.
He will lean toward the maw
of the oven as it opens

every afternoon, sighing
better and better smells.





"Yes, I live inside the piano
 

Yes, I live inside the piano,
but there is no need for you
to come and visit me.





Poem
 

I'm in the house.
It's nice out: warm
sun on cold snow.
First day of spring
or last of winter.
My legs run down
the stairs and out
the door, my top
half here typing





Trust
 

If I would be walking down the road
you told me to imagine and I would and find
a diner kind of teacup sitting on its saucer
in the middle then I would feel so good
in my life that is just like mine
I would walk right up and look into my face
eclipsing the sky in the tea in the cup
and say, "Thank you, I have enjoyed
imagining all this.





In the Low Countries
 

They are building a ship
in a field
much bigger than I should have thought
sensible.
When it is finished
there will never be enough of them
to carry it to the sea
and already it is turning
rusty.





Burn Lake
 

For Burn Construction Company
When you were building the i-10 bypass, 
one of your dozers, moving earth 
at the center of a great pit, 
slipped its thick blade beneath 
the water table, slicing into the earth's 
wet palm, and the silt moistened 
beneath the huge thing's tires, and the crew 
was sent home for the day. 
Next morning, water filled the pit. 
Nothing anyone could do to stop it coming. 
It was a revelation: kidney-shaped, deep 
green, there between the interstate 
and the sewage treatment plant. 
When nothing else worked, you called it 
a lake and opened it to the public. 
And we were the public.





"My hat
 

My hat
was run over
by a trolley
yesterday.
This morning
my coat took a walk
to some place
far away.
This afternoon
my shoes

A Boat
 

O beautiful
was the werewolf 
in his evil forest. 
We took him
to the carnival 
and he started 
     crying
when he saw
the Ferris wheel. 
Electric
green and red tears 
flowed down
his furry cheeks. 
He looked
like a boat
out on the dark 
water.





From "Bestiary
 

My mother sends me a black-and-white
photograph of her and my father, circa
1968, posing with two Indian men.

"Who are those Indian guys? I ask her
on the phone.

"I don't know, she says.

The next obvious question: "Then why
did you send me this photo? But I don't
ask it.

One of those strange Indian men is
pointing up toward the sky.

Above them, a bird shaped like a
question mark.





The One About the Robbers
 

You tell me a joke about two robbers who hide from the police. One robber hides as a sack of cats and the other robber hides as a sack of potatoes. That is the punch line somehow, the sack of potatoes, but all I can think about is how my dad used to throw me over his shoulder when I was very small and call me his sack of potatoes. I've got a sack of potatoes he would yell, spinning around in a circle, the arm not holding me reaching out for a sale. Does anyone want to buy my sack of potatoes? No one ever wanted to buy me. We were always the only two people in the room.





Auto-Lullaby
 

Think of a sheep
knitting a sweater;
think of your life
getting better and better.

Think of your cat
asleep in a tree;
think of that spot
where you once skinned your knee.

Think of a bird
that stands in your palm.
Try to remember
the Twenty-first Psalm.

Think of a big pink horse
galloping south;
think of a fly, and
close your mouth.

If you feel thirsty, then
drink from your cup.
The birds will keep singing
until they wake up.





Monsters
 

This is a world where there are monsters
There are monsters everywhere, racoons and skunks
There are possums outside, there are monsters in my bed.
There is one monster. He is my little one.
I talk to my little monster.
I give my little monster some bacon but that does not satisfy him.
I tell him, ssh ssh, don't growl little monster!
And he growls, oh boy does he growl!
And he wants something from me,
He wants my soul.
And finally giving in, I give him my gleaming soul
And as he eats my gleaming soul, I am one with him
And stare out his eyepits and I see nothing but white
And then I see nothing but fog and the white I had seen before was nothing but fog
And there is nothing but fog out the eyes of monsters.





"A monster owl
 

A monster owl
out on the fence
flew away. What
is it the sign
of? The sign of
an owl.





Dawn
 

5am: the frogs
ask what is it, what is it?
It is what it is.












And the Ghosts
 

they own everything





This Room
 

The room I entered was a dream of this room.
Surely all those feet on the sofa were mine.
The oval portrait
of a dog was me at an early age.
Something shimmers, something is hushed up.

We had macaroni for lunch every day
except Sunday, when a small quail was induced
to be served to us. Why do I tell you these things?
You are not even here.





Uppity
 

Roads around mountains
cause we can't drive
through

That's Poetry
to Me.





The Islands of Africa
 

to Rimbaud
Two pages to a grape fable
dangles the swan of samite blood
shaping sand from thistle covered fog
Over sacred lakes of fever
(polished mouths of the vegetable frog
rolling to my iron venus)
I drop the chiseled pear
Standing in smoke filled valleys
(great domains of wingless flight
and the angel's fleshy gun)
I stamp the houses of withering wax
Bells of siren-teeth (singing to our tomb
refusal's last becoming)
await the approach of the incendiary children
lighting the moon-shaped beast

Every twisted river pulls down my torn-out hair
to ratless columns by the pyramid's ghost
(watered basin of the temple stink)
and all the mud clocks in haste
draw their mermaid-feather swords
(wrapped by Dust) to nail them
into the tears of the sea-gull child
The winter web minute
flutters beneath the spider's goblet
and the whores of all the fathers
bleed for my delight





Witness
 

Because the dark suit is worn it is worn warm 
    with a black tie 
and a kiss at the head of the stairs

When you hear the dark suit rip 
on the heart's curb the hurt is big 
     rose flesh caught on the orange woman's buttons

As you talk metropole monotone
                  antique intelligence 
as you dress wounds by peyotl looming the boulevards 
women hunt their children from you 
who look out
                  lit still inside of a dark suit

Spring 1963





Sunday Morning
 

I 

Complacencies of the peignoir, and late 
Coffee and oranges in a sunny chair, 
And the green freedom of a cockatoo 
Upon a rug mingle to dissipate 
The holy hush of ancient sacrifice. 
She dreams a little, and she feels the dark 
Encroachment of that old catastrophe, 
As a calm darkens among water-lights. 
The pungent oranges and bright, green wings 
Seem things in some procession of the dead, 
Winding across wide water, without sound. 
The day is like wide water, without sound, 
Stilled for the passing of her dreaming feet 
Over the seas, to silent Palestine, 
Dominion of the blood and sepulchre. 


       II 

Why should she give her bounty to the dead? 
What is divinity if it can come 
Only in silent shadows and in dreams? 
Shall she not find in comforts of the sun, 
In pungent fruit and bright, green wings, or else 
In any balm or beauty of the earth, 
Things to be cherished like the thought of heaven? 
Divinity must live within herself: 
Passions of rain, or moods in falling snow; 
Grievings in loneliness, or unsubdued 
Elations when the forest blooms; gusty 
Emotions on wet roads on autumn nights; 
All pleasures and all pains, remembering 
The bough of summer and the winter branch. 
These are the measures destined for her soul. 


       III 

Jove in the clouds had his inhuman birth. 
No mother suckled him, no sweet land gave 
Large-mannered motions to his mythy mind. 
He moved among us, as a muttering king, 
Magnificent, would move among his hinds, 
Until our blood, commingling, virginal, 
With heaven, brought such requital to desire 
The very hinds discerned it, in a star. 
Shall our blood fail? Or shall it come to be 
The blood of paradise? And shall the earth 
Seem all of paradise that we shall know? 
The sky will be much friendlier then than now, 
A part of labor and a part of pain, 
And next in glory to enduring love, 
Not this dividing and indifferent blue. 


       IV 

She says, "I am content when wakened birds, 
Before they fly, test the reality 
Of misty fields, by their sweet questionings; 
But when the birds are gone, and their warm fields 
Return no more, where, then, is paradise? 
There is not any haunt of prophecy, 
Nor any old chimera of the grave, 
Neither the golden underground, nor isle 
Melodious, where spirits gat them home, 
Nor visionary south, nor cloudy palm 
Remote on heaven's hill, that has endured 
As April's green endures; or will endure 
Like her remembrance of awakened birds, 
Or her desire for June and evening, tipped 
By the consummation of the swallow's wings. 


       V 

She says, "But in contentment I still feel 
The need of some imperishable bliss. 
Death is the mother of beauty; hence from her, 
Alone, shall come fulfilment to our dreams 
And our desires. Although she strews the leaves 
Of sure obliteration on our paths, 
The path sick sorrow took, the many paths 
Where triumph rang its brassy phrase, or love 
Whispered a little out of tenderness, 
She makes the willow shiver in the sun 
For maidens who were wont to sit and gaze 
Upon the grass, relinquished to their feet. 
She causes boys to pile new plums and pears 
On disregarded plate. The maidens taste 
And stray impassioned in the littering leaves. 


       VI 

Is there no change of death in paradise? 
Does ripe fruit never fall? Or do the boughs 
Hang always heavy in that perfect sky, 
Unchanging, yet so like our perishing earth, 
With rivers like our own that seek for seas 
They never find, the same receding shores 
That never touch with inarticulate pang? 
Why set the pear upon those river banks 
Or spice the shores with odors of the plum? 
Alas, that they should wear our colors there, 
The silken weavings of our afternoons, 
And pick the strings of our insipid lutes! 
Death is the mother of beauty, mystical, 
Within whose burning bosom we devise 
Our earthly mothers waiting, sleeplessly. 


       VII 

Supple and turbulent, a ring of men 
Shall chant in orgy on a summer morn 
Their boisterous devotion to the sun, 
Not as a god, but as a god might be, 
Naked among them, like a savage source. 
Their chant shall be a chant of paradise, 
Out of their blood, returning to the sky; 
And in their chant shall enter, voice by voice, 
The windy lake wherein their lord delights, 
The trees, like serafin, and echoing hills, 
That choir among themselves long afterward. 
They shall know well the heavenly fellowship 
Of men that perish and of summer morn. 
And whence they came and whither they shall go 
The dew upon their feet shall manifest. 


       VIII 

She hears, upon that water without sound, 
A voice that cries, "The tomb in Palestine 
Is not the porch of spirits lingering. 
It is the grave of Jesus, where he lay. 
We live in an old chaos of the sun, 
Or old dependency of day and night, 
Or island solitude, unsponsored, free, 
Of that wide water, inescapable. 
Deer walk upon our mountains, and the quail 
Whistle about us their spontaneous cries; 
Sweet berries ripen in the wilderness; 
And, in the isolation of the sky, 
At evening, casual flocks of pigeons make 
Ambiguous undulations as they sink, 
Downward to darkness, on extended wings.





A Little Washington DC Dream
 

The Due D'Aumal's cannonballs
Are being marshmellowed 370 years from their masonic inception
Now lie on the Potomac
The Due D'Aumal's balls cannonaded
Split
Through mirror teeth Washington D.C.
Black City of white rectangular bits of fear
Blown fluff of fear
O the Duke of Aumal's balls are raging
Yellow vermin white houses of fear
And beautiful funky people
Diamond heart D'Afrique
Human blood human need
Black booming emotional vibes of life
White geometry of abstract cerebral death
I really saw at Fort McNair
In front of American General's mansion
A fir-tree tied down to a black coffiny box
Jefferson's phantom always rides tonight
There's a solar splendor burst from Eighteenth-Century Cannon of the Due D'Aumal
I'm sure Citizen Lafayette was no dixiecrat





Meadowlark West
 

Choppers in the night husk the brilliants of thought
Beyond the cities of patina grow caves of thought
Coyote Hummingbird Owl are rivers of thought
The lumens the pumpkins dance: pits of correspondence over the land
Birds the dream tongues warble Iroquois Mojav Ohlone
Market Street of "The Mad Doctor via the occult centers
A gang of fox spirits at the crossroads
Bandoleros set between the obliteration of grizzly bears painted by an Arcimboldist and the monstrance of bleeding chains 
Montezuma's feathery headdress torn up in the boondocks of the Rosy Cross

Coyote girls in myth-time 
At the central dream of edenic treasures
The irrevocable annihilation of christian civilization is taking shape with carnivorous flowers of volcanic thought





Some Feel Rain
 

Some feel rain. Some feel the beetle startle
in its ghost-part when the bark
slips. Some feel musk. Asleep against
each other in the whiskey dark, scarcely there.
When it falls apart, some feel the moondark air
drop its motes to the patch-thick slopes of
snow. Tiny blinkings of ice from the oak,
a boot-beat that comes and goes, the line of prayer
you can follow from the dusking wind to the snowy owl
it carries. Some feel sunlight
well up in blood-vessels below the skin
and wish there had been less to lose.
Knowing how it could have been, pale maples
drowsing like a second sleep above our temperaments.
Do I imagine there is any place so safe it can't be
snapped? Some feel the rivers shift,
blue veins through soil, as if the smokestacks were a long
dream of exhalation. The lynx lets its paws
skim the ground in snow and showers.
The wildflowers scatter in warm tints until
the second they are plucked. You can wait
to scrape the ankle-burrs, you can wait until Mercury
the early star underdraws the night and its blackest
districts. And wonder. Why others feel
through coal-thick night that deeply colored garnet
star. Why sparring and pins are all you have.
Why the earth cannot make its way towards you.





What Is (War)
 

And if all those who meet or even
hear of you become witness to what you are--

a white country of blight beneath the last snows of 
spring. Could we remain quiet on earth

and bear it, the war we make inside
what is--it's a long time to be here, to be still,

to feel the rot inside now--bone-scrap, char, sheets of stars 
at the edge of a field where we are once again

taken from ourselves. Could we remain here, 
witness to grief, one last bright dire call-and-reply,

each birdsong or siren extinguished where some 
trueness abides, some portion we have lost our right

to claim or know. It comes into any mind that would 
perceive it, leaf-rot, speech-rot, the deliberate ribcage

of the deer, these abrupt chalk cliffs over which 
the confused animals fling themselves, and you,

obscure, receive no response that is not suffered 
as the days grow long and distortions

come to seem the natural course of things-- 
what trees whose creatures stray into space--

and they find they cannot land though the eyelid 
struggles open--no answer, no resolution--

a window opened to the mute green world, 
weedy and driftless, a wind drilling rain, dirt,

the parameters of uncertainty, of hope,
what we might be against what we have done,

bees crawling through the lips of the one
who would say the earth turned into sour flesh--

What strange rooms, what soundless movement of sky 
over desert where the flesh again is beaten

and the emptiness extends itself while some old man 
looks on, a raptor in waiting, the sand-field

around them blown thinly toward sun--no longer 
ourselves in the afternoons, evenings,

weak, vague, clutched at the mouth-- 
because we did nothing, because we lost count.





Half Omen Half Hope
 

When everything finally has been wrecked and further shipwrecked, 
When their most ardent dream has been made hollow and unrecognizable, 
They will feel inside their limbs the missing shade of blue that lingers 
Against hills in the cooler hours before dark, and the moss at the foot of the forest
When green starts to leave it. What they take into their privacy (half of his embrace,
Her violence at play) are shadows of acts which have no farewells in them. 
Moons unearth them. And when, in their separate dwellings, their bodies 
Feel the next season come, they no longer have anyone to whom 
To tell it. Clouds of reverie pass outside the window and a strange emptiness 
Peers back in. If they love, it is solely to be adored, it is to scatter and gather
Themselves like hard seeds in a field made fallow by a fire someone years ago set. 
In the quiet woods, from the highest trees, there is always something 
Weightless falling; and he, who must realize that certain losses are irreparable, 
Tells himself at night, before the darkest mirror, that vision keeps him whole.

On the verge of warm and simple sleep they tell themselves certain loves 
Are like sheets of dark water, or ice forests, or husks of ships. To stop a thing 
Such as this would be to halve a sound that travels out from a silent person's 
Thoughts. The imprint they make on each other's bodies is worth any pain 
They may have caused. Quiet falls around them. And when she reaches 
For him the air greens like underwater light and the well-waters drop. 
They will see again the shadows of insects.
They will touch the bark and feel each age of the tree fly undisturbed 
Into them. If what is no longer present in them cannot be restored, 
It can at least be offered. Through long bewildered dusks, stalks grow; 
Rains fill and pass out of clouds; animals hover at the edges of fields 
With eyes like black pools. For nothing cannot be transformed; 
Pleasure and failure feed each other daily. Do not think any breeze, 
Any grain of light, shall be withheld. All the stars will sail out for them.





Auroras
 

It began in a foyer of evenings 
The evenings left traces of glass in the trees 
A book and a footpath we followed 
Under throat-pipes of birds

We moved through a room of leaves 
Thin streams of silver buried under our eyes 
A field of white clover buried under our eyes 
Or a river we stopped at to watch 
The wind cross it, recross it

Room into room you paused
Where once on a stoop we leaned back
Talking late into daylight
The morning trees shook off twilight
Opening and closing our eyes auroras

Beyond groves and flora we followed a road 
Dotted with polished brown bottles, 
Scoured furrows, a wood emptied of trees

It was enough to hollow us out
The evenings left grasses half-wild at our feet
Branches with spaces for winds

The earth changes
The way we speak to each other has changed 
As for a long while we stood in a hall full of exits 
Listening for a landscape beyond us





Apology
 

Lately, too much disturbed, you stay trailing in me
and I believe you. How could I not feel
you were misspent, there by books stacked clean on glass,
or outside the snow arriving as I am still arriving.
If the explanations amount to something, I will tell you.
It is enough, you say, that surfaces grow so distant.
Maybe you darken, already too much changed,
maybe in your house you would be content where
no incident emerges, but for smoke or glass or air,
such things held simply to be voiceless.
And if you mean me, I believe you.
Or if you should darken, this inwardness would be misspent,
and flinching I might pause, and add to these meager
incidents the words. Some books
should stay formal on the shelves.
So surely I heard you, in your complication aware,
snow holding where it might weightless rest,
and should you fold into me--trackless, misspent,
too much arranged--I might believe you
but swiftly shut, lines of smoke rising through snow,
here where it seems no good word emerges.
Though it is cold, I am aware such reluctance
could lose these blinking hours to simple safety.
Here is an inwardless purpose.
In these hours when snow shuts, it may be we empty,
amounting to something. How could I not
wait for those few words, which we might enter.





Introduction
 

It had to be from someone whose grandparents were born in Shanghai
not the city's greatest citizens, but certainly among the sober ones
to make their small now eroded mark
It had to be from a distant or dissolute descendant (yes, moi)
who can sing praises unworthy of even a flicker of your attention

Doesn't this sound like it might turn into a love poem or a prayer
Well, you are wrong, because a man of the people,
which I am not nor will I ever be,
doesn't single out one above all others
as this is a hierarchical construction
and therefore undemocratic and antihumanist

It had to be from someone whose virtues do not include stubbornness, 
patience, gentleness, loyalty, or truthfulness

It had to be from someone who could take my place 
after I left the room 
never to return

It had to be from someone who didn't exist
before this poem
began writing itself down





A Sheaf of Pleasant Voices
 

There are rooftops 
made of cloud remnants

gathered by a trader
dabbling in car parts and burlap

At night, I dive onto the breeze 
fermenting above the dirt

and dream that I am a crocodile
a tin of shoe polish, an audience of two

In the morning, before the smallest yawn 
becomes a noodle, I am offered

a ribbon of yellow smoke
I opt for fuzzy rocks and clawed water

and, of course, the perishable window 
I am one of the last computer

chain errors to be illuminated 
I tell you there are rooftops

on which the moon stops 
being a cold jewel

And one by one the mountains 
begin their descent from

the chambers of a lost book





Broken Sonnet
 

The world weeps. There are no tears
To be found. It is deemed a miracle.
The president appears on screens
In villages and towns, in cities in jungles
And jungles still affectionately called cities.
He appears on screens and reads a story.
Whose story is he reading and why?
What lessons are to be learned from this story
About a time that has not arrived, will not arrive, is here?
Time of fire and images of fire climbing toward the sun
Time of precious and semi-precious liquids
Time of a man and a woman doused in ink
Rolling across streams and down valleys
Trying to leave some string of words behind.





Thought Experiment: Twin Earth and the Glass of Water*
 

That was the day your mesmerized went awol on the shore. Each star, you said, was the same star. Beneath our sunny beach blanket an anonymous moisture spread like fur. It's getting dark and darker.
Dusk is hard. Gossip travels worst when it's low-contrast out; it stalls, and the air begins to crack. Droplets black as blood squeeze through fissures, making night.
What came from above--the forestscan, the cornucump, the mar--came violently on our feet. Finally, when it was time to order, you pulled yourself up from the syntax we'd shared and beckoned for me to come. It's just like rain, I said, as if to make amends. Every arm is the same arm, you replied, and took mine.
* In which an unwitting traveler to a parallel universe, offered trum and toke all night, drinks himself out of his depth to drown the unknown source of his discomfort.
        




Compound Hibernation
 

Those who glance about me
who cease to see inside the Sun
who cease to imagine its destabilized pre-quanta
cannot know me
cannot know my ethos as pumice
as mingled apparition or flare

my perception through the prior sun that I ingest
like a blackened pre-existence
or collected hawks through assignation

the Sun
with its dualisms
with its pre-biotic photons which waver

perhaps
9 suns before the Sun existed 
before the oceans seemed formed 
there were molecular drafts

akashic precursors 
floating proto-ammonia

I think of carbon 
& wisps 
& floodings

of feral combat shelter 
where blank geometry accrues

before separable biology was born
before the contradictory ballast of de-existent protozoa

being scorching photon by abstentia 
like a pre-atomic sigil 
destabilized as blizzard

a pre-cognitive rotation
a strange galvanics of the cosmos

& because of this galvanics
one reeks of invisible tremor
walking around in league with daunting helium affliction

thus
the mirrors in my skin like haunted salamander fluid
like cells bereft with cooling centigrade rotation

therefore
I know the abyss as volatile lunar transposition
as sub-liminal mantis as climbing
as splintering

therefore I am not
an oily or blasphemous yogin
collapsing in default by sudden anger or water

yet I am compound
struggling with scattered mental a-rhythmia
with partial psychic aphasia
intensive
illusive
aloof by interior compounding





Thought Experiment: Mary in the Black-and-White Room*
 

Some things lock in competition, like an earthquake and a kiss. While a decision is waiting to be made, neither side of the argument progresses. The earthquake, though eager to prove its claim, shows valiant restraint; the kiss? It knows the power of bitten tongues.
Such stand-offs as these precede most gains (stance of knowing too much and fearing too late). The tongues, shaking along with the house, say nothing shattering at all.
With progress, not only earthquakes but kisses will be predicted. The last fine line between feeling and fact will choose a good point, and end. Flattery will continue to make us immortal in the difficult years between the first word and the lost.

* In which Mary, herself a palette of grays, inhabitant of a universe void of color, gains access to the complete scientific story of what makes red red--and reads it.





Cant
 

for Thomas Green Bethune
Thar he blows! Plus, tusks 
crushed into grins, grins 
host to, guest of, impish

Nature, her fort/da "jewels
glassified behind blank
opposable pupils--Ahabit perfected

("perhaps memory) by/for the dicey 
Veil. Auto-didact/-dialectics 
staged in rent-to-rent

"crowded houses, asea to har-har-
poon Terrible Tom's tom-tom 
stutter--VAC  C . Gone

but for "language, music, 
imitation and perhaps memory.
Owns no umbrella to forget to splay

open like a bucket. Can't cast 
down, can't go singin' in 
the there.





Descant
 

I left my heart in the teeth of jumper-cables-- 
black tongue, superfluous nipples . . .

By The Time I hit the yellow tape-- 
it was already turning red . . .

Of my fair and alabaster love?
My redundant chains drawn in chalk?

Halfway to the stars I stopped-- 
turned, spat--it's too late, baby . . .






Earth Light: I
 

Doors open and shut.
We've come to the place where nothing shines.
I hear eternity
Is self-forgetting.  Interiors warm with the nightmare of guests and poetry
And you.  Everything darkly
Reverent years of reading about death eluded.
Bled
Back from the ear sidestepping your bullets bloom in on ye lay
Rock.  Rud.  Spread
So swiftly tastes like mud.  Dredged mud off
The corpse sled hushed down woodsmoke.
Said the stars thrum on Marie
Marie.  Hold on tight.
In the depths of outer space
Is man.





Lullaby [For Charles Baudelaire]
 

Lie me down to heal in sleep, do not let me wake
In sin, the tongue 
Cancels another year, another painted storm
In the coral caves, some pious poet
Drunk on vapors
Swatting tomb-bats in the nightwood, would that
Wayward bark sunned white
Be also thunder, a hill of bones drumming--thud
Thud, a wake
Of buzzards braiding into the loosening skull--the redoubled fists
Of students like an island in the bramble chained--I have been told
To reason, lawless, empty, without rights--
But I am old
Not age, I have been told
To match its columns by our footfall, prophet--I am not
The straw or garland of our Sirens, not the brow
Of holly, nor the warble
Of any lark





The Soul has Bandaged moments - (360)
 

The Soul has Bandaged moments - 
When too appalled to stir -
She feels some ghastly Fright come up
And stop to look at her -

Salute her, with long fingers -
Caress her freezing hair -
Sip, Goblin, from the very lips
The Lover - hovered - o'er -
Unworthy, that a thought so mean
Accost a Theme - so - fair -

The soul has moments of escape -
When bursting all the doors -
She dances like a Bomb, abroad, 
And swings opon the Hours,

As do the Bee - delirious borne -
Long Dungeoned from his Rose -
Touch Liberty - then know no more -
But Noon, and Paradise 

The Soul's retaken moments -
When, Felon led along, 
With shackles on the plumed feet, 
And staples, in the song,

The Horror welcomes her, again, 
These, are not brayed of Tongue -





Banish Air from Air -(963)
 

Banish Air from Air -
Divide Light if you dare -
They'll meet
While Cubes in a Drop
Or Pellets of Shape
Fit -
Films cannot annul
Odors return whole
Force Flame
And with a Blonde push
Over your impotence
Flits Steam.





A not admitting of the wound (1188)
 

A not admitting of the wound
Until it grew so wide
That all my Life had entered it
And there were troughs beside - 

A closing of the simple lid that opened to the sun
Until the tender Carpenter
Perpetual nail it down -





In this short Life that only lasts an hour (1292)
 

In this short Life that only lasts an hour
How much - how little - is within our power





I never hear that one is dead (1325)
 

I never hear that one is dead
Without the chance of Life
Afresh annihilating me
That mightiest Belief,

Too mighty for the Daily mind
That tilling it's abyss,
Had Madness, had it once or, Twice
The yawning Consciousness,

Beliefs are Bandaged, like the Tongue
When Terror were it told
In any Tone commensurate
Would strike us instant Dead - 

I do not know the man so bold
He dare in lonely Place
That awful stranger - Consciousness
Deliberately face -





The Mushroom is the Elf of Plants - (1350)
 

The Mushroom is the Elf of Plants - 
At Evening, it is not
At Morning, in a Truffled Hut
It stop opon a Spot

As if it tarried always
And yet it's whole Career
Is shorter than a Snake's Delay - 
And fleeter than a Tare - 

'Tis Vegetation's Juggler - 
The Germ of Alibi - 
Doth like a Bubble antedate
And like a Bubble, hie - 

I feel as if the Grass was pleased
To have it intermit - 
This surreptitious Scion
Of Summer's circumspect.

Had Nature any supple Face
Or could she one contemn - 
Had Nature an Apostate - 
That Mushroom - it is Him!





Glass was the Street - in Tinsel Peril (1518)
 

Glass was the Street - in Tinsel Peril
Tree and Traveller stood.
Filled was the Air with merry venture
Hearty with Boys the Road.

Shot the lithe Sleds like Shod vibrations
Emphacized and gone
It is the Past's supreme italic
Makes the Present mean -





Very Large Moth
 

After D.H.L.
Your first thought when the light snaps on and the black wings
             clatter about the kitchen       is a bat

the clear part of your mind considers rabies       the other part
             does not consider       knows only to startle

and cower away from the slap of its wings       though it is soon
             clearly not a bat but a moth       and harmless

still you are shy of it       it clings to the hood of the stove
             not black but brown       its orange eyes sparkle

like televisions       its leg joints are large enough to count
             how could you kill it       where would you hide the body

a creature so solid must have room for a soul
            and if this is so       why not in a creature

half its size       or half its size again       and so on
             down to the ants       clearly it must be saved

caught in a shopping bag and rushed to the front door
             afraid to crush it       feeling the plastic rattle

loosened into the night air       it batters the porch light
             throwing fitful shadows around the landing

That was a really big moth       is all you can say to the doorman
             who has watched your whole performance with a smile

the half-compassion and half-horror we feel for the creatures
             we want not to hurt       and prefer not to touch





Lines for painting on grains of rice
 

For Rebecca
You are the kind of person who buys exotic fruits
             leaves them out on the counter until they rot
You always mean to eat them       sometimes you rearrange them
             rousing over the bowl a cloud of tiny flies


                                            &

How do they balance       the parrot who chews a walnut
             sideways       holding it up in his right foot
the owl perched on a just-lit lamppost
             scratching behind its ear       like a big dog

                                            &

Your pencil eraser wears down long before the point
             for every word you write       you rub out two

                                            &

Where the slice of toast rested       the plate is still warm
            a film of fog       little points of dew

                                            &

Love is like velocity       we feel the speeding up
            and the slowing down       otherwise not at all
the more steady       the more it feels like going nowhere
            my love I want to go nowhere with you

                                            &

I cannot bring myself to toss the cup of cold coffee
       you set down by the door on your way to the taxi
all day I have sipped it       each time forgetting
       your two tablets of fake sugar       too sweet

                                            &

Running down the street
        dodging between raindrops plump as cherries

                                            &

The ground was feathered with wild strawberries
        I picked seven       as many as I could bear
I ate two       I saved the rest for you       here
        hold out your hand       take them       taste how sweet

                                            &

Please hold me the forgotten way       the wall pleads
        spray-paint face and voice of a damned poet
the darling damned poets       save them from themselves
        maybe it is us they need saving from





Pitahaya
 

Teach me a fruit of your
country I asked and so you dipped
into a shop and in your hand
held me a thick yellow pinecone

no knife between us
you put it to your teeth
sideways like a bird and bit
and peeled away the fleshy
scales or were they petals

crisp white at the core
peppered with black seeds
sweet and light like a cold cloud
like some exotic sherbet carried
hand over hand from a mountaintop
by a relay of runners straightway
to the Inca's high table

we sat on metal chairs
still pebbled with rain the seat
of my pants damp we passed it
back and forth no matter how
carefully we could not help

spilling the juice making
our cheeks sticky our fingers
getting sticky our fingers no
not even once touching





Mulberry
 

You have towered here
leaning half over the wall
all my awareness

years before I knew
what silkworm was or China
I felt your berries

pulp under my feet
tracked your purple all over
grandmother's carpet

a sapling planted
by some sea captain to make
shade for a future

This winter you lost
one of your long low branches
to a backed-up car

and the old woman
who has known you all her life
wept at the split wood

Your bark is wrinkled
more deeply than any face
you live so slowly

do our voices sound
to you like the fluttering
of paper moth wings

do we seem rootless
holding fast to the anchor
of the saddest things





Personally Engraved
 

There are many opportunities here for unrequited friendship,
the offer letter said. All you need is a chain saw and die grinder.

In this spirit I force my eyes across your message,
revisiting that due diligence tone you do so well.

I'm searching for some whispered twist or shout,
but all emotion's leveled, the way a child will draw

a snowman and a mansion the same size.
What is a dedicated icemaker

dedicated to? Do you really think
those shades you wear above your head

will keep the sun out of your mind?
Rainbows stick to any abject object.

That's why I'm wearing that same old funky dress.
When you kissed my forehead it felt like the priest's

thumbscrew touch rubbing in the dust-
thou-art Ash Wednesday smudge.

I've learned the dance instructor's expository gestures.
Now I'm learning tangos to be danced alone.

While comrades buff officious cases
barfed from their brains--

eight parts moon venom one part nose waste--
I ask can mine be personally engraved?

I'm living in a please state, smarming
how I've long admired your hardscape of artists

morphed to small appliances. That being said,
I'm having issues. Do you really think

that scarf will keep your snowman warm?





"Make It New
 

I find it helpful to imagine writing in a blizzard
             with every inscription

designed to prevent snow
             crystals from drifting in.

Avoid the hive mind. Go fly a kite,
raise a stained glass window in the sky.

It's the opposite of making love to drudgery,
             what I do for a dying.

       Remove the bitter sediment
trapped in the brewer. It will be new

whether you make it new
or not. It will be full of neo-

shadows. Full of then--both past and next,
iridescent with suspense. Remember

             time is not the treasure revealer.
More a midge larva creeping

through a waterfall releasing
suction feet. The curiosity rover

       lands on Mars! New is a hooligan.
It breaks the reckoning frame and rests

in pieces. Let me collect its dna
from the tears on your desk.





You Own It
 

For your birthday, I'm learning to pop champagne corks
with a cossack sword when all you asked for was world peace.
I'm actioning the deliverables to wish you many happy returns

of the ecstasies that are imminent when all you requested
was a contentment so quiet it's inaudible. Remember when
I gave you a robe of black silk that floats and does not rustle?
When all you desired was to turn from what was finished and hard

in the darkness. And when you said I gave you what I wanted
myself I gave you what I didn't want: gift certificates to spas
that wax hearts, a blind date with the inventor of friction.

Today I bring an actual-size sunrise and many glow words 
from the inmates of this late-stage civilization who navigate
in your slipstream and to whom you say keep rowing.

When you were born you were placed on a small throne on castors 
while the Stop Shopping Choir sang hosannas, a defining
moment. People noticed something nascent about you

that persists in your fondness for the first person primordial.
You own it. You know why voices die in throats

and trees struggle in silence: the deepest trauma cannot
spare a sound. If you meet a mystery you do not disturb it

with little picks and suction things. You say the shape
of happiness is too fine for capture spray, and it is well
to remember the days when plastic boxes snapping shut were all
that women had to celebrate. Yet it is not seditious to rebel
against a culture like circus music, so cheerful

we'd need a cadaver tendon to fix it. That's what
you say. You are hard to fathom as a guttering compass
that is neither hush nor howl. I'm thinking of the time

you placed an Aeolian harp in the window, took me
by the notebook, and asked me to consider why

turkeys bob their heads when they walk and geese don't
though they both waddle. You watched my ethereality show
and commiserated when they adorned my rival

in a deconsecrated rosary bead bikini and send her to St. Barts
while I was remaindered to an orange jumpsuit organ-swiping plot.
That century I was betrayed by a dedicated icemaker,
you burned a feather pen to revive me. You tried

my device that prevents accidental workplace nudity, vetted
its magnetic veils, and at Christmas sent fruitcake
privacy filters. Remember when I was dismissed as overness

consultant? How you resigned in solidarity and grew
a sky-colored flower since I could not be satisfied
with the sky itself? You gave me a robe of black silk that floats
and does not rustle and advised me to turn from what was finished

and hard in the darkness. If I critiqued the treasure revealer
you said do not test its softness against your cheek.
Today I raise my glass of wheat grass and atmospheric information

to wish you every beyond of thought in which to consider
all that is majorly good. I won't sing Happy Birthday,
a song so overdetermined it sounds bereaved.

I'll sing of passions that persist in the Elysian Fields.
Though shackled to a boulder at the moment, I'm unpacking
boxes from your last move, wrapping the contents

in recycled moonlight and presenting them to you
as objects exactly forgotten and largely

what you wanted. I nerve myself for the encounter.





Vessels
 

Shouldn't it ache, this slit 
into the sweet
and salt mix of waters 

comprising the mussel, 
its labial meats 
winged open: yellow- 

fleshed, black and gray
around the tough
adductor? It hurts

to imagine it, regardless
of the harvester's
denials, swiveling 

his knife to make 
the incision: one
dull cyst nicked

from the oyster's 
mantle--its thread of red 
gland no bigger

than a seed 
of trout roe--pressed 
inside the tendered

flesh. Both hosts eased
open with a knife 
(as if anything

could be said to be eased
with a knife): 
so that one pearl

after another can be 
harvested, polished, 
added to others 

until a single rope is strung 
on silk. Linked 
by what you think

is pain. Nothing 
could be so roughly 
handled and yet feel 

so little, your pity 
turned into part of this 
production: you 

with your small,
four-chambered heart, 
shyness, hungers, envy: what

could be so precious 
you'd cleave 
another to keep it

close? Imagine 
the weeks it takes to wind 
nacre over the red

seed placed at the other 
heart's mantle. 
The mussel 

become what no one 
wants to:
vessel, caisson, wounded 

into making us 
the thing we want
to call beautiful.





Ode to Browsing the Web
 

Two spiky-haired Russian cats hit kick flips 
on a vert ramp. The camera pans to another

pocket of the room where six kids rocking holey
T-shirts etch aerosol lines on warehouse walls

in words I cannot comprehend. All of this
happening in a time no older than your last

heartbeat. I've been told the internet is
an unholy place--an endless intangible

stumbling ground of false deities 
dogma and loneliness, sad as a pile of shit

in a world without flies. My loneliness exists 
in every afterthought. Yesterday, I watched

a neighbor braid intricate waves of cornrows
into her son's tiny head and could have lived 

in her focus-wrinkled brow for a living. Today
I think I practice the religion of blinking too much.

Today, I know no neighbor's name and won't
know if I like it or not. O holy streaming screen 

of counterculture punks, linger my lit mind
on landing strips--through fog, rain, hail--

without care for time or density. O world
wide web, o viral video, o god of excrement 

thought. Befriend me. Be fucking infectious.
Move my eyes from one sight to the next.





Summer
 

Today you find yourself guilty
as the rim you split
an egg against
You press charges
You spell out your name
like the letters are medals
for good conduct in a bad war
The night moves in with you
into your room
until even your sleep
is not your own
Through the window
the grass tells you
to give up
and you are trying
but on the other hand
things keep you:
the moon, the cars, cars
You undress yourself
more deeply down
like this is the way
to get to the future
You let the darkness
medically examine you
So much can't be
put back together
To burn the house down
to burn the house up
It's the same problem
in any direction
You're matter
You turn on the light





Pursuits
 

It is not that you want
to be the one to make prints
in the untrampled snow
It is that you want
to be in the snow
without having touched it
to be of the snow
not beginning
Everywhere commerce
dictates the shapes
that move you along
that seat you at the table
far from the snow
far from the act
of not touching 
It only gets worse
A girl's gotta eat
And your hunger's 
not even your own





I Cant Swim
 

I can't swim because I can't fit
into the water

                         I am 
two million feet tall

but thank you for inviting me

I am standing in line
inside my giant shirt

If someone wanted to weaponize me
they would tell me to lie down on New York

and the city I destroyed
would hurt me back

I eat stars
                         It's a riot

I know
                         my big mouth
full of their light





Another Moon
 

Mama said 
it only existed in storybooks 

with its soft surface 
of bluebells 

but there it was 
spinning so close to the earth 

that it bent
every weather vane in Omaha 

it was prom night

and I thought I'd pluck a few 
trumpets

to bring your Grandma 

so I pulled our red ladder out 
of the garage 

and climbed to the roof 

I stood up 
and imagined I was balancing 

the moon on my head 

the narrow windows of Union 
Station 

gleamed like ice chips 

and the thin faces of the clock 
tower told me 

it was almost eight 

I was going to be late picking 
Nancy up 

if I didn't get a move on 

so I snipped off the best stems 
and hurried 

back down to my Ford 

I sped through every stop sign 
on my way 

to her parents' house 

she was waiting with her arms 
crossed 

trying not to look upset 

I think she thought 
she was going to get stood up 

so when I popped open 
the door 

and told her to get in 
she couldn't help smiling a bit 

she asked 
what'd taken me so long

and I figured I should go ahead 

and give her the flowers
I'd brought her 

I'd set them
back behind the steering wheel 

to not ruin the surprise 

I told her she was the princess 
and I was the knight

who rode into the stars

so he could flare 
their notes to her on a blue horn





praise song
 

praise the Hennessy, the brown 
shine, the dull burn. praise 
the dare, the take it, the no face 
you're supposed to make.
praise the house, its many rooms,
hardwood and butter leather couches;
its richness. praise the rich, their friendship.
praise the friends: the child of the well off,
the child of the well off, the child of well,
the child of welfare, the child of welfare.
praise the diversity but praise the Hennessy,
and again,           and again.           praise 
the new year upon us. praise my stumble,
the shaky eye, the fluid arm, but the steady 
hand. praise my hand, the burning it has.
praise the dive into the gut of a friend; the dousing 
of my hand in his ribs. praise the softness of skin, 
the way it always gives.

praise the pulling, the calming down.

praise the fuck that, the jump back into all 
five of my friends fist first. praise all 
five of my friends pinning me into the thick 
carpet, knees in my back. praise my back,
how it hurts and raises anyway, how it flips, 
how it's the best friend of my fists.
praise the swinging pool cue, how it whips 
air like a disobedient child, praise the disobedient 
and all the chilling           i won't do.
praise the child smile on my face, the fun 
plunging a knee into a cheek of my best friend.
praise his blood, the brightness of it, a sun i bask in.
praise my blood, the nose flowing wild with effort, 
the mess and taste of it, praise the swallowing,
salt and its sweetness.

praise the morning, the impossible blue, 
Midwestern January above us. praise 
the blues dulled in my denim by all 
the brown. praise the brown shine, the dull 
burn.

praise all six in my jeans, our salt 
and life sitting dry on my thighs
mixing, refusing to wash away.





After a row
 

A lapwing somersaults spring
flips over winter and back.

After a fast walk up long hills, my limbs
the engine of thought, where burn
bubbles into beck and clough to gill,
beneath a sandstone cliff balanced on a bed of shale
and held from hurtling by Scots pine
that brush a scrubby sky with cloud snow scutters,
I found a place to sit
                 by snapping watta smacking rocks
and wondered--how would it be for you?

And so, alone,
                  un-alone even, in my anger,
bring you here.





Prologue
 

When my lover became my enemy 
I made my bed amongst winds 
and drove the old road 'till my heart crashed.
Where's the bypass?

Washing my shirts, wringing them out.
Hung in the breeze. 

Water skips 
                  undressed 
over outcrops.

What it says is.

Wind,
roots in rock. 

Lying on Long Tongue,
sun diffused in mist.
Easy sleep 
without waking.

Edge of 
      displaced echoes 
air around
and sound
      of bird and 'plane

A swallow's glittering chitter.





anabatic
 

at first they recce,
      easy, 
around the edge of breath

then gathered gangs unleash
and breach 

but the wind has no objective,
riding the slope of my roof





Most People Would Rather Not
 

Most people would rather not,
but I indulge, every few weeks,
the thought of it. Sometimes

the oily smell of an evening flower appears
and hangs in the air, a slightly browner spot.

I think most people had it wrong when they said
forget about it and find a fresh patch  
of grass to lie down in.  

There are prayers, though,
about that kind of peace.  

I have to admit, sometimes
I want nothing more than to be lying on the bottom
of an unimpressive river.  

I can watch all the leaves and sticks skim over my head,
and no one will bother me  
because they're swimming
in the more impressive rivers.

The water's not too cold. It doesn't feel
like being dead.

It also doesn't feel like being old
or fetal.

I came to the humble water to lie down.
I did what I set out to do.
Now I don't have to tell you
anything more about it.





Growing a Bear
 

Growing a bear--a midnight occupation, 
the need for which you perhaps first realized
when you saw the wrong kind of shadow 

under your chin--a convex when you expected
concave, so now it's clear
you're getting older. Your wife was in the shower

and you wanted to step inside
and soap her up like you did in college when she said

"I'll shower with you, but I'm leaving
my underwear on, and you enjoyed her
in every way you could enjoy a person with soap.

You didn't join your wife in the shower.
She's gotten funny about letting you see her
shave her legs or wash herself anywhere.

You think she read it somewhere--
that letting your husband see you pluck anything,
trim anything, apply medicine to anything,
will make him feel like he's furniture.

It's exactly on cold nights like these that the basement
is not as forbidding as it should be, despite the fact
that you have to put gloves on 
in what is part of your own home.

Downstairs, a large bathtub, kept, for some reason,
after remodeling. It is there that your bear will be grown,
by you, though you have no idea how. Probably wishing

is most of it; fertilizer, chunks of raw stew meat,
handfuls of blackberries, two metal rakes, and a thick rug
make up the rest. Then water.

You get an e-mail from a friend late at night 
saying he can't sleep. You write back 
"I hope you feel sleepy soon and think how childish 
the word "sleepy is. And you're a man,
older than most of the people you see on television.

You haven't even considered how your wife will feel
when you have finished growing your bear. You could 
write a letter to her tonight, explaining how your life
was just so lacking in bear: 

"Janet, it's nothing you've done--
clearly you have no possible way of supplying me with a bear
or any of the activities I might be able to enjoy 
after acquiring the bear. 

It might just be best 
to keep the two worlds separate. 
Janet clearly prefers things to be comfortable
and unchallenging. Janet soaps herself up. Janet puts herself
to bed, and you just happen to be next to her. 

You go on your weekly bike ride with Mark and tell him
that you've been growing a bear. An eighteen-wheeler 
flies by and he doesn't seem to hear you--
plus he's focused on the hill. 

You think about how not all friends know
what each other sounds like when struggling and
breathing heavy. Past the age of college athletics,
most friends don't even know what each others' bodies
look like, flushed, tired, showering, cold.





At the Edge of Time
 

The stems of the sun bent over the eye
             The sleeping man
The whole of the earth
             And this head heavy with fear
In the night
This complete hole
                         Vast
And even so streaming with water
The noise
           The peals of little bells mingled with the
               Clinking of glasses
                    And bursts of laughter
The head moves
On the carpet the body shifts
And turns over the warm spot
                At the slipping feet of the animal
It's that they're waiting 
                           For the summons of the shock
And the signal of the eyelid
The ray relaxes
                           Sleep
                                       Light
And what is left shines at the edge of the white rock





Afternoon
 

In the morning that comes up behind the roof, in the shelter of the bridge, in the corner of the cypresses that rise above the wall, a rooster has crowed. In the bell tower that rips the air with its shining point, the notes ring out and already the morning din can be heard in the street; the only street that goes from the river to the mountain dividing the woods. One looks for some other words but the ideas are always just as dark, just as simple and singularly painful. There is hardly more than the eyes, the open air, the grass and the water in the distance with, around every bend, a well or a cool basin. In the right-hand corner the last house with a larger head at the window. The trees are extremely alive and all those familiar companions walk along the demolished wall that is crushed into the thorns with bursts of laughter. Above the ravine the din augments, swells, and if the car passes on the upper road one no longer knows if it is the flowers or the little bells that are chiming. Under the blazing sun, when the landscape is on fire, the traveler crosses the stream on a very narrow bridge, before a dark hole where the trees line the water that falls asleep in the afternoon. And, against the trembling background of the woods, the motionless man.





Clock
 

    In the warm air of the ceiling the footlights of dreams are illuminated.
       The white walls have curved. The burdened chest breathes confused words. In the mirror, the wind from the south spins, carrying leaves and feathers. The window is blocked. The heart is almost extinguished among the already cold ashes of the moon--the hands are without shelter--as all the trees lying down. In the wind from the desert the needles bend and my hour is past.





Live Flesh
 

Stand up carcass and walk
Nothing new under the yellow sun
The last of the last of the louis d'or
The light that separates
under the skins of time
The lock in the heart that shatters
A thread of silk
A thread of lead
A thread of blood
After these waves of silence
These tokens of love in black horsehair
The sky smoother than your eye
The neck twisted with pride
My life in the corridor
From which I see the undulating harvests of death
All those greedy hands kneading loaves of smoke
Heavier than the pillars of the universe
Heads empty 
Hearts bare
Hands scented
Tentacles of the monkeys who aim at the clouds
Among the wrinkles of these grimaces
A straight line tightens
A nerve twists
The sea sated
Love
The bitter smile of death





Carpe Demon
 

Where is your father whose eye you were the apple of?

Where are your mother's parlor portieres, her slip-covered days, her petticoats?

In the orchard at the other end of time, you were just a child in ballet slippers,

Your first poodle skirt, your tortoiseshell barrettes. As the peach tree grew more 

Scarce each day, you kept running out to try to tape the leaves back on their boughs.

Once, I caught you catch a pond of sunlight in your lap and when you stood, 

The sunlight spilt; it could never follow you. Once, above the river, 

You told me you were born to be a turtle, swimming down. Under the bridge 

Now you take your meals where the thinnest creatures live at the end

Of the world. Carpe Demon, you told me just before you put down the phone 

And drank the antifreeze. This year, the winter sky in Missouri is a kind of cold

The color of a turtle's hood, a soup of dandelion, burdock root, and clay.





You Have Harnessed Yourself Ridiculously to This World
 

Tell the truth I told me                                When I couldn't speak.

Sorrow's a barbaric art, crude as a Viking ship                Or a child

Who rode a spotted pony to the lake away from summer 

In the 1930s                                       Toward the iron lung of polio.

According to the census I am unmarried                And unchurched.

                                    The woman in the field dressed only in the sun.

Too far gone to halt the Arctic Cap's catastrophe, big beautiful

Blubbery white bears each clinging to his one last hunk of ice.

I am obliged, now, to refrain from dying, for as long as it is possible.

For whom left am I first?

                                                          We have come to terms with our Self

Like a marmoset getting out of her Great Ape suit.

coping skills lost in the flood

Lonely Deep Affection
 

years of practice for a soft 
        landing in the slaughter 
                we looked far off to 
             a flag sewn into flesh
dear enemy come down the
     hill I have taken a title out
of the love for you jumping
     down the clear shaft of your eye
      you would not know how long I
      paused when writing this unless 
              I said so in the poem
               half an hour staring 
              at the pencil having 
      written of my enemy with 
      love and fight to maintain 
                            the ascension
                             voices from a 
                             room no one exits 
                             we pry genocide out
                             of the museum but
                             meant to remove
                            the museum 
                             from genocide





Thunderbride
 

My throat is full of sparklers 
                                                    making me a lighthouse
                                 for a loveship       that can fly

Our mother monarchy
                                  sweet land paternity

I'll eat their offspring's money       and let you have a bite 

In wilder colors       I can love the copy of you 
                                  which is great            when we have breasts

He will breathe through contractions
           and she will heal the faceless
                                  and use her eyes       to steel his legs 

You must see that I'm eating for two sexes

Minimalism means       nothing making more
                                                of what isn't there

            a green preconception
              divining a baby gender
                                    for which I qualified 
            with braids ablaze       and stuck to my back 

We are going to win       then make extra babies
            yes we make enough
                to make a country 

Text unto the winged baby       the tiny pill of mystery
                                that makes me want to tickle the world
            until it starts barfing clouds

Make it free       is not the advice we paid for
            but a long song about the flavor of nowhere 

                                                   and how we never fill it
           and how I shave my buzzardy wings       to offend the sublime

While I'm quick to swallow       the heaviest business
                       and quicker yet to modify that trash
        you have a poultice       for sudden holes 

                       you have a knife in ten minutes
            you will marry a parent       and make it do
                                    whatever you tell it

The raptor you were       does an end-run around sorrow 
                       but I'm right here sweetness

                       out of the glass closet                voil
                voil        so what do you make of my baby

Tonight we bomb 
Tonight we blitz 
Tonight we barrage 
Tonight we make the greater migration
Tonight our fabulous flock shits napalm on the criminal dads

For I am a figure       first of girls in orbit

                the best reason I have to eat your bed

I am spangled breasts       I am shaved 
                        like any birdboy       only huger
                 than babies or ladybugs 

                       one of each is precious 
                        a million a menace 

My inside is a live mine 
          and I'm after the light that sustains the skin of women 
                     scooping the spectacle 
          where everyone freaks everyone 

They will say how do you do Mister Ms. Thunderbride
                 and I will say I do it distorted 

                             and you       will marry a million of you 
                                                              in your twisted gown of flames





Buzkashi
 

A husband puts an afghan over the dead goat's
torso, combs the knots out of her beard.
The goat smells chalk, wonders when the riders
will come in their wool pakols red from walnuts, spurs
chirring like castanets. The buzkashi whips
will grow damp in their mouths, their rope belts
slowly twisting in place. She knows
not to be devoured is a perfect sentiment
because she has thoughts to gather, faces to grow,
hunger this morning and no throat, only
the song in her teeth that goes on
indefinitely as he saws off each hoof, just
above the ankle, her knees bent for praying.
Her head is axed. Her collar
falls to the ground, its circle unbroken. She looks to see
how deep is the pool of blood is a river
of no one becoming her. With salt in her heart
she'll stay good for days. He's been to her like her father
he killed. He's been to her like the father he killed.
He turns her face to the window: mountains
oddly still in the milk broth of oblivion. Intercourse:
the sun drove a man in the ground like a stake.





The Old Country
 

I

Where every town was a tidy town 
and every garden a hanging garden. 
A half could be had for half a crown. 
Every major artery would harden

since every meal was a square meal. 
Every clothesline showed a line of undies 
yet no house was in dishabille. 
Every Sunday took a month of Sundays

till everyone got it off by heart
every start was a bad start
since all conclusions were foregone.

Every wood had its twist of woodbine. 
Every cliff its herd of fatalistic swine. 
Every runnel was a Rubicon.


II

Every runnel was a Rubicon 
and every annual a hardy annual 
applying itself like linen to a lawn. 
Every glove compartment held a manual

and a map of the roads, major and minor. 
Every major road had major roadworks. 
Every wishy-washy water diviner 
had stood like a bulwark

against something worth standing against. 
The smell of incense left us incensed 
at the firing of the fort.

Every heron was a presager
of some disaster after which, we'd wager,
every resort was a last resort.


III

Every resort was a last resort
with a harbor that harbored an old grudge.
Every sale was a selling short.
There were those who simply wouldn't budge

from the Dandy to the Rover.
That shouting was the shouting
but for which it was all over--
the weekend, I mean, we set off on an outing

with the weekday train timetable. 
Every tower was a tower of Babel 
that graced each corner of a bawn

where every lookout was a poor lookout. 
Every rill had its unflashy trout.
 Every runnel was a Rubicon.


IV

Every runnel was a Rubicon 
where every ditch was a last ditch. 
Every man was "a grand wee mon 
whose every pitch was another sales pitch

now every boat was a burned boat. 
Every cap was a cap in hand. 
Every coat a trailed coat. 
Every band was a gallant band

across the broken bridge
and broken ridge after broken ridge
where you couldn't beat a stick with a big stick.

Every straight road was a straight up speed trap. 
Every decision was a snap. 
Every cut was a cut to the quick.


V

Every cut was a cut to the quick
when the weasel's twist met the weasel's tooth
and Christ was somewhat impolitic
in branding as "weasels fighting in a hole, forsooth,

the petrol smugglers back on the old sod 
when a vendor of red diesel
for whom every rod was a green rod 
reminded one and all that the weasel

was nowhere to be found in that same quarter. 
No mere mortar could withstand a ten-inch mortar. 
Every hope was a forlorn hope.

So it was that the defenders
were taken in by their own blood splendour.
Every slope was a slippery slope. 


VI

Every slope was a slippery slope 
where every shave was a very close shave 
and money was money for old rope 
where every grave was a watery grave

now every boat was, again, a burned boat.
Every dime-a-dozen rat a dime-a-dozen drowned rat
except for the whitrack, or stoat,
which the very Norsemen had down pat

as a weasel-word
though we know their speech was rather slurred.
Every time was time in the nick

just as every nick was a nick in time.
Every unsheathed sword was somehow sheathed in rime.
Every cut was a cut to the quick. 


VII

Every cut was a cut to the quick 
what with every feather a feather to ruffle. 
Every whitrack was a whitterick. 
Everyone was in a right kerfuffle

when from his hob some hobbledehoy 
would venture the whitterick was a curlew. 
Every wall was a wall of Troy 
and every hunt a hunt in the purlieu

of a demesne so out of bounds
every hound might have been a hellhound.
At every lane end stood a milk churn

whose every dent was a sign of indenture 
to some pig wormer or cattle drencher. 
Every point was a point of no return.


VIII

Every point was a point of no return
for those who had signed the Covenant in blood.
Every fern was a maidenhair fern
that gave every eye an eyeful of mud

ere it was plucked out and cast into the flame. 
Every rowan was a mountain ash. 
Every swath-swathed mower made of his graft a game 
and the hay sash

went to the kemper best fit to kemp. 
Every secretary was a temp 
who could shift shape

like the river goddesses Banna and Boann.
Every two-a-penny maze was, at its heart, Minoan. 
Every escape was a narrow escape.


IX

Every escape was a narrow escape 
where every stroke was a broad stroke 
of an ax on a pig nape. 
Every pig was a pig in a poke

though it scooted once through the Diamond
so unfalt--so unfalteringly.
The threshold of pain was outlimened
by the bar raised at high tea

now every scone was a drop scone.
Every ass had an ass's jawbone
that might itself drop from grin to girn.

Every malt was a single malt. 
Every pillar was a pillar of salt. 
Every point was a point of no return.


X

Every point was a point of no return
where to make a mark was to overstep the mark.
Every brae had its own braw burn.
Every meadow had its meadowlark

that stood in for the laverock.
Those Norse had tried fjord after fjord
to find a tight wee place to dock.
When he made a scourge of small whin cords,

Christ drove out the moneylenders
and all the other bitter-enders
when the thing to have done was take up the slack.

Whin was to furze as furze was to gorse.
Every hobbledehoy had his hobbledyhobbyhorse.
Every track was an inside track. 


XI

Every track was an inside track 
where every horse had the horse sense 
to know it was only a glorified hack. 
Every graineen of gratitude was immense

and every platitude a familiar platitude.
Every kemple of hay was a kemple tossed in the air
by a haymaker in a hay feud.
Every chair at the barn dance a musical chair

given how every paltry poltroon 
and his paltry dog could carry a tune 
yet no one would carry the can

any more than Samson would carry the temple. 
Every spinal column was a collapsing stemple. 
Every flash was a flash in the pan.


XII

Every flash was a flash in the pan
and every border a herbaceous border
unless it happened to be an
herbaceous border as observed by the Recorder

or recorded by the Observer.
Every widdie stemmed from a willow bole.
Every fervor was a religious fervor
by which we'd fly the godforsaken hole

into which we'd been flung by it.
Every pit was a bottomless pit
out of which every pig needed a piggyback.

Every cow had subsided in its subsidy.
Biddy winked at Paddy and Paddy winked at Biddy.
Every track was an inside track.


XIII

Every track was an inside track 
and every job an inside job. 
Every whitterick had been a whitrack 
until, from his hobbledehob,

that hobbledehobbledehoy 
had insisted the whitterick was a curlew. 
But every boy was still "one of the boys 
and every girl "ye girl ye

for whom every dance was a last dance
and every chance a last chance
and every letdown a terrible letdown

from the days when every list was a laundry list 
in that old country where, we reminisced, 
every town was a tidy town.





My First Black Nature Poem
 

there is a dark mass following me. these legs are clumsy. they flap quickly. 
I want to slow them down. but my nerves. Lord, these pensive endings.

the sun slumps against the merging fall on red leaves. 
and where the natives are unenlightened, the mass comes closer.

               only white people swim in lakes nowadays 
               you know . . . Crystal Lake?

never seen a black person jump in a lake;
let alone a river till this summer.
the Bronx River is said to be clean: we care about clean.
a month before, two boys drowned in the Bronx River.
a week after, a boy jumps into it unfazed.

abandoned tires, relics of its sewer days, river herring spark no fear.
and a publicly funded park with a biology class, a boat-making workshop
for the children of Hunt's Point, gives me hope we'd wet our hair again.

     (these follicles don't surf; don't swim)

but here in Virginia, there's little comfort.
the blush current from underwater springs makes me tense. 

             white people form groups to paddle on boards across the Hudson, 
             taking on trends from Hawai'i. they tap into the yesterdays 
             of Algonquian tongues. Wappinger. Mohican.

             a sporty new aged (like gouda) convenience. 
             a luxury to admire when Long Beach is too far 
             and Rockaway too dirty.

black folk don't swim. we splash and cool off.
we a ways forward from a Splenda hint of Senegalese manliness diving from a ferry,
miles off shore from Gore. that water got too much memory.
we much prefer chlorine. that salt and fresh water our hypertension.

             and that ocean is curiously scary.
             and this lake is charmed and churning with tales from the deep.

profound is this river of B-rated torture.
deep are shadow people speculated through my rave tangerine goggles.

on Lake Champlain at night, the chilly air felt like a presence.
swamp monsters (this ain't a swamp). tubular amphibians (they'd be in rivers).
aquatic reptilians. ancestors distraught and vengeful (like Jason).

but this is smaller and gnawing like chiggers; something from my weed days 
could live. down. here.

my arms fight the green clearness. so mud olive I cannot see the bottom. 
beneath me is crisp. a fallen branch is mistaken for an eel.





black hermans last asrah levitation at magic city, Atlanta 2010
 

This exclusive shit I don't share with the world.50 Cent
I, Herman, made medicinal -- concocted potions in ways my former's was hearsay;
Turned palomas christened Zora on to formulas husbands roll over n mitzvah.

I, a black lad, proud Virginian, selling out Liberty Hall n pinched w/ stickpins 
in Woodlawn, do bequeath my next-to-last oratory:

               My roots subverted the man, 
               honeys n dog voyagers to Neptune,
               who dared interfere w/ your melodious saccharine midsection.
               My cluster of tricks made chaps seek out connotation.

               Look at my magic stick.
               Not my clavicles, but my magic stick.

               Ain't no lightness of hand but of bounce player.

[The challenge: to start]
 

The challenge: to start
not with theory but with tangible performance

You and others, approaching

We shall be asked for a way out

                to be fed

                to keep warm and dry

Starting with experience, magic 
genuine science

More than once we have been lost 
in a trackless wilderness

dwarfed and shadowed by mighty buildings 
subway trains wild as elephants

One goes blindly back to one's desk

These moments come, their dark 
shadow

We glimpsed control 
and more tragic waste

We entered with 40,000,000 warriors 
with the dignity of cathedrals

The lake is upon you.
You have two canoes, your tent
The child has entered upon this desert

You have your axes

What, precisely, is your procedure?





[We wonder at our shifting capacities . . .]
 

We wonder at our shifting capacities, keep
adding and striking skills
from the bottoms of our rsums
under constant revision
like the inscriptions on tombs
shared for generations
unnervingly up
to date

Made nervous by our shift in capabilities, we write:

                                            I visited a country where kittens lay  dying 
                                            under every bench, in every gutter, next to 
                                            every  cigarette butt. One  made  me  weep. 
                                            Two   made   me  worry.  Three   made   me

The New Violence: I visited a country where 
everything looked like home





Archaeopteryx, an Elegy
 

As soon as possible, I will confront the wren's
              doings, rinse the white streaks from the porch bricks
drawing lizards from their shade, the immediate 
              smell of water too much for all of us.
But first is lunch. The remains we'll scatter over
              the driveway away from the bricks. Wrens come,
crusts from our dishes make drama. Then history.

What is possible in memory is disingenuous.
              Limestone, impressed with the archaic smile 
of bone and reptilian wrists, wishbones and feathers,
              describes. It cups the transitional form, 
naturally selecting one's best side. There was
              the time you forgot your legs no longer 
could recall how to stand--then rose up straight and sang

              You'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me

Probably I've been thinking of that since August.
              The indelible wrens grate like shovels 
outside--exhumed, one voice rises from wilderness, 
              echoes,
                            settles, rests
                                          --then another, and, 
between them, the keep of an unerring quiet.





Relic
 

The first time I touched it, 
cloth fell under my fingers, 
the frail white folds 
softened, demure. No burn,

no combustion at the touch of skin. 
It sat, silent, like any other contents 
of any other box: photographs 
of the dead, heirloom jewels.

Exposed to thin windowlight it is 
exactly as in movies: 
a long gown, and where a chest 
must have breathed, a red cross

crossed over. The crown, I know, 
waits underneath, the hood with eyes 
carefully stitched open, arch cap 
like a bishop's, surging to its point.





The Vanity of the Dragonfly
 

The dragonfly at rest on the doorbell-- 
too weak to ring and glad of it, 
but well mannered and cautious, 
thinking it best to observe us quietly 
before flying in, and who knows if he will find 
the way out? Cautious of traps, this one.
A winged cross, plain, the body straight 
as a thermometer, the old glass kind 
that could kill us with mercury if our teeth 
did not respect its brittle body. Slim as an eel 
but a solitary glider, a pilot without bombs 
or weapons, and wings clear and small as a wish
to see over our heads, to see the whole picture. 
And when our gaze grazes over it and moves on, 
the dragonfly changes its clothes,
sheds its old skin, shriveled like laundry, 
and steps forth, polished black, with two 
circles buttoned like epaulettes taking the last space 
at the edge of its eyes.





Advice
 

You know how, after it rains, 
my father told me one August afternoon 
when I struggled with something 
hurtful my best friend had said, 
how worms come out and 
crawl all over the sidewalk 
and it stays a big mess 
a long time after it's over 
if you step on them?

Leave them alone, 
he went on to say, 
after clearing his throat, 
and when the rain stops, 
they crawl back into the ground.





Releasing a Tree
 

Softly pummeled overnight, the lower 
limbs of our Norway spruce 
flexed and the deepening snow held them. 
Windless sunlight now, so I go out 
wearing hip waders and carrying
not a fly rod but a garden hoe. I begin 
worrying the snow for the holdfast 
of a branch that's so far down 
a wren's nest floats above it like a buoy. 
I work the hoe, not chopping but cradling, 
then pull straight up. A current of air
as the needles loft their burden 
over my head. Those grace notes 
of the snowfall, crystals giving off 
copper, green, rose--watching them 
I stumble over a branch, go down 
and my gloves fill with snow. Ah, I find 
my father here: I remember as a child 
how flames touched my hand the time 
I added wood to the stove in our ice-fishing 
shanty, how he plunged that hand 
through the hole into the river, teaching me 
one kind of burning can ease another. 
The branch bobs then tapers into place 
and composes itself, looking 
unchanged though all summer 
it will bring up this day from underfoot.





I Ask My Mother to Sing
 

She begins, and my grandmother joins her. 
Mother and daughter sing like young girls. 
If my father were alive, he would play 
his accordion and sway like a boat.

I've never been in Peking, or the Summer Palace, 
nor stood on the great Stone Boat to watch 
the rain begin on Kuen Ming Lake, the picnickers 
running away in the grass.

But I love to hear it sung; 
how the waterlilies fill with rain until 
they overturn, spilling water into water, 
then rock back, and fill with more.

Both women have begun to cry. 
But neither stops her song.





After Filing for Divorce
 

Your paperwork in, it's like the morning after 
a party, the shaken survey of damage, 
a waste of bottles where there was laughter. 
It all seems so much more than you can manage: 
the accusing cups and stubbed-out cigarettes, 
the sun assaulting the window, your throbbing head. 
It's not enough to face your own regrets
(though they're coming back fast, the things you said) 
because someone's trailed bean dip across the table, 
someone's ground salsa in the rug with his shoe. 
So you start to clean, as much as you are able,
and think how far those hours have fled from you, 
before the hangover and your sour tongue, 
when you felt lovely, and infinite, and young.





Ablution
 

Because one must be naked to get clean, 
my dad shrugs out of his pajama shirt, 
steps from his boxers and into the tub 
as I brace him, whose long illness
has made him shed modesty too. 
Seated on the plastic bench, he holds 
the soap like a caught fish in his lap, 
waiting for me to test the water's heat 
on my wrist before turning the nozzle 
toward his pale skin. He leans over 
to be doused, then hands me the soap 
so I might scrub his shoulders and neck, 
suds sluicing from spine to buttock cleft. 
Like a child he wants a washcloth 
to cover his eyes while I lather 
a palmful of pearlescent shampoo 
into his craniotomy-scarred scalp 
and then rinse clear whatever soft hair 
is left. Our voices echo in the spray 
and steam of this room where once, 
long ago, he knelt at the tub's edge 
to pour cups of bathwater over my head. 
He reminds me to wash behind his ears, 
and when he judges himself to be clean, 
I turn off the tap. He grips the safety bar, 
steadies himself, and stands. Turning to me, 
his body is dripping and frail and pink. 
And although I am nearly forty, 
he has this one last thing to teach me. 
I hold open the towel to receive him.





Spirit of the Bat
 

Hair rush, low swoop-- 
so those of us

stuck here on earth 
know--you must be gods.

Or friends of gods, 
granted chances

to push off into sky, 
granted chances

to hear so well 
your own voice bounced

back to you 
maps the night.

Each hinge 
in your wing's

an act of creation. 
Each insect

you snick out of air 
a witness.

You transform 
obstacles

into sounds, 
then dodge them.





Ex
 

Long after I married you, I found myself 
in his city and heard him call my name. 
Each of us amazed, we headed to the caf 
we used to haunt in our days together. 
We sat by a window across the paneled room 
from the table that had witnessed hours
of our clipped voices and sharp silences. 
Instead of coffee, my old habit in those days, 
I ordered hot chocolate, your drink, 
dark and dense the way you take it, 
without the swirl of frothy cream I like. 
He told me of his troubled marriage, his two 
difficult daughters, their spiteful mother, how 
she'd tricked him and turned into someone 
he didn't really know. I listened and listened, 
glad all over again to be rid of him, and sipped 
the thick, brown sweetness slowly as I could, 
licking my lips, making it last.





First Morel
 

Up from wood rot, 
wrinkling up from duff 
and homely damps, 
spore-born and cauled 
like a meager seer, 
it pushes aside earth 
to make a small place 
from decay. Bashful, 
it brings honeycombed 
news from below 
of the coming plenty 
and everything rising.





Consecration
 

The man in the yellow hard hat,   
the one with the mask   
across his nose and mouth, 

pulls the lever that turns 
the great arm of the crane up   
and over and sideways 

toward the earth; 
then the wrecking ball   
dangles crazily, 

so delicately, like a silver fob   
loosened from a waistcoat pocket:   
shocking to see 

the dust fly up and the timber   
sail up, then so slowly   
down, how the summer air 

bristles with a hundred splinters 
and the smallest is a splintered flame,   
for it takes so many lengthening 

erratic movements to tear away   
what stands between the sidewalk   
and the bell tower, 

where the pigeons now rise   
in grand indignant waves   
at such poor timing, such 

a deaf ear toward the music;   
in this way the silence 

between hand and lever is turned   
into a ragged and sorely lifted   
wing: the wrecking ball lurches   
in a narrowing arc until only 

the dust resists--the rest   
comes down, story by story, 
and is hauled off in flatbed trucks. 

Meanwhile the pedestrians come   
and go, now and then glancing   
at their accurate watches. 

Gradually, the dust   
becomes the rose light   
of autumn. 

But one evening a woman   
loses her way as she's   
swept into a passing wave 

of commuters and she 
looks up toward the perfectly   
empty rectangle 

now hanging between 
the rutted mud and the sky.   
There along the sides 

of the adjacent building,   
like a set for a simple   
elementary school play, 

like the gestures of the dead   
in her children's faces,   
she sees the flowered paper 

of her parents' bedroom,   
the pink stripes leading   
up the stairs to the attic, 

and the outline of the claw- 
footed bathtub, font 
of the lost cathedral of childhood.





Sensitivity
 

May 4, 1959
for Mack Charles Parker, lynched near Poplarville, Mississippi, April 24, 1959,
recovered from the Pearl River, May 4, 1959 

Six weeks since that whisper rose
into the window of a stage
behind the Half Note's bar,
whisper Mingus let spread like a bruise,
Lester Young is dead, six weeks
since he fell from the sky,
dead off the plane from Paris,
and each night this goodbye's
gone more sensitive. Now
the flats are hid, and Handy's learned
to fold the sound of breath
inside his notes--the bleeding throat,
tongue's last epileptic flutter--
while Mingus thrills the bass
in waves of sound and fail
no microphone can hold.
Drinks tremble like the river
halfway from here to the grave,
pulled by wind or plummet,
cough of strings beneath the hand,
and uptown a tape is waiting
for magnets to say this again,
a teletype is writing a story
for tomorrow's Times--
a body pulled from a river
in Mississippi, with only fingers
for a name. Here
only the drinks are listening
as Ervin rises, ghosting Handy's lead,
and even they cannot hear
how the rivers heal their quiet,
how they fill their scars so perfectly
that remember feels like forget.
Then the breath is gone.
The wood hums a moment longer,
and each surface smoothes
till the glasses and the waters
are glass again and ready
to catch each clap,
each note that falls.





City of Grace
 

Welcome to Jackson: City of Grace and Benevolence
City of Grace, you open,
you part your curtains
and smile like a hostess
when we call your name,
you tender what any traveler needs,
a call to ease, a balm,
a kindness, whatever storm.
You take us in. City of Grace
and Benevolence, you say
you know what solace means,
burned so often they called you
Chimneyville, and now
you can't forget,
you've written it in bronze
outside the City Hall
the War made a hospital
for the Yankee
and for your Rebel sons,
like the one who is always dying
outside the Capitol.
City of Fame,
you hold him still, laurel
on your crown, fan
making a hand of wind
to soothe his face
and fill the eagle's wings
spread above to promise,
Virtute et armis, to say again
just how far you'll go.
City of Remembrance,
you keep so well, you show us
where Welty lived,
the house still there, how she skated
to the library, through
the Capitol, the book
now cast and open in her hands.
Tell me now, City of Embrace,
of the newsreels' children
rounded from their march,
flags gathered, the children
trucked to the fairground cages,
the ones who peer out
through the chicken wire.
City of Richard Wright
and Ross Barnett, tell me
not just where the Governor pled
I love Mississippi, I love her people,
her customs, but where the writer
went to school, a short walk
from here, thinking it was not
until one wanted the world to be different
that one would look at the world
with will and emotion, and tell me,
then, where Medgar Evers lived,
whom you remember
with a post office and a stamp
and an airport, though
when I've asked you've turned
to someone else and said
Can you help this man find his friend?



Ambivalent City, you know the way, 
but you let me find it, the statue, 
the library, miles away, 
the Boulevard, and then the house, 
the plaque that tells us
this is where he lived, perfect
as a photograph, as a movie,
only the color's unreal,
or too real, the green piercing,
the hose uncoiled as if someone
might return to water the lawn.
Neighbors cruise, panning
like cameras as I stand
where he must have stood
choosing the house with no front door,
where Beckwith must have stood,
who drove the town asking everyone
where Evers lived, where
he marked his man.
There is nowhere else to stand.
A city is a kind of memory,
and if you stay too long
the shape of someone else
will hold you there
until day repeats its failure
and the streetlights wake
and yawn all color from the dusk
and the house becomes a photograph
of itself and the small wings
unfold from the fabric of night,
from all the magnolias' ears
and the broad stretch of the reservoir
and the river you can smell
as they gather into pearls
the stars' historic light,
the eyes' whose looking stays
long after the pupils
have burned away. Fireflies
fall back into the grass,
and the mayflies clasp each other
in a kind of halo. City of Ghosts,
you can't abandon your history,
and it won't abandon you. 
You watch each other, 
you call each other's names. 
The sidewalks, the driveways 
gleam like quarried moon, 
and each open hand repeats 
the ambient light as the crickets 
fill with heat and raise again 
the street's last breath: 
Turn me loose.





The Second Person
 

Natchez
Afternoon burns everything off Franklin Street. 
               Even the birds, even the flies.

Or iced-tea sugar and chicken grease weigh everyone 
               into a doze, all indoors, in a cool

they said would never come eighty years ago
               when this was still the center of business

and the civilized left these high hours to the dogs, 
               ice in a highball, and let each house

close its lids a while. They've kept their quiet, 
               so I'm alone before the windows,

the radiant panes, each with its scrim of clay, 
               the finish the river gives everything,

so nothing, not even glass, is clear.
               It's almost painful, this saturation,

this street and its stores of rugs and signs and flags, 
               bright and strange as a magazine photo

you'd find in an attic or an antique store,
               hard to believe the color was ever real.

The teacups, the painted china and jeweled eggs, 
               even the bottles, medicine vials

and flasks each with its ounce of dirt,
               even the smell of the prolific earth,

the sedimentary atmosphere of empire chairs
               and oak armoires and mantles that survive

their tall, white homes, like the plantation house 
               where, later, I'll witness again

the marriage of gray suit and hoop skirt
               that still feels like a dream, where I'll walk

out of--or is it into?--myself,
               the maitre'd's small, solicitous voice

proffering another julep--cotton-leaf hand, 
               silver cup--though even he must be

a reenactment or a revenant,
               a hanger for the clothes of memory.

I will take it, I would, a handful of refuge 
               in unthinking weather, will take

the same lethargic joy in a breeze, any chill 
               in the throat, any kind of shade--

so I enter the dim of one old cotton house,
               its air-conditioned maze of hand-tools

and quilts, corn cribs and cotton gins, and of course 
               the owner's smile, porcelain, bright, almost

blinding, blooming in welcome and how-you-do 
               and what-brings-you. We talk amid rows

of cook-stoves, stew-pots, and cast-iron skillets 
               about the wedding I've come to see

on the famed estate, the time the town exploded, 
               the Rhythm Club's inferno, and then

she ventures she knows the accent, knows
               I'm from Alabama, and soon she's eloquent

on our lakes and rivers, where the mister takes her 
               every chance they get. She's seen it all,

so she asks where I'm from, and when I say
               she starts to glow, gushing over mountains

all the way to Gatlinburg. She's walked each one,
               even skied the state's one slope, which conjures

not the "Southern snow" that required almost everything 
               around us, but snow, cold snow, a thought

that cools me further, so my sweat is nearly dry
               when the smile tightens across her teeth

and she leans in to say I just love it
               you know--there are no darkies there.

Then afternoon is a conspiracy of color, 
               an echo the heat or the history

in our voices draws us into--
               someone else's version of ourselves--

and the inevitable, painful quiet
               in which an answer must arrive.

What can you say? And how long do you have to wait 
               before you can leave, before you can walk

out of yourself and down the cotton-trading streets 
               into the smother of trees

on some more recent lane? How long do you have to wait 
               before you can leave and not be followed,

and how long do you have to walk before the mockingbirds 
               drown in bass and drum and anger,

before you can cross back into the proper century? 
               The smell of the river stays with you,

maybe even grows as you move so you don't know
               where you're going, and the key in your hand

could open a car door or a plantation room
               or nothing at all, some door that's vanished

in the air, June's shimmer from the asphalt
               and the roofs of every house, so you walk

toward that moment when the sun starts burning 
               and the magnolias' thick perfume washes

all around and you find yourself on a corner,
               all linen and sweat, again the only one

who'd walk in a heat like this. You have no idea 
               where you are, so you cock your head

as if you might hear your way through the afternoon, 
               and when you raise your head, you see,

across the street, two men hunched in shadow 
               on a barbershop's stoop, ties

dangling like smoke in the solid air. They've seen you 
               and now their brows sharpen

as if they know, too, you're not from here,
               and in the space between you anything

could pass, the ghosts of Farragut or Grant
               or a hot white Caddy rattling New Orleans Bounce,

you're waiting to see, it seems like years or centuries, 
               then one rises, ties his tie, and steps back in,

leaving the other, who keeps your eye
               a moment longer then looks into the distance

through that lace of smoke that seems etched in the air 
               for something far behind you, something

you don't even know how to look for,
               something that may never arrive.





Substantiation, part 1
 

And the way the jury chose to believe the ridiculous stories of the defense. . . .
     -- Mamie Till, 1955

. . . with truth absent, hypocrisy and myth have flourished. . . . 
     --Look, January 1956


The sheriff says it wasn't Till we pulled from the river, 
that man was as white as I am, white as cotton 
blowed by the cotton gin fan that weighed him down, 
looked like he'd lain there weeks, not a kid at all. 
He was a stranger just out of Money, recalled 
by a store clerk, a hobo, and a crossroad guitarist. 
The reporter finds them at the once abandoned crossing. 
They say it's like the sheriff says, came up one night, 
headed Clarksdale way, another one, hat pulled down, 
right behind. Three days later, the bluesman says, 
a plague of starlings gathered into little boys 
those who fished and found the dead man's foot. 
The reporter stares into his cataracted, cotton eyes. 
He cannot find them, no matter where he looks.





The Crowd He Becomes
 

15 September 1963, Birmingham
Later he will say he did not do it,
he was home at breakfast, just ask the wife,
say they heard some radio preacher doing
love thy neighbor while birds filled up the yard.
Later, he will say he did not do it then tell
how he didn't, lean in close to say
if he would have done it it wouldn't have been
alone, he would have had a driver
and a man out west to phone in threats
to draw the cops away. They'd ease
through empty streets to plant their package
then glide away, their route thick with friends,
a thousand ways to disappear.



The DA will lean, will see his would have
dashboard-lit, driving Dynamite Hill,
headlights, radio dead. Would have
in the shotgun seat, sticks sweating in his grip,
shadow steering through the city's sleep.
Will see them driving, out before the paperboys,
ready to throw when the dark is right.
See him Christmas, few years back,
outside the preacher's house, thin fuse of cigarette,
newspaper spread on the bus protests.
See flash, shock push him from the dark,
burn his shadow where anyone could see.
Something dark in the lenses of the bottle trees. 



The photographer spots him eyeing
the bombed-out church, minutes after,
a face he's seen before, flash on the shards
of phone-booths and broken windows
he'll follow through the horrid and the horrified
while the cops arrive, the state patrol arrives
with bayonets instead of hoses, bayonets
instead of dogs, while congregants arrive
between firemen and plainclothes Klansmen
and the children, the children arrive
and depart, and there, the smirk he'll follow
through uniforms and Sunday black,
into the park, then lose him as it fills.



Will stand in the blur of what arrives and wonder
where he could have gone. Whether he'd cut
toward the depot, through the railyards to wind back home,
or north through the nervous blocks, or circle back
for another view, maybe shadowed in a doorway,
japing in a storefront window, listening at a sandwich stand
while everyone is talking, his work on every tongue.
Maybe he could drift through the crush of lookers
in cigarette smoke, in the breath of many lungs,
common, innocuous, a cloud about to disappear.



Will stand imagining him split at each intersection, 
now four of him working the city's riot, 
one with a bomb in his Sunday Herald, 
one with a gun hung out the window racing 
to a segregation rally, one with a bullhorn 
and a speech for the news if they want it right, 
and one just waiting for some midnight's cool 
when he can stand beneath the vacant windows 
and search for that fire in the face of Christ 
before driving out past the mills. On the ridge 
he'll see Vulcan's torch is red, but not for them. 
Shadows reel from the furnace sheds, 
birds exploding, blown from molten light.



The mayor says all of us are victims, innocent victims.
The lawyer kills his radio. When folks ask later
who did it, the lawyer says I'll tell you who.
Who is everyone who talks of niggers. Who is everyone
who slurs to his neighbors and his sons. Everyone
who jokes about niggers and everyone
who laughs at the jokes. Everyone who's quiet,
who lets it happen. Now his voice flaps in the rafters
of the meeting hall, and everyone is quiet.
I'll tell you who did it, he says. We all did.



The photographer keeps his beat, past the crater
in the church foundation, through the park,
into the midday rush, just where he lost him.
In the darkroom, he kept arriving, his face
framed between elbows, caught in the thrall,
or his crewcut, his smile cropped by arms.
Now his haircut, half-rolled sleeve, cigarette lip,
his eye pass by a dozen times, and more.
He could be anyone, could be everyone
wandering the storefronts, spying behind his News.
The photographer follows each one, cocked
and ready to shoot, but his lens can't catch them all
so he just stands, tracing their paths,
he just stands, lost in the crowd he becomes.





The Small Birds of Sound
 

State of Alabama v. Robert E. Chambliss, 1977
When they come
filling the yard with their overheard,

broke-glass catastrophes of voice, 
overcrowded party line,

he lets the screen door clap 
to see them plume

the settle back to the fence, 
aftershocks of crowd and wail.

When they come
he says again he was home at breakfast

radio preacher doing love thy neighbor 
and then the bomb,

just ask the wife. 
The silence

in the TV's cathode glow
 slowly fills with questions

as starlings shutter light 
then weigh the lines, voices

tangled in their claws.



They had him buying dynamite, 
a case he says he passed along,

then the other's car behind the church, 
four men dome-lit in early dark.

Now all they have is years 
of brag and noise and alibi,

a quiet
in which the trail's confused.

At times it seemed he wasn't real, 
that he was no one,

a story everyone had heard, 
just not the end,

that he was different men, 
one arm with a bomb,

another making calls 
miles outside of town,

a fog, an exhalation, 
scattering when seen.





Ill-Advised Love Poem
 

Come live with me 
And we will sit

Upon the rocks 
By shallow rivers

Come live with me 
And we will plant acorns

In each other's mouth 
It would be our way

Of greeting the earth 
Before it shoves us

Back into the snow 
Our interior cavities

Brimming with 
Disagreeable substances

Come live with me 
Before winter stops

To use the only pillow 
The sky ever sleeps on

Our interior cavities 
Brimming with snow

Come live with me 
Before spring

Swallows the air 
And birds sing





Confessions of a Recycled Shopping Bag
 

I used to be a plastic bottle

I used to be scads of masticated wattle

I used to be epic spittle, aka septic piddle

I used to be a pleasant colleague

I used to be a radiant ingredient

I used to be a purple polyethylene pony

I used to be a phony upload project

I used to be a stony blue inhalant

I used to be a family-size turquoise bottle

I used to be a domesticated pink bubble

I used to be a pleasant red colleague

I used to be a beaming cobalt emollient

I used to be a convenient chartreuse antidepressant





The Missing Portrait (1)
 

It does not do you like it
Imperfect copy's forgery
Posts its vermillion decree
These anointed mistakes
Neither robust nor enticing
These dark orthogonals and parallel curves
This swift recession to the single
Disgusted, the poem closes its mouth
Full of revulsion, the poem proceeds to close its eyes and ears
Once it recognizes, it realizes
Escape is impossible
Snow continues falling inside the glass egg
The villagers are singing, but the children looking in cannot hear them
Someone calls this poetry
Someone said, you shall observe words
Stealing parts of language that remain missing
Why speak about the unspeakable and the silence surrounding it
The unspeakable is a planet, our destination,
And silence is its atmosphere
The poem's mouth remains closed
There is no map that the poem can follow
The poem is a dog that doesn't sniff the traces of fear clinging to us
A man decides to paint a tree while the radio announces the progress of a war
A critic writes you do not make progress painting a tree
A new machine is progress, a machine of words
Each more perfectly realized than the last, is progress
Another example might begin with
I returned the tree to the hill from which it was stolen
Stay, coward blood, and do not yield to beauty's burning field
(I did not write this and neither did you)
And this latest example to arrive
The end is never near because it has always
Now the sky drifts out of the picture 
Now the poem mangles its imperfect copy





Outgoing
 

Our answering machine still played your message, 
and on the day you died Dad asked me to replace it.

I was chosen to save us the shame of dead you 
answering calls. Hello, I have just shot myself.

To leave a message for me, call hell. The clear cassette 
lay inside the white machine like a tiny patient

being monitored or a miniature glass briefcase 
protecting the scroll of lost voices. Everything barely

mattered and then no longer did. I pressed record 
and laid my voice over yours, muting it forever

and even now. I'm sorry we are not here, I began.





After Suicide [A hole is nothing]
 

A hole is nothing
but what remains around it.

My brother stood
in the refrigerator light

drinking milk that poured 
out of his head

through thick black curls 
down his back into a puddle

growing larger around him. 
My body stood between the

living room and kitchen 
one foot on worn carpet

one on cold linoleum. 
He couldn't hear his name

clouding from my mouth 
settling in the fluorescent air.

I wanted to put my finger 
into the hole

feel the smooth channel 
he escaped through

stop the milk
so he could swallow it

but my body held
as if driven into place.

The milk on the floor 
reflected the light

then became it.
Floated upward and outward

filling every shadow 
blowing the dark open.





After Suicide [In the hallway of life]
 

In the hallway of life
you were a rose with no stem 

and I, the janitor sweeping 
away the fallen petals.

You said the world revolves 
while we ourselves remain

in the darkness of the never-
ending, never-beginning never.

I say that the man who
was humiliated in the second act

and shot himself in the fifth, 
stands up, smiles, bows.

The lamp asks,
is it the shadow writing this,

the pen, or their converging? 
The paper asks nothing.





First Light
 

Spiders in the cold, 
bees in inarticulate bunches 
hang from a day's work. 
Waiting for light they wait 
to see what they will be. 
A tree lets down
green undersides and is maple. 
A window glints--
a thing of saffron
kindles with singlehood.
In the broad yard
each thing dandles
its blue, its name, its consequence.





from Articles of War, Section II
 

          
          The coastline edges to the edge of our chart. We move on a central, generous blue. Wind high, ocean plain smack tonnage our bow plows through,the boiling salt excitement of our wake,gone in minutes,then birds on our bobbing cratesa thousand miles from land.To pass the time I try to teach our bosun mate "Sailing to Byzantium." Good-natured, he laughs and laughs.
It is by no   means enough that an officer    o

hortcoming from heedless  or stupid blunder.





from Articles of War, Section V
 

I stare down into waterburn. 
This urge to enter what we see. 
Unrefracted tropical sun 
with its whole arm 
works deeply the ocean interior.

Water and light in union
make a third thing--color as fluid
deepened endlessly.
Into the quarry of aquamarine,
high-walled with light, the mind high dives.

My fingers cleave watersilk.
I breathe heavy light.
The big cavitation of the props
gone by, my struggling stops, my slowed

descent, in diminishing light, 
gains the country where the shark 
is eagle, fish the fishermen, and men 
no more than stones along the road.





Exploring the Pastime Reaches and Beyond
 

Things in the dark
exist but are not realized.
Perhaps with wings
they wait for enacting light.
I start out as the sky descends
to the visible spectrum and begins.

Midmorning I find in a lab
a blue magnetic fluid:
revolving in the stress of gauss,
the source of blue resides.
November nights, up to the first snow,
derive from this seat of blue.

I spend a month reflecting at Palomar.
My delicate fourteen tons
I bring to bear
on galaxies: their lonely shine
harbors
on my dustless, understanding curve.

I come to a mountain out of season.
The brass benchmark telling the height
is under ice.
Without witness, without cease
a blizzard
pummels the summit's face.

I reach the pole. Here at the axis
the wobble and grind is audible.
My compass tries to point straight down.
It, too, deceived: Having achieved
one absolute, the source of north,
to find that south surrounds, is all but it.

The Humboldt Current has my boat 
and its mile of line straight down. 
Now and then, fishermen haul in 
the inexplicable
along with seabream, haddock, squid. 
I hook a coelacanth, thought long 
extinct, and brain it with an oar.

Nose to the bottom
I shove off from the hundred fathom curve.
Slow footage of mud unreeling through my mind,
the miles of decline become my age.
Hauled up someday by accident,
rupturing in the lost pressure,
my look will say how knowing feels.

Living among the trilobites
I learn you cross great lengths of time
by stilling the waiting in yourself.
From scavengers I see how you can live
off your own dead kind.
I gum the grit of a tidal flat
and have no name.

A chance letter brings me home,
telling how I was found.
Returned I sit
like water in a jar,
light from a window passing through,
a slow rain of precipitate
remembering the bottom.





Two Moths
 

Some girls        on the other side of this planet

                   will never know        the loveliness

       of walking      in a crepe silk sari.      Instead, 

they will spend        their days                          on their backs 

   for a parade               of men           who could be       their uncles

       in another life.         These girls memorize 

                    each slight wobble                  of fan blade as it cuts 

       through the stale       tea air and auto-rickshaw 

                     exhaust,        thick as egg curry. 

Men         shove greasy rupees        at the door 

                      for one hour         in a room 

      with a twelve-year-old.                One hour--               One hour-- 

             One hour.            And if she cries afterward, 

   her older sister       will cover it up.         Will rim 

              the waterline             of her eyes                 with kohl pencil 

                       until it looks like                        two silk moths 

                                have stopped      to rest       on her exquisite     face. 







Samba in the Sky
 

The poor have the best views,
Views sloping down to sea.

A green and yellow planet,
A blue band, rung with stars.

The poor have the best views.
You have to walk to get there.

Up three flights, narrow paths,
Houses rising steeply side to side.

No, no space for a car.
When the flag lifts, you see the coast:

Yellow curve of sand,
Framed by reaching branches.

Little humpbacked islands,
Soon they will drill for oil there,

Deep underwater. Once microscopic
Diatoms swarmed in salt, danced, died.

Fell to the bottom of fathoms, became black 
Slick hid in shale. They drill down miles...

(Police arriving at the edge
Of the mind.)

Are you thirsty? Something to drink?
Please sit down. Yes, the game is on.

We built that room by hand. I lie
In bed at night dreaming of a new room,

One jutting into sky. The eldest
Daughter's in university. Economics,

But she switched to Environment.

Out the door, the flag lifts, reveals.
(Curve of Rio.) Ordem e progresso. 

The poor have the best views,
Samba in the sky.





Medusa on Sansome and Pine
 

The woman is daft.
Invented her own sect.
Has upside-down sex.
With alternate species.

You see her on the street.
Corner of Sansome and Pine:
Morning rev up of sf financial types.
Instead, there she is, beneath a gigantic hat.

Hair wild, in coils, like a rattle-
Snake. Smiles like she's got the shakes.
Every cell in her seems to vibrate.
Psst! Could you turn that to low?

The gray-suited, heads bent to cement, pass.
Edges of her sleeves are threads;
Her clothes mismatch. The shoes
Are not a pair. She stands as you stare,

Or better yet, ignore. You ask
Her if she's fine, and she replies, Fan-
Tastic! As if this were the day
She'd finally learned to levitate,

And her eyes are the doors
To a holographic universe,

And she looks right through you,
As if you too had won the lottery of the soul.
And you look down at your shiny, perfectly symmetrical shoes,
Like, Man, that's more than I wanted to know.

And--Didn't anyone tell you you need a reason--
A house you own, matching clothes,
Translucent skin, sheen of fashion,
A pulsing bank account, like our galaxy always expanding--

To feel so friggin' over the moon?
Who are you? How do you justify you?
What made you you? What context gave you you?
And on the curb you kick, swing, scuff your shoes.

The woman is daft.
Invented her own sect.
Probably has no sex, or too much.
With any species.

She hasn't yet learned
That happiness is contingent--
It depends upon 
The things aforelisted. 

She's just riding on the being of being.
Hedonist. On her hand, a rock
As if, eons ago, the glacier had swung by and deposited
A boulder on her finger. The elemental pinned to her.

The woman is daft, I tell you.
Adrift. Steer clear. The glint
In her--shield your eyes. Downcast.
Don't let it get to you. She will die

Alone--while you, you'll have--
Have--Resist. Do not, 
I say, do not
Long for that magic.





How Many Days Can You Live on Vicodin and Frosty?
 

Poor thing, she holds him on her lap,
the godless hidden god,

causing the lips
of those that sleep to speak.

Cold shadow of the white
acanthus in its tiptoe dance.

Buy the truth
and sell it not.

A lion is in the streets,
there is a lion in the way.

My niece, the little siren, 
taught her the slang:

mad married fiance.

Dido has a quiver,
she wears a spotted lynx

skin and a belt. 
My undefiled is not herself

tonight, but one thing's forever:
I just saw the video explaining

the neighborhood applause,
a book of anthems where sirens

plunge into the gold of the initials
at that karaoke party for her 

boyfriend. We cooked up 
all the goodies and fauns

come through the windows.
That's her thing.

"I like this path to darkness
she keeps saying.

Whatever party fame's doing to her
chances for a quick trial. 

Barbarella can't touch her Goldilocks.

That dog don't bird
for she coming back or not.





Buying Camels in Dresden
 

Like all great rivers
The Elbe is familiar at first sight.
The barges
             spic & span as the front parlors
Of model homes in Saxony--
The steam paddle-wheelers & other
                                               vessels,
No less impeccable--all run
With a near soporific efficiency.
You lean out
                   & the land starts up:
The parcels of pastures & castles
Bearing with them trees & cows & cattle-grids
         the crowned heads of daisies
Little knots of human habitations,
Cigarette factory & garrisons
Floodplains, sheet pilings
Run
          All run,
As if by an engine,
Some cement breaker from under the river
                                   torn turfs all
Bob up & down,
Brown
           like bears in bear gardens
The cupolas, cavaliers
Their ruinous sandstone reflections alongside.
Whether this is the famous effect
               Of the Balcony of Europe
Cork coasters chasing gilt coronets
              Maps loosely adrift on a map
So many teacups clicking,
Large balconies colliding
           Breaking up into smaller ones
Valley & vineyards
Mines, bridges, sugar-beet fields, villas,
Museum corridors
A Procession of Princes
Chimera of Chinese porcelain palaces
Cargoes of homeland & meadows,
Other
Municipalities, the beer & beer mats,
Coal, forestry,
History atop Geography atop History
Flags roll unroll--coalesce
Black--red--yellow
Yellow Black
Red
Runs

White
Sunk trains with passengers
Trains sunk
               April '45 Bergen-Belsen

Run   Elbe   Run


I pulled away.
I have come this day to the bank of the Elbe
To write a few postcards
In a tearoom.


                                  On the steps up
From street level to the Old Albertinum Museum
                                         some way from the tearoom
A man too is minding his business
On his lap a glass case
For keyboard
2 rows of colored sand in test tubes
Raspberry/burnt sienna/turquoise/Prussian blue/lavender/ochre
Or neutral--just sand.
Into a beer bottle he tips a little color
           & before you know
Our man has tossed one up in the air like a baby
& caught it roundly by the heels too,
Le voil, not one grain escapes
It is shockproof, waterproof,
A world like a Swiss watch,
& time-proof--
You count three camels
It looks like 4,--any number could have been packed in the bottle
Which, when turned slowly in the palm
                                  An orderly procession,
: Camels against a horizon of low sun
An irradiated sky,
Palm tree, undulating dunes
               A strata of deep watermelon subsiding to honey halva
The silhouette of a tent, hint of
A sandstorm in the air.
                                         Grit under eyelids
& should you prefer
From the array of bottles you could take home one with
A full sun, an Egyptian sun-disk
& you have his word,--no fear,
             each hermetically sealed,
Will travel.


                                                 As if to say not all the grains
Are sand, our man also works
With rice.
He's a jeweler.
He will encrypt
On a grain of rice
                             a word,
Enclosed in a colored phial of water
           again hermetically
For all time
                    Like the camels.
A jewel, he said,
The word
                         a ruby, an emerald
Of water
Should you forget, here his English broke off
But you understand
Yes, there is closure.
As I watched, a lady at my elbow
                        Like one at a sance, asked
For the name "Christine, her grand daughter, she said.
& he, our scribe, answered he was from Iran,
           --not that anyone inquired.
Iranian, then
--Hence the camels
Though here in Dresden
He had looked Mexican
A second before.
I looked again & saw that he could be from anywhere,
It depends on where you stand.
This man has for good or ill
                         the face of the world,
Which he bears sadly
With some mirth.


I pulled away.
                     Another moment I would have
To come up with a name, a word,
Another world.


I was happy with my purchase of camels
On the Elbe.
Back home it holds Dresden & the Elbe for me in a bottle.
It runs
           for so long as anyone would care to look,
Not a drop more.
I would have liked to write a card to the bottler
Addressing sands
           sands of the world thereof
My migrant,
                 errant friend
I wish you all the grains
                       whatever you had set out for,
& always
Sands enough to take you,
                                just where you stand
Waiting for your No. 28 sunsets, No. 20,
The watermelon sunrise
& no end of camels.





Snake Oil, Snake Bite
 

They staunched the wound with a stone.
They drew blue venom from his blood 
            until there was none.
When his veins ran true his face remained 
lifeless and all the mothers of the village 
wept and pounded their chests until the sky 
             had little choice 
but to grant their supplications. God made 
             the boy breathe again.

God breathes life into us, it is said,
only once. But this case was an exception. 
God drew back in a giant gust and blew life into the boy
and like a stranded fish, he shuddered, oceanless.

It was true: the boy lived. 
He lived for a very long time. The toxins 
were an oil slick: contaminated, cleaned.
But just as soon as the women
kissed redness back into his cheeks
the boy began to die again.
He continued to die for the rest of his life.
The dying took place slowly, sweetly.
The dying took a very long time.





The Maty Embroidery
 

On the platter set out in the center of the Maty-embroidered tablecloth
was the syringe. And around it was silence. My father
gazed at my mother, and she back at him. Slowly,
faltering, he began to speak. I was seized by
an unusual shuddering. I recall that he used the word fate,
and that if I consented to the injected dose,
we could all fall asleep. We would stay together
for all time. And evade the uncertainty in mortifying 
desperation. A fifteen-year-old's desire to live 
cried out in me: "No! To which
my father stated: "If you want to live, then
we too must keep on living, because we can't leave you
by yourself. My father was the village doctor. I grew up
with no siblings. My mother's sister lived next door,
with her husband and two children, Nelly and Gyurika.
In the evenings I prayed: "Merciful Lord of mine,
My eyes have closed, but thine, yet still are open, father mine,
Watch over me as I recline. Then this: "In one God 
I believe, in one homeland I believe, in the eternal 
divine truth I believe, in Hungary's re-
surrection I believe. Amen. Gyuri could not study in Pest,
he went to Brnn. Later, not even there. Then the family
sent him to Toulouse. My mind could not comprehend. Then
one of uncle Vilmos's servants murdered him with six ax-blows.
He screamed crazed into the courtyard: "That's what
the stinking Jew deserved! I found him, his head smashed open.
I ran to my father, who didn't even believe it. And one after
the other, the horrors came. Nelly lived in jvidk 
with her husband. Uncle Ern was in the middle of shaving when
Hungarians broke into the flat. They were looking for the family. 
The nanny quickly threw a quilt onto six-month-old Tomika,
they didn't notice him. Peterke was out with Nelly. Uncle Ern
was executed on the ice of the Danube. Nelly did not recover.
She knitted pullovers, each more beautiful than the next, so as not
to feel the pain. She went to Pest to learn a trade,
so she could support her children. That's how it was when
nineteen-forty-four came. On March 15, one of my teachers said,
"You remain seated, while the class sang the Anthem,
"and be quiet. On the day of the nineteenth, the Germans
invaded. From then on, it was obligatory to wear the star.
Through the intervention of the medical officer and the Lord Lieutenant, my father
could have stayed out. I had to move to the ghetto with my mother. My
father said "The family should stay together. All up and down
our street they stood, to bid farewell. Father acknowledged
them, but already he was just waiting
for the end. He had aged by decades. Then the injection,
the one I already spoke of, turned up on the table with the
Maty embroidery. We sat in the evening underneath the open sky
before being loaded onto the freight cars. The doctor from the next village
drank mercury chloride with his wife. Despite my father's stomach lavage,
they succumbed by the morning. There were eighty of us in the wagon.
An expectant mother gave birth on the way. But with no water, my father
could not save them. There were those who went mad in the freight cars.
My father taught me always to say "Ich will
arbeiten. On the seventh of July the train stopped. Father read 
the plaque, Auschwitz-Birkenau, and said, "We are
lost! Megaphones blared, "Leave your packages
in the wagons, they will be brought to you later. Special vehicles
are coming for the sick and the elderly, just remain sitting,
they repeated, "everything will be fine. Men exit
the wagon to the left, women to the right. As farewell, 
my papa said, "Always be my clever, my obedient, my good 
little girl... That is how we parted for eternity. Tomika and Peterke
were squeezing my hand tightly, but my mother said, "Don't
you want to sit down? We can walk. Come...
We moved forward in a column of five rows. The bulbs of the searchlights
blinded us in the eyes. A German officer, legs wide apart. He stood there
somewhere far away. Sent us to the right. Had to get undressed
in a room. Then they sent us into another, and the iron door slammed,
bolted shut. Screaming, I pounded on it again and again. We truly 
were lost, as last I understood.... Turning around, the others
already shaved bald. I didn't recognize anyone.
They stood there like sheep. Upon their skin, the writing of gooseflesh.





Rocket
 

Despite that you 
wrote your name 
and number
on its fuselage 
in magic marker

neither your quiet 
hours at the kitchen
table assembling
it with glue

nor your choice of
paint and lacquer

nor your seemingly
equally perfect 
choice of a seemingly 
breezeless day
for the launch of
your ambition

nor the thrill 
of its swift ignition

nor the heights
it streaks

nor the dancing
way you chase
beneath its 

dot

across that
seemingly endless
childhood field

will ever be 
restored to you 

by the people
in the topmost
branches of whose trees

unseen

it may yet from 
its plastic 
chute
on thin 
white 
string

still swing.





Bravery
 

A rung's 
come broken in the 
ladder to the mow

and so one hesitates 
to clamber up there
just to bomb a cow
with dung or bother 
swallows from their 
rafter cakes. It takes
a new footing some-
where in the ribs' 
treads, about heart- 
height, to climb it 
now. A new gap's in
the smile that smiles
from the limed barn 
floor. There seems 
to come a break in 
the war. But soon, one
of a neighbor's sons, 
too young to know 
it was otherwise once, 
braves it, and soon, 
even with a sweater-
swaddled kitten or a 
BB gun, all the kids 
can do it again, nearly 
at a run, like pros, and
so it goes, as before.





Tell Life
 

For Ghassan Zaqtan
1



I now release from my blood                the bird of thirty she wasted
that's how wars                                        crumble us

I now tell those                                        who are exhausted from the expense 
of children the secret                              of happiness and happiness itself

from what is arrived at                          but doesn't come 
from the language                                  of balance

defeat                                                        has the taste 
of being shrouded                                 with another's banner
while your enemies                                chant your names

Some music                                              some shelling 
will strike our dead                                 who flew off in the early raids
have you seen them                                return from their flying?

They stayed behind                                 hanging by the thread 
of their surprise                                       and by their women's hair

We will dance                                           in the wreckage drink the coffee 
our dead left brewing                             we will open our tombs 
to windows for the sea                            in order 
for the sea to remain                               besieged

Right here                                                 right here 
a corpse shook its trunk                         in the earth a corpse snapped 
God's ropes                                               houses gathered then hid
what's easy to interpret                          of people's speech

Which mourners ebbed                         and turned the sea to tombstones 
for our dead which poem                      was said and revived us?

And that huge rose of ours                    our only bewilderment 
our offense                                                on earth our balcony 
on the kingdom of heaven                    the grandfather's house

a hand that gestures                               farewell
in the roar of the massacre                   a white hand like old time
a free hand like death                             after death

Tell my love                                              space has been plucked
tell her to sleep                                        on disaffection's stone

 Two raids three raids                             a whole morning
a year of long                                           bombardment over your going

Did you forget                                          a newspaper of palm fronds 
a time of white dawn                             some hay from last season's siege
a brief greeting                                        like a mumbling 
on mornings                                            of slow advance

a suitcase a rug a palm                          with which you touched the evening 
of shelling                                                 into a meaning 
for a people                                              kind and assured and silent?

Whenever glass shook                           you would shriek
kid                                                              I pluck 
your death's anemone                           and eat it 

Each land                                                  has its people 
each time                                                  has its folks and time 
for a while now                                        has been standing on our throats 

As if we don't love                                  or hate as if we've seen the land 
only as a bracelet                                    a house a dress a poem left filled 
with those who were killed                   without war

Memory shrinks                                      until it fits in a fist
memory shrinks                                      without forgetting

a boy in a farm                                         a chicken on a roof
a dot on the planet                                  mysterious and intuitive like parents

or a tree for a hat                                     with prairies
for a dictionary                                         and days like sleeves

short in summer                                      cotton in winter 
they resist when squeezed                     between our knees

A not so First World                               rains on a calm boy
torn apart                                                  like a tattered tent

The lily of words                                      enters his heart takes a wedding 
by the horns                                              a well-trained bulbul 
by the scandalous                                    fruit rush of the river

His return                                                 will be washed shrouded
a field's first flower                                 guarded by dirt

Coffee coffee                                            for the beautiful one
whose heart's                                           a tambourine this morning
while war                                                  shouts cold on slopes

In the saddles                                          grass grows 
warmth matures                                     in oleander 
the river pours                                        in your absence 
everything                                                will happen

I exchanged                                             half of my books to sit near you 
flung my hand                                         so that it may see you
then retrieved it                                      to touch what it saw

We slept like sponges                            near the river butterflies descended
from the ribs of shadow                        then left behind 
a mirror pitched                                     like a house of jinn

It'll be difficult                                          that you go
before you choose a grave                      fit for sleep 

It'll be difficult                                         that you die
before you choose a grave                     fit for running 
for flood swimming                                for dense reeds by irrigation channels 
for bird snares                                         for the lettuce garden in the backyard 

for old dry thatch                                    on mud roofs
for jujube shrubs                                     for climbing on trucks and holding on
to vegetable boxes                                   for the diffusion of secrets 
loading and unloading                           in the big market

A grave fit for you                                    to see Jericho light up 
through the windows                              as a neon garden 
the refugee camps                                    by the marshes touch 

A grave fit for you                                    to see Jericho's convent toss
grass liquor our way                                fir for some arches 
where oleander wilts                               near Bedouin tents 

And their watchdogs                               will dig and dig 
and dig and dig                                        and you won't come

And the mules                                           in the junkyards
does anyone feed                                      their loneliness when they cry?

Or has anyone quenched                        their oneness or washed
their dead necks                                       or visited them to remember how 
they blackened                                          in their sleep?

The mules the movie                               extras who fold their torsos 
in the packed air                                       as lineage 
floats on light                                            an icon 
of wondrous dust                                     and riddles

And our neighbor                                    the one whose voice 
fenced us with reeds                               all day and all night

She would forget                                      her rings in our hands
two boys                                                    who used to dance for her





And a Lie
 

The asking was askance.
And the tell all told. 
So then, in tandem,

Anathema, and anthem.
The truth was on hold,
Seeking too tasking.

And the wool was pulled
Over as cover.
No eyes were kept peeled.

My iris I missed
The truth, now mistrust
All things seen, and this

Distrust, the sounded distress signal
Called and called and culled from your damsel.





Norroway in February
 

The glassy hill I clomb for thee
For surefooted step, hooves behoove the haver. 
The sky redid blue, the woman wavered,

and the black bull (the vanquisher), vanished.
She called out to nothing, and in vain shed 

tears until she reached the glass hill's impasse. 
Served her standard fairy tale penance, passim,

served her seven to be given iron
shoes to--at last--scale the hill, the earned

neared end. Each step conquered territory,
at last, the sleeping prince-once-bull, torrid tearing 

of clothes, tearing on one's clothes, three nights of this
until the prince awakes. How she, exhausted,

must have felt in the at long last, the ever after.
Happily, I guess, but a long time until laughter.





The Fox Bead in May
 

The kiss is, strictly speaking, a passing
of of twice: a bead from her mouth to his,
then back, ad nauseam, and the boys who lived
and died for it. The lovely girl amassing

ninety-nine spirits, and in high spirits
for consuming her highest amount. Once
the hundredth boy arrived she starts her hunt
in her haunt, a hill's field filled with fitting

Artemisia absinthium.
And every day they kissed to swap the bead
and for a month he waned and wans

and when he learned the truth about her tongue,
he downed the bead: her true form a nine-tailed
fox who could have turned human, had he kissed on.





Bad Year Anthem
 

Who can face the sea and not inherit its loneliness?                 --Olin Ivory
I


Gray sky, gray sea--gray mind, the man thinks. He thinks:
To grow old with it and kicks a stone into the water.

He mucks at the seam and it crumbles below him.

A sea gull beaks a crab, flights vertically and drops
it to the rocks. The man cracks with laughter,

tossing a stone to a stone.



II


Working alone means the voice must grow louder,
for who can stand to think quietly all through the day's calculations?

I cannot. I let the voice grow loud. I let the voice
hum outside my body in distinguishable phrasings, and count

the increments as I set the fence according to the blade. All day

I stand before a blade and push things into its path.

I stand aside as what is removed is whisked alongside me.
The smallest particles of what is removed thicken the air,

making a dream inside which one cannot live. All day
the voice is learning how to be outside of the body.



III


A man is not a beach, nor is he stone, though he collects their entirety
in a single thought. He works alone and his thoughts begin to
smack of stone. His teeth clatter with their collection.



IV


A man can hold a secret between his teeth,
and it will never leave his mouth, for who would listen
to his wavering tune of so sad and how hard and hear
anything original? He is that he is--the errand and the fool

running to himself over and over only to find that even he
is tired of telling about it. To grow old with it

was the task, and the question always: would he last?

A man can believe in the body and have no one,

as though he were ghost
or stone, nothing to speak at or be heard from.



V


All work, no pay makes a body bray.
Though he may bray--

Though he may bray and bray,

forgive him the bit. If he tells you his secret,
he will have no secret.
This is how one sings a sentence into stone.





In the Year of "No Work
 

I would drive the pre-dawn dark to stake
my spot to fish for dinner, to numb my hands in the ice
bucket, to pluck, from the neat stack, a herring,
to fit the skullcap and pierce the eye with a toothpick,
the body double-hooked, my fingertips glimmering
with the scales of the dead while the line whined free
from the reel, and the bait arced out over the tidal current
on a point in view of the town where I lived,

where I had become a man
                                                       with no money,
suddenly concerned only with money, for there were mouths
and I had helped to make them--

The eddy swirled, kept my line taut, my
whole body taut though a man a few down the row
laughed, sitting back on his bucket while he pulled in more fish
than he could take.

I hated the other men, hated the ones who caught nothing,
who crossed lines or hooked gulls, who plucked even birds from the sky
and slowly drew them in while they struggled and looked away, even,
finally, in the hands of the man who only wanted them free.

I climbed the breakwater and fished and spoke to no one.

I baited my line and thought of a woman
who would carry my body over the threshold
of our small white house simply with her eyes
because I had brought something home,
for her, for us, our boys at my side
while one fish was divided and indeed did feed many--

(Now to sift the facts for truth):

I reeked of the sea and had nothing to show for it.

Darkling saltwater for a dream
and no other place to be.





Speak
 

A storm and so a gift. 
       Its swift approach 
             lifts gravel from the road. 
A fence is flattened in 
       the course of the storm's 
             worse attempt at language-- 
thunder's umbrage. A tree 
       is torn apart, 
             blown upward through a bedroom 
window. A boy winnows 
       through the pile 
             of shards for the sharpest parts
from the blown-apart 
       glass. He has 
             a bag that holds found edges 
jagged as a stag's
       horns or smooth as 
             a single pane smashed into 
smaller panes that he sticks 
       his hand into 
             to make blood web across 
his ache-less skin flexing 
       like fish gills 
             O-lipped for a scream
it cannot make.
       He wants to feel 
             what his friends have felt, 
the slant of fear on their faces 
       he could never 
             recreate, his body configured 
without pain. When his skin's 
       pouting welts 
             don't rake a whimper 
from his mouth, he runs 
       outside, arms up 
             for the storm, aluminum 
baseball bat held out 
       to the sky 
            until lightning with an electric 
tongue makes his viscera 
       luminescent; 
             the boy's first word for pain
       is the light's 
             new word for home.





Do-rag
 

O darling, the moon did not disrobe you.
You fell asleep that way, nude
and capsized by our wine, our Bump

n' Grind shenanigans. Blame it
on whatever you like; my bed welcomes 
whomever you decide to be: thug-

mistress, poinsettia, John Doe 
in the alcove of my dreams. You
can quote verbatim an entire album

of Bone Thugs-n-Harmony
with your ass in the air. There's nothing
wrong with that. They mince syllables

as you call me yours. You don't 
like me but still invite me to your home
when your homies aren't near

enough to hear us crash into each other 
like hours. Some men have killed 
their lovers because they loved them

so much in secret that the secret kept 
coming out: wife gouging her husband 
with suspicion, churches sneering

when an usher enters. Never mind that.
The sickle moon turns the sky into 
a man's mouth slapped sideways 

to keep him from spilling what no one would
understand: you call me God when it 
gets good though I do not exist to you 

outside this room. Be yourself or no one else 
here. Your do-rag is camouflage-patterned 
and stuffed into my mouth.





Homan and Chicago Ave.
 

Cross the blood 
that quilts your busted lip 
with the tender tip 
of your tongue. That lip's 
blood is brackish and white 
meat flares from the black 
swell. You crossed your mama's 
mind so call her sometimes. 
She dreams your dead daddy 
still puts his hands on her 
waist. She calls his name 
then crosses herself, calls 
the police then crosses 
her fingers. Cross me 
and get cut across your cheek, 
its fat bag full of bad words 
and cheap liquor you hide 
from your badass kids. Make 
a wish for bad weather 
when the hoodlums get to shooting 
in a good summer's heat. 
Cross the territory between 
two gangs and feel eyes stare 
and cross in a blur of crosshairs. 
When a shot man lands 
in the garden of trash the block 
flares up like an appetite 
spurred on by the sight 
of prey, by the slurred 
prayer of a man so death-close 
he sees buzzards burrow 
their bladed beaks into 
his entry wound. Tune 
the trumpets. Make way through 
dusk's clutter. After death 
the dead cross over into song, 
their bones tuning-forked 
into vibrancy. Cross your lips, 
mutiny against all speech 
when a corpse starts singing 
despite its leaded larynx. Don't 
say miracle when butterflies 
break from a death-gaped skull, 
rout the sky, and scatter.





Of Darker Ceremonies
 

After "E. 1999 Eternal by Bone Thugs-n-Harmony
Dear god of armed robberies and puff-puff-pass,
a chalk outline unpeels from the street, smashes 
every windshield, and leaves florid temples of crack 
on porches. Burnt-black pleats of joint-pressed lips
prophesied your return. Please accept these nickel bags 
as offerings. Brick bastions of piss-stench thresholds 
and boarded windows require a weekly sacrifice.
Is there a Tarot card called "The Corner, a shrike 
shown lifting a corpse from the pike of a middle finger?
Children speak to their murdered brothers with a cereal box 
and construction paper cut into a Ouija's tongue that licks 
yes when asked if liquor could polish a skull in a way 
pleasing to the dead, licks no when asked for a name.





Thirty Going
 

on seventeen, I come from hearty straw.
My grandpa wore a gallon
hat. My grandma, like a shogun,
bun and shawl. For their honeymoon,
they went to the movies. No one
knows what they saw.

You arrive with licorice, cigarettes,
the documentary on Woody Allen.
Don't feign a passion for his start

in tv, or his clarinets,
or Love and Death. Just skip to the Soon-
Yi part.








You Look Like I Feel
 

Dirt on my chin and I wonder: am I already
in the ground? Like a toy turned real, I cannot shed
the sense that I have died. The German word

for Heaven's the same

as the German word for sky. On hearing a cruel
prince was in danger, I prayed for him to thrive,
not for his own sake, but for the concubines,

sure to end up buried

along. To my real face, a man once crowed
i ruined you, and though he did, the joke's
on him: he ruined me only for this world,

and this world is not long

for itself. The Earth, that ever-loving
but distrustful kin, keeps leaving us just a little
pocket money when it dies, never the land--







Not Horses
 

What I adore is not horses, with their modern
domestic life span of 25 years. What I adore
is a bug that lives only one day, especially if
it's a terrible day, a day of train derailment or
chemical lake or cop admits to cover-up, a day
when no one thinks of anything else, least of all
that bug. I know how it feels, born as I've been
into these rotting times, as into sin. Everybody's
busy, so distraught they forget to kill me,
and even that won't keep me alive. I share
my home not with horses, but with a little dog
who sees poorly at dusk and menaces stumps,
makes her muscle known to every statue.
I wish she could have a single day of language,
so that I might reassure her don't be afraid--
our whole world is dead and so can do you no harm.





Gazelle Lost in Watts
 

          
          I saw you painted on a ghetto wall last summer and thought don't submit to this medium...everybody's running into the wall or running into each other and plagiarizing our future like mummies and nukes, I watched you hug the Mona Lisa. I wanna use the word pariah until it shrugs for us and even their disguises go limp as a fire tumbling down a hillside into the playfulness in my heart, acres and acres of a lean, almost spiritual vibe afraid of its own momentum and then not afraid again 





Niggas in Raincoats Reprise
 

          
          Even alleged militants blame the vanishing of the summer sea ice on "Ghosts (short version) by Albert Ayler. He disappeared while he was getting his sound together. No one knows what happened but the water high in increments like a crown around his cries and glass is a liquid and you have to forgive your parents for whatever it is and they have to forgive themselves I would like to use this craft to fly with him I feel that saddle the morning after and try--again--warm in the habit of our warning and yearning for more of them until          We finally need to see this reckoning But when it's time I'm not ready and when I'm ready it's not time--that's fate. And blind in the halo of so-what, so-what, we make it a future I say, I don't know who you are. I say, It don't matter at this point, I do it all for you anyways (long run)--gorgeous photographs of industrial ruins so lush you want to lick them, be them, become a trend. Crushed under the debris, an instrument is so tender it breaks and mends in the same note. Becoming men is like that, degrading, uplifting, denial, lazily caving in Isis and ice until all of our guesses are obsolete we can't see nobody who isn't disappearing
        




Motown Philly Back Again
 

We're all pagans and shamans and clap your hands now we won't stop the beat

We believe in divine healing and we hate to see that evening sun go down

We know when the sight of our women dressed in white each ritual night, is touching, hypnotizes

The animals blush and split for us as revival, as revealed to themselves

These are triumphant women.

Even Sister Fame hiding out in the alley turning tricks and singing verses from the undid scripture, is touching

Thank you jesus, thank you jesus, that you jesus, baby, is that you, she mutters up high between rocks and lace--his eagerness--it was all night long

Sometimes he'd interrupt a recording session to tell us about his early Motown days or expand on his views of Heaven and Hell

One time he was saying how important it was to love one's father.

Do you love yours? I asked him

Why don't you tell him

Why don't you tell your father, he said

I will if you do

You go first





Do any black children grow up casual?
 

          
          And that other time after we got carjacked in L.A. on the way home from Spago. Like a scene outta that movie I don't like about those hoes I don't love. It is hard out there for a pimp. A white woman and her brown babies/brown babies in a fancy car with unlocked doors. Most everything is semi-automatic. Two black men hopped into the front row seats and started waving guns like pom-poms. We made it! We made it! Right against the rim of her porcelain brain. All they wanted was the car and the color. The car was white like her. She saved our lives. Then the penguins came over with a book full of photos of black men, so serious like kings in their mugging, and they asked us to pick which two it was. I was five but I could feel the shrugged evil of it so true and impossible to touch as I pretended to recognize us. We closed our eyes and pointed at you, and said, I don't know that man. Je ne connais pas cet homme. We saved our lives. We tugged at the flashlight looking for bruises and found you awake, and found a way.
        




As I was Going to St. Ives
 




As I was going to St. Ives,
 I met a man with seven wives,
 Each wife had seven sacks,
 Each sack had seven cats,
 Each cat had seven kits:
 Kits, cats, sacks, and wives,
 How many were there going to St. Ives? 








Mix a Pancake
 




Mix a pancake,
 Stir a pancake, 
Pop it in the pan; 
Fry the pancake, 
Toss the pancake-- 
Catch it if you can. 








Singing-Time
 

I wake in the morning early
 And always, the very first thing,
 I poke out my head and I sit up in bed 
 And I sing and I sing and I sing.





The Fox's Foray
 

A fox jumped out one winter's night, 
 And begged the moon to give him light. 
 For he'd many miles to trot that night 
 Before he reached his den O! 
                 Den O! Den O!
 For he'd many miles to trot that night before he reached his den O! 
  
 The first place he came to was a farmer's yard,
 Where the ducks and the geese declared it hard
 That their nerves should be shaken and their rest so marred 
 By a visit from Mr. Fox O! 
                Fox O! Fox O! 
  
 That their nerves should be shaken and their rest so marred 
 By a visit from Mr. Fox O! 
  
 He took the grey goose by the neck,
 And swung him right across his back;
 The grey goose cried out, Quack, quack, quack, 
 With his legs hanging dangling down O! 
                Down O! Down O!
 The grey goose cried out, Quack, quack, quack, 
 With his legs hanging dangling down O! 
  
 Old Mother Slipper Slopper jumped out of bed, 
 And out of the window she popped her head: 
 Oh, John, John, the grey goose is gone,
 And the fox is off to his den O! 
                Den O! Den O!
 Oh, John, John, the grey goose is gone, 
 And the fox is off to his den O! 
  
 John ran up to the top of the hill.
 And blew his whistle loud and shrill;
 Said the fox, That is very pretty music still 
 I'd rather be in my den O! 
                Den O! Den O!
 Said the fox, That is very pretty music still  
 I'd rather be in my den O! 
  
 The fox went back to his hungry den,
 And his dear little foxes, eight, nine, ten;
 Quoth they, Good daddy, you must go there again, 
 If you bring such god cheer from the farm O!
                Farm O! Farm O!
 Quoth they, Good daddy, you must go there again, 
 If you bring such god cheer from the farm O! 
  
 The fox and his wife, without any strife,
 Said they never ate a better goose in all their life: 
 They did very well without fork or knife,
 And the little ones chewed on the bones O! 
                Bones O! Bones O!
 They did very well without fork or knife, 
 And the little ones chewed on the bones O! 





The morns are meeker than they were - (32)
 

The morns are meeker than they were - 
 The nuts are getting brown -
 The berry's cheek is plumper -
 The rose is out of town. 
  
 The maple wears a gayer scarf -
 The field a scarlet gown -
 Lest I sh'd be old-fashioned 
 I'll put a trinket on. 





Your World
 

Your world is as big as you make it. 
 I know, for I used to abide
 In the narrowest nest in a corner, 
 My wings pressing close to my side. 
  
 But I sighted the distant horizon 
 Where the skyline encircled the sea 
 And I throbbed with a burning desire 
 To travel this immensity. 
  
 I battered the cordons around me 
 And cradled my wings on the breeze, 
 Then soared to the uttermost reaches 
 With rapture, with power, with ease!





The Ecchoing Green
 

The sun does arise,
 And make happy the skies.
 The merry bells ring
 To welcome the Spring.
 The sky-lark and thrush,
 The birds of the bush,
 Sing louder around,
 To the bells' cheerful sound. 
 While our sports shall be seen 
 On the Ecchoing Green. 
  
 Old John, with white hair 
 Does laugh away care, 
 Sitting under the oak, 
 Among the old folk, 
 They laugh at our play, 
 And soon they all say.
 Such, such were the joys. 
 When we all girls & boys, 
 In our youth-time were seen, 
 On the Ecchoing Green.' 
  
 Till the little ones weary
 No more can be merry
 The sun does descend,
 And our sports have an end: 
 Round the laps of their mothers, 
 Many sisters and brothers, 
 Like birds in their nest, 
 Are ready for rest;
 And sport no more seen,
 On the darkening Green. 





A Bird, came down the Walk - (359)
 

A Bird, came down the Walk - 
 He did not know I saw -
 He bit an Angle Worm in halves 
 And ate the fellow, raw, 
  
 And then, he drank a Dew
 From a convenient Grass -
 And then hopped sidewise to the Wall 
 To let a Beetle pass -
  
 He glanced with rapid eyes,
 That hurried all abroad -
 They looked like frightened Beads, I thought,
 He stirred his Velvet Head. - 
  
 Like one in danger, Cautious,
 I offered him a Crumb,
 And he unrolled his feathers, 
 And rowed him softer Home -
  
 Than Oars divide the Ocean,
 Too silver for a seam,
 Or Butterflies, off Banks of Noon, 
 Leap, plashless as they swim. 





Twelfth Song of Thunder [Navajo Tradition]
 

The voice that beautifies the land! 
 The voice above,
 The voice of thunder
 Within the dark cloud 
 Again and again it sounds,
 The voice that beautifies the land. 
  
 The voice that beautifies the land! 
 The voice below,
 The voice of the grasshopper 
 Among the plants 
 Again and again it sounds,
 The voice that beautifies the land. 





We grow accustomed to the Dark - (428)
 

We grow accustomed to the Dark - 
 When Light is put away -
 As when the Neighbor holds the Lamp 
 To witness her Good bye -
  
 A Moment - We uncertain step 
 For newness of the night -
 Then - fit our Vision to the Dark - 
 And meet the Road  - erect - 
  
 And so of larger - Darknesses -
 Those Evenings of the Brain -
 When not a Moon disclose a sign -
 Or Star - come out - within -
  
 The Bravest - grope a little -
 And sometimes hit a Tree 
 Directly in the Forehead -
 But as they learn to see -
  
 Either the Darkness alters -
 Or something in the sight 
 Adjusts itself to Midnight -
 And Life steps almost straight.





A Poem of Changgan
 

My hair had hardly covered my forehead.
 I was picking flowers, playing by my door,
 When you, my lover, on a bamboo horse,
 Came trotting in circles and throwing green plums. 
 We lived near together on a lane in Ch'ang-kan, 
 Both of us young and happy-hearted. 
  
 ...At fourteen I became your wife,
 So bashful that I dared not smile,
 And I lowered my head toward a dark corner
 And would not turn to your thousand calls;
 But at fifteen I straightened my brows and laughed, 
 Learning that no dust could ever seal our love,
 That even unto death I would await you by my post
 And would never lose heart in the tower of silent watching. 
  
 ...Then when I was sixteen, you left on a long journey 
 Through the Gorges of Ch'u-t'ang, of rock and whirling water. 
 And then came the Fifth-month, more than I could bear,
 And I tried to hear the monkeys in your lofty far-off sky.
 Your footprints by our door, where I had watched you go, 
 Were hidden, every one of them, under green moss,
 Hidden under moss too deep to sweep away.
 And the first autumn wind added fallen leaves.
 And now, in the Eighth-month, yellowing butterflies
 Hover, two by two, in our west-garden grasses
 And, because of all this, my heart is breaking
 And I fear for my bright cheeks, lest they fade. 
  
 ...Oh, at last, when you return through the three Pa districts, 
 Send me a message home ahead!
 And I will come and meet you and will never mind the distance, 
 All the way to Chang-feng Sha. 





Song VII ("My song has put off her adornments)
 

My song has put off her adornments.
 She has no pride of dress and decoration. 
 Ornaments would mar our union;
 they would come between thee and me; 
 their jingling would drown thy whispers.
  
 My poet's vanity dies in shame before thy sight. 
 O master poet, I have sat down at thy feet. 
 Only let me make my life simple and straight, 
 like a flute of reed for thee to fill with music.





Urban Affection
 

for Walt Whitman
Besides the obvious technological and architectural advances, only one thing has really changed between our generations:
 
We now live in an America where blacks are not only allowed the right to vote but can become the Redeemer President of the United States
 
Otherwise, we still live in an America where the audacity to openly enjoy the pleasures of sex and being respected for wisdom are contradictions without reconciliation
 
We still live in an America where the economy collapses while the masses are consumed with preventing the rights of anyone with a fancy for anything out of the ordinary
 
We still live in an America where rotting leaves, tufts of straw, and debris are found in more homes than poetry books
 
We still live in an America where Christ and Dracula provide both excitement and fear for restless lives longing for a simple touch
 
We still live in an America where the impact of urbanization reaches out to the common person more than the obscene nature of poetry
 
We still live in an America where writing about prostitution is considered trashy and profane
 
We still live in an America where poets have to work while publishing to survive financial difficulty unless they are fashioned like Shakespeare
 
We still live in an America where, unless you belong to a church, you are a religious skeptic believing in nothing
 
We still live in an America where overt sexuality, siding with the barnburners, and authoring disreputable books limit poets to a vagabond lifestyle
 
We still live in an America where breaking tradition and the boundaries of poetic form are considered the trademarks of a pretentious ass
 
We still live in an America where everything from thieves to dwarfs to fog to beetles deserve validity
 
We still live in an America where books cannot prevent war and the sick and wounded need healing
 
We still live in an America where not everyone can appreciate the beauty of immigration, crowded streets, brutal differences, urban affection
 
We still live in an America where the same sun that once invigorated your passion continues to provide us with the beauty of life worth fighting for
 
We still live in an America where America still lives in us
  
 





Step Father
 

He forgets that he used to call me mariconcito-
 that I harbored years of hatred toward him
 while hoping to find my real father. My
 childhood memories of him reminding me
 I was my mother's son, not his. I tried
 to poison him once and scattered sharp nails
 inside the shoes in his closet. By the time one
 of his sons died of AIDS I was already lost
 in contempt for the man I blamed for everything.
 There was the time I was in love and he met my
 boyfriend. Now he forgets to go to the bathroom
  
 or where he is but he still remembers Michael
 and asks about him. I help him walk slowly
 outdoors to step outside the prison cell that is
 the tiny apartment with no windows in which
 I grew up abused by both of them. He barely
 understands. His fate has been torture. I know
 that I cannot be his savior. I used to pray for
 him to die but here he is slowly fading. In his
 eyes I see that he learned to love me and wishes
 he could take it all back. He is unable to recall
 those drunken nights and hateful words. I should
  
 do the same. I left a long time ago but he still
 remains haunted by the little boy who wanted
 to belong. Like him, I want to forget that we
 made mistakes and caused so much pain. I need
 for both of us to remember how he taught me
 how to ride a bike and how to swim and told
 me, better late than never, that he loved me and
 was proud of all I had done. I have to help him
 settle into his favorite chair and let him know that
 I forgive him. There is a place somewhere where
 he will call me hijo and I will know him as my dad.
  





Versus
 

In this poem all artifice
is stripped away
but you are held under water.

In this poem you enter a mirrored dressing room
lit so that you look more beautiful than you have ever looked.

I recognize you with surprise.
In this poem you are by yourself.





One Boy Told Me
 

Music lives inside my legs. 
It's coming out when I talk.

I'm going to send my valentines 
to people you don't even know.

Oatmeal cookies make my throat gallop.

Grown-ups keep their feet on the ground 
when they swing. I hate that.

Look at those 2 o's with a smash in the middle--
that spells good-bye.

Don't ever say "purpose again, 
let's throw the word out.

Don't talk big to me.
I'm carrying my box of faces.
If I want to change faces I will.

Yesterday faded
but tomorrow's in boldface.

When I grow up my old names 
will live in the house 
where we live now. 
I'll come and visit them.

Only one of my eyes is tired. 
The other eye and my body aren't.

Is it true all metal was liquid first?
Does that mean if we bought our car earlier
they could have served it
in a cup? 

There's a stopper in my arm
that's not going to let me grow any bigger.
I'll be like this always, small.

And I will be deep water too.
Wait. Just wait. How deep is the river?
Would it cover the tallest man with his hands in the air?

Your head is a souvenir.

When you were in New York I could see you 
in real life walking in my mind.

I'll invite a bee to live in your shoe. 
What if you found your shoe 
full of honey?

What if the clock said 6:92
instead of 6:30? Would you be scared?

My tongue is the car wash 
for the spoon.

Can noodles swim?

My toes are dictionaries. 
Do you need any words?

From now on I'll only drink white milk 
on January 26.

What does minus mean? 
I never want to minus you.

Just think--no one has ever seen 
inside this peanut before!

It is hard being a person.

I do and don't love you--
isn't that happiness?





Dizzy
 

Zigging, mid-
block, he's off:
on a torn-up, trafficked slab of Second Avenue-- 
his cane sweeping
over

broken asphalt,
like a sapper or
an open skiff on back-splashing seas. For a few
seconds it's 
unclear

if he gets
the risk,
as yellow cabs swoop down and flock at the light.
Then, safe
home

on the other
side. And I
for one cannot take my eyes off him as he pivots,
compassing
north.

We're never
truly clear.
Now he jams himself at pace between a giant planter
and cross-braced
scaffold

newly set up
at Finnegans.
And wham. The guy is smack on his ass, un-staring up
to heaven,
stunned.

Damn,
I think, what
in hell was that? It's not like the pain of loving someone
who doesn't
want

you back
(though that
once ate up years of my life and left me blown like an artery
after too many
bypasses),

nor does it 
compare to 
frittering away in a job that I'm ill-suited to and which I'll
probably 
lose.

It's more
as if a hammer
dropped from a sill and laid him out cold. That scaffold
just appeared there
overnight. 

And for all
my hard-won bile
I'm not worse off than he is, except in this: I've come
to think I
am.





Frying Trout While Drunk
 

Mother is drinking to forget a man 
who could fill the woods with invitations:   
come with me he whispered and she went   
in his Nash Rambler, its dash 
where her knees turned green 
in the radium dials of the 50's. 
When I drink it is always 1953, 
bacon wilting in the pan on Cook Street   
and mother, wrist deep in red water,   
laying a trail from the sink 
to a glass of gin and back. 
She is a beautiful, unlucky woman 
in love with a man of lechery so solid   
you could build a table on it 
and when you did the blues would come to visit.   
I remember all of us awkwardly at dinner,   
the dark slung across the porch, 
and then mother's dress falling to the floor,   
buttons ticking like seeds spit on a plate.   
When I drink I am too much like her--   
the knife in one hand and the trout   
with a belly white as my wrist.   
I have loved you all my life 
she told him and it was true 
in the same way that all her life 
she drank, dedicated to the act itself,   
she stood at this stove 
and with the care of the very drunk   
handed him the plate.





Minding Rites
 

This guy I know, a rabbi, Friday nights, 
on his way home before sunset in winter, 
always stops at a florist or bodega 
and buys a bunch of flowers for his wife.

Every week the same, a ritual, 
regardless of her mood that morning, fresh 
upsets at work, or snarling on the bridge; 
he brings her roses wrapped in cellophane.

But isn't there a ring of hokiness 
in that? Why should a good man have to show 
his devotion? Some things go unspoken; 
some things get tested on the real world,

and isn't that the place that matters most? 
So when you told me I should bring you flowers, 
I joked, "But don't I show my feelings more 
in dog walks, diapers, and rewiring lamps?

The flowers, I learned later, weren't for wooing,
not for affection in long marriage, but
for something seeded even deeper down,
through frost heaves, and which might be, roughly, peace.

(It's funny that I just assumed romance.) 
Now there's no peace with us. I wonder what 
they might have meant to you, those simple tokens, 
holding in sight what no rite can grow back.





A Stop Before Starting
 

The only time I've been to Switzerland
was early one spring on a train through the mountains.
There was a lake--I guess it was Lucerne?
Above me cliff tops ridged with snow fanned out
so that where I stood at the edge of the platform
light bathed the empty siding all around
with a diffused opalescence off the water.

Behind the station must have been a town,
spires of churches, municipal arcades,
and coffee squelching in the fogged cafs.
I never saw the place, though I remember
thinking this is Switzerland and took
a mind-shot of the pines, breathing in the cold
as the porter whistled at us to reboard.





Dead Fox
 

We pretended to know nothing about it.
I withdrew to childhood training: stay out
of swampy undergrowth, choked edges.
This was around the time
we were too cruel to kill the mice we caught,
leaving them in the Have-a-Heart trap
under the sun-burning bramble of rugosa.
But moving up the trail, we caught a glimpse
right at the start: the fox just over the hillock
on the dune-side slope, spoiling
the grass-inscribed sand. Neither of us looked--
it seemed best to back away.
On the dune's steep side
we surveyed what we'd come for: ocean's
snaking blues beyond the meadow, the silvered
blade-like wands lying down. Lovely enough
to hold ourselves to that view.
But the currents of an odor wafted in and out,
until the sweep of smell grew wider, wilder.
The heat compounded, and ugliness
settled its cloud over us, profound as human speech,
although by then we were not speaking.





In Lent
 

Dead deer a week now by the snowy gate.
Do I have to watch it be eaten? Do I have to see
who comes first, who quarrels, who stays?

And there is the question of the night, 
what flesh preferred by which creature-- 
what sinew and fat, the organs, the eyes. 
These appetites: it's enough 
to know the swoop and cut of wings 
over the snarl of something leaping away.

Do I have to see the icy figure fused to the ground, 
scrabbled snow, not lovely or deep, 
but the surface of something spoiled? 
By now the rib bones arch above it all, 
unbroken light shining between them, 
above the black cavity.

And I hear the crows, complaint, complaint 
splitting the morning, hunched over the skull. 
They know their offices.





Magnificence, 4 AM
 

She thinks it wants to kill, this wind,
the wind with no mind--a transference
to everything out there.
Because she needs waking,
the howling is meant to wake her, a self
crying underneath her sleeping self,
the stilted house groaning on the edge.

For how many days now
this dominating sea?
Wind so absolute
it rides the rain sideways and up,
crashing out far beyond her
until the anchor
breaks away--
waves take possession, smash the boat
on concrete pilings.

But isn't this what she came for?





Infinite Riches in the Smallest Room
 

Silk spool of the recluse as she confects her eventual mythomania. 

If it is written down, you can't rescind it. 

Spoon and pottage bowl. You are starving. Come closer now. 

What if I were gone and the wind still reeks of hyacinth, what then. 

Who will I be: a gaudy arrangement of nuclei, an apple-size gray circle 

On the tunic of a Jew, preventing more bad biological accidents

                                From breeding-in. I have not bred-

In. Each child still has one lantern inside lit. May the Mother not 

Blow her children out. She says her hair is thinning, thin. 

The flowerbed is black, sumptuous in emptiness. 

Blue-footed mushrooms line the walkway to my door. I would as soon 

Die as serve them in a salad to the man I love. We lie down 

In the shape of a gondola. Venice is gorgeous cold. 3 December, 

Unspeakable anxiety about locked-in syndrome, about a fourth world. 

I cannot presume to say. The violin spider, she 

Has six good eyes, arranged in threes.

                                The rims of wounds have wounds as well. 

Sphinx, small print, you are inscrutable.

                                                            On the roads, blue thistles, barely 

Visible by night, and, by these, you may yet find your way home.





Freedom of Speech
 

If my own voice falters, tell them hubris was my way of adoring you. 
The hollow of the hulk of you, so feverish in life, cut open,

Reveals ten thousand rags of music in your thoracic cavity.
The hands are received bagged and examination reveals no injury.

Winter then, the body is cold to the touch, unplunderable,
                                 Kept in its drawer of old-world harrowing.

Teeth in fair repair. Will you be buried where; nowhere.

Your mouth a globe of gauze and glossolalia. 
And opening, most delft of blue,
                                                                  Your heart was a mess--

A mob of hoofprints where the skittish colts first learned to stand, 
Catching on to their agility, a shock of freedom, wild-maned.

The eyes have hazel irides and the conjunctivae are pale,

With hemorrhaging. One lung, smaller, congested with rose smoke. 
The other, filled with a swarm of massive sentimentia.

                                                                   I adore you more. I know 
The wingspan of your voice, whole gorgeous flock of harriers,

Cannot be taken down. You would like it now, this snow, this hour.
                                 Your visitation here tonight not altogether unexpected.

The night-laborers, immigrants all, assemble here, aching for to speaking,
                                                                                        Longing for to work.





Meditation on the Sources of the Catastrophic Imagination
 

Green as alchemy and even more scarce, little can be known 
Of the misfortunes of a saint condemned to turn great sorrows

Into greater egrets, ice-bound and irrevocable. The wings were left ajar 
At the altar where I've knelt all night, trembling, leaning, rough

As sugar raw, and sweet. From the outside, peering in, it would seem
My life had been smooth as a Prussian ship gliding on the bridegroom

Of her Baltic waters in a season of no wind. Tinny empire,

Neighborhood of Bokhara silks, were you to go, I would stop--simply 
                                As a pilgrim putting down his cup. Most of my life,

I had consorted with the unspeakable, longing to put my mouth 
On it. I was just imagining. I can be

Resumed. Some nights, I paint into the scene two Doves,
I being alternately one and then the other, calling myself by my kind.

                                                  In the living will if it says: Hydrate. Please.
 Hydration only. Do not resume me then.





A Girl Ago
 

No feeding on wisteria. No pitch-burner traipsing 
In the nettled woods. No milk in metal cylinders, no 
Buttering. No making small contusions on the page 
But saying nothing no one has not said before. 
No milkweed blown across your pony-coat, no burrs. 
No scent of juniper on your Jacobean mouth. No crush 
Of ink or injury, no lacerating wish.
                                                      Extinguish me from this. 
I was sixteen for twenty years. By September I will be a ghost 
And flickering in unison with all the other fireflies in Appalachia, 
Blinking in the swarm of it, and all at once, above 
And on a bare branch in a shepherd's sky.    No Dove.
                                                       There is no thou to speak of.





When Father Decided He Did Not Love Her Anymore
 

Tonight I will remember the model   
With the wide, sad mouth 
Who used to pose for father 
Because I love the dangers of memory,   
The boarded window and door,   
Rooms where one bare bulb   
Makes shadows swell up the wall.   
And yet I recall only vaguely   
The way her hem rustled on the floor   
Like sand against tin 
Laisse-moi tranquille, epicier,   
It said because I want it to 
Say something memorable.   
I want her back 
That brilliant, farfetched woman   
Who drank coffee in our garden   
And the days father fed me   
Absinthe through a sugar cube   
So I would be asleep by noon   
And wake to find Ramona posing   
Naked with a tambourine. 
Tonight the whole world is a garden   
In which the immortal whispers   
Something about art 
And its opportunities: 
Memory like a bolt of silk 
In a tailor's arms 
Can be made into anything   
Especially misfortune, 
Especially the year Ramona spent 
In a wrath almost Biblical 
And so far from the world 
Not even the moon could find 
Her study in Paris 
Where the doors opened to the river.





Two Girls Ago
 

No exquisite instruments.

No dead coming back as wrens in rooms at dawn.

No suicidal hankering; no hankering for suicide.

No one thousand days.

No slim luck for the only President I ever loved.

No lukewarm bath in oatmeal.

No lantern left for Natalie on the way home from school in her Alaskan dark.

No eye.

No Victorian slippers that walked the bogs to moor.

No Donner bones with cuts on them or not.

No horizontal weeping; no weeping vertically.

No flipping back your black tails at the black piano bench.

No Elgar, no Tallis, no post-industrial despair.

No French kissing in the field of wild raspberry and thorn.

No commissioned urn.

No threat. In the table of contents I'm not dead yet.





Epic
 

It's you I'd like to see Greece again with
You I'd like to take to bed of cyclamen
You know I nurse a certain myth
about myself              that I descend
de tribus d'origine asiatique
and am part Thracian or Macedonian
cleaving to a Hellenic mystique
after centuries' migration inland

a full moon             rising over the Acropolis
I can repeat the scene        this time  deux
as then I had no one to kiss
slicing halloumi amid the hullabaloo
of a rooftop taverna in July
The doors that opened to lovers
pulled like tree roots from darkness        I
close upon us now like book covers

The alcove in which we embrace
is cool with brilliant tile
and weirded by a dove's note       chase
of ouzo with Uzi          junta-style
History makes its noise      we duck
till it passes      Love we think is our due
Not we think like the epoch
the unchosen thing we're wedded to





Escape Architecture
 

They sang Green, Green Grass of Home 
sailing west from New Orleans.
They sang Ne Me Quitte Pas beneath mesquite

while digging graves in Matagorda.
Pelican soup was a vile, greasy potage.
They sang Green, Green Grass of Home

where alligator was a luxury (the meat)
down at the Turtle Bayou Turnaround.
They sang Ne Me Quitte Pas beneath mesquite.

Near the Old and Lost River they surmised
Spanish moss strains coffee pretty good.
They sang Green, Green Grass of Home.

They were whingeing Stuck in Lodi,
forty Slavonians in the Big Thicket.
They sang Ne Me Quitte Pas beneath mesquite.

They cut down the trees, they sawed the blocks,
split the blocks into billets, split the billets into boards.
They sang Green, Green Grass of Home.
They sang Ne Me Quitte Pas beneath mesquite.





Frederick Olmsted was right when he wrote
G.T.T. (Gone to Texas) was appended
"to every man's name who had disappeared

before the discovery of some rascality.
Brands were a language: Shanghai M, Running W.
Frederick Olmsted was right when he wrote,

or rode upright, through "a sort of Brobdingnag grass. 
Bradded L, Walking R, Swinging J.
Every man's name who had disappeared

singed like needles off a cactus, whiskers off rope
(this was a practice). Rocking T, Tumbling K--
Frederick Olmsted was right when he wrote

in the alphabet we got from the Canaanites.
Oxhead A. Camel G. If it doesn't brand, it bites.
To every man's name who had disappeared,

someone added: Sent to heaven to hunt for a harp. 
Or maybe it was another case of slow.
Olmsted slowed so he could write while he rode
among men whose names had disappeared.





Nocturne
 

Mother died last night,
Mother who never dies.

Winter was in the air,
many months away
but in the air nevertheless.

It was the tenth of May.
Hyacinth and apple blossom
bloomed in the back garden.

We could hear
Maria singing songs from Czechoslovakia--

How alone I am--
songs of that kind.

How alone I am,
no mother, no father--
my brain seems so empty without them.

Aromas drifted out of the earth;
the dishes were in the sink,
rinsed but not stacked.

Under the full moon
Maria was folding the washing;
the stiff sheets became
dry white rectangles of moonlight.

How alone I am, but in music
my desolation is my rejoicing.

It was the tenth of May
as it had been the ninth, the eighth.

Mother slept in her bed,
her arms outstretched, her head
balanced between them.





Visitors from Abroad
 

1


Sometime after I had entered
that time of life
people prefer to allude to in others
but not in themselves, in the middle of the night
the phone rang. It rang and rang
as though the world needed me,
though really it was the reverse.

I lay in bed, trying to analyze
the ring. It had
my mother's persistence and my father's
pained embarrassment.

When I picked it up, the line was dead.
Or was the phone working and the caller dead?
Or was it not the phone, but the door perhaps?


2


My mother and father stood in the cold
on the front steps. My mother stared at me,
a daughter, a fellow female.
You never think of us, she said.

We read your books when they reach heaven.
Hardly a mention of us anymore, hardly a mention of your sister.
And they pointed to my dead sister, a complete stranger,
tightly wrapped in my mother's arms.

But for us, she said, you wouldn't exist.
And your sister--you have your sister's soul.
After which they vanished, like Mormon missionaries.


3


The street was white again,
all the bushes covered with heavy snow
and the trees glittering, encased with ice.

I lay in the dark, waiting for the night to end.
It seemed the longest night I had ever known,
longer than the night I was born.

I write about you all the time, I said aloud.
Every time I say "I, it refers to you.


4


Outside the street was silent.
The receiver lay on its side among the tangled sheets,
its peevish throbbing had ceased some hours before.

I left it as it was;
its long cord drifting under the furniture.

I watched the snow falling,
not so much obscuring things
as making them seem larger than they were.

Who would call in the middle of the night?
Trouble calls, despair calls.
Joy is sleeping like a baby.





Aboriginal Landscape
 

You're stepping on your father, my mother said,
and indeed I was standing exactly in the center
of a bed of grass, mown so neatly it could have been
my father's grave, although there was no stone saying so.

You're stepping on your father, she repeated,
louder this time, which began to be strange to me,
since she was dead herself; even the doctor had admitted it.

I moved slightly to the side, to where
my father ended and my mother began.

The cemetery was silent. Wind blew through the trees;
I could hear, very faintly, sounds of weeping several rows away,
and beyond that, a dog wailing. 

At length these sounds abated. It crossed my mind
I had no memory of being driven here,
to what now seemed a cemetery, though it could have been
a cemetery in my mind only; perhaps it was a park, or if not a park,
a garden or bower, perfumed, I now realized, with the scent of roses-- 
douceur de vivre filling the air, the sweetness of living,
as the saying goes. At some point,

it occurred to me I was alone.
Where had the others gone,
my cousins and sister, Caitlin and Abigail?

By now the light was fading. Where was the car
waiting to take us home?

I then began seeking for some alternative. I felt
an impatience growing in me, approaching, I would say, anxiety.
Finally, in the distance, I made out a small train,
stopped, it seemed, behind some foliage, the conductor
lingering against a doorframe, smoking a cigarette.

Do not forget me, I cried, running now
over many plots, many mothers and fathers--

Do not forget me, I cried, when at last I reached him.
Madam, he said, pointing to the tracks,
surely you realize this is the end, the tracks do not go further.
His words were harsh, and yet his eyes were kind;
this encouraged me to press my case harder.
But they go back, I said, and I remarked
their sturdiness, as though they had many such returns ahead of them.

You know, he said, our work is difficult: we confront
much sorrow and disappointment.
He gazed at me with increasing frankness.
I was like you once, he added, in love with turbulence.

Now I spoke as to an old friend:
What of you, I said, since he was free to leave,
have you no wish to go home,
to see the city again?

This is my home, he said.
The city--the city is where I disappear.





Dream
 

Close to the
door in
my dream the
small signs

I saw a brown
sign with wisdom
on it
I saw a brown
one leaning
with wisdom
on it

fringe of a mirror
my mother 
leaning over a pond
cupping water

leaning against
the moulding
cardboard or 
wood which materials do you

does your wisdom prefer

which a-
partment in a summer
with someone 
I felt brave to
have touched 
her love the screen
door and the dogs
and the cats always
getting out. That
was the fear
two signs
fading but recalling
they had faded like words
fade in stone because
of the rain and the days
and waking and the dream
is leaving with every
step leaning over the meat
because I do not want 
you to have died in vain
kissing the turkey and 
the neck of my dog
all animals am I. 
all dreams, all stone
all message am I.





Dream 2
 

the car had a cover over it
and it was over the wheels
and it hurt my ass and I 
couldn't sleep. It seems I should move, go forward now
I was wandering through the jungle
anywhere on earth but I was a woman
in bed in New York and how many 
people have died in wild places
dreaming you were still in bed
would you know. Travel well
I said to my dog when she
went on her journey thinking
of a cheap movie
I've thought this was an urn
turning this was on water
this was flat
but now I see light between
the trees I see water trickling
through stone this is not 
made of language but energy
that will stop when I die
the dream dies too
one bolt





Prophesy
 

I'm playing with the devil's cock
it's like a crayon
it's like a fat burnt crayon
I'm writing a poem with it
I'm writing that down
all that rattling heat in this room
I'm using that
I'm using that tingling rattle
that light in the middle of the room
it's my host
I've always been afraid of you
scared you're god and something else
I'm afraid when you're yellow
tawny
white it's okay. Transparent cool
you don't look like home
my belly is homeless
flopping over the waist of my jeans like an omelette
there better be something about feeling fat
what there really is is a lack of emptiness
I'm aiming for that empty feeling
going to get some of that
and then I'll be back





Together and by Ourselves
 

I opened the window so I could hear people.
Last night we were together and by ourselves.
You. You look and look at Diver 
for Crane by Johns and want to say something.
In the water you are a child without eyes. 
Yesterday there was nothing on the beach
and no one knows where it came from.
There's a small animal lodged somewhere inside us. 
There are minutes of peace.
Just the feel. Just this once. Where does the past,
where should the period go? 
What is under the earth followed them home. 
The branch broke. It broke by itself. It did break, James.
We were there and on silent. We were delete, shift, command.
Slow--in black--on an orange street sign. 
Missing everywhere and unwritten--suddenly--all at once.
Him. He misses a person and he is still living.
I haven't missed you for long and you are so gone.
Then he stepped away from the poem midsentence. . .
we must have been lonely people to say those things then.
But there are rooms for us now and sculptures to look at.
In the perfect field someone has left everything 
including themselves. You. You should stay here.
It's a brutal and beautiful autumn.
With his hands in the sand, on the earth, under time
he touched something else.
People are mostly what they can't keep and keeps them.
And inside the circular cage of the Ferris wheel you saw the world.
In the steam, on the mirror: you wrote so so so. . .
so if you're looking for answers you're looking 
at every water tower around here.
Why does the sea hold what it loves most below?
Fear. Hopeless money. All the news and the non-news.
How could anyone anywhere know us? What did we make?
And the leather of your chair. . .it has me marked
so good luck forgetting. The world was a home. 
It was cruel. It was true. It was not realistic.
Make sure you date and sign here then save all the soft things.
Because everyone wants to know when it was, 
how it happened--say something about it. 
How the night hail made imprints all over. 
Our things. Our charming and singular things.





Elegies
 

               amy winehouse 

All song is formal, and you
Maybe felt this and decided
You'd be formal too. (The eyeliner, the beehive: formal.)

When a desire to escape becomes formal,
It's dangerous. Then escape requires
Nullity, rather than a walk in the park or a movie.
Eventually, nullity gets harder and
Harder to achieve. After surgery, I had
Opiates. I pushed the button as often as I could.
Understood by music was how I felt. An escape
So complete it became a song. After that,
Elegy's the only necessary form.


               steve jobs 

Say you lost all your money, or turned against your ambition. 
Then you would be at peace, or 
Else why does the mind punish the body? 
Vengeance is mind, says the body.
Ever after, you're a mirror, "silver and exact.

Just like the bug in a string of code, the body defies the mind 
Or looks in the mirror of the mind and shudders. 
Better instruments are better because they're 
Silverish but intact.

Random, and definite. 
Obdurate the calendar.

Very good. Let's hunt for a pen.

Lingering over 
Unlovely bodies, 
Couldn't help 
Intuitively rendering 
A whole

Facts are

Dear daylight?


               donna summer 

Discourse that night concerned the warm-blooded love we felt. 
On the divan and in the ballroom and on the terrace, we felt it. 
Now virtue meant liking the look of the face we lay next to. 
Never mind the sting of the winter solstice.
All discourse that night concerned the warm-blooded love we felt.

Something lifted us higher. Her little finger told her so, 
Untangling, with careless skill, the flora of the sexual grove. 
Master physician with a masterly joy in wrapping up 
Mud-spattered, coke-dusted wounds at midnight, when it's too 
Early to stop dancing and go home. Our lily-minds soothed by her 
Royalty concealed in the synthesizers in the flora of the sexual grove.





Lines for People After the Party
 

And whenever they couldn't speak they looked at each other.
How long should I look at the world before I go home?
It's a moody life like Debussy on a weekend
and all the appointments and money and drinks they do go.
So with our beautiful coats we went back to that mess 
and what happened? Someone found what they wanted 
by night, by mistake. In the car it felt like summer 
and we lived with no sun. . .just metals and leather.
A lot of Mondays. A lot of you in the grass I go to and touch.
Oh and Los Angeles for its slow light. Rome for when it gets late.
You. Not you, but you who are reading. . .
what won't you ask for and want?
Of course I remember it differently because I was broke
and it feels like I'm broke still.
The cabs lined up but no one took him
where he wanted to go. Those months shared a face 
and the face of a dog on a street was the only thing 
that really saw you (for a long time).
Then I heard you were traveling, I heard you were somewhere,
I heard you were nowhere anyone looked for at all.
French stationery. Construction. Sent then deleted. Missed you 
so sorry next time press yes to continue press now.
And I stood on Barrow then Greenwich then Allen 
then all streets, every street, all the time, everyone.
There was a check you used just to drive out there.
There was a storm that brought a gold door in front of their shoes.
You know, it doesn't get easier with the lights on. 
It doesn't get easier to watch the play with an end.
On the way out someone said, what a terrible way to portray life.
But about us. Hide all week then some place 
we go empty the dark in. In the dark 
with our vices and best shirts and history's dress. 
Then you could find me anytime. And then there's right now. 
Where wouldn't we go to be no one and those people again?





Trying Fourleggedness
 

The boy and the girl were mostly gesture,
a clouded outline, the pencil lifting, lowering
to get at the idea of childhood, not the sour milk
and scraped knee of it. Her skirt was a swoop
of ink, his hand invisible in an undrawn pocket.
Circles make up the majority of the face. We are all circles
and planar suggestion. If the girl wants to be a horse
she need only walk into the outline of one
and line up her body with the chest. We'll fill in
the rest, and before you know it, she's a natural.
Who will ride her? The boy doesn't know how.
He has a hankering to sketch in a saddle.
When she tosses her head, he mocks up a bridle.
He mocks her. A bridle for a bride, he says,
which doesn't seem like what little boys say,
but he wasn't so little, and she didn't run away.





Halston
 

Roy Halston Frowick, 19321990
He kept his middle name, the pick of the lot, 
he thought, and mispronounced himself: Hall-stun. 

At Bergdorf's he acquired an accent and referred 
to himself in the third person, every bird he flayed 

wrapped in Ultrasuede. He lit a True with a True, 
smeared his hirsute muse with sequins. There were air- 

kisses, Capote's new-cut face at Studio 54, that Baccarat 
flute of ejaculate. Never too late, he ordered in 

meat and potatoes, and a trick. 
He called it "dial-a-steak, dial-a-dick. He appeared 

on The Love Boat, Halstonettes in tow, 
maybe the high, maybe the low, watermark. 

When his pupils betrayed him at work, on came the shades. 
And a well-cut blazer, paranoia. He had signed away 

the rights to his name, for options. When he tried 
to reclaim them from the conglomerate, 

he excused himself to the toilet, just a sec-- 
white dust on a black turtleneck. 

His block started to look a lot like sickness. 
Even his beloved orchids, the sickness. 

Just like that, the eighties were gone. 
New York, New York, the eighties were no one.





Tender
 

There was a time 
we had functional alignment. 
I was your individual 
contributor, you my associate 

director. On Monday 
I said Happy Monday, 
rolling my rimshot grin. 
Ring-fenced 

by cool molecules, 
like cattle, I battled biosimilars, 
sipped local gin; 
I tried my luck at affairs 

and trade fairs, 
optimistic as a fantasy 
suite. I inked the deal, 
the ink slick 

and permanent, 
like President 
Reagan. I didn't sleep 
unless I felt sick. 

Something was always gated 
on a fragile something. 
Everything 
on the critical path. 

The whiteboard, cruel 
as conceptual math, 
scope creep 
like a disease. 

Some of those days, 
our parent showed up, 
bespoke shoes bearing Leckerli. 
I felt like a starlet 

on a cruisy backlot, 
an outpost of opportunity. 
I took on a new role, 
went through the motions 

and the typing pool. 
But the bonus was no bonus, 
any more than the bay. 
Like tender, it started to fray. 

My admin booked a good 
weekend of atrocity. I winced. 
I slid the To-Hurt folder below 
a molecule's Package Insert. 

Then came the Efficiency 
Report, my resignation. 
I packed up the brood 
for Orlando, a last resort. 

I cut off my khaki pants 
at the knee, traded in the wife-- 
this is the Epcot Center of my life! 
I want to thank you in advance. 

I'd fallen out of favor, like a nation.





Like a Cloud above a Ravine
 

Like a cloud above a ravine is the hell you already know:
That sublime work of the imagination by Dante Alighieri. 

But the rain that falls from that cloud is not made up of human souls. 
It rains, and the rain funnels down into the something-other-than-human sewer.

Look how a Chinese writing brush ends in a cone of rigid horsehair. 
Loaded with ink, the cone will flex, will leave a wet trench in the rice paper.

It will leave an attractive trench, and the daylight sucked into the ink 
Will give it a reflective "shine dot--like looking into an animal's eye.

Which of you has looked into the looking-up eyes of a hair-trigger fox? 
A backyard fox or a campsite coyote: Daoist, unintelligible, brave . . .

Which of you knows how not to part the pebble on the beach from its colors? 
The songbird from its social network? the fruit from its multifaceted peel?

Oh, that sugary piece of phosphorus in its form-fitted velvet casing! 
That unappreciated Egyptian sarcophagus meant | to be opened from the inside.

And each seed-bearing fruit has an atmosphere. Each has its several moons,
Has tides (subject to gravity), changing weather, lunar eclipses . . .

But should an arrow suddenly snatch the waiting pomegranate out of your hand, 
If it snatches the cap off your head, recall: its circuit has only begun . . .

For the arrow of the luckless archer returns to the middle of his or her back. 
There, between athletic shoulder blades, is a diploma tube full of arrows.

Is a diploma tube full of arrows, and so | it is time for graduation. 
The genie's gone back to his bottle; the devils to their fallow hells.

And the Chinese writing brush, and the cloud above the ravine (wherein 
The charged particles have sorted themselves along their up-and-down axis),

And the looking-up eyes of the fox, and the sarcophagus, and the campsite
Are irreducible to a system, are each of them floating over a void.

Truly: "All hells and hierarchies are works of the imagination. And equally: 
"It is not the part of the Daoist sage to conjure meaningless hells.





Saul Bass Redesigns the First Man
 

I want to make beautiful things, even if nobody cares.
To make, you first have
            to create materials. Re: man, we know
the rib removed. But, before--? 
            Forget ash to ash, dust
                        &c.

                        Stick a floating rib (i.e. thoracic
1112, y'know--"Edenic) in a glass 
            of water with the promise
                        it'll grow
            roots like leek or fur

                        like chia. The joke's Crusoe 
            astride the bone or Jim & Huck paddling
rustic as a ballpoint pen will go. 
            --Nn-o.
                       (That's not a plank 
                                              in your peeper!) --

           It's a hollow; cue: running

faucet, a Pabst-crack opening
                      into seraphic 
           choir. (Risk Handel's?
   A perfect major? root, third, & fifth?) With aesthetics, 
                      like a bad comb-

                                            over, you don't
           need a mirror to know what you are
   missing. Now that you have this
                                  thing, you've got to

   feed, roof, & rock-

                      a-bye baby. You're the big boss, head honch-

    o, but watch out, foreman, Little Evie 
                       & Adam were the first 
organized union. (1-2-3-4...don't give us pain in labor!)

                       So what'll you give him in return?

    Latin and genus?
                       Genius? 
                                             . . . Medicinal plants? 

                       (I call this "Vladimir 
                                  Nabo-cough, man.)

Or do we let him take for him-
            self by fount, 
fin, & medium--language. Though from this,
                       we know 
            creation is only

myth; destruction, narrative.





Reading Ovid at the Plastic Surgeons
 

I scarcely dared to lookto see what it was I was.
No one else with a book, the slick 
weeklies gossip amongst 

themselves on the side 
tables as the ticker rolls the Dow 

Jones down down down under 
a profile of the marathon

bombers (the older, a boxer). Jove
argues for the removal of a race 

of peoples that do not please 
him: What is past

remedy calls for the surgeon's
knife. They will take a hunk of my

cheek (cancer) & though I can't
see during the procedure, I imagine

the site as an apricot, bitten. 
This is a survival mechanism--

romanticism. David says,
If you're out

in public & you don't want anyone
to talk to you, bring a book 

of poetry. Even as I enter the confidence
of the room, I avoid my reflection

in the window, for there, most 
of all, I see myself as only I can,

as only the eye will have me--
as light, as light alone.





Nature Boy
 

If I had enough cages to keep all the birds 
I've collected over the years then I would have 
to open a shop because there's only so much room 
in a two-bedroom walk-up for 48 birds, 
not to mention the dancing bears and the frogs, 
or the different varieties of fish, the one 
species of flea, and I almost forgot the proud 
dogs and the lone mule, the profane one 
who entered my life to curse at scribes and pharisees; 
and maybe he'd let the mouse I found 
forever dying at the end of a poem
ride on his back like a whiskered Christ 
and if not, maybe my yeti could do it 
when he's not downtown working 
security at the store or teaching the parrots 
how to say brotherhood in grunt 
and how to comb out the tangles and mud 
from his hair whose sweat reminds me 
of that bearded collector of beasts 
with the ark who would have no doubt 
understood how I feel, that prophet 
of change under whose spell I want to confess 
that I'm a Christian of the Old Testament, 
that my grandfather hung all his goats 
upside down, their throats over a bucket, 
and slapped their chests like that other Nature Boy 
who strutted around the ring 
like a peacock with his feathered hair 
that stayed immaculate 
even on the nights he lost to our hero 
Wahoo McDaniel who never played the heel, 
he who hailed from the lost tribes 
of Oklahoma, who made us want to be chiefs 
so much we wore pigeon feathers 
and circled each other inside a green square 
of water hose until someone finally rang the bell 
that was never there and we sprung 
toward each other like animals in love or at war.





Love Train
 

For D'Andra
My bowl brimming with pretzels, 
the snack you wanted least, 
I slid open the door of our sleeping car 
where we had been enjoying the country rushing by, 
as if we were the first two people 
to look down into the valleys and see 
bright necks of pines stretch across farms 
and streams to the groves they once cradled. 
You had asked for Earl Grey cookies 
sandwiched around buttercream or marshmallows 
made of chocolate, but all the tea bags had been dunked 
and the chocolate melted over biscotti. 
When I came bearing the salted and twisted news, 
the room was empty but for a heel. It was black 
as a bunting, and wound with zippers, 
and every time the car rocked 
it looked ready to fly and escape 
into the cold, tangled air 
of travel that always feels heavy 
with joy and desire, and a little sadness, 
always a little sadness, 
because of the leaving, which is what I do 
when I realize I'm in the wrong room 
and that numbers have betrayed me again 
while I was hunting and gathering, 
foraging like Homo habilis 
who probably never lost his cave. 

Out of patience, I opened every door 
marked with threes and eights, those conjoined twins 
disastrously separated at birth, 
and roused the scabbed eyes of sleepers 
like a beggar, no, an angel, 
a begging angel who has written on his heart 
will work for love. 
Having not found our room, not heard 
the sharp swing of your voice, 
I descended upon the passenger cars 
and row upon row of couples asleep 
or staring out the windows like zombies 
trying to remember what happens next 
once the newspaper is well-thumbed, 
the tea has gone cold, and the conversation is dead. 

I called for you, in vain, even using your secret names, 
the ones only the night knows: 
wind-kiss, brilliant-fruit, dervish-moon. . . 
Over and over, I said your names, 
over and over until they filled 
the wounded air of the car 
and when there was no more room 
for another sound, they caught and hooked 
the ring of the brakes hugging the rails. 

Just when I thought I wouldn't find you, 
you were there, the train was pulling away, 
and I was watching you slowly eat 
a dish of whipped cream and bananas
--the house special--in a cafe 
in a city we didn't know. 
When you finished, we started walking 
down a road that bent like a smile, 
a shy smile, like the one the Japanese cat wore 
on your purse. The road, we were told, 
would take us to the end of the line 
where all lovers in search of joy 
packed on bullet trains--they're the fastest 
on two continents--arrive every hour.





Goosestep
 

A collector of walks, I was practicing my llamastep 
when one of those white geese with the knob 
of cheddar on its bill honked at the goslings 
ignoring the art of the rank and file so adored 
by Mussolini and other assorted lunatics 
who I have trouble believing could ever raise one leg 
parallel to the earth they scorched without falling 
prey to gravity that was given a special kind of dominion 
over the fascist paunch, a shabby thing 
I have never seen hang around the waist of a goose, 
though who can say for sure under all that heavenly 
down where the hips of a goose begin and end; and even 
if tomorrow some budding scholar published a treatise 
titled The Mystery of Goose Hips to fanfare, 
it would be an exaggeration of the grossest kind 
to equate a goose's trumpet with the barking 
from the balcony by the sad bullies whose love 
of the locked leg I will never understand 
since the knee was so obviously made to flex, 
which means locking one is most likely a kind of sin 
against Darwin or God, both of whom I think 
would disapprove of anything so unnatural 
as even twenty people moving in stiff unison 
to music unless the brass and strings 
were just about to sway and bend to the hot 
version of "When the Saints Go Marching In.





Stanza
 

Because in medieval Italian it meant "room 
I tied the curtains at their elbows with 
what could have been honor cords or worse 
yet, a belt from the 60s, so hideous were the 
tassels that were dancing a little tarantella 
after I had propped the windows and the wind 
had carried in the song the rubbing trees 
were making, without any accompaniment, 
mind you, from a tambourine, although the bells 
of the occasional sleigh played that part, 
while I waited for the vixen and their shameless 
yelping to follow the music and the cold 
and the night inside where I sat half man, 
half snow, to investigate my squeaking 
pencil and the flapping of the bird-white page 
I couldn't seem to catch in those years when I 
lugged around a frozen heart and was infatuated 
with whiteness, since I had read somewhere it was 
the absence of color, which could not be true 
since I had once loved a pure white duck with 
a white bill and feet and I had even torn its white 
flesh with my teeth that were still then white, 
which should have been all the proof anyone needed 
to debunk our outdated theories of absence.





Where We Live
 

For John Guare
I used to live 
in a mother now I live
in a sunflower

Blinded by the silverware

Blinded by the refrigerator

I sit on a sidewalk 
in the sunflower and its yellow 
downpour

The light of the world
beads up on one perfect 
green leaf

It scribbles its name on every living thing then erases it so what's left is more of a whisper than a mother

Here it's spring 

Over and over and over again 





I used to live
in a cloud now I live
in a crow

It's tiny and crippled in there but I can find my way to the bathroom in the dark if I need to

All the windows 
in the crow are left open 
and let the clouds in

Back in

They float past my bed and have nothing to say

Hello it's nice to meet you!

From a telephone pole 
tongues slide out singing 
welcome home 

Welcome home they sing





I used to live 
in a tree now I live
in a king

He waves his arms in front of him and endless migrations of birds disappear into his coat

I like to sit up inside 
his crown eating sandwiches 
and watching tv

Hills shake in the distance when he shuffles his feet
Floods when he snaps his fingers

I bow inside his brow and the afternoon stretches out
Orders more sandwiches

And sells the slaves

and sets the slaves free

and sells the slaves





Red Migraine
 

The redbreast kills
and kills itself against
the window

Sooner or later the blood in the breast will break the window into hundreds of pieces you can swallow whole

Keep swallowing

The redbreast
loves you and wants you
to remember the love

So it makes you puke into the toilet blind

I was blinded by love

And drowned 
in an empty bathtub
spitting up birdshit

Covered in red feathers





Sometimes the redbreast likes anting with lit cigarettes safety pins paper cuts God that feels good

It wraps everything 
in pretty pink gauze the color
of fake sunset 

Look it is a pink soul!

It wants to get naked and it wants it to hurt

Red teeth red toes
Open mouths

Who keeps pressing
my head into the sidewalk
inside the bathroom

Who keeps the lights on the lights stay on

Who dissolves on my tongue

Who flies from my finger





The redbreast sits inside
behind your left eye
behind your right and cleans
its babies with 
its beak

Scrubs its babies clean

Shakes its tail feathers to scour the floor behind your forehead and scours the floor red

My brain is a cutter

My initials are beats per second 

Scrubbed down to zero
by the rubies
in the halo

I whispered your name into the red air 

and you answered





Government Spending
 

The government spent a Patricia on me,
"a huge waste, it lamented, "when we could
have been spending it on another Nixon,

the government spent all its beauty
on the great light leap on the deer-
crossing sign -- there was hardly any
beauty left for anything else in America,
and looking around them the government
said,
           "Is there none left? Print more,

you are born, you barely contain yourself,
you grow, inside you, someone spends
a billion to make prison more luxurious;
inside you, someone spends a billion
to keep libraries open one hour later;
then oh god, you feel wonderful,
                         you must be on welfare,

the government spent its whole education
on me, at least that is how it feels right now,
I am bursting with educational dollars,
I am bursting with other dollars as well,
I'm rounded up, I'm one long row of ohs,
I get so many commas
                     that the sentence doesn't stop,

the dollars in me are a map of Missouri
my mother can't fold back up, oh no the map
is everywhere, but I know the way, I am hot
on a trail, I am bursting with the dollars
that put that knowing breath in drug dogs,

all the spending of the space program is in me,
the stars seem especially close, this is because
they are a government handout, they are spending
millions on moonlight research, when I am President

I will cut the arts and let my right arm flow downhill,
I am ready, there is nothing trivial about me left,
I am eliminating the penny every second,

a dollar is peeled off a roll of thousands,
it is the day, the mint of it is in my mouth,
I open it, completely fresh.





The Hypno-Domme Speaks, and Speaks and Speaks
 

I was born as a woman, I talk you to death,
                                                   or else your ear off,
or else you to sleep. What do I have, all the time
in the world, and a voice that swings brass back
and forth, you can hear it, and a focal point where
my face should be. What do I have, I have absolute
power, and what I want is your money, your drool,
and your mind, and the sense of myself as a snake,
and a garter in the grass. Every bone in the snake
is the hipbone, every part of the snake is the hips.
The first sound I make is silence, then sssssshhh,
          the first word I say is listen. Sheep shearers
                      and accountants hypnotize the hardest,
and lookout sailors who watch the sea, and the boys
who cut and cut and cut and cut and cut the grass.
The writers who write page-turners, and the writers
who repeat themselves. The diamond-cutter kneels
down before me and asks me to hypnotize him, and
I glisten at him and glisten hard, and listen to me and
listen, I tell him. Count your age backward, I tell him.
Become aware of your breathing, and aware of mine
                         which will go on longer. Believe you
           are a baby till I tell you otherwise, then believe
you're a man till I tell you you're dirt. When a gunshot
rings out you'll lie down like you're dead. When you
          hear, "He is breathing, you'll stand up again.
The best dog of the language is Yes and protects you.
The best black-and-white dog of the language is Yes
and goes wherever you go, and you go where I say,
you go anywhere. Why do I do it is easy, I am working
my way through school. Give me the money
                           for Modernism, and give me the money
for what comes next. When you wake to the fact that you
have a body, you will wake to the fact that not for long.
When you wake you will come when you read the word
hard, or hard to understand me, or impenetrable poetry.
When you put down the book you will come when you
hear the words put down the book,
                                              you will come when you hear.





Kronos: Father of the Year
 

my mouth a cunt in reverse and my guts, nuts. 
I nose the dark nursery, belly for my dick spurting ink at shit. 

Fire. Arrow. 
Water. Shadow. 
you know no kid's name a word, but some shit-to-do. 
no kid ain't shit but a map to its folk 
traced by its folk to where they buried their folk. 

took that shit that made me to make me make myself myself, 
rolled in on papa's red nuts like they a fucking chariot. 





these days my guts stay aching. my head an empty crib. 

I sit to my work on me to work on. life is its own hunger for itself.
I want only one to feed.

without meaning to

each step
jarring my frame

Noah / Ham: Fathers of the Year
 







Alphabet's End
 

So I'll speak ill of the dead. A was crooked,
planting the small left finger of the raccoon in the upholstery
before he sold the car. B made certain to point out Celia's
bewildered look before her pink slip came in the flimsy institution.
In the videos of C, a jejune overwhelmed the cast.

D built dollhouses. Even Lonnie down at Shell
found him less a man for it, the night they went off to see the stock
cars break. I wanted E's hair, but by the end it was no more. F
refused alms, pulling the man up by his shirt in the street, and
G sought rewards. Marybeth said H fondled her for sport.

Now you, I, Smokey, hell
bent on a village version of Club 21, embarrassed by our attentions.
Mistrust it was. Dig me a chamber of preparedness.

The Troubadours Etc.
 

Just for this evening, let's not mock them. 
Not their curtsies or cross-garters 
or ever-recurring pepper trees in their gardens 
promising, promising.

At least they had ideas about love.

All day we've driven past cornfields, past cows poking their heads
through metal contraptions to eat.
We've followed West 84, and what else?
Irrigation sprinklers fly past us, huge wooden spools in the fields,
lounging sheep, telephone wires,
yellowing flowering shrubs.

Before us, above us, the clouds swell, layers of them,
the violet underneath of clouds.
Every idea I have is nostalgia. Look up:
there is the sky that passenger pigeons darkened and filled--
darkened for days, eclipsing sun, eclipsing all other sound
with the thunder of their wings.
After a while, it must have seemed that they followed
not instinct or pattern but only
one another.

When they stopped, Audubon observed,
they broke the limbs of stout trees by the weight of the numbers.

And when we stop we'll follow--what? 
Our hearts?

The Puritans thought that we are granted the ability to love 
only through miracle,
but the troubadours knew how to burn themselves through, 
how to make themselves shrines to their own longing. 
The spectacular was never behind them.

Think of days of those scarlet-breasted, blue-winged birds above you.
Think of me in the garden, humming
quietly to myself in my blue dress,
a blue darker than the sky above us, a blue dark enough for storms,
though cloudless.

At what point is something gone completely? 
The last of the sunlight is disappearing 
even as it swells--

Just for this evening, won't you put me before you 
until I'm far enough away you can 
believe in me?

Then try, try to come closer-- 
my wonderful and less than.





Touch Gallery: Joan of Arc
 

The sculptures in this gallery have been                        
carefully treated with a protective wax                           
so that visitors may touch them.

of chicago

Stone soldier, it's okay now.
I've removed my rings, my watch, my bracelets.

I'm allowed, brave girl,
to touch you here, where the mail covers your throat,
your full neck, down your shoulders
to here, where raised unlatchable buckles
mock-fasten your plated armor.

Nothing peels from you.

Your skin gleams like the silver earrings 
you do not wear.

Above you, museum windows gleam October. 
Above you, high gold leaves flinch in the garden,

but the flat immovable leaves entwined in your hair to crown you
go through what my fingers can't.
I want you to have a mind I can turn in my hands.

You have a smooth and upturned chin, 
cold cheeks, unbruisable eyes, 
and hair as grooved as fig skin.

It's October, but it's not October 
behind your ears, which don't hint 
of dark birds moving overhead, 
or of the blush and canary leaves

emptying themselves
in slow spasms
into shallow hedgerows.

Still bride of your own armor, 
bride of your own blind eyes, 
this isn't an appeal.

If I could I would let your hair down 
and make your ears disappear.

Your head at my shoulder, my fingers on your lips--

as if the cool of your stone curls were the cool
               of an evening-- 
as if you were about to eat salt from my hand.





To You Again
 

Again this morning my eyes woke up too close 
to your eyes,

their almost green orbs
too heavy-lidded to really look back.

To wake up next to you
is ordinary. I do not even need to look at you

to see you.
But I do look. So when you come to me

in your opulent sadness, I see 
you do not want me

to unbutton you
so I cannot do the one thing

I can do.
Now it is almost one a.m. I am still at my desk

and you are upstairs at your desk a staircase 
away from me. Already it is years

of you a staircase
away from me. To be near you

and not near you 
is ordinary.

You
are ordinary.

Still, how many afternoons have I spent 
peeling blue paint from

our porch steps, peering above 
hedgerows, the few parked cars for the first

glimpse of you. How many hours under 
the overgrown, pink Camillas, thinking

the color was wrong for you, thinking 
you'd appear

after my next 
blink.

Soon you'll come down the stairs 
to tell me something. And I'll say,

okay. Okay. I'll say it 
like that, say it just like

that, I'll go on being 
your never-enough.

It's not the best in you
I long for. It's when you're noteless,

numb at the ends of my fingers, all is 
all. I say it is.





Night Shifts at the Group Home
 

for Lily Mae
The job was easy: I tucked
them in, kicked off my shoes, listened for
the floor to go quiet. Everyone

slept except one: outside her door, 
she paced, she hummed, holding 
the edge of her torn

nightgown. Pointing, I told
her: to bed. Your bed. But she would not
stay there. She was old,

older than my mother: manic, caught 
up in gibberish, determined to 
sleep on my cot--

At first it was just to
quiet her. I could only sleep
if she slept, and I needed relief

from myself. That is how she 
became a body next to mine 
whether or not I wanted there to be

a body. She climbed
into my bed. I let her
sleep hot and damp against my spine.

All night she rocked, she turned, 
she poked her spastic elbows 
into my calves and slurred

her broken noises in the dark. All the old
fans went round in clicks
those summer nights--and she rolled

in bed and kicked
me in the head and I was
happy. No words, no tricks,

I just didn't love
my loneliness. My mind
felt cooler

with her there. Beside
her, I could have been anyone.
She had no word for me and not the kind

of mind to keep one. 
And if she kicked 
me, some nights, just

for the fun of it--who was I 
to disappoint my one? 
Sometimes I imagine I

was someone she won
at a fair as the wheel spun
under the floating, unfaltering sun

and clicked each lucky one
and one
until I was happily undone.





Happy Ideas
 

I had the happy idea to fasten a bicycle wheel 
to a kitchen stool and watch it turn.                   

--duchamp

I had the happy idea to suspend some blue globes in the air

and watch them pop.

I had the happy idea to put my little copper horse on the shelf so we could stare at each other 
all evening.

I had the happy idea to create a void in myself.

Then to call it natural.

Then to call it supernatural.

I had the happy idea to wrap a blue scarf around my head and spin.

I had the happy idea that somewhere a child was being born who was nothing like Helen or 
Jesus except in the sense of changing everything.

I had the happy idea that someday I would find both pleasure and punishment, that I would 
know them and feel them,

and that, until I did, it would be almost as good to pretend.

I had the happy idea to call myself happy.

I had the happy idea that the dog digging a hole in the yard in the twilight had his nose deep in 
mold-life.

I had the happy idea that what I do not understand is more real than what I do,

and then the happier idea to buckle myself

into two blue velvet shoes.

I had the happy idea to polish the reflecting glass and say 

hello to my own blue soul. Hello, blue soul. Hello. 

It was my happiest idea.





Knocking or Nothing
 

Knock me or nothing, the things of this world 
ring in me, shrill-gorged and shrewish,

clicking their charms and their chains and their spouts. 
Let them. Let the fans whirr.

All the similar virgins must have emptied 
their flimsy pockets, and I

was empty enough,
sugared and stretched on the unmown lawn,

dumb as the frost-pink tongues 
of the unpruned roses.

When you put your arms around me in that moment, 
when you pulled me to you and leaned

back, when you lifted me
just a few inches, when you shook me

hard then, had you ever heard 
such emptiness?

I had room for every girl's locket, 
every last dime and pocketknife.

Oh my out-sung, fierce, unthinkable--
why rattle only the world

you placed in me? Won't you clutter the unkissed, 
idiot stars? They blink and blink

like quiet shepherds,
like brides-about-your-neck.

Call them out of that quietness.
Knock them in their nothing, against their empty enamel,

against the dark that has no way to hold them 
and no appetite.

Call in the dead to touch them.
Let them slip on their own chinks of light.





The Year of What Now
 

I ask your doctor
of infectious disease if she's
read Williams   he cured
sick babies I tell her and
begin describing spring
and all   she's looking at the wall
now the floor   now your chart
now the door   never
heard of him she says
but I can't stop explaining
how important this is
I need to know your doctor
believes in the tenacity of nature
to endure   I'm past his heart
attack   his strokes   and now as if
etching the tombstone myself   I find
I can't remember the date
he died or even
the year   of what now
are we the pure products   and what
does that even mean   pure   isn't it
obvious   we are each our own culture
alive with the virus that's waiting
to unmake us





Awash
 

the unthinkable prospect 
of a world in which I am left 
to my own devices

which are few and as soon 
as the batteries die useless 
first order of business

I draw a map in the sand
mark where I stand as the capital
of civilization   within me the
detailed blueprints of the pyramids
and the concept of zero
beyond me the finite frontier

the many miles of undeveloped 
shoreline with spectacular views of a 
sea filled with intricately depicted 
monsters   I have a lot to do before

I introduce the new world 
to art and astronomy and industry 
medicine and technology 
ethics politics democracy

by a show of hands we shall elect 
which tree to burn in the first fire





Everything Every Time
 

in a different version of this I'm the one
sitting up in bed while the nurse says
deep breaths   listens to my lungs through
the cold antenna of her stethoscope   you're the one
sitting in a chair in the corner
with a half hearted smile plastered to your face

in a different version of this
we're both in bed   hunched over
while two nurses   sisters actually   listen
to our lungs   your husband and my wife
sit in the corners of the room
both of them completely useless

in a different version of this I'm in a chair
in the corner while my sister sits up
in bed   you're the nurse who listens
to my sister breathing   you glance at me for
an instant and return my uncertain smile

in a different version of this I sit up 
abruptly in bed   I'm breathing deeply   you 
put your hand on my back and say 
go back to sleep   you're fine   everything is fine





from Laon and Cythna; or The Revolution of the Golden City
 

                       To Mary -- --
                                          1.


  So now my summer task is ended, Mary,
       And I return to thee, mine own heart's home; 
   As to his Queen some victor Knight of Fary,
       Earning bright spoils for her inchanted dome;
       Nor thou disdain, that ere my fame become 
   A star among the stars of mortal night,
       If it indeed may cleave its natal gloom, 
   Its doubtful promise thus I would unite 
With thy beloved name, thou Child of love and light.


                                         2.


   The toil which stole from thee so many an hour 
       Is ended,--and the fruit is at thy feet!
   No longer where the woods to frame a bower 
       With interlaced branches mix and meet, 
       Or where with sound like many voices sweet,
   Water-falls leap among wild islands green,
       Which framed for my lone boat a lone retreat
   Of moss-grown trees and weeds, shall I be seen: 
But beside thee, where still my heart has ever been.


                                         3.


   Thoughts of great deeds were mine, dear Friend, when first 
       The clouds which wrap this world from youth did pass.
   I do remember well the hour which burst 
       My spirit's sleep: a fresh May-dawn it was, 
       When I walked forth upon the glittering grass,
   And wept, I knew not why; until there rose 
       From the near school-room, voices, that, alas!
   Were but one echo from a world of woes-- 
The harsh and grating strife of tyrants and of foes.


                                         4.


   And then I clasped my hands and looked around--
       --But none was near to mock my streaming eyes, 
   Which poured their warm drops on the sunny ground--
       So without shame, I spake:--"I will be wise,
       And just, and free, and mild, if in me lies 
   Such power, for I grow weary to behold
       The selfish and the strong still tyrannise 
   Without reproach or check." I then controuled 
My tears, my heart grew calm, and I was meek and bold.


                                         5.


   And from that hour did I with earnest thought
       Heap knowledge from forbidden mines of lore, 
   Yet nothing that my tyrants knew or taught
       I cared to learn, but from that secret store
       Wrought linked armour for my soul, before 
   It might walk forth to war among mankind;
       Thus power and hope were strengthened more and more
   Within me, till there came upon my mind
A sense of loneliness, a thirst with which I pined.


                                         6.


   Alas, that love should be a blight and snare
       To those who seek all sympathies in one!-- 
   Such once I sought in vain; then black despair,
       The shadow of a starless night, was thrown
       Over the world in which I moved alone:--
   Yet never found I one not false to me,
       Hard hearts, and cold, like weights of icy stone 
   Which crushed and withered mine, that could not be 
Aught but a lifeless clog, until revived by thee.


                                         7.


   Thou Friend, whose presence on my wintry heart 
       Fell, like bright Spring upon some herbless plain;
   How beautiful and calm and free thou wert 
       In thy young wisdom, when the mortal chain 
       Of Custom thou didst burst and rend in twain,
   And walked as free as light the clouds among,
       Which many an envious slave then breathed in vain
   From his dim dungeon, and my spirit sprung 
To meet thee from the woes which had begirt it long.


                                         8.


   No more alone through the world's wilderness, 
       Although I trod the paths of high intent,
   I journeyed now: no more companionless, 
       Where solitude is like despair, I went.-- 
       There is the wisdom of a stern content
   When Poverty can blight the just and good, 
       When Infamy dares mock the innocent,
   And cherished friends turn with the multitude 
To trample: this was ours, and we unshaken stood!


                                         9.


   Now has descended a serener hour,
       And with inconstant fortune, friends return;
   Though suffering leaves the knowledge and the power
       Which says:--Let scorn be not repaid with scorn.
       And from thy side two gentle babes are born 
   To fill our home with smiles, and thus are we
      Most fortunate beneath life's beaming morn;
   And these delights, and thou, have been to me
The parents of the Song I consecrate to thee.


                                         10.


   Is it, that now my inexperienced fingers
       But strike the prelude of a loftier strain? 
   Or, must the lyre on which my spirit lingers
       Soon pause in silence, ne'er to sound again,
       Though it might shake the Anarch Custom's reign, 
   And charm the minds of men to Truth's own sway
       Holier than was Amphion's? I would fain
   Reply in hope--but I am worn away, 
And Death and Love are yet contending for their prey.


                                         11.


   And what art thou? I know, but dare not speak: 
       Time may interpret to his silent years.
   Yet in the paleness of thy thoughtful cheek, 
       And in the light thine ample forehead wears, 
       And in thy sweetest smiles, and in thy tears,
  And in thy gentle speech, a prophecy
       Is whispered, to subdue my fondest fears:
   And through thine eyes, even in thy soul I see 
A lamp of vestal fire burning internally.


                                         12.


   They say that thou wert lovely from thy birth, 
       Of glorious parents, thou aspiring Child.
   I wonder not--for One then left this earth
       Whose life was like a setting planet mild 
       Which clothed thee in the radiance undefiled
   Of its departing glory; still her fame
       Shines on thee, through the tempests dark and wild
   Which shake these latter days; and thou canst claim 
The shelter, from thy Sire, of an immortal name.


                                         13.


   One voice came forth from many a mighty spirit, 
       Which was the echo of three thousand years;
   And the tumultuous world stood mute to hear it, 
       As some lone man who in a desart hears 
       The music of his home:--unwonted fears
   Fell on the pale oppressors of our race,
       And Faith, and Custom, and low-thoughted cares,
   Like thunder-stricken dragons, for a space 
Left the torn human heart, their food and dwelling-place.


                                         14.


   Truth's deathless voice pauses among mankind!
       If there must be no response to my cry-- 
   If men must rise and stamp with fury blind
       On his pure name who loves them,--thou and I,
       Sweet Friend! can look from our tranquillity
   Like lamps into the world's tempestuous night,--
       Two tranquil stars, while clouds are passing by
   Which wrap them from the foundering seaman's sight,
That burn from year to year with unextinguished light.





The Promise
 

Stay, I said 
to the cut flowers.
They bowed 
their heads lower.

Stay, I said to the spider, 
who fled.

Stay, leaf.
It reddened,
embarrassed for me and itself.

Stay, I said to my body. 
It sat as a dog does, 
obedient for a moment, 
soon starting to tremble.

Stay, to the earth
of riverine valley meadows,
of fossiled escarpments,
of limestone and sandstone.
It looked back
with a changing expression, in silence.

Stay, I said to my loves. 
Each answered,
Always.





The People on the Bus
 

We have had our lives.
The reservoir visible
In the window beside our elbows, and the willow
Branches trailing at our stop
Are the nature we leave
Behind us gladly, since it has no place

For all we have recently learned: that sex
Is temporary, help
Ours to hand down now, and materials science
Not the only kind. We thank
Calm, careful Minerva, goddess
Of adults, who for so many years took us

To school: her voice the timbre of fretless bass, 
Her eyes the color of pencil lead, she taught 
Us how to behave in order to have our rewards 
In twenty years. We have them, and if we wish 
Too often, this fall, to have led another life 
We do not mean that we would give up ours:

Though we stand in a row and sway 
Before an obstructed view, we are able to find 
Initials outlined in the crosshatched trees, 
And pebbles--calculi--around our ponds 
And cherish them; we like to watch the roads 
Along which the perennial pollen sifts down

As finely as ever, making a soft powder
Of brass amid the troughs in softball fields.
Our skills are finally in demand.
If you mock us, Pan,
In whom we also believe, do it
As gently as you can.





Bad Newz
 

(Alec Soth: "Kenny and Bill--Bad Newz,                         Grand Rapids, Minnesota")
They tilt their guitars and stare. 
Each boy puts one foot toward 
Us, one where a trailing wire 
Would run to an amplifier 
If amplifiers were there. 
Bill's Gibson glitters like ore. 
Kenny's Ibaez hoards

White noise in its black fretboard.
Bill's double chin shows. Is it fair
To mention his pudge? Kenny's hair
Gets stuck behind one ear.
Each of the brothers wears
A T-shirt, loose jeans, and a pair
Of bruised high-tops. A pear-

Shaped garbage bag hugs a steel bar. 
The big rectangular blur 
Behind them looks like the door 
To a walk-in refrigerator. 
Maybe dad is a restaurateur, 
A diner owner who requires 
Kenny to spend six hours

A week moving cases of beer, 
While Bill chops potatoes, or scours 
Grease from the checkerboard floor. 
Bill imagines a national tour: 
CBGB's. The Black Cat. Hardcore. 
Or metal: the glow and allure 
Of arenas and open-air

Pyrotechnics at dusk, a chauffeur.
Or do they hope modestly for
Sideman jobs, L.A. 'burbs, the secure
Work of studio engineers?
Two boys hold two guitars
In a basement kitchen, and care
What you think of them. Next year

They promise to practice more. 
Right now their repertoire 
Is six songs, seven chords, 
Five originals, and a spare 
Reworking of REM's four-
Minute anthem about a lost car: 
"Can't Get There from Here."





In Memory of the Rock Band Breaking Circus
 

You were whiny and socially unacceptable even 
to loud young men whose first criterion 
for rock and roll was that it strike someone else 
as awful and repulsive and you told 
grim stories about such obscure affairs 
as a man-killing Zamboni and a grudge-
laden marathon runner from Zanzibar

who knifed a man after finishing sixteenth

Each tale sped from you at such anxious rate
sarcastic showtunes abject similes
feel like a piece of burnt black toast
for example threaded on a rusty wire followed
up by spitting too much time to think
by fusillades from rivetguns by cold
and awkward bronze reverberant church bells

percussive monotones 4/4 all for

the five or six consumers who enjoyed
both the impatience of youth
and the pissiness of middle age
as if you knew you had to get across
your warnings against all our lives as fast
as practicable before roommate or friend
could get up from a couch to turn them off

We barely remember you in Minnesota we love

our affable Replacements who modeled a more
acceptable form of rage who thought of girls
and cities boys and beds and homes and cars
as flawed but fixable with the right drink 
right mates and right guitar strings whereas you 
did not and nothing in your songs resolved 
except in a certain technical sense as a drill

resolves contests between drywall and screw

Your second bassist took the stage name Flour 
your second drummer copied a machine 
Somebody else in your hometown took credit 
for every sound you taught them how to use 
I write about you now since nobody else 
is likely to and since even appalled 
too-serious flat compliments like these

are better than nothing and because to annoy

perseverate and get under everyone's skin
beats the hell out of the real worst thing in the world
which is to fade into silence entirely which
will never happen to The Ice Machine
to "Driving the Dynamite Truck" to The Very Long Fuse
to Smoker's Paradise such hard sticks thrown
in the eyes of any audience that is

I should say not until it happens to me





Butterfly with Parachute
 

A real one wouldn't need one,
but the one Nathan draws surely does:
four oblongs the size and color of popsicles,
green apple, toasted coconut and grape,
flanked, two per side, by billowing valentine hearts,
in a frame of Scotch tape.
Alive, it could stay off the floor,
for a few unaerodynamic minutes;
thrown as a paper airplane, for one or two more.

Very sensibly, therefore,
our son gave it something, not to keep it apart
from the ground forever, but rather to make safe its descent.
When we ask that imagination discover the limits
of the real
world only slowly,
maybe this is what we meant.





I Want to be Stark[like]
 

Game of Thrones
A man is only worth what people say he is
and those Starks are good stock. They'll knee-deep it.
They famish the craving they are fathered by.
Manning the forestry of life, they are steadfast and sturdy.

When pungent or cruel, they sauce the ache.
Light folds them in two. 
What I want to say is, I would meet you upon this.

Let me, too, carry the token of the world. 
Tell me the secret of what comes next,
and then take me

& I trudged over the broken branches 
             fidgeting through snow 

              like hungry fingers through 
              an empty pocket. 

Over the termite-hollowed stump 
as squat as a flat tire. 

              Over the hollow 
             the fox dives into 
when we open the back door at night. 

That was the week of snow
              & it glittered like every 
              Christmas card we could 
              remember while my daughter 

poked around for the best place 
to stand a snowman. One 

with a pinecone nose. 
              One with thumb-pressed 

             eyes to see the whole 
picture once things warm up.

This sunlight on snow. 

This decrescendo
of covered stumps & brush--
stop for it. 

Stop before the sled end-
              over-ends down 
              the chin of the hill--

the way it always will 
at the rock  of the way down. 

Stop & shiver in it: the ring 
              of snow inside gloves, 
              the cusp of red forehead 

like a sun just waiting to top 
the hill. Every ill-built 

              snowball waiting to be thrown, 
              every bell-shaped angel 

stamped over the brown leaves. 
When my daughter ranges 
              in winter, she works 

every dazzling angle--
              the crestfallen pinecones, 

             the grizzled beards 
of bushes in the morning, 

a furnace's windup huffing
              in this throat-
              clearing of snow.





Khaleesi Says
 

Game of Thrones
In this story, she is fire-born:
knee-deep in the shuddering world.

In this story, she knows no fear,
for what is fractured is a near-bitten star,
a false-bearing tree,
or a dishonest wind.

In this story, fear is a house gone dry.
Fear is not being a woman. 

I'm no ordinary woman, she says.
My dreams come true.

And she says and she is 
and I say, yes, give me that.





Follow
 

Game of Thrones
Follow where all is./Follow the transfused./Follow what is still and what is still-attracting.

That light/That beauty/That love/That, that is massy-borne and rising up, like a drifting star.

Like stars lift./Like lifting stars./Like the lifting of stars, I rose. I rise. 

Rose. Rose. Like a thing beyond words: satiated.

Let lie in the ravage./Let lie in what is ravaged-wrought.

Why fear what hasn't become?

I beckon, like light./Like a star, I will beckon./You will oblige./You will lend the want. You will eclipse my blinding. 

You will know nothing. Nothing. You will know nothing of what has been dark.

In nyc, we stalked fishes 
              in filets of sounds: delivery 
              engines & ashy doors 

clapping shut, vendors
knuckling fin & silhouette-

             shaped words into salty 
expectations. My daughter 

& I walked down a couple 
              of slim-bricked blocks 
              that smelled like snapper 

& afro sheen with no afros 
in sight. On snaggletoothed 

streets, we double-took the wet 
alleys where things jumped 

off the hook like smart seafood 
              before lunch. We parted 

the perfect & abundantly wintered 

streets. My daughter said, I know
these parts like a tired pianist 
              resting on her bench.





Wings of Desire
 

This is what it sounds like outside, 
fat geese and guinea hens holding hands.
I am 31, which is very young for my age.
That is enough to realize I'm a pencil that has learned
how to draw the Internet. I explain squiggles
diagramming exactly how I feel and you are drawn to read
in ways you cannot yet. Slow goes the drag 
of creation, how what's within comes to be without,
which is the rhythmic erection of essence. 
Life's little deaths, petite orgasms, as the French nearly said
but never came to. Feathers outstrip the weather
as we stand with binoculars inquiring how 
winged creatures can hold their blood to warmth
without a proper insulation system overlaying circulation.
That is, sans fat and simple wooden bones with hair glued on.
Mostly though they pulsate on the horizons of backlit vision,
where we only meet the subways with handshakes, 
the rainbow filters of downloaded electronica,
the telephone poles as archaic checkpoints to past cultures.
They don't have screens to seek their cues in.
We drift from one culture to another and fight 
the stitcheries of racism, classism, 
anti-Muslim terrorists among us, 
with overlaps in the complete dis-ease our bodies
settle into for next to no resistance.
So we create something else. 
As in, roughshod moments of fake hate
will position a fluid hello of death rattles
that settle for the injunction of existence and state: 
Here am I made manifest by not being you, 
by not going in the same unsteady destination, 
by not asking the questions or repeating 
the paintings that came before me, 
by not singing in the register of your bubble baths
as you hug that person close in a wish to outlast 
bullets, even as the light leaves your eyes 
just a little next time we overlap paths.
So the hens and geese make us think in terms of help
outside, how they flap and move with fat ease in front of trains,
across the chopping block, to the hungry winters of final leviathans,
even as they land just so on the wires above us, 
and we go on complaining, murderous, too far out, unspoken.





The Duck Shit at Clarion Creek
 

We liked to stick it in a bb gun and shoot it. 
We tattooed with it. We said hallelujah, 
the poor man's tanning lotion. 
Then the frack wells began, something black 
capping the water and we got high 
watching a green-backed heron die. 
We got funny at Clarion, flung 
each other's underwear into the trees. 
Why was it we got naked there 
and nowhere else? Maybe we knew 
we were getting good and ugly, rusted inside 
as the trucks we rode into the water. 
Maybe we knew we only appeared 
to be floating, but soon and wholly 
we'd go under, and there 
would be nothing of return.





On Returning to My Hometown in 2035
 

Even the gun shows are gone now, even 
the scrapyards, the darkest, farthest barns. 
The strip mall half empty since 
my elementary years abides only 
chemicals now, the lot sequestered 
behind fences, its metal tanks checked 
each September for leaks in the seals. 
I lost my virginity in a basement here, lost
my balance on a backhoe, had to pick 
the gravel out of my knees. For the prom, 
my date was the tank man just vaporized
in the heat storm, his data screen open 
to augmented porn. This morning
in my Honda pedi-plane, I flew over where 
we used to sled, old hills oranged now
for warning, only the edges still brown. 
I saw a denier sitting outside 
in a lawn chair, her hair so long 
it met the ground. There's no idling in
the skyways now, which is why 
I can't tell you if she was dying.





Poem with Accidental Memory
 

That we go back to life one day, the next,
Some other century where we were alive,

When music spelled itself out to us, often
Incomplete, and nothing was more vague

Than the banality of whom to love and lose
In line, the doppelgangers in rimless snow,

Or even now, in summer, at day, by night,
When something oblivious, replete, turns

Back at us in idolatrous quiet, so we see
Who in nullified particulars we really are

At a desk of our own making, filling in for
Someone else's life sentence, blots drying

On a silk tie having no meaning but today's,
When the loner puts his insomnia to rest.





George Washington
 

You were my gym buddy ferreting along spotty florescent ramps.
Misbegotten signals blinked out bumpkin lanes over sable grass.

We passed through many things. Peach sirens, entryway orderlies.
Mangled disposition-stations. Chief in disbelief was concrete love.

Firmer still, a melee awkwardness that showed all registrants just
how we managed to pickpocket night. Then came dark crowds.

Some doodled for the pad, debriefed what pumiced eyes meant
in multi-dotted foreign rows. Buildings like a spider's clothes.

Later, we sped backward. A maw orchard, windless in the mind,
boomed electronic lifts. I spied you at the prow of some sensation.

I declined to call another name. Pelting noise flew off fairy citadels.
Clocks, first thought abducted, were switched. Dialogues dispelled.

My love heard a mug crash on the countertop of Long Island Sound.
Our people became as ones lost. Not many rebounded with pledge,

not many fetched familiars, stretched legs, reread white meetings.
O stream, ring your ears. Handsome tubers, go ahead and wig out.

Modern territories click like a mouse. Body becomes human body.
On a skinny avenue I hushed up pyramidal steps older than sorcery.

You know how I want to share a dust ball with misty partner.
Dance one fabled evening and hear the skylark do something.

Picnics bended over, they happen below. Swings parks rung.
I inject chlorine into my memory-parts with lady satisfaction.

Are you gay? A political campaign sanctioned a quart of moose.
So stars soon quarreled back to the travel section of the North.

I ignored that and opened my lips for a job to crunch and push
at me, seeing the flat spacey wherewithal of disconnected items.

I want a second act. What can I say but this was my second act.
Must wrangle a look-see. The sign revenging its timely laziness

in the ruffled strut of an accusing pillow. I hibernate in phrase
as perfect as the mood of the blue lotus flower. Public aspects.

The last shipment of vhs tapes left its factory on this day in 2008
or 2009. Meanwhile, delis around town don't go like they used to.

Who cares if I can't hose you down my you, my Newfoundland.
And George Washington, someone we can't really know, rows

over famed waters, wondering what his face will be, not in
the future, not for the monthly book clubs. But as sovereign:

as beast with dunce cap. I will dress you down in fresh lettuce
and gobble your ear off with smutty keys principled as music.

The marching saints won't bother in battalion to much know.
We make of him so much hackneyed affection, dress wounds

as if equivocal all need. Hunger passes through to the other side.
Entertaining pals you wouldn't call but couldn't not think to.

A disfigured face's humiliated psychic debris sprawls on gussy rug.
It talks you into needing solace while cup passes from sleep to sleep.

The positional plot warps but is the same. The deluxe mattress drifts
on gravitational subtleties like the rest of us, practicing the gut's banjo.

No, in fact, I don't know how he ever crossed the channels or canals
from that stout city. I don't really know if I ever really need to know.

One thing we share is worshipping the image of a person we never knew.





Time After Time
 

After Cyndi Lauper
I'm in the barricade hearing the clock thickening you.
    Autumn encircles a confusion that's nothing new.
Flash back to warring eyes almost letting me drown.

Out of which, a picture of me walking in a foreign head.
     I can't hear what you said. Then you say: Cold room,
the second that life unwinds. A tinctured vase returns

to grass. Secrets doled out deep inside a drum beat out
     of time. Whatever you said was ghostly slow like
a second hand unwinding by match light. Lying back

to the wheel, I shirked confusion. You already knew.
     Suitcases surround me. You picture me too far ahead.
Yet I can't hear what you've said. You say: Doldrums,

some secondhand wine. Love, you knew my precincts.
     The stone house turned out black, the scenic tunics
were deep inside. Who said home? Oh, I fall behind.

That very secret height blinds. Lying like a diamond,
     the cock-thickening of you: hunchbacked arms, eyes
left behind. You'll picture me walking far, far ahead.

I hear what you've done. You said: Go slow. I feebly
     bleed out. Matthew's sermon turned out to be glass.
I wander in windows soft as Sour Patch. No rewind.

But something is out of touch and you, you're Sinbad.
     That second date totally mine. Lying in a vacuum,
the thickening plot thinks of you. The future's not new.

touchdown. Lights. All those celebrity behinds.
     A suitcase full of weeds. You picture me coming to.
You: too close to me to hear what you've already said.

Then you say: The second wind unwinds. Doves whistle,
     halving their dovely backs, watching out windows to see
if I'm okay. See it, the dulcet moment? I'm like thicket

tinkering for you. Fusion nothing you knew. Flash back
     to seagull-beguiled eyes. Sometimes talking to a barren
lad. Such music so unbearably droll. The hand is mine.

Random picture frames off the darkness. A Turing machine?
     Scotch-taping through windows, stolen from deep inside
rum-beaded thyme. You say also: Behind sequins & hinds. . .

And I'm in the barricade hearing the clock thickening you.
     Clematis enclosures, walking with news, pollinated by a 
secondary grief, while something reminds you of our love.





Arlene and Esme
 

In our house we live with Arlene. My little sister has a plan.
She has what they call a beginner's mind. She sees everything 
from an un-given-up perspective. I'm frightened; I know 
Arlene better than anyone; she knows me better. Esme says 
if I'm scared we can't win. But I am scared. Arlene drags me 
over to the window where the black mould has made 
a map of Australia. Australia gives me trouble breathing,
it's so far away. Arlene points it out and I get the feeling 
in my chest, my whole life in there twisted up like a snake. 
It could bite me or her. She puts a hand on my breastbone. 
You're not strong. I want to tell her we can look after ourselves. 
I want to tell her I'm in charge now, but I can still see the dark 
blur at the edges. I don't sleep anymore, my head is full 
of this insomniac light. I lie awake watching over my sisters 
and I listen to them breathe. Esme whispers that I should 
wake her if I need to. I say I will, but I never do. Even when 
I sleep I dream I can't sleep and I'm standing there looking 
down at them, the night pouring from my hands. Esme has 
a future in mind. She's always laughing. She gets up early 
and makes buttermilk pancakes using normal milk soured 
with lemon juice. She tries things out. Arlene tells us 
to stay away from sharp things or we'll cut ourselves. Esme 
does what she likes. She grates apple for a new recipe and 
cuts her knuckle and laughs. I don't know if I can live my life. 
I don't know if I can look after someone as unafraid as Esme. 
I don't know how to change what I do, the way someone 
eating soup will, out of habit, bite down. Esme laughs; she's 
serving up apple pancakes with banana and maple syrup
and she says, You are a whole person. A row of mornings fan out.
And the pancakes are sweet and slightly gummy with a salt edge.





The Forms of Resistance
 

Is this mountain all rock, or are there any villages on it?
These are some of the things I said to her.

We bake because it is a way of overcoming.
In the journey of zest, I see myself.

On the news every day people are standing up screaming
or lying down screaming while others remain calm.

She pointed out that I had not made eye contact
with her at all. Then I cried properly in a short burst.

This is the worst example of any circumstance ever,
noted a journalist in his notebook.

Let butter and chocolate be a wish not to die!
I implored the bain-marie. She likened me to a sieve.

I clutch all my poems to my chest and count them
again and again. I am kneeling like a small dog.

What's going on with this modern world
and the right wife not even knowing

what the left wife is doing? Now all you have to do
is cut off the legs. After an absence, after a hard task,

after the way the hand turns, like this--
There was so much I couldn't contain.

She asked me how I was feeling in my body
at this moment; I said tense in my whole trunk area.

A strong smell of white wine. She said it came from
an impulse that she often used to have when she first

started practicing. She said she believed feelings
are held in the body. She asked me what was going on

with my breath and I realized I was sort of holding it.
Like the boxes in the cupboard. "Enough can get bigger.

How much bigger, though? When I say
I've had enough, how will you know when to stop?





The Flight
 

Just seen, running, and silver-gray
along the top tube of a fence between myrtles and me,
too slinky for a bird and even at this distance
unmistakably a quadruped and
nimble, some sort of unspoiled animal, but which?
It ran as if away
from a threat, peril was everywhere,
a footsole crunches it, it is mangled
by a tire's treads, hawk scoops it, turkey buzzard
pecks at it, no speech mitigates its pains,
even the cat fools with it, until, inedible,
it is kicked into the gutter. There she goes,
the slinky silver-gray Atalanta of reptiles
vanishes in no time, for the wind
whisks from her feet such tenuous gusts of air--
brisk now where turnpikes stretch their webs,
and not forever can an earthiness
so sweet as this propel such grace.

She'll have got to the mantis eggs by now,
at each gulp of hatchling
she slowly blinks with satisfaction.





Sweet Virginia
 

I got a letter from the government.
It said let there be night.
I went through your trash.
There was night, all right.
I consider how your light is spent.

I have butterflies a little bit.
I have some pills I take for it.
I've been up since four the day before.
Agony's a cinch to sham.

Don't worry about the environment.
Let it kill us if it can.
I give a tiny tinker's damn.
I put the ox behind the cart.
Consume away my snow-blind heart.

Fastened to a service animal
it is waiting for the beep.
It is waiting for the right to change.
Hello, I know you're there, pick up.





Not Fade Away
 

Half of the Beatles have fallen
and half are yet to fall.
Keith Moon has set. Hank Williams
hasn't answered yet.

Children sing for Alex Chilton.
Whitney Houston's left the Hilton.
Hendrix, Guru, Bonham, Janis.
They have a tendency to vanish.

Bolan, Bell, and Boon by car.
How I wonder where they are.
Hell is now Jeff Hanneman's.
Adam Yauch and three Ramones.

[This space held in reserve
for Zimmerman and Osterberg,
for Bruce and Neil and Keith,
that sere and yellow leaf.]

Johnny Cash and Waylon Jennings,
Stinson, Sterling, Otis Redding.
Johnny Thunders and Joe Strummer,
Ronnie Dio, Donna Summer.

Randy Rhoads and Kurt Cobain,
Patsy Cline and Ronnie Lane.
Poly Styrene, Teena Marie.
Timor mortis conturbat me.





In Loco Parentis
 

were some quite creepy men--one 
used to lie down
on the dayroom floor, then get us all 
to pile on top of him--and a basilisk-
eyed matron in a blue uniform with a watch 
dangling 
beneath her right
collarbone. Thump thump
thump went her footsteps, making 
the asbestos ceiling tiles quiver, and me
want to hide, or run like a rabbit
in a fire . . .
                    What we lost, we lost
forever. A minor 
devil played at chess 
with us, forcing 
the pieces to levitate 
and hover, flourishing swords, in midair. I'd grasp 
them now, the orotund bishop, the stealthy
knight, the all-
knowing queen, 
but they dissolve
in my fingers, refuse 
to return to the board, to their squares.





Unreal
 

                                        . . . I drank
and was surprised 
to see what looked like tea leaves 
at the bottom 
of the cup . . . minutes
later a great warm green wave 
or cloud 
began advancing towards me. "Look at the boats 
on his shirt, I felt myself trying
to say, in Spanish, or Moroccan, yet knowing 
I knew
none of the words . . .

                                          it was bright 
morning, and the train had arrived
and emptied 
at Chamartn before I finally 
pried open my eyes, and saw
on the carriage floor
nothing but an unfamiliar 
pair of trainers: cracked
white leather, with three green stripes. "Mister--
or rather Herr--Adolf 
Dassler made these, I thought. But which
of the two friendly men with whom 
I'd shared the carriage, and some wine,
had been wearing them? I pondered
this awhile, then fell
asleep again . . .

                              and did 
Herr Dassler visit, personally, all the cities inscribed
on his trainers? Koln, Dublin, Paris, Montreal, 
Kopenhagen, Bern, Amsterdam . . . and fit 
the trainer to the city? Rom, like these, Vienna, 
London . . .

                    Seor Dassler, I am dreaming of you
on a bench on a platform in a train station 
in Madrid, unable
to wake up, a pair 
of your trainers, that weren't mine, but now are,
on my feet . . .

                            I am swimming, Herr 
Dassler, in your wake, though I fear
you are dead, a corpse washed clean by the numbing tides 
with three slanting stripes emblazoned 
on your chest, your passport and your wallet 
drifting to the ocean floor . . .

                                                       I discovered
in a pocket--oh! the kindness 
of strangers!--about 
forty pesetas; but casting 
around for a joke or silver lining, I found 
nada--or niente, as I put it
to my shoes . . . closing 
my eyes, I imagined fingers untying 
and easing off my Reeboks, as the train 
hurtled through the darkness, the men trying 
them on in turn, the ex-owner of these 
flexing his toes, padding up and down, nodding 
approval. They must have whispered 
like parents, as they lifted my shirt and unfastened
my money belt, or perhaps, more like surgeons, they used
scissors, or a knife . . .

                                          snicker-snack! I watched
the vorpal blade trace
arabesques across my breastbone, hover, then slide
between two ribs. Chug-chug
went the trains. The heat 
was building, the potion
at last wearing off. How light 
I'd be, I now 
began to reason, as quick and canny 
as a lizard, a perfectly camouflaged 
lizard, who'd shed a skin and acquired a new 
way of walking.





Granted
 

A film is always like a book and not like a conversation.                                --Christian Metz
As I saw your face nearing
my face, snow fell through
a keyhole and opened the door.
We went inside and watched
windows wax green and gold.
Spring, we decided, was more
oppressive than winter with
its alyssum and clover
and the sheer weight of life
crowding us off the page.
We stayed in bed for years
and took our cures patiently
from each other's cups.
We read Bleak House and
stored our money in socks.
Nothing opened as we did.





Scene
 

The cinema is a specific language.           --Christian Metz
What the body might guess,
what the hand requests,
what language assumes
becomes amulet,
which is to say
I am carrying your face
in a locket in a box
to a virtual location
guarded by kestrels,
suggesting the scene's
geography of love and dirt,
trees ripe with darkness
and bones' white luster.
In the moonlit blue house,
where snow won't fall
unless called upon,
grace enters as requested,
lands next to you, grasped,
as if love were a reflex
simple as weather.





A Woman in the Sun
 

The shed        behind the barn behind the red cottage I wait


for her in the fescue grass the rye        I hear it grow over me


Wait for my friends in the distance        on fire their full heads


of rust (I love how the clothing drips off them        I hear myself say)


If the beekeeper doesn't        come chasing behind with a hatchet


I'll wait behind Cobb's barn        watching the distant houses


She will come down this road        my shadow is paving for her


a stalk of honey        and the rye grass grows from her arms


(She was raised in these hills        looking down on Elk Creek)


and behind her the bluegrass        it's reaching to touch her ankle

               1 

Rain fell as a glass 
breaks,
something suddenly everywhere at the same time.


               2 

To live like a painting 
looked into from more than one angle at once--

eye to eye with the doorway,
down at the hair,
up at your own dusty feet. 


                3 

"This is your house,
said my bird heart to my heart of the cricket, 
and I entered.


                4 

The happy see only happiness,
the living see only life,
the young see only the young,

as lovers believe
they wake always beside one also in love.


                5 

However often I turned its pages,
I kept ending up 
as the same two sentences of the book:

The being of some is: to be. Of others: to be without.

Then I fell back asleep, in Swedish.


                6 

A sheep grazing is unimpressed by the mountain
but not by its flies.


                7 

The grief
of what hasn't yet happened--

a door closed from inside.

The weight of the grass 
dividing
an ant's five-legged silence
walking through it.


                8 

What is the towel, what is the water, 
changes,
though of we three, 
only the towel can be held upside down in the sun.


                9 

"I was once.
Said not in self-pity or praise.
This dignity we allow barn owl, 
ego, oyster.





Arrochar Alps
 

I have been known to birth a mountain whole,
a range of them in my belly,

I popped them out one by one.
The blood-cut son born black,

I could not believe the wholeness of him,
the crushed diamond of his face.

And then the other,
who flew from me, a shooting star;

a twin mirror girl, whose orchid face
opened and opened and opened.

There were more of them,
one born of water, one of fire,

one for every element.
But now my mountain days are done.

The red night clouds, the afterbirth,
the snail shell whorls of them.

The unborns we named:

Beinn Narnain, Ben Vane, Beinn Ime,
Ben Vorlich, and Beinn Bhuidhe.





Roses
 

There is no escaping the storm of roses
crisscrossed on the split-cracked wall
of a dead fountain arch.
There is no escaping their uterine balls,
expanding as a reminder of the children I never had.
If you listen carefully you can hear the vibrations,
the heart drone of their petal jaw-harps.
And there's no going back,
no indiscovery of Mars
or these red planets brooding before me,
light predators, sun-hatched
and bloodening like the fists of women
who have gone to war.





Wild Poppies
 

And how do you survive? Your long throat, 
your red-rag-to-a-bull head?

You rise heavy in the night, stars drinking
from your poppy neck.

Your henna silks serenade me 
under the breadth of the Pyrenees.

You move like an opera,
open like sea anemones.

You are earth's first blood. 
How the birds love you,

I envy your lipstick dress.
You are urgent as airmail, animal red,

Ash Wednesday crosses tattooed on your head.
Your butterfly breath 

releases your scents, your secrets, 
bees blackening your mouth

as your dirty red laundry
all hangs out.





The Unique Thoughts of Otherhood
 

After Alfred Noyes
               unmount

Umber tail mount, 
Seven bubbles, sad 
Balk of night,
Red tulip lunges. 

Incandescent felt tips,
Small ochre waves
In the nape
Of greening brick.

Simile-clad branches
Vascular, the leather
Cusp of April
Or glass leaves: 

Nest of pages
In a sweep.



               woof

Coil helix rain. 
Congregation gully up.
Cold steel compress
Her rosy ways.

Rattle a cocoon,
Three twins falling
Combat lost nap
Wool in Woolf. 

Brittle sheep tossed,
Biotic petrol lagoon:
Morning sex lyric 
Ever after umber:

Where the knobby 
Moose pins glisten.



               perroquet

Hooked rug or
Gursky's 99 cent.
By the thousand
Field, bunch, vase,

Swooped pink neckline
Tailored as crinoline
Fringed, parrot, Rembrandt
Ovoid domesticated bowl.

Swivel in red
Armless white linen,
Visualization of unnatural 
Interactive selection bias:

What the daffodil
Could not accomplish. 



               swivel

Owls curtain his 
Future, a violent 
Wave rumbling beneath
The brown floorboards.

I'm a bad 
Mother, impatient, tiny-
Fisted body crumpled
Against my chest,

Aquatic gulps of
Air, the owls,
Prickling our chests.
The bad finger

Points back, points
At the pointer.



               chisel

After Steve McCaffery's "Tyrolean Night

Suddenness is other,
A numerical chill
Sphere machine, a
Tall Bash bathes.

Pond jumps in 
To frog, insults 
Are all sex, 
Is mute sagas, 

Is daylight upended, 
Drunken, you sang 
The totem up:
The wind did 

What shrewd words 
So rarely do.





Sylvia Plaths Elegy for Sylvia Plath
 

If you can't feel love in life you won't feel it in death, nor
Will you feel the tulip's skin, nor the soft gravel 

Of childhood under cheek. You will have writhed 
Across the page for a hard couplet, a firm rhyme, ass

High as any downward dog, and cutlass arms 
Lashing any mother who tries to pass: Let's be frank 

About the cost of spurs, mothers like peonies 
Whirling in storm drains, families sunk before 

Reaching open water. The empty boudoir 
Will haunt, but not how you imagine it will. 

Nothing, not even death frees mothers 
From the cutting board, the balloons, their 

Lack of resistance, thoughts, he said, quick
As tulips staggering across the quad.

She heard, I like my women splayed 
Out, red. Read swollen, domesticated,

Wanting out. The tulips were never warm 
My loves, they never smelled of spring, 

They never marked the path out of loneliness, 
Never led me home, nor to me, nor away 

From what spring, or red, or tulips 
Could never be.





A Worldly Country
 

Not the smoothness, not the insane clocks on the square,
the scent of manure in the municipal parterre,
not the fabrics, the sullen mockery of Tweety Bird,
not the fresh troops that needed freshening up. If it occurred
in real time, it was OK, and if it was time in a novel
that was OK too. From palace and hovel
the great parade flooded avenue and byway
and turnip fields became just another highway.
Leftover bonbons were thrown to the chickens
and geese, who squawked like the very dickens.
There was no peace in the bathroom, none in the china closet
or the banks, where no one came to make a deposit.
In short all hell broke loose that wide afternoon.
By evening all was calm again. A crescent moon
hung in the sky like a parrot on its perch.
Departing guests smiled and called, "See you in church!"
For night, as usual, knew what it was doing,
providing sleep to offset the great ungluing
that tomorrow again would surely bring.
As I gazed at the quiet rubble, one thing
puzzled me: What had happened, and why?
One minute we were up to our necks in rebelliousness,
and the next, peace had subdued the ranks of hellishness.

So often it happens that the time we turn around in
soon becomes the shoal our pathetic skiff will run aground in.
And just as waves are anchored to the bottom of the sea
we must reach the shallows before God cuts us free.





Gettysburg: July 1, 1863
 

The young man, hardly more
than a boy, who fired the shot
had looked at him with an air
not of anger but of concentration,
as if he were surveying a road,
or feeding a length of wood into a saw:
It had to be done just so.

The bullet passed through 
his upper chest, below the collar bone.
The pain was not what he might
have feared. Strangely exhilirated
he staggered out of the pasture
and into a grove of trees.

He pressed and pressed
the wound, trying to stanch
the blood, but he could only press
what he could reach, and he could 
not reach his back, where the bullet
had exited.
                     He lay on the earth
smelling the leaves and mosses,
musty and damp and cool
after the blaze of open afternoon.

How good the earth smelled,
as it had when he was a boy
hiding from his father,
who was intent of strapping him
for doing his chores
late one time too many.

A cowbird razzed from a rail fence.
It isn't mockery, he thought,
no malice in it. . . just a noise.
Stray bullets nicked the oaks
overhead. Leaves and splinters fell.

Someone near him groaned.
But it was his own voice he heard.
His fingers and feet tingled,
the roof of his mouth,
and the bridge of his nose. . . .

He became dry, dry, and thought
of Christ, who said, I thirst.
His man-smell, the smell of his hair
and skin, his sweat, the salt smell
of his cock and the little ferny hairs
that two women had known

left him, and a sharp, almost sweet
smell began to rise from his open mouth
in the warm shade of the oaks.
A streak of sun climbed the rough
trunk of a tree, but he did not
see it with his open eye.





Darkness Starts
 

A shadow in the shape of a house
 slides out of a house
 and loses its shape on the lawn.

 Trees seek each other
 as the wind within them dies.

 Darkness starts inside of things
 but keeps on going when the things are gone.

 Barefoot careless in the farthest parts of the yard 
children become their cries.





The Last Hour
 

Lean and sane 
in the last hour 
of a long fast 
or fiercer discipline 
he could touch dust 
into a sudden 
surge of limbs 
and speak leaves 
in the night air 
above him, inhabit
 quiet so wholly 
he heard roots 
inch into the unfeeling 
earth, rings increasing 
inside of that tree.
Without moving, 
hardly breathing, 
he could call
 out of the long darkness 
walls around him, 
a house whose each room 
he knew, its hoard 
of silences, solitudes, 
doors opening 
onto the wide fields 
through which he moved, 
breathing deeply, 
unbewildered by the dead 
with their hands of wind, 
their faces of cloud. 
Stilled and gifted 
in the last hour 
before the first light,
in the dark place 
of his own making, 
he could feel rocks 
relax alive 
beside him, gather 
from a moon-raveled 
river the pearl 
curves and blue 
fluency of a girl 
his hands once knew.

He could let her go. 
He let it all go, 
desire and grief 
and raw need 
going out of him 
moment by moment 
into the mild 
immaculate night, 
love by love 
into a last 
passion of pure 
attention, nerves, 
readiness...

                     Light carved 
out of the darkness 
a muscled trunk, 
each clenched limb 
and the difficult tips 
of a plain mesquite 
taking shape 
over the hard ground 
where they found him, 
his eyes wide
and his whole body 
hungering upward, 
as if he could hear 
and bear the bird 
singing unseen 
deep in those leaves.





Hard Night
 

What words or harder gift 
does the light require of me 
carving from the dark 
this difficult tree?

What place or farther peace 
do I almost see 
emerging from the night 
and heart of me?

The sky whitens, goes on and on. 
Fields wrinkle into rows 
of cotton, go on and on. 
Night like a fling of crows 
disperses and is gone.

What song, what home, 
what calm or one clarity 
can I not quite come to, 
never quite see: 
this field, this sky, this tree.





Night's Thousand Shadows
 

1. deathbed

There is a word that is not water, 
has nothing to do with heat or light, 
is unrelated to any one pain 
though the torn body tears itself further 
trying to speak it.
                                  There is a sound 
beyond all the sounds that I have made, 
the needs that one by one I've tried to name. 
It burns clear in the eyes searching mine, 
the lips beginning to bleed again, 
her hand squeezing my hand, 
pleading and pleading that I understand.


2. living will

All afternoon in the afterlife 
of little things that love,
 or pain, or need could not let go of
 I hunt for the will
 that will let me let you go.

I am distracted and slow--
all the grainy faces
 in old photographs, letters 
from the dead, deeds to places 
that are only air,

 some bright nowhere 
of broad fields and sunlight 
that was my idea of heaven 
one long afternoon 
of clouds and steady rain

 when you sat and explained 
where a garden was, a well, 
excited by it, the hell 
ahead of you 
just a brief tightness at your heart.

 Outside in the yard, crickets start, 
cry here and here and here, 
night's thousand shadows growing tall.
 And now I have it, formal, final. 
I touch each keepsake like a wall.


3. going

In the hard light and hum
 of the room to which I've come
 to stay, I watch the clock,
 and wait, and hour by hour
 begin to disappear.
 Movements, mutterings: the brain
 darkens like a landscape. Pain
 in the pale arterial hills
 flashes and vanishes,
 takes with it one whole year.
 Cotton and killdeer, a cloud
 looks down, something's happened
 in the wellhouse, someone runs
 through tall trees, breathe and breathe,
 is it my hand you hold?
 The fever climbs. You grow cold,
 then warm, now cold again,
 a hive of nerves in the skin.
 Some glimmer breaks through
 and I bend whispering as fear
 like a wind shakes you,
 I'm right here, I'm right here...

 Midnight, moonlight gauzing 
the walls, the iron and umber 
of intensive care: 
I watch as it swells and falls 
the puttied scar at your heart, 
and read each beat and falter 
on a screen and match my breathing 
to the breathing of a machine 
to know this time as it passes, 
each moment as it goes-- 
until, early, you shudder 
and quieten, blood gases 
begin to rapidly rise 
and somewhere behind your eyes 
I fall in fragments away: 
a child surprised at his play, 
encroached upon by air, 
a shattered man near dawn, 
something about the way 
he holds so still, his hair.





Rhymes for a Watertower
 

A town so flat a grave's a hill, 
            A dusk the color of beer.
 A row of schooldesks shadows fill, 
            A row of houses near.

 A courthouse spreading to its lawn, 
            A bank clock's lingering heat.
 A gleam of storefronts not quite gone, 
            A courthouse in the street.

 A different element, almost, 
            A dry creek brimming black.
 A fight to lure the darkness close, 
            A light to keep it back.

 A time so still a heart's a sound, 
            A moon the color of skin.
 A pumpjack bowing to the ground, 
            Again, again, again.





This Inwardness, This Ice
 

This inwardness, this ice, 
this wide boreal whiteness

 into which he's come 
with a crawling sort of care

 for the sky's severer blue, 
the edge on the air,

 trusting his own lightness 
and the feel as feeling goes;

 this discipline, this glaze, 
this cold opacity of days

 begins to crack.
 No marks, not one scar,

 no sign of where they are,
 these weaknesses rumoring through,

 growing loud if he stays, 
louder if he turns back.

Nothing to do but move. 
Nowhere to go but on,

to creep, and breathe, and learn 
a blue beyond belief,

 an air too sharp to pause, 
this distance, this burn,

 this element of flaws 
that winces as it gives.

Nothing to do but live.
Nowhere to be but gone.





The Ice Storm
 

Then all one day because of ice
 they couldn't make it down the hill.
Or up, James says,
dabbing at a spill
of coffee, crunching toast as if it had a spine.
But he could work, at any rate,
could concentrate
on that book he's been reading,
or meaning to,
the flu--
or was it famine?--of '49,
some smoldering fact
he's found in the cold ash of some war.
Gusting upward, lobes and nose on fire,
his whole face florid
from the heart attack
he's somehow never had,
he sways, repeating:
Oh, we'd get down just fine,
I expect, but we'd never make it back,
then goes into his room and shuts the door.

Eva's hours have nearer ends.
She heats the little disk the cat sleeps on;
chips, until her hands are gone,
the glaze off all the feeders for the birds;
then writes two friends
to thank them for the birthday chocolates they've sent.
The word alone makes her stomach burn.
Which is mostly what age is, she's learned,
the senses sharpening backwards,
keen to what they can't perceive,
when to be wise means mostly not to wish
for what you love,
for what you love is pain:
spices or coffee, gin
bringing the evening light into your veins,
good chocolates the grandkids ravish
like a horde of crows.
You stuff your bellies with tomorrow's ache,
she can almost hear him bellow,
nipping and pinching to make them squeal.
Hot water with honey, one coddled egg, dry saltines:
Oh, what difference does it make?
She picks up the chocolates, breaks
the seal.





He draws the blinds on a wall of glass,
winces at the glare,
drags his chair
into the bright crevasse
between his bed and bookshelf,
takes a deep breath of air,
and buries himself
in one of the early wordy furies
of William Gladstone,
never a man for minor keys.
Creak and tick of the burdened limbs.
A creak and tick inside of him
as he crosses his legs and then uncrosses them,
shifts his weight to ease
the stiffness in one side,
turns a page like a summit he has climbed,
and breathes...
Think of it--twenty thousand books devoured
in Gladstone's life, and of his own
enough to keep an army of bibliographers occupied;
a whole age and empire crammed into one man:
spellbinding crowds until he couldn't stand,
felling his million trees,
filling six decades' worth of diaries
because a life is owed as well as owned, time
a gift of which a good man gives account;
who would mount,
night after night, a moral, high-rhetorical siege
upon some poor Haymarket tart
in whom ruin
and beauty were one word,
then go home and whip himself for a sin
that, all the evidence suggests, never occurred
but in his heart.





And has just one,
pleasure spreading through her blood like a single drop
of ink.
She scours the stove and countertop,
bleaches coffee stains off the sink,
cleans leaf by leaf
the emerald ripple and the paradise palm,
both mostly dormant now,
reaches high for the philodendron, huge since trained to climb,
and pauses,
remembering the calm
of constant motion that her mother was--
a beauty, men said, though it hardly seemed
a part of her, looking out of her own face
like someone on a train;
and remembering, too,
the child-high hedgerows
alone the lane
behind their house on Paddox Close,
the slice of sky above
growing wider as she grew,
the little park with its central statue
(who was it of?),
which, last time she'd seen,
weather had worried
to a Swedish ivy sort of green.





Emma Clifton, Elizabeth Collins, P. Lightfoot--
even the names of those women are there
amid the parliamentary proceedings,
bulldog scholarship, affairs
of state.
He lifts his hand like a weight
to check his watch, little trembles traveling through his bones
into the air
as through plucked strings
a sound.
Two hours until the final round
at Palm Springs,
with its hairpin fairways, lacquered greens,
and that great eighteenth in homage
to Bobby Jones.
What a character!--touring in his teens,
retired at twenty-eight
with nothing left to win,
at forty storming Normandy with men
half his age.
Even his death was rare-- 
syringomyelia--cane to brace to wheelchair
without a trace of self-pity, regret, rage:
We all have to play the ball as it lies.
How much of a man's revealed in how he dies...
Poor Owen, barely sixty, Dean of the College,
a decent book on Kant behind him:
two days of chest pain
slivering into a lifetime's knowledge
and all the old beliefs
come flooding back,
silly relics and rituals, griefs
you're born into, some guilt you can't even name.
"Ischemia," that's exactly right: blood lack.





Sweet pickles and white bread,
salted ham,
a soybean spread
that is his one concession to his heart,
two butter cookies, plum jam:
she clicks
across the polished floor
through motes that rise
and float like molecules of light,
pausing outside his door,
hearing the Mahler chorus to which he always cries,
plays to cry, she suspects,
as if even sadness could be planned.
She takes the knob in her hand,
sees, inside its shine,
white tablecloths, crystal cut fine
as jewels,
and, and... and a man
with American shoulders and vowels,
that face
so open it wasn't, like the ocean,
and that tidal way he had of filling any space
that wasn't taken,
the table where she sat with friends,
afternoons and weekends,
classrooms, boardrooms, lecture halls,
the very bodies of their children,
in whose broad limbs he seems to sprawl.
Was that what she had fallen for,
talk of golf, and Oxford, and roast beef
in that gray decade after the war,
that it seemed so safe
a fall?





There--where the strings go silent
and that woman's whole soul
is in her throat...
A home can have but one composer.
Wasn't that the quote?
That long ironclad letter Mahler wrote
to Alma, the most exquisite
woman in Vienna, who packed
away that cold contract,
her party dresses, and her own precocious technique,
and settled, if you could call it that,
into the role
of being Gustav Mahler's wife:
I am not happy, and yet not unhappy.
My ship is in the harbor, but it has sprung a leak.
But he loved her; and she is in his music
as surely as the God
he never quite possessed nor fully lost,
as surely as the daughter is alive
inside this song, whose life
it cost.
Gladstone also had a daughter die at five. 
Odd,
not to have thought of that before.
And Mahler's sisters name was Anna,
and Gladstone's sister Ann;
and wasn't Mrs. Gladstone's family from Oxford, or near?
Oh, William dear,
she told him once, if you weren't such a great man, you'd be a terrible bore.





Was that a laugh or a sob?
Mahler dies off
into the long silences, polite applause,
and weirdly reverential tones of golf.
This could take all day.
She lets go of the knob,
backs away.





He looks up as if he's heard a sound--
what was it called,
that late-medieval game out of which golf evolved?
He looks down:
O'Connor's on the second tee,
It must have started earlier than he thought,
Steady head, steady head,
that pro at Sea Pines always said.
James lifts one hand above his knee,
so palsied now
he can't keep his cocktails quiet,
as if every instant were a shock
his body took.
Think of a stake
driven through your skull into the ground.
California fades into some salesman fool
he mutes
to spend three minutes
amid the doomed midcentury debates
on Home Rule:
Gladstone, suicidally brilliant at eighty-four--
One fight more,
the best and the last...
He looks up to see a ball
that's made of feathers struck
with something like a gardening tool
and flying fast
toward what, in the moment before he blinks,
is a cemetery gate.
Hurley or shinty, he thinks
as it falls.
In northern France they called it soule.





Head bowed,
her face in pieces
on the table, she seems,
as she gathers and releases
a little storm of gleams
from her hands, to wield the sun she's in.
Nineteen fifty-four it would have been
when James's parents gave them these. Proud,
so proud they were--
of their heirloom silver, their tidy house, Michigan,
her,
whom they kept introducing as James's bride,
though she was nearly five months gone by then. 
She draws the cloth between the light and knife, 
freezes.
How strange--to feel a life 
that is and isn't yours 
shift inside,
After the first brittle exchanges that day, 
hot dogs and crisps, tours 
of their property, their church, James's high school 
where they first learned their private awe was real, 
his mother rattling on in that white-noise way 
that women will 
when silence, like men, 
is simply one more thing to fill--
Eva had nodded, and smiled, 
and hovered just outside of her own skin, 
trying to feel 
that life inside of her again.





The dogleg seventh. A tough par five, 
the fairway pared 
to nearly nothing at its kink, 
ramping up to inkblot bunkers and a pulpit green. 
O'Connor times a drive
so pure and powerful the ball becomes the air-- 
a blue nowhere
for a long moment on the screen--
distilling white on its descent 
into the rough. 
Straight enough,
the commentator says, but overplayed, 
going on to praise the progress O'Connor's made 
since that wild tirade
two years ago on this same course,
the midnight tabloid accident
in which he broke both hands.
The camera pans
the fairway and milling gallery,
probes a dense, occluded spot
under a tree.
As if a man could simply start all over,
as if you couldn't read one character
in everything he does.
What was it Mahler said of Alma's early love--
Even his music has a weak chin.
O'Connor, lost in leaves, eye on the pin,
scalds a shot
past every limb but one,
which, after a comic chaos
of ricochets,
trickles back exactly where it was.
The Perilous Ambition
was Bobby Jones's phrase,
which is to aim at what you were
despite the hazard you are in.





Anna calls,
the fifth time in as many days,
some childhood memory of a sauce
for pears;
thirty minutes later calls again
to chat about the ice
she's seen on television,
one brother's ruined marriage,
another's move across
the country, cutting a careful trace
around the silence
of her second miscarriage
in as many years
until there is no word that's not that loss.
A walk, I think. You too, Mom. Tell Dad hi.
Goodbye.





This stiffness in one side, 
the telephone ringing and ringing, 
the damn birds racketing 
as if it were spring--
he's up, listing a moment while the tide 
of blood comes back into his brain, 
a fine pain
needling through his chest and down one shoulder, 
which is what he should have told her, 
he thinks, with as much a smile 
as he can manage, that pretty girl he stumbled into in the aisle 
of the grocery store,
who had pink-streaked hair, a pierced nose, and swore 
by acupuncture:
that his body had, in a sense, acquired its own. 
Point by point he feels the pain withdraw.
 Like a world disturbed in water, 
his bed and bookcase, the centuries on the shelves, 
the television, and his own unsteady limbs 
waver back into themselves. 
Gladstone,
he thinks, striding across the room, 
that mix of filial relief and Protestant rage 
the great man felt for his sister, healed of lockjaw
and tremblings by the knucklebone
of a saint.
He stops, so close that he can see
each nub and flaw
in the white paint
of the door.
He takes a deep breath, lets it out slowly.
What's one hour more.





Forks and spoons and knives.
Fingers, hair, face.
What survives,
she wonders, rising suddenly toward the window,
of James's parents' place:
the vegetable garden and the screened-in porch,
the driveway bumping toward
the blacktop, as they called it,
splintering into a million little nameless roads
through the countryside
that she and James didn't so much drive
one frozen night so long ago
as glide.
She puts her fingers on the cold pane:
the iron deck chairs, the railings and the ground below,
each least tip of every tree,
all wrought to the same fine fragility
of glass.
Where were they?
She feels a quicksilver current in her nerves,
feels it pass.
Was there some way
to have prepared for this--
the childhood walks; the first lilt and flirt
of a voice she hardly recognized as hers;
that kiss
outside her front door
after James had met her parents, the taste
of something, tea, yes;
and more,
Amherst, New Haven, Ann Arbor,
vast tracts of life like landscape glimpsed from a car;
even labor,
Lord, vise of time
tightening, tightening, tearing you in two
until that one pain is all you are...
--these brief gleams in the mind.
And who would guess
that as the years find
their final focus you're bothered less
by the dark that lies ahead of you
than the dark that lies behind?





But who'd refuse a healing for its source?
Up, up
the slick eighteenth a strong putt climbs,
rounds
the lip of the cup
so deeply half the ball's inside,
emerges
only to slide
all the way back down.
Tough course, tough course.





North, night, late, and the branches fraught
with ice as they are now;
first one owl
like an oboe in the upper dark,
low, stark,
then farther off another;
and how,
as the time between their cries grew wide,
they never moved,
as if what each one sought
was not the other
but the distance that the other was,
and cried
but to align their silences.





He lifts his eyes:
a last stab of light from the icy trees. 
Tomorrow this will all be gone. 
The limbs will unclench, the ground give, 
and the melt
from branchtip and rooftop tick, tick all day long 
like a rain.
Why did you suffer? Why did you live? 
Things fever out of their forms again, 
and he sees, blurred 
into the list of names on the screen, 
the first golfer of whom there's record, 
King James of the Iron Belt, 
who died in arms on the fields of Flodden. 
Live long enough and all thoughts go one way--
Gladstone, cancer hiving his face, 
turning on that last railway platform to say: 
God bless you all, and this place,
and the land you love;
Mahler, harrowed and honed by the fever
he'd soon die of:
I am hungrier for life than ever.
Even this muted Midwestern woman
purging germs
on tv brings his mother back,
her eyes emptying, her chest ripped apart
by doctors frantically massaging that starved heart,
which feels, he's read somewhere, like a seethe of worms.





Let it go.
Let the silver lie scattered as it is,
dinner unprepared.
Let an hour go by in glimpses
of the old oak iced in light like a chandelier,
titmouse and sparrow,
a cardinal like a cut the tree releases
calling what-cheer, cheer, cheer.
What is the cry she can't recognize?
What time is it now,
a prow
of last light slicing through the deep shadow
of the living room where she lies,
opera on public radio,
while the cat purrs
into the warm crook of limbs it's found,
and the deep-water heartbeat sound inside of sound
is hers,
the kiss still on her lips
as she slips
inside after the last goodbyes,
where her long-dead father from behind his paper mutters
You can bet they call him Jim, 
and her mother, later, even quieter, 
Do you love him?





Let it go.
Let the dead recede
into their names,
effect lie quiet with its cause.
In the end,
what difference does it make,
another day in grains,
walls a gauze
through which fine, faint voices bleed.
It will all come clear tomorrow.
Let the ache
that feels like acid rising in his chest
as he lies down on his bed to rest
from what it seems he's just begun
be only that.
Let it be done,
if not for good then for now,
if for good then with grace somehow,
the screen
flickering with whatever victory or defeat
one can always read about,
evening intensifying inside and out
until there is no pane between,
his eyes becoming heavy, and all he knows
grown light,
as he lets them--Eva?--close.





Happy Trigger
 

Off-season and in 
the burnt forest 
of my nightgown, a feral 
undergrowth that marks 
me as burial site--
to be still enough or 
just enough.

My arms become fat arms: 
hearth. I eat dirt for doubt, 
a secret bleached 
old as lie. I out-want 
like a spindly 
winged monster.
If I were a bug--
were I--then you'd hope 
for reparation, and paint 
more brown into the plot.





The Daughter
 

We said she was a negative image of me because of her lightness.
She's light and also passage, the glory in my cortex.
Daughter, where did you get all that goddess?
Her eyes are Neruda's two dark pools at twilight.
Sometimes she's a stranger in my home because I hadn't imagined her.
Who will her daughter be?
She and I are the gradual ebb of my mother's darkness.
I unfurl the ribbon of her life, and it's a smooth long hallway, doors flung open.
Her surface is a deflection is why.
Harm on her, harm on us all.
Inside her, my grit and timbre, my reckless.





Warming Her Pearls
 

for Judith Radstone
Next to my own skin, her pearls. My mistress 
bids me wear them, warm them, until evening 
when I'll brush her hair. At six, I place them 
round her cool, white throat. All day I think of her,

resting in the Yellow Room, contemplating silk 
or taffeta, which gown tonight? She fans herself 
whilst I work willingly, my slow heat entering 
each pearl. Slack on my neck, her rope.

She's beautiful. I dream about her
in my attic bed; picture her dancing
with tall men, puzzled by my faint, persistent scent
beneath her French perfume, her milky stones.

I dust her shoulders with a rabbit's foot, 
watch the soft blush seep through her skin 
like an indolent sigh. In her looking-glass 
my red lips part as though I want to speak.

Full moon. Her carriage brings her home. I see 
her every movement in my head.... Undressing, 
taking off her jewels, her slim hand reaching 
for the case, slipping naked into bed, the way

she always does.... And I lie here awake, 
knowing the pearls are cooling even now 
in the room where my mistress sleeps. All night 
I feel their absence and I burn.





Elegy
 

What to do with this knowledge that our living is not guaranteed?
Perhaps one day you touch the young branch 
of something beautiful. & it grows & grows 
despite your birthdays & the death certificate, 
& it one day shades the heads of something beautiful 
or makes itself useful to the nest. Walk out 
of your house, then, believing in this. 
Nothing else matters.

All above us is the touching 
of strangers & parrots, 
some of them human, 
some of them not human.

Listen to me. I am telling you
a true thing. This is the only kingdom.
The kingdom of touching;
the touches of the disappearing, things.





St. Elizabeth
 

I run high in my body 
on the road toward sea.

I fall in love. The things 
the wind is telling me.

The yellow sky quiet 
in her quiet dress.

Old birds sending news 
from the reddish hills.

& the one hawk flying 
in the distance overhead.

That hawk is what 
the wind says. In love

with the heaving 
of my peacock chest,

with my lungs, two wings, 
such flying things,

but mine for now, just for now 
as I open my stride

above the good, dirt road, 
fall in love with the mustard

& coriander dust, 
& the far, far mountain

beveled by light, by rain, 
the easy eye of the sun, now,

smoke floating across the hillside 
like a face I knew once very well.

Very well, I fall in love 
with the flowers & the wash

hung like prayer flags, see, 
in red Juanita's yard. In love 

with the earth the color of earth. In 
love with the goats, their bellies & hooves,

& the goat mouths bleating 
as they greet me on the road.

I fall in love. How they wear 
their strange & double-eyes.

How they do not blink 
or laugh at me

or say a thing I understand 
when I ask them in my English,

because they circle around my feet, 
as if they always knew me,

Were you my children once? 
Did I know your names?

Oh, little magics? 
Little children?





The Dream
 

Last night, all night
the dream, the dead
mother, my small sister,
tiny, her mouth
over my shoulder
(screaming) like a knapsack
when she heard the news,
& my brother playing
the stereo. I howled
like the coyotes; myself.
& saw the light outside
below the window, my mother,
young, playing with me
at a rock, in some sunlight
falling over us. I was small.
An old & famous woman
asked her questions:
Who wrote this dream?
I wanted to know.
My brother thought
it was our mother
who wrote it
when she was old.
She did not die, he thought.
But I knew, & called down
to the cotton-head of her then, when
she could not see or hear me.
She would never hear me.
I was not capable of talking
then, yet, & she had died,
after all, & the mother
I call to tell the dream
will not remember, after all
she was not born then, yet,
& needed the first mother to die 
before she could use her name 
& feed her children.





You, If No One Else
 


                                     Listen, you
who transformed your anguish 
into healthy awareness,
put your voice
where your memory is.
You who swallowed
the afternoon dust,
defend everything you understand
with words.
You, if no one else,
will condemn with your tongue
the erosion each disappointment brings.

You, who saw the images
of disgust growing,
will understand how time
devours the destitute;
you, who gave yourself
your own commandments,
know better than anyone
why you turned your back
on your town's toughest limits.

Don't hush,
don't throw away
the most persistent truth,
as our hard-headed brethren
sometimes do.
Remember well
what your life was like: cloudiness,
and slick mud
after a drizzle;
flimsy windows the wind
kept rattling
in winter, and that
unheated slab dwelling
where coldness crawled
up in your clothes.

Tell how you were able to come
to this point, to unbar
History's doors
to see your early years,
your people, the others.
Name the way 
rebellion's calm spirit has served you,
and how you came
to unlearn the lessons
of that teacher,
your land's omnipotent defiler.





The Venturesomeness of Sedition
 


     The unrestricted sun 
had split the day in two, 
and now we went 
on the edge of the afternoon 
like a tableau of bent figures 
made of faded blue duck. 
We went like a wandering 
and stinking, sweating brotherhood, 
pull by pull between 
the leafy cotton plants, 
with the pathetic appearance of arriving 
at the end of the furrow. 
But we always arrived 
in a rush to get there, 
and the sole logic was 
we had to move over 
to the next furrow, 
and no one could stop 
the counterflow down it.

And I, the dusty kid 
left behind in the middle of the field, 
held prisoner in my own slow shadow, 
was right
in not giving in to the absurd pace
of tradition.
So my days burned up
in that captive state
of childhood.

Then, yes,
it was then the venturesomeness 
of sedition overtook me.
Saturdays,
after noon,
the body finally lying down
in the waves of the aluminum bathtub.
And in the liberating rite of the water,
I could shed
the grime and contemplate
the muddy waters of time.
So it was,
with the ablution of the weekly bath,
I exiled myself each time
from what I was.





Heredities (1) Etymology
 

          
          When she was seven, my grandmother suffered from fever and swollen glands. The doctors believed her tonsils were inflamed, that she needed surgery. Instead, she went to a curandera. The curandera divined that a jealous relative had cast a curse on her and, now, her language of kindness was bound to her throat, the unspoken swelling her glands.As a child my grandmother spoke to santitos with a voice like a chestnut: ruddy and warm, seeds dropping from her mouth. The santitos would take her words into themselves, her voice growing within them like grapevines.During the tonsillitis, when the words no longer fell like seeds from her lips, the santito's vineyards of accent and voice grew vapid, dry as a parched mouth. They went to her tongue and asked why silence imprisoned the words of the child, why lumps were present under her chin, why tears drew channels down her cheeks.I asked my grandmother how her tongue replied. After touching my cheek, she told me she had a dream that night: She was within her lungs and she rose like breath through the moist of her throat. She remembered her tonsils swinging before her like fleshy apples, then a hand taking them into a fist, harvesting their sound. She told me her throat opened in two spots like insect eyes and the names of her children came flying through her wounds like peacocks.Patting my thigh, she said, "That is why the name of your mother is Maria, because she is a prayer, a song of praise to the Holy Mother." She told me this, then showed me two scars on her throat--tiny scars, like two eyelids stitched closed.

Water Poppies Open as the Mouth
 

The Body as Nature, HistoryAll motivations intermingle as the core of history, the internal becomes external... all as parts of the body.--maurice merleau-ponty
i.               the positing of space, corporeal history


medium of my body

bent to narrow rivers,


         touching of the touch
                           commits


totem to shape:

           jasmine buds,

    water poppies            open as the mouth.


                       Propolis and juniper oil

             resinous   viscera
             embowered in trees,

              life wholly aware of itself
              unbound and unsealed.

four wings fastened      by a row of resolutions

Day to Start on the Floorboards, Rain to the South, Any View a Machine
 

Negative, chalk (how I first saw
your sign) reads like smoke signals.
Has an extensive collection of glasses.
On this side of the earth, no sides:
where we practice our marksmanship,
like soldiers in the city square, on corpses,
no matter many beetles in the grass.
Find it.
Obstinately refuse to grasp.
The spades, today valiantly shouldered,
submerge in the unprofitable patch.
Beetles are back-up plan zero,
the if I were you thing inside
the water container,
which is too blind to trust with the wheel,
to leave alone, even if in for the eve.
The wounds we gave ourselves
have just begun us,
irreligious, and are the deterrents,
as escarpments, of else but warlike heads.

Go get your own aquarium, each fin becoming
coiled beneath the bus, cruising along.
There you'll find the nasal passage.
Ask the operator for extreme commitment
from the lamp shade
to the table, all reflected in the unwashed window.

Table of omens. Flotation devices murmured 
and murdered.
The shutters of thunder are forlorn 
like the song of the sound of my own voice: a different tattooed country. 
Nationalism.
At the rally, everybody's grin gives away two bags. 
All are watered, her body slipping 
out from under the dripping awning, effortlessly.





Many Jasons
 

He strolled from the hill sound of sacred scales.
A sheet on his head (arrested for something),
they surrounded him,
Hera speaking through his mouth
kept the lid on his appeal to Caeneus the Lapith,
who had been a woman--
moon spread on the all edge of standing water,
the bleachers where they left the bodies.

That was the sedgy day, invisible contagions
stretching from our roof
on which the fresh trails of spilled pink...
to the aquatic plaza, one sandal at a time
and the bottom of the room beguiled us,
below the carpet covered with sand,
where they used to run
down the slums. Athena's oak prow, oracular,
from the grove at Dodona:
the team started the troika.

Many leave. One went in.
Many Jasons.
At some point Orpheus was on
that upside-down boat beneath the bridge,
but now, through its hull
(some planks missing), the ancestral bricks shimmer.
Rare is their tide.





Protest in Philippines
 

He is for a long time bleating the embassy collection: 
(water-resistant cot,
a resurgent stretch of storefronts to dive into, 
compadre, col legno, funding the new permits, pleasing 
room, murderous rain.

Near-spring night, stars on flat blackboards, essay estate 
questions passed person to person. 
The lottery window 
I turn red past, 
hyacinth-lanced dawn.

In green tree talk
the transcriber dons a dark robe, a mirror.

The notebook discovered
the parting sun, magnificent trough, blind
hair on a head
of state, streak-woods
in the winding road atlas--stranded shore.

Pose in flight
covered by weeds, claw hair-rocks,
Pullulation. Push-up. Push-up.
Pestilentia reeds announce--trebly isolated, a closed trio,
the trinity trick-fucked--in a.





Wilderness
 

You are the man
You are my other country
and I find it hard going

You are the prickly pear
You are the sudden violent storm

the torrent to raise the river 
to float the wounded doe





Foreclosure
 

Tell em to take my bare walls down 
my cement abutments 
their parties thereof 
and clause of claws

Leave me the land 
Scratch out: the land

May prose and property both die out 
and leave me peace





Handling Destiny: Tools of the Trade
 

1.
They make such uncomfortable clank
child of earth
child of fire
These are your tools of the trade
difficult when you use them

A large trunk with children darting 
in all directions 
appears slippery in its sheen 
adorned with thorns

There comes a day in a man's life
when the machete he was given early on
can cut into small inheritances
place them in a large calabash
set them aflame
spill the ashes behind him
to cover his old footsteps
the one's he stepped over & over
trodden tongue lashing
the atlas of littered women
over & over every few years

2.
Remember at the end of seven days
a gift of hoe & machete
used at times by your grandfather
then again by his son
At the end of the seven days
remember the whipping song
as you with machete & hoe in hand 
wrote on the earth diagrams 
signatures that would sprout shelter 
words won't lead you to obstacle's house

Remember
when she had a dimpled hammock on each thigh
marks from birth from years lying
behind
diagrams written on her history





Song of Chameleon
 

I have sinned in front of mirrors
But I'll say this
in my defense--
Too scared to face my indecency
the voice with a larynx
big as mangoes too--
I took your voice burnt with tabaco
They say you must first imitate
before your tongue
jagged in novice
can ripen a word
shape it along color
before words being enough
change what's before you

Now
squeezing the bandages of injured history
when they hid your clothing
from the riverbank
slings of leather like slices
stretched along your skin
in the mood of talking drum
you remember only when they
tighten
speak from tension after all

It's time for your dissertation 
mirrored cool one more color 
on the chameleon's back 
Time to play forgive the rainbow 
your song of imperfection





The River of Girls
 

i.m. India's missing girls
This is not really myth or secret.
This murmur in the mouth 
of the mountain where the sound
of rain is born. This surging
past pilgrim town and village well.
This coin-thin vagina
and acid stain of bone.
This doctor with his rusty tools,
this street cleaner, this mother
laying down the bloody offerings
of birth. This is not the cry
of a beginning, or a river
buried in the bowels of the earth.
This is the sound of ten million girls
singing of a time in the universe
when they were born with tigers
breathing between their thighs;
when they set out for battle
with all three eyes on fire,
their golden breasts held high
like weapons to the sky.





The Immigrant's Song
 

Let us not speak of those days 
when coffee beans filled the morning 
with hope, when our mothers' headscarves 
hung like white flags on washing lines. 
Let us not speak of the long arms of sky 
that used to cradle us at dusk. 
And the baobabs--let us not trace 
the shape of their leaves in our dreams, 
or yearn for the noise of those nameless birds 
that sang and died in the church's eaves. 
Let us not speak of men, 
stolen from their beds at night. 
Let us not say the word
                                            disappeared.
Let us not remember the first smell of rain. 
Instead, let us speak of our lives now--
the gates and bridges and stores.
And when we break bread
in cafs and at kitchen tables
with our new brothers,
let us not burden them with stories
of war or abandonment.
Let us not name our old friends
who are unravelling like fairy tales
in the forests of the dead.
Naming them will not bring them back.
Let us stay here, and wait for the future
to arrive, for grandchildren to speak
in forked tongues about the country
we once came from.
Tell us about it, they might ask.
And you might consider telling them 
of the sky and the coffee beans, 
the small white houses and dusty streets. 
You might set your memory afloat 
like a paper boat down a river. 
You might pray that the paper 
whispers your story to the water, 
that the water sings it to the trees, 
that the trees howl and howl 
it to the leaves. If you keep still 
and do not speak, you might hear 
your whole life fill the world 
until the wind is the only word.





Lament I
 

When I see the houses in this city, 
the electric gates and uniformed men 
employed to guard the riches of the rich, 
the gilded columns and gardens, 
the boats on water, I wonder, 
how to describe my home to you: 
the short, mud walls, 
the whispering roof, the veranda 
on which my whole family 
used to spread sheets and sleep.

The year I came to find work in the city, 
my wife painted our house white 
so it would be brighter than the neighbours'. 
I beat her for her foolishness. 
The children are hungry, I said, 
the cow is old,
the money collector is after my blood, 
and you steal like a magpie--
half a month's wage--to decorate 
your nest like a shiny jewel?

The monsoon finally arrived the year I left, 
dripped through the thatch, 
peeled paint off the walls. 
The wells grew full and overflowed. 
The farmers rejoiced in the fields. 
My son sat with his mouth open 
catching drops of water like a frog. 
My wife clung to the walls and wept.

When I fall asleep on the pavements
in this city, I try to imagine my wife's skin
against mine, the kohl in her eyes,
the white walls, the whole village sky
bearing down upon us
with all the weight of the stars.
I think of returning to that life,
but mostly I try to remember
how the world was once.
I want to open my mouth like my son,
and swallow things whole--
feel water filling all the voids,
until I am shaped back into existence.





1 January 1965
 

The Wise Men will unlearn your name.
Above your head no star will flame.
One weary sound will be the same--
the hoarse roar of the gale.
The shadows fall from your tired eyes
as your lone bedside candle dies,
for here the calendar breeds nights
till stores of candles fail.

What prompts this melancholy key?
A long familiar melody.
It sounds again. So let it be.
Let it sound from this night.
Let it sound in my hour of  death--
as gratefulness of eyes and lips
for that which sometimes makes us lift
our gaze to the far sky.

You glare in silence at the wall.
Your stocking gapes: no gifts at all.
It's clear that you are now too old
to trust in good Saint Nick;
that it's too late for miracles.
--But suddenly, lifting your eyes
to heaven's light, you realize:
your life is a sheer gift.





from the wave, the way
 

In green water I saw your eye and in it I saw that Arabian palace 
filled with birds and broken glass.
                                                                  I copy an address into my right hand 
and fill myself with memories of psalms. 
A green fish emerges from seaweed as seaweed from a wave
                                                                  that rises like the wailing wall.

My sun-baked body at the edge,
wind in my lungs, its whistle,
my torn world, my grief,
my soggy passport, my shell with no pearl,
you lift them, delicate cloud, into a liquid world.

Last night I dreamed of my father's flabby body and of my blue 
resolve to run away, to find a way, I dreamed of your eye
                                                            and for an instant I found the vertex of the road, 
the imaginary line that falls across the earth:
               that meridian where the sun on a tiger's back meets the shade at its belly.

Waking up, we are swallowed by wakefulness.
The house swallows us in its terrible thirst. The routine of taking our children
to school swallows us
                                                   and so does the if only I could.

There was something to that dream. You know it. A direction. A way.
                                                                   A forest as green as you and your roots.

Give me your premonitions, give me your book, give me your prodigious memory, 
give me the blue gaze from your dark eye, give me the devotion of your sleeping birds.

Sometimes the way is a fire 
through which the circus tiger
                                                           leaps, a perfect circle
                                                                           returning to me with its stripes intact 
and with the endless continuity of this ineluctably feral world.





Eye of Heaven
 

On paunchy green hills
in some province of China, you are the one I speak to.
Someone buys a perfume, recalling
that the bones of his beloved are small.
When he writes the note, when he wraps
the little bottle, he takes that into account. So do I.

The subtlest trace of mind against your shoulders
is your true skin. And I press myself to you.
I hear the steady rhythm of your typing, the key
of a borrowed pulse. But what difference does it make, that it is given?
For a while it is mine to use, then your turn, but the pulse originates
in the Child of Heaven who has hearts to spare.

Some day you'll sink yourself into a frozen
lake where paper ships were torched with the
names of the missing. Some dead, some vanished.
The flames consume all but
the wisp of smoke on which a single word rises
and water licks at the rest. So we are freed from a weight.
Perennially your hills are filled with birds.
Green hills, the deep mosses around your temples.
They, the birds, are your faithful ones.
As I am, naturally.
Faithful to a world unknown,
a world for us alone, paper-thin, and too fragile to speak of.





Parenthesis
 

Nothing's in the nest. No needles. No newborn ravens.
Maybe something like night in the deep hollow,
an eggshell planet, cracked in the middle, an empty bowl of soup.
Nothing's in the nest. No thread. No webs of words.
Maybe something like my navel, the eclipse of a magnifying glass.
A slice, mute with regard to its empty depths.
In the nest, nothing. The web unwoven. Dismembered.
In the space, something, yes. A piece of cloth. Sounding like flags
taking wing, a worm in its beak and suddenly, eyes, my eyes
which, cutting across the empty air, direct themselves at something noiseless over there.





All My Activities Are Feeding Activities
 

Dear Commissioner 
here are my directive accounts 
of genitals and cash 
now bring me your goods

We don't live among fowlers 
Not all poisonous juices are burning 
or bitter nor is everything now 
which is burning and bitter poisonous

Air is removed from the workspace 
and dispersed into the multiverse 
It's very strict metadata 
You get echoes and dropouts

For the most part 
Juliet is gaseous now 
as a caucasian she gets it 
on the head and face and I move 
from hypocrisy to cynicism

Cristal all over the face and neck 
concrete and glinting 
audible light on jumbotron
marmalade for miles 
That good wood kept calling my name 
Behavior meet Behavior, Behavior 
meat all the social organs





The Help I Need Is Not Available Here
 

I need help with long term hope 
I need help with the dawn 
of war and achieving 
my new year's resolutions

This praise song 
and the problem of pornography 
structures this praise song 
as speaking placement

I need help moving my chickens
I need help with girl problem
my dog, like, keeps marking the wrong areas?

and my breasts
this most pressing issue
like choosing between best friends
a distance problem involving constant
acceleration and tethering glitches

The party's all "descendant selectors, please!" 
and me I'm in my handspring visor 
and my bird plucking problem

I need help with a bat script for parsing 
I need help with pricing with naming this 
praise song I said 
I seriously need help with the whole set up ASAP!

so it's
40.08 /100.09 (grams of molecular mass of calcium carbonate) =
moles of calcium

then
(moles of Calcium x .1973ml (convert grams to ml)) / 0.05

I got 1.580 ml 
is that right?





A Practice Known as Churning
 

I went to the city some days 
to learn my master's pleasure 
& laid fort at the farthest place 
where hedges are highest 
& terror of the obvious 
is a rosary of similitude

Did you see some of the nudging? 
How did you feel about the nudging?

Boats by water and wagons by land 
in active assistance in perpetuating 
fraudulent froth & hence 
with haste I've seen 
their mulchy tongues 
suck up every animate aim 
sweeping excess into piles

the reserves and neocons 
administrators and representatives

the preachers and deputies 
and yahoos and spodies 
In the evenings they come down 
from their operational sectors 
to kiss the children

what terror is in them 
to keep the sugar boiling 
to restrain the wanderings 
as fragile and fictitious

Did you see the tent on a stick?
Did you see the architecture of gathering?

I go to the city some days 
to gather what's left of scrubgrass 
There in the alley we converse 
Idris his love of fresh skim 
Ted his disdain for women 
their lack of banking 
Terrence and Will their concern 
for purity of pussy

power precedes them 
sap-drenched 
& parceled 
across the land

I go to the city some days I receive a letter
Dear Comrades
don't get it twisted
never lick the hand that lashes you
use beef when you run out of oakum





Essay
 

after Bernadette Mayer
I guess it's too late to live on the farm

I guess it's too late to enter the darkened room in which a single light 
illuminated the artist stripped from the waist down, smeared with 
blood, stretched and bound to the table

I guess it's too late to inhabit a glass-fronted, white, box-like room, 
dressed in white, against which the menstrual blood was visible

I guess it's too late to start farming

I guess it's too late to start struggling to remain standing in a 
transparent plastic cubicle filled with wet clay, repeatedly slipping and 
falling

I guess it's too late to buy 60,000 acres in Marfa

I guess it's too late to begin appearing on the subway in stinking 
clothes during rush hour with balloons attached to her ears, nose, hair 
and teeth

I guess we'll never have an orgiastic Happening

I guess we're too old to carry out maintenance activities in public 
spaces, during public hours

I guess we couldn't afford to simulate masturbation while President 
Josip Broz Tito's motorcade drove by below

I guess we're not suited to "I am awake in the place where women die"

I guess we'll never have a self-inflicted wound in front of an audience now

I guess entering a sex cinema dressed in a black shirt, jeans with the 
crotch removed, and a machine gun slung over her shoulder is not in 
the cards now

I guess Clive wouldn't make a good photographic montage in which 
their male and female faces became almost indistinguishable

I guess I can't expect we'll ever have a selection of photographs derived 
from images produced by the beauty industry now

I guess I'll have to give up all my dreams of being seen, clothed and 
unclothed, being systematically measured by two male 'researchers' 
who record her measurements on a chart and compare them with a set 
of 'normal' measurements

I guess I'll never be waiting for my body to break down, to get ugly

We couldn't get tied together by our hair anyways though Allen 
Ginsberg got one late in life

Maybe someday I'll have the foreshortened barrel of a gun pointing 
toward the viewer

I guess joining our hands around the base's perimeter fence into which 
they weave strands of wool is really out

Feeding the pigs and the chickens, walking between miles of rows of crops

I guess examining women's working conditions is just too difficult

We'll never have a, never-really-a-collective, a group of women who 
came together to work on a public mural

Too much work and still to be poets

Who are the simultaneously-the-beneficiary-of-our-cultural-heritage-
and-a-victim-of-it-poets

Was there ever a poet who had a self-sufficient loss of certainty

Flannery O'Connor raised peacocks

And Wendell Berry has raised large-scale spirals of rusted industrial 
materials in incongruous natural and commercial spaces

Faulkner may have spent three days in a gallery with a coyote, a little

And Robert Frost asked a friend to shoot him at close range with a .22 
caliber rifle

And someone told me Samuel Beckett lay hidden under a gallery-wide 
ramp, masturbating while vocalizing into a loudspeaker his fantasies 
about the visitors walking above him

Very few poets are really going to the library carrying a concealed tape 
recording of loud belches

If William Carlos Williams could be a doctor and Charlie Vermont too, 
If Yves Klein could be an artist, and Jackson Pollock too,

Why not a poet who was also dying of lymphoma and making a series of 
life size photographs, self-portrait watercolors, medical object-sculptures 
and collages made with the hair she lost during chemotherapy

Of course there was Brook Farm
And Virgil raised bees
Perhaps some poets of the past were overseers of the meticulous
chronicle of the feeding and
                    excretory cycles of her son during the first six months of his life 
I guess poets tend to live more momentarily 
Than life in her body as the object of her own sculpting activity would allow 
You could never leave the structures made of wood, rope and concrete 
blocks assembled to form
                    stocks and racks, to give a reading 
Or to go to a lecture by Emerson in Concord 
I don't want to be continuously scrubbing the flesh off of cow bones 
with a cleaning brush but
                    my mother was right 
I should never have tried to rise out of the proletariat 
Unless I can convince myself as Satan argues with Eve 
That we are among a proletariat of poets of all the classes 
Each ill-paid and surviving on nothing 
Or on as little as one needs to survive 
Steadfast as any person's glottis, photographed with a laryngoscope, 
speaking the following
                    words: "The power of language continues to show its trace for 
a long time after silence"
                    and fixed as the stars 
Tenants of a vision we rent out endlessly





Black Swan
 


After the second conference, I would be cast in the role of a young dancer with a prestigious New York City ballet company. I would be cast in the role of the mother, a former dancer now amateur artist, whose career ended at 28 when she became pregnant. I would be cast in the role of the exotic beauty who is more in touch with her sensuality. I would be cast in the role of the director, a cruel and demanding genius who would sleep with the ingenue. I would be cast in the role of someone selected to compete for the part alongside several other dancers. I would be cast in the role of someone who bites the director, and/or doesn't get along with the other dancers. I would be cast in the role of the aging principal dancer. My rigid technique would make me the ideal choice, but I would also lack the passion required by this role.I would practice all the time. I would become increasingly paranoid. I would get drunk and yell, with dark makeup all around my eyes. I would barricade myself in my room. I would become increasingly critical. I would tell her how pretty she is, and carefully pull mittens over her hands before bed so that she does not hurt herself. I would sing her a lullaby. I would see my own image everywhere. I would be annoyed with her. I would paint picture after picture of the person I loved and hated. I would get a rash. I would get into an accident. I would eat the cake offered to me, although I did not want it. I would injure myself. I would hallucinate that I am having sex with my friend, and during this scene there would be a ripping, chewing sound. The scene is obviously misogynist. But it felt so real. I would peel skin away from my fingernails in long strips. It would happen in the bathroom. My friend would perform my role in my absence. I would perform my friend's role in her absence. I would sleep with the director. I would wish to sleep with the director. I would be left alone in the building.I would betray my friend. My friend would betray me. I would feel the envy and aggression of others keenly. I would feel envious and aggressive towards others. I would seem rather childish. I would be rigid and controlling. I would pass out. I would scratch my back until it bled, and wear clothing designed to cover these scratches. I would not be part of the group. I would discover her in my room, wearing my costume, I would congratulate her, kiss her, shove her into the mirror and hide her body. Only then would I notice my own wound. Crying as I watched her performance.

To the Censorious Ones
 

(Jesse Helms & others...)
I'm coming up out of the tomb, Men of War
Just when you thought you had me down, in place, hidden
I'm coming up now
Can you feel the ground rumble under your feet?
It's breaking apart, it's turning over, it's pushing up
It's thrusting into your point of view, your private property
O Men of War, Censorious Ones!
get ready big boys get ready
I'm coming up now
I'm coming up with all that was hidden
Get ready, Big Boys, get ready
I'm coming up with all you wanted buried,
All the hermetic texts with stories in them of hot & dangerous women
Women with lascivious tongues, sharp eyes & claws
I've been working out, my muscles are strong
I'm pushing up the earth with all you try to censor
All the iconoclasm & bravado you scorn
All the taunts against your banner & salute
I'm coming up from Hell with all you ever suppressed
All the dark fantasies, all the dregs are coming back
I'm leading them back up now
They're going to bark & scoff & rage & bite
I'm opening the box
boo!





Early Poem
 

          
          The first sentence is a sentence about writing. The second sentence tells you it's alright to lose interest. You might be one of those people who sits back in his or her chair without interest, and this would have been the third sentence you would have read. The fourth sentence, what does that say, that says something about how I genuinely feel, even if it no longer matters how I genuinely feel, that has not even become the topic of another book. The fifth sentence says that that was left by the wayside because it was such a variable thing. That's what the sixth sentence said, and says, that it sits there still, varying, changing its colors, etc., the army of ancient Rome marches by, they think it is some sort of tomb and display their eagle insignia. The seventh sentence ill conceals its surprise that I should have tried to make it all look so far away. The eight sentence is therefore a meditation on something close at hand. The ninth sentence is a means of approach. In the tenth sentence I discover I am staring at a list of things I have done written in blue pencil on brown paper. In the eleventh sentence I draw a one-eyed duck on the paper beside the list. In the twelfth sentence I circle one of the numbers on the list and I start to feel nervous. In the thirteenth sentence I realize I have chosen something. In the fourteenth sentence I decide I will read my choice aloud. In the fifteenth sentence I stall by saying the words "I don't have a choice." In the sixteenth sentence I stall again by thinking about the obelisk on the Upper East Side in Central Park and how it is called "Cleopatra's Needle," and how around the base of the "needle" there are metal supports in the shape of crustaceans, I think they are crabs in fact but sometimes that word is slightly obscene so I consider not writing it. In the seventeenth sentence I think some more about the kinds of joke that employ that word and whether it is worth thinking about such jokes, as it does alter the genre of what you are writing if such things are allowed to be thought as a part of it. The lawns of the park were very green in summer, and it is early summer right now, right as I think to think this, and this is the first time I have lived in New York City for a full year in ten years, this is what I tell as the nineteenth sentence. In the twentieth sentence I recall the list and resolve again to look at it. In the twentifirst sentence I misspell twenty-first with two "i"s. In the twenty-second sentence I look down at the list, I have circled no. 18759351 on the list. In the twentisecond sentence I misspell twenty-second using an "i" again. In the twenty-third sentence I read what is written next to no. 18759351, it says, "He was sitting on a bench...," but at this moment a breeze enters in through the open window, lifting the page and you begin reading another line, the words, "And you hand in the application and it takes three months and...." In the twenty-fourth sentence you can see me set the page down as another person walks through the door. I turn off the electronic typewriter and scroll out the page and place it facedown on the desk and I cover it with a notebook you weren't aware was also there on the desk. Now you can see it, it is almost the exact same color as the surface of the desk and now you can see it. These were the twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth sentences, respectively, it is the lot of the twenty-seventh sentence to have to announce that. In the twenty-eighth sentence a cloud passes over the apartment on its way into space. In the twenty-ninth sentence, I think, next year this will be the number of my age. The thirtieth sentence is all about the speed at which time is passing. In the thirty-first sentence I won't care anymore, I'll see that reality only accrues to itself and does not have to mean something. In the thirty-second sentence I want you to agree with me. Things happen by chance, and what Montaigne pleads with us to believe, in an essay, is that fortune makes herself known in the act of reading, there is much that I could not have intended which is yet here, I forget exactly how this goes, this being the thirty-third sentence. I sit down beside myself in the thirty-fourth sentence and say to myself, smiling, even small numbers are big. This is the working of time, the thirty-fifth sentence joins in saying this, too, once one has crossed the years their number does not matter. But what I was trying to get across was, I think in sentence thirty-six, that maybe you could not have done things earlier, maybe it just was not possible in those days for whichever reasons. You spend the thirty-seventh sentence attempting to spell those reasons out. You fall asleep, and in the thirty-eighth sentence you dream about a room. The room is a classroom in which you are alone, says sentence number thirty-nine, the windows have been left open and a sentence can be read on the blackboard. In the fortieth sentence you have to force yourself to go on. Descartes's dream, you remember, in sentence forty-one, provided a quote supposedly from Ausonius. This is the forty-second sentence, Est et non. Then I think it is safe to say that something begins to happen, sentence forty-three tells us. Sentence forty-four says that you should forgive. Sentence forty-five says that you remember this number as having been particularly beautiful when worn by your mother. Sentence forty-six says the figures move away. Sentence forty-seven is a sentence about what loneliness names itself in the paradoxical presence of others. Sentence forty-eight says it has a name. Sentence forty-nine says that I cannot remember this name. Sentence fifty says that I go back and try and live there in that moment when I was saying the name. I say, "Happiness." This was sentence fifty-one. That was sentence fifty-two. Sentence fifty-four is a sentence about how there is too much of so many things, there is too much of all the words, but the world runs on underneath them and I keep on imagining how you could have heard me, how you could not have heard me. Sentence fifty-five is a sentence about picking up the phone. Sentence fifty-six is a sentence about picking up a small cellular phone but not using it and willing the phone to ring on its own. The gray cotton of the sweatshirt I wear is a warm cotton in sentence fifty-seven. In sentence fifty-eight I decide to keep on saying the numbers. In sentence fifty-nine I hold the page up to the light and see the type on the other side show through, In sentence sixty you start to believe me. In sentence sixty-one I start to go back to the beginning. I wonder if I should worry. The world is full of pauses, the world is full with continuations, says sentence sixty-three. I let sentence sixty-four go. In sentence sixty-five it occurs to me that I concern myself here with something that ought not to be touched. Sentence sixty-six is a guess that this is the mystery of counting, that it goes on and means itself without having a meaning. I count the people in the distance I can see from my window in sentence sixty-seven. In sentence sixty-eight the breeze has a sweet smell. In sentence sixty-nine, it turns the last week of May in the year 2008. Sentence seventy concerns the lack of what I wanted, in my own mind, to be saying. In sentence seventy-one I'm going so far as to ask you if you can see this, how much of what I thought lay before me remained in the distance. In sentence seventy-two there is a hill there. In sentence seventy-three we see flowers open their faces and then black snakes slide down the face of the hill. In sentence seventy-four there is still nothing. In sentence seventy-five the moon changes place with the sun. In sentence seventy-six this takes place again, only now it is day. In sentence seventy-seven it is still day. In sentence seventy-eight it is still day. Why do you think about tragedy, sentence seventy-nine wants to know, since it is the least likely thing to happen. Sentence eighty will eventually come to me and want to know what I am doing with myself. Sentence eighty-one reminds me to expect this question. In sentence eighty-two something changes. I stay up two nights running and in the morning the sidewalk seems to rise up and meet my feet underneath my feet. Sentence eighty-four contains the question, didn't you already know that this would start to happen. Sentence eighty-five agrees. When I start to read sentence eighty-six I discover it contains the words, It is also true that what you said could be. For this reason, sentence eighty-seven is a sentence about why there are certainly points of correspondence between what we expect to be the case and what is. Sentence eighty-eight proclaims it feels the excitement and not the work. Sentence eighty-nine takes action without saying anything first. In sentence ninety I cover my eyes. In sentence ninety-one I uncover my eyes so that I can look again. In sentence ninety-two I cover them again. Now I am speaking to you. Now I am speaking to you. Say the words after me just as I say them. What it means to live is the subject of sentence ninety-six. You are moving out of earshot now. We are not going to miss each other. You have an excellent memory. Please never forget I was the one who told you that
        




Two Hear Cicadas
 

BEEF: We are here between trees, 
with the tempo of a rosary being strung 
in a queue of escalating beads--

BEEF: It's not quite the count in
the countinghouse of my chest
but the heart does make an awful attempt

BEEF: a tee and a circle wherever it may 
be there was music coming on

BEEF: which though machinery-like 
moves not in cogs, and never 
springs, but waves through

BEEF: like wired applause for antic backstage 
buds on the pre-comeuppance buzz; but it 
fades

BEEF: but only after the chorus has pulsed

BEEF: it drops off with sudden decision, like fountain 
water gone dross

BEEF: or it reaches the furthest point
the branch turns from us, and is for some arc
fully quiet...

BEEF: until the roulette snaps its jaw and the choir's 
circuit opens to one

BEEF: like a pigeon unhinged, its wings in sudden 
white-rumped ascent

BEEF: unopposed by iridescence

BEEF: unopposed by iridescence





Honey/Manila Portfolio
 

This is not a book. Otherwise, by now 
We would love each other. 
You would not put me first, 
Out of a kind habit, under your coat 
And clutch--as a sudden rain 
Spate down. For I've seen it done 
For the hardly known.

No, you would know with a book you love: 
How nothing held your eyes 
The way the words did, with archer-focus: 
How each arrow heading toward you 
Was slowed by the dripping beehive 
On its spike--

Nothing else could hold what you are 
Still: I pressed your heart in speech and saw 
What a musical you let rush, nothing 
Else in the eyes. This is not a book, 
But a streak--
Words cross reins-- 
The brow splits, veins careen.





Memory
 

Over the night a bull
Whispers into a coal

:Unmeant in the stall to sit and plate,
But sixth, with all the senses,
To consume--
Incorporate-- those signal
Impressions which are (we know) its fate:

In explosions, in hard strides,
His coattails fly; to bits, to friends
Craven and brave.

Sadness undulates at their back.

His lilt's a cotillion of flies.

But how he charges, he commits!

Each to the next.

It seems unfair, a target lies
Between its shoulder blades.
And another whisps right back:
A drop of blood would pin back his wild hair
Which wanders as it wills
A sunset like acupuncture





Brasil
 

Left a hole on fire agony or was it the sun
on the banks and near duets?
Eagles with the white wine of the sun
clink and spill, tall
grass over head and heels
. . . Space of hell: shy, inscribed already
but alone-- I think I can be that

again, a new hole in the ongoing flute.
In a leap, the country glows-- to hone
the fate that wonder exacts,
to go netted through that much,
so heavy as paperweights angels land
square on chaparral nerves.
And since names must give in spades,
out of sorts like these, your reactions
may swell great fountain lips--
a promise that a wish will purge
or pennies caravan the safe
return hearts cross.





Make a Law So That the Spine Remembers Wings
 

So that the truant boy may go steady with the State,
So that in his spine a memory of wings
Will make his shoulders tense & bend
Like a thing already flown
When the bracelets of another school of love
Are fastened to his wrists,
Make a law that doesn't have to wait
Long until someone comes along to break it.

So that in jail he will have the time to read
How the king was beheaded & the hawk that rode
The king's wrist died of a common cold,
And learn that chivalry persists,
And what first felt like an insult to the flesh
Was the blank o' of love.
Put the fun back into punishment.
Make a law that loves the one who breaks it.

So that no empty court will make a judge recall
Ice fishing on some overcast bay,
Shivering in the cold beside his father, it ought
To be an interesting law,
The kind of thing that no one can obey,
A law that whispers "Break me.
Let the crows roost & caw.
A good judge is an example to us all.

So that the patrolman can still whistle
"The Yellow Rose of Texas through his teeth
And even show some faint gesture of respect
While he cuffs the suspect,
Not ungently, & says things like ok,
That's it, relax,
It'll go better for you if you don't resist,
Lean back just a little, against me. 





Ocean Park #17, 1968: Homage to Diebenkorn
 

What I remember is a carhop on Pico hurrying
Toward a blue Chevy,

A crucifix dangling from its rearview mirror
That jiggled as the driver brushed

A revolver against it, in passing, before tucking it
Behind his back & beginning to joke with her.

What I remember
Is the smooth arc the gun made & the way

Jesus shimmied to the rhythm.






Someday I'll go back to the place depicted
By the painting, boarded over by the layers of paint

And abandoned,

And beneath the pastel yellows I'll find
The Bayside Motel & the little room

With the thin, rumpled coverlet,

And sit down, drinking nothing but the night air
By the window, & wait for her to finish

Dressing, one earring, then another,

And wait until the objects in the room take back
Their shapes in the dawn,

And wait until

Each rumpled crease in the sheets & pillowcase
Is as clear as a gift again, & wait--

At a certain moment, that room, then all the rooms
Of the empty Bayside,

Will turn completely into light.






I place a cup on the sill & listen for the faint
Tock of china on wood, &...

That moment of light is already this one--
Sweet, fickle, oblivious, & gone:

My hand hurrying across the page to get there
On time, that place

Of undoing--






Where the shriek of the carhop's laugh,
And the complete faith of the martyr, as he spins & shimmies in the light,

And the inextricable candor of doubt by which Diebenkorn,
One afternoon, made his presence known

In the yellow pastels, then wiped his knuckles with a rag--

             Are one--are the salt, the nowhere & the cold--

The entwined limbs of lovers & the cold wave's sprawl.





Whethering
 

The rain is haunted;
I had forgotten.
My children are two hours abed
And yet I rise
Hearing behind the typing of the rain,

Its abacus and digits,
A voice calling me again,
Softer, clearer.
The kids lie buried under duvets, sound
Asleep. It isn't them I hear, it's

Something formless that fidgets
Beyond the window's benighted mirror,
Where a negative develops, where reflection
Holds up a glass of spirits.
White noise

Precipitates.
Rain is a kind of recollection.
Much has been shed,
Hissing indignantly into the ground.
It is the listening

Belates,
Haunted by these fingertaps and sighs
Behind the beaded-curtain glistening,
As though by choices that we didn't make and never wanted,
As though by the dead and misbegotten.





Boardinghouse with No Visible Address
 

So, I thought,
as the door was unlocked 
and the landlord disappeared (no,
he actually disappeared)
and I got to examine the room 
unobserved. There
it stood
in its gray corner:
the narrow bed, sheets
the color of old aspirin.
Maybe all this had occurred
somewhere inside me
already, or
was just about to.
Is there a choice?
Is there 
even a difference? Familiar,
familiar but not
yet remembered...
The small narrow bed.
I had often wondered
where I would find it, and
what it would look like.
Don't you?
It was so awful
I couldn't speak. Then
maybe you ought to lie down for a minute, I heard myself
thinking. I mean
if you are having that much trouble
functioning. And when
was the last time
with genuine sorrow
and longing to change
you got on your knees?
I could get some work done
here, I shrugged;
I had done it before.
I would work without cease.
Oh, I would stay awake
if only from horror
at the thought of waking
up here. Ma,
a voice spoke from the darkness
in the back seat where
a long thin man lay,
arms crossed
on his chest,
while they cruised slowly up and down
straining to make out the numbers
over unlighted doors,
the midnight doctor's;
in his hurt mind
he was already merging
with a black Mississippi
of mercy, the sweat pouring off him
as though he'd been doused
with a bucket of ice water
as he lay sleeping. "I saw the light,
they kept screaming. "Do
I saw the light!
Ma--there ain't no light
I don't see no light.



--Dayton, Ohio





The Break
 

Then he stopped
dead on the sidewalk
astounded
to overhear himself
say quite distinctly
I quit,
in his own words--
be glad you weren't there.
Pandemonium
in the cerebral
combs, unprecedented
mass desertions, solar
flare-ups.
It said
itself
actually;
the lips moved 
not, no thought was
taken. With massive finality
and apropos of absolutely
nothing it came,
a cruel blessing,
the ultimate low
note of an organ
made of ice or a passing
night train
of black holes. He
kept lying there--
what else was he
supposed to do?--with watch
pressed to one ear, emitting
a molecular hum. (Ever wonder
how they fit a whole
hive inside one
of them?) Minute
hand starting to disappear,
such was its speed
by now; on his face
an expression
of guarded rapture.
No one could do a thing
for him now. They'd stop,
gaze down
in disgust
and concern, a moment before
they hurried on or,
without looking,
adroitly moved
around him, the way you would
dog shit. Invariably
in such cases there is a line
that no one crosses.
You know what
I'm getting at. Mainly
everyone just stands around
and waits for the arrival
of the ambulance; the mind simply stops, nothing,
silence. Then
the most silver,
the tiniest
sound
of a fracture
like that of an ice cube
dropped in vodka
can be heard
around the world;
people freeze
at whatever they're doing, and bow
their minds, those persistent
illusions in pain,
or shame. But all
is soon forgotten,
the sunlight appears
all at once like
a great shadow
and floats with the gas-like hush
throughout the twelve spokes,
the brilliant yellow darkness
of the twelve candlelit
hallways forever
abandoned, forever
emanating out from
the one central
hexagonal chamber
so much larger than all
the rest, in which
the young queen lies
dreaming, amazed,
eyes open wide
inside
her lead-lined matchbox
rocking bed,
tits up
dead, immovable
sow, maggot
in color.





Akechis Wife
 


On one occasion Ygen of Ise Province was offering to share, for a night or two, the comforts of his home with me when a distant, bemused expression came over his face as though at the recollection of a joke told him earlier that day; then, to a degree I would not have thought possible in one whose normal manner was so formal, that studiedly dour professorial expression gave way for an instant to one that positively beamed, illuminated from within by the sound of a beloved voice. So worn out, not even sure I was on the right road, I forgot myself awhile watching in weary amazement as his wife came and went, the two of them giving the impression of having long perfected some grave and complex dance known only to them, one of accord and the affection of two people moving hand-in-hand in the same direction, both possessed by desire while knowing themselves to be the source of that desire. But I am so tired, I heard my own voice say, one of them, that startlingly cruel, intrusive voice I hate, darkening everything, how sick I am of listening to it, and of having to go on! But after some time had passed once again I forgot all about it as I sat there, the witness of this marvel that brought peace to my heart or, perhaps, a hidden joy of my own, one I had so long considered extinct. When Ygen fell on hard times and was dragged down into the most humiliating poverty, his wife made up her mind one day to have her long beautiful hair cut short so that she could sell it and he could afford to invite all their friends to an evening of laughter and drinking, renga competitions, and the conversation of those who have known one another for a long time, the kind look and humorous word that make it seem possible to live again. I think of her sometimes.


Moon, come down andcome alone. I have to tell you allabout Akechi's wife.

--Bash, translated by Franz Wright





Homer
 

Schliemann is outside, digging. He's not
not calling a spade a spade.
The stadium where the Greeks once played
used to stand on this very spot. 
 
Each night, Penelope, operating
in mythical time, unspools the light 
gray orb Schliemann has just unearthed. Come daylight, 
her hands will restitch it. The suitors sigh, waiting.
 
And each night I'd watch as my hero curled
himself round home plate, as if he were going 
to bat for me. And I'd hold my breath, knowing
a strong enough shot might be heard round the world.
 
One must imagine Penelope. 
One must imagine Penelope happy.
One must imagine Schliemann excavating
the dugouts and outfields of Troy, carbon-dating
 
the box score stats and the ticket stubs
he pulls from the lurid dirt. He rubs
the remains of Achilles's rage on his shirt.
What does not kill you can still hurt.

Penelope's suitors are striking out,
one after another. Their sad swings and misses. 
They can't even get to first base. She'll cut
the stitches once more, then blow them all kisses.

Odysseus won't care that the orb is undone.
He'll take a swing at it with all his might.
The ball takes flight. Odysseus takes flight.
It feels to Penelope like he's been gone

since the dawn of mankind, but he's already zoomed 
round third and flies like an arrow toward home, 
as the unearthly orb trails its guts in the air--
the yarn fanning out like Penelope's hair--

not knowing yet whether to fall foul or fair.

There Are Birds Here
 

For Detroit
There are birds here,
so many birds here
is what I was trying to say
when they said those birds were metaphors
for what is trapped
between buildings
and buildings. No.
The birds are here
to root around for bread
the girl's hands tear
and toss like confetti. No,
I don't mean the bread is torn like cotton,
I said confetti, and no
not the confetti
a tank can make of a building.
I mean the confetti
a boy can't stop smiling about
and no his smile isn't much
like a skeleton at all. And no
his neighborhood is not like a war zone.
I am trying to say
his neighborhood
is as tattered and feathered
as anything else,
as shadow pierced by sun
and light parted
by shadow-dance as anything else,
but they won't stop saying
how lovely the ruins,
how ruined the lovely
children must be in that birdless city.





Been About
 

The rat traps emptied, the grain troughs filled.
The distance between sheep shed 
and my own ice-melt dripping on the mat
equals the diameter of moonlight squared
on his face as he looks up
and finds me again. Says
he's sure I'd been swallowed
by the elements, says he'd been
about to come looking. I step into
the warm. Two baas from out back
where I'd worked. Two tufts of wool
he lifts from my hair. In just 
such a manner are sleek blue words
slyly acquired by a wispy
whiter-than-snow page. He's seen it
happen. Seen a tear of mine, then two,
well up and slip loose 
as the little boat of orgasm
veers into the vortex.





Per Fumum
 

(through smoke)
My mother became an ornithologist
when the grackle tumbled through barbecue smoke
and fell at her feet. Soon she learned
why singers cage birds; it can take weeks
to memorize a melody--
the first days lost as they mope
and warble a friendless note,
the same tone every animal memorizes
hours into breathing. It's a note
a cologne would emit if the bottle was struck
while something mystical was aligned
with something even more mystical
but farther away. My father was an astronomer
for forty minutes in a row
the first time a bus took us so far
from streetlights he could point out constellations
that may or may not have been Draco,
Orion, Aquila, or Crux.
When they faded I resented the sun's excess,
a combination of fires I couldn't smell.
The first chemist was a perfumer
whose combinations, brushed
against pulse points, were unlocked
by quickening blood. From stolen perfumes
I concocted my personal toxin.
It was no more deadly than as much water
to any creature the size of a roach. I grew suspicious
of my plate and lighter Bunsen burner,
the tiny vials accumulating in my closet.
I was a chemist for months
before I learned the difference
between poisoned and drowned.
When my bed caught fire
it smelled like a garden.





From "The Sonnagrams
 

on thoth's tits
From Sonnet 75 ("So are you to my thoughts as food to life)


A groovy day, a fish fillet, an elf hair,
A cosmonaut, a microdot, a hoedown,
A trusty door, the finest whore on welfare,
A neocon who's keeping on the lowdown,

A purple fist, a Federalist, a sunspot,
A bird that's got a big big butt to study,
A guy named Toots, ten dumb galoots, a gunshot,
Die Fledermaus by good ol' Strauss (my buddy),

A grinning troll, a real a-hole, a smiler,
A dude who knows a gushing hose is funny,
An underdressed (no tie, no vest) John Tyler,
A sexy flirt, a cowboy shirt--oh honey!

I'll flip you for a dinosaur, my sweeties,
When Uncle Pete lets Usher eat our Wheaties.




uh huh: hi, hula tooth
From Sonnet 135 ("Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy Will)


Will refried catnip addicts find a cure? 
Will daytime televangelists go broke? 
Will Algorithmic Horses go on tour? 
Will nineteen shekels buy one thin, thin Coke?

Will innovative inverts be reported? 
Will weasel-human hybrids rent a maid? 
Will hesitating oxen get aborted? 
Will analysts of real estate get laid?

Will hoochie-coochie nuns remove their mink? 
Will enemies of hotness shut it down? 
Will tame aphasic mynahs learn to think?

DetoNation
 

There's a joke that ends with--huh?
It's the bomb saying here is your father.

Now here is your father inside
your lungs. Look how lighter

the earth is--afterward.
To even write the word father

is to carve a portion of the day
out of a bomb-bright page.

There's enough light to drown in
but never enough to enter the bones

& stay. Don't stay here, he said, my boy
broken by the names of flowers. Don't cry

anymore. So I ran into the night.
The night: my shadow growing

toward my father.





Aubade with Burning City
 

South Vietnam, April 29, 1975: Armed Forces Radio played Irving Berlin's "White Christmas as a code to begin Operation Frequent Wind, the ultimate evacuation of American civilians and Vietnamese refugees by helicopter during the fall of Saigon.

            Milkflower petals on the street
                                                     like pieces of a girl's dress.

May your days be merry and bright...

He fills a teacup with champagne, brings it to her lips.
            Open, he says.
                                        She opens.
                                                      Outside, a soldier spits out
            his cigarette as footsteps
                            fill the square like stones fallen from the sky. May all
                                         your Christmases be white as the traffic guard
            unstraps his holster.

                                        His hand running the hem
of her white dress.
                            His black eyes.
            Her black hair.
                            A single candle.
                                        Their shadows: two wicks.

A military truck speeds through the intersection, the sound of children
                                        shrieking inside. A bicycle hurled
            through a store window. When the dust rises, a black dog
                            lies in the road, panting. Its hind legs
                                                                                   crushed into the shine
                                                       of a white Christmas.

On the nightstand, a sprig of magnolia expands like a secret heard
                                                                      for the first time.

The treetops glisten and children listen, the chief of police
                                facedown in a pool of Coca-Cola.
                                             A palm-sized photo of his father soaking
                beside his left ear.

The song moving through the city like a widow.
                A white...A white...I'm dreaming of a curtain of snow

                                                          falling from her shoulders.

Snow crackling against the window. Snow shredded

                                           with gunfire. Red sky.
                              Snow on the tanks rolling over the city walls.
A helicopter lifting the living just out of reach.

            The city so white it is ready for ink.

                                                     The radio saying run run run.
Milkflower petals on a black dog
                            like pieces of a girl's dress.

May your days be merry and bright. She is saying
            something neither of them can hear. The hotel rocks
                        beneath them. The bed a field of ice
                                                                                 cracking.

Don't worry, he says, as the first bomb brightens
                             their faces, my brothers have won the war
                                                                       and tomorrow...
                                             The lights go out.

I'm dreaming. I'm dreaming...
                                                            to hear sleigh bells in the snow...

In the square below: a nun, on fire,
                                            runs silently toward her god--

                           Open, he says.
                                                         She opens.





Recall the Carousel
 

Recall the carousel. Its round and round.
Its pink lights blinking off and on. 
The children's faces painted garish colors against
an institutional wall. And the genetics. The 
We won't be here too long...Do not step off...
The carousel? Do you recall? As if
we were our own young parents suffering again
after so many hundreds of hours of bliss. 
And even the startling fact that 
what had always been feared might come to pass: 
A familiar sweater in a garbage can.
A surgeon bent over our baby, wearing a mask. 
But surely you recall 
how happily and for how long
we watched our pretty hostages go round. 
They waved at us too many times to count.
Their dancing foals. Their lacquered mares. Even 
a blue-eyed hunting hound 
was still allowed back then.





Twelve Thirty One Nineteen Ninety Nine
 

First Architect of the jungle & Author of pastel slums,
Patron Saint of rust,
You have become too famous to be read.

I let the book fall behind me until it becomes
A book again. Cloth, thread, & the infinite wood.

Don't worry. Don't worry.
In the future, everyone, simply everyone,
Will be hung in effigy.
The crepe paper in the high school gym will be
Black & pink & feathery,

Rainbow trout & a dog's tongue. In effigy. This,

For example, was written in memory of...

But of whom? Brecht gasping for air in the street?
Truman dancing alone with his daughter?

Goodbye, little century.
Goodbye, riderless black horse that trots
From one side of the street to the other,
Trying to find its way
Out of the parade.

Forgive me for saluting you
With a hand still cold, sweating,
And resembling, as I hold it up & a heavy sleep
Fills it, the body of someone

Curled in sleep as the procession passes.

Excuse me, but at the end of our complete belief,
Which is what you required of us, don't we deserve

A good belly laugh? Don't we deserve

A shout in the street?

And this confetti on which our history is being written,
Smaller & smaller, less clear every moment,

And subject to endless revision?

Under the circumstances, & because
It can imagine no other life, doesn't the hand,

Held up there for hours,

Deserve it?

No? No hunh? No.





The Companions of Odysseus in Hades
 

After Seferis
Since we still had a little
Of the rusk left, what fools
To eat, against the rules,
The Sun's slow-moving cattle,

Each ox huge as a tank--
A wall you'd have to siege
For forty years to reach
A star, a hero's rank.

We starved on the back of the earth,
But when we'd stuffed ourselves,
We tumbled to these delves,
Numbskulls, fed up with dearth.





Apple Blossoms
 

One evening in winter 
when nothing has been enough, 
when the days are too short,

the nights too long 
and cheerless, the secret 
and docile buds of the apple

blossoms begin their quick 
ascent to light. Night 
after interminable night

the sugars pucker and swell 
into green slips, green 
silks. And just as you find

yourself at the end 
of winter's long, cold 
rope, the blossoms open

like pink thimbles 
and that black dollop 
of shine called

bumblebee stumbles in.





[But isnt midnight intermittent]
 

But isn't midnight intermittent
Or was that just a whispered nine
A snap of blown light low against the flank of a cow
A likeness of something numberless that only I not knowing the sound 
            might know 
It may have been howled by a circling dog being chastised -- threatened --
            by multiples of itself in pursuit of the consolation of knowing that
            everything is real 
It was real
I don't mean midnight -- despite horizon, nipple, and fissure 
I don't mean
And yet I do -- mean, I mean 
A cowering animal woven real
            flickers
                        please pull over
                                    Kierkegaard 
Kierkegaard says knowledge precedes every act but surely there are acts that 
are not preceded by knowledge. Repetitions pass at the door from summer 
to winter. Some slowly. Some quickly. Total strangers. Never saw them 
before. Can't picture them now. Umbrellas -- strange totalities -- upheld, 
wheeling.





[A straight rain is rare...]
 

A straight rain is rare and doors have suspicions
and I hold that names begin histories
and that the last century was a cruel one. I am pretending
to be a truck in Mexico. I am a woman with a long neck and a good burden
and I waddle efficiently. Activity never sleeps and no tale of crumbling cliffs
can be a short one. I have to shift weight favorably. Happiness
can't be settled. I brush my left knee twice, my right once,
my left twice again and in that way advance. The alphabet
and the cello can represent horses but I can only pretend
to be a dog slurping pudding. After the 55 minutes it takes to finish
my legs tremble. All is forgiven. Yesterday is going the way of tomorrow
indirectly and the heat of the sun is inadequate at this depth. I see
the moon. The verbs ought and can lack infinity and somewhere
between 1957 when the heat of the dry sun naughtily struck me
and now when my secrets combine in the new order of cold rains
and night winds a lot has happened. Long phrases
are made up of short phrases that bear everything "in vain or "all
in fun "for your sake and "step by step precisely. I too can spring.





[The water was rising...]
 

The water was rising, I got up on the bed
Still wearing the Hawaiian shirt he had on yesterday
He used his thoughts to draw a rudimentary circle on the wall
Hitting Beirut and killing 22 civilians
But now go the bells, and we are ready
Novelty is no better than repetition
That graces the walls of toilet stalls with hooey
And comparison with the dead--their slimy cruelty--and meatballs
Perched like ghostly birds
Believing in old men's lies, then too late unbelieving
There's rough life in the rust
Long-buried whore's eggs, razor-clams with shells
Pirates dressed in pink and pit-bulls on parade
With power to extend the longevity of learned fear in the mouse
And a heron on the horizon many sewing-days ago

Jane, Jane, ascend the stairs
Of the river's mouth at the year's turn
Thus predicting the shock to the tale that so entertains grown children
Of the animals that have nearly all forsaken us





The Siren
 

The puppy must be learned of all this material. 
No map of the hospital. First, the war effort. 
Then, the war itself. The water makes and remakes 
its walls. No persons or boats are allowed in them.

This plot is to be played out in the buildings known to us. 
Swim for the stick, baby! You've got an anti-sink device. 
The nba guard flips forward and back 
in his hologram. Fish-fission. Light.
                                                                            --and found wheels beneath her
linen skirt. The kids mill around like businessmen-clowns. 
Their organization is a matter of choice and thus not protected under 
reedlight. Candlelight.

Horizonto-rotary gaze beating clearly to the right.
Now, corrected, to the left. Fish! Flip! and Out of Hearing!
Alone in the pink apartment with your little swab.
The moth-mom tries out everything at once: straps on wool,
ties a candle to her head. Don't pity her. She wants to eat the moth!
Which dithers over whether it eats wool or flame.

The skyline lifts, and the gulfstream slips out barefoot
clear to England. Maidens rhinocently down the cowpath clomp.
Toothbrush into yogurt cup, Recyclamente! I am so
adamant. The siren with a catch in its cry starts over.
Eternal transistance. Ent'ring our marriage ride.

What I Eat is a Prayer
 

Then in the August of my twenty-seventh year, 
naked except for my seaclogs, 
I greeted an audience of piers.

After my dip, I came up covered
in salt and sand: hair tough as an angel's.
Who could disappoint me now among the so-coifed?

Disappointing menus for a banquet of twenty-seven.
The hostess cannot hear the hotelier, walls blow ope';
lousy with wallets and checkbooks, the air. Naked except for

The checks and the monies flapped like birds.
I partook of the seasonal activity
and caught a check in my hands--to myself from myself--

and was caught; I was smart and dumb. 
I hadn't been clobbered in such a long time! 
Now, shoved against the carpeted headrest,

I wondered at its cold and slender neck.

The nakeder I feel the happier.

Camp is over, and the children come out
wearing hats; the children are happy for each other,
each camp having been maximally appropriate.

The ocean grew gritty with proteins. I arose
and clomb to the yard with its spigot.
It looked up and blinked. Above, kite strings wrote

toing and froing was the same motion; tiny sighs above the halls 
at the county airport; swung on tiny chains; 
my father swathed me in two handtowels,

said nexttime, swim in the sea.

A gold thread falls from an eagle's towel
onto the beach. A gold face big as a quarter of the sky
looks at us with gold-milk tears in its eyes

and the gold girl goes on brushing the countryside 
with a twig-broom big as a tree. When our competitor 
finishes third, he approaches the throne

with a gold wheel of tillamook.





King Prion
 

--Hoooooooo
Lay in an array of pixels
Fat, simulated proteins
Looks just like nutrition!
Acts just like an avatar!
I just wanted to give my body to
A net of guarine
Gingko-balboa azatine melamine
Camphobacter phylacter nicotine
Which hung like neuron-nectar in a cell, net of
Vatic coughdropped hairball tells the future of
Neural center where the straight lines hopped
Like a hairline fracture on a bender jumps a
Mulholland retaining wall and crashes the crinkled Vale of
Food-for-thought
Fruit for monkeys in a barrel, one fruit per monkey
For a total of fortyseven monkeydays
For a total of twelve hours at a clip
The go-home-and-feed-the-baby milk of it
That man is a mouth chased by ghosts
Round a rainslicked hairpin off a cliff in
(And now I pause to remember
How Art was a silver paper moulded to the ceiling
Where you cut your hair
For your rebirth as Fata Androgyana
The scissors-sister who slits where she goes-into
Cuts as she cuts--)
This machine makes its need louder and
Invites me into its duct, unlike the baby
Sleeping on the other edge of Pow'r,
Eyes roll'd, mouth pinch'd shut
Round Pow'r's earthly sinks and shunts--





Dear Fi Jae 2 (Ms. Merongrongrong)
 

Now I know what it is to bite the tongue inside

the mink stole: I do not want

my inspiration

stolen! ms. merongrongrong, for you I do

my husband's hairdo

in a kind of flip. Now for once I want to build

a data cage, a firewall, encrypt a fiber option, to lock up

his image, lock the tick

into his rib. I grasp his slim wrist and mask him

for the gas: what a pheasant operation, his plumage

brilliants as he whites out

in closed caption, under glass. A harmless operation, a lipid removal or a viscous

camera drip. ms. merongrongrong, please

do not misprism me, for normally I am not like this, I do not

creep or crypt, do not go hissing, bent double,

kettlewaisted, clinched. When pressed

I spread; when pinched, pinch; shiv and shinny

my way out, make a finger mouth

that shrinks the moon to a pupa, shove it in my purse

to pupate on my cabbage stash, my petty rash

cashola. In your stall, I dump the stenchy

contents of my clutch on your counter, your clerk Moonlight

scrubs

the Wikifile, slicks the nail down to a nib, mums me

in muff, ruff, muffler,

ruffle, stomacher, pannier of ribbed silk, knight's visor, hutch

where I keep my prize rabbits, ms. merongrongrong

I and II, which liplop the moonlit garden in stitched minks.

ms. merongrongrong

you send the Dutchman moon to touch us you cinch

my betrothed

's throat till he has to swallow

what I bite, he drags himself to the window to vomit, he drags

the bile sea in drag like a widow

with a ghost lover, mourning over the suck white sand in white

I wear a glass pane

over my face, a teller's window or a train's, ms. merongrongrong,

I stutter by in sailor's guise, adrenal sink disguised

as swagger, a thickened chest wall, a fat and padded neck. I go

a specimen, I pose

between the slides for my decline, ms.

merongrongrong time

thins and quickens, I help my husband

up over the lip of the Dutch oven, his flank is ripped, one paw 

limp, one soft ear hangs by a thread, I lug myself up the path 

you have prepared for us, the trestle, the wooden tread--





Third Poem for the Catastrophe
 

O
melting rainbow that embrace this roof
O
persistent covenant
hangs around
giving us nothing, leaves its muck in the water
expects us to be knocked out by its fine colors
weren't you nothing too, weren't you
sea bottom
crunched down into fuel
and when that eggshell roof busts through
mama's gonna buy you
a rainbow ride for free
an illumination, an inflammation
hyperion flame headdress
dream pins in the fuel
balloons of Koolaid burst down to cool
the sticky baby's head
plus a credit card a glock a new bible
a princess dress
a mermaid princess dress
so you'll be twice submerged
or an erased Indian princess
pajama set now go to sleep





Kingdom of Dirt
 

Soon the ambassadors from the Netherworld 
Will begin

Their jet-like descent. Death, 
Disguised inside me, already,

As sleaze.
Grime and her magnificent seed. Brother Rainer

Clutching his Bible, hallucinating helicopters. 
Brother Rainer, child-like and wrecked.

Infamy, and the cosmology of chronic 
Raveling and unraveling. Or,

Displaced insanity. Dirty Cindy, little
Glitter of her father's

Spit: invisible, androgynous, a fragment of 
His, found at the bottom of his dream chest.

Draped in my black cape of smut glue and 
Subterranean, they mistake me for

A man in drag in my nasty
Boots. Why just look: a manifestation

Of stars. Or, appoint me hustler of 
Brutal Rainer and his kinky noir

Scheme: me, at thirteen, on the beach 
In a candy-striped bikini.

In time or out of time, 
Glamorine.

Groom of the Underworld, please 
Come with me

To the discotheque at the end 
Of the world. Piss-

Elegant at the halfway
House for the trashed and gone galore.

Meet me in the love-
Burned orchard

Where the beautiful doomed 
Meet at last.





Self Portrait
 

I did not want my body 
Spackled in the world's 
Black beads and broke 
Diamonds. What the world

Wanted, I did not. Of the things 
It wanted. The body of Sunday 
Morning, the warm wine and 
The blood. The dripping fox

Furs dragged through the black New 
York snow--the parked car, the pearls, 
To the first pew--the funders, 
The trustees, the bloat, the red weight of

The world. Their faces. I wanted not 
That. I wanted Saint Francis, the love of 
His animals. The wolf, broken and bleeding-- 
That was me.





Aqu
 

He wanders through the crooked streets
that mimic river beds Before
and breathes the anxious air in traffic
filled with tension left from wooded crossroads in attack
He shops the windows, happy,
where the stalking once was good
and his kitchen floor is built on bones
of venison once gently roasted.

"It's a good place for a party!" he concurs 
to friends now dressed in jeans.

The ground was already beaten smooth 
and festive by the joy of ancient dances.

He feels the warmth,
and doesn't know his soul is filled
with the spirit of coyotes past.





Caminitos
 

The pathways of my thoughts are cobbled with 
        mesquite blocks
                and narrow-winding, 
        long and aged like the streets of 
                san fernando de bexar
                        y la villa real de san antonio

        pensive
                y callados 
        cada uno con su chiste
                idiosyncracy
                        crazy turns 
        that are because they are,
                centuries magic

cada uno hecho as,
        y with a careful 
                capricho touch, 
                        as.

They curl slowly into ripples,
        earthy and cool like the Ro Medina 
                under the trees
                        silently singing, standing still, 
                and flowing, becoming, 
        became 
and always as always
        still fertile, laughing, loving, 
                alivianada
                        Ro Medina
                                under the trees, 
                                        celebrating life.

They end up in the monte, chaparral, 
        llenos de burrs, spurs 
                pero libres 
Running through the hills freefoot 
       con aire azul 
               blue breaths peacefully taken 
                       between each lope 
                               remembering venado 
                                       remembering conejos 
                                               remembering 
                                                       where 
                                                               we came from





Voyage
 

I was the fourth ship.
          Behind Nia, Pinta, Santa Mara, 
          Lost at sea while watching a seagull, 
          Following the wind and sunset skies, 
          While the others set their charts.

I was the fourth ship.
          Breathing in salt and flying with clouds, 
          Sailing moonbreezes and starvision nights, 
          Rolling into the wave and savoring its lull, 
          While the others pointed their prows.

I was the fourth ship.
          Playfully in love with the sea, 
          Eternally entwined with the sky, 
          Forever vowed to my voyage, 
          While the others shouted "Land."





Ode on Dictionaries
 

A-bomb is how it begins with a big bang on page
        one, a calculator of sorts whose centrifuge 
begets bedouin, bamboozle, breakdance, and berserk,
        one of my mother's favorite words, hard knock 
clerk of clichs that she is, at the moment going ape
        the current rave in the fundamentalist landscape 
disguised as her brain, a rococo lexicon
        of Deuteronomy, Job, gossip, spritz, and neocon 
ephemera all wrapped up in a pop burrito
        of movie star shenanigans, like a stray Cheeto 
found in your pocket the day after you finish the bag,
        tastier than any oyster and champagne fueled fugue 
gastronomique you have been pursuing in France
        for the past four months. This 82-year-old's rants 
have taken their place with the dictionary I bought
        in the fourth grade, with so many gorgeous words I thought 
I'd never plumb its depths. Right the first time, little girl,
        yet here I am still at it, trolling for pearls, 
Japanese words vying with Bantu in a goulash
        I eat daily, sometimes gagging, sometimes with relish, 
kleptomaniac in the candy store of language,
        slipping words in my pockets like a non-smudge 
lipstick that smears with the first kiss. I'm the demented
        lady with sixteen cats. Sure, the house stinks, but those damned 
mice have skedaddled, though I kind of miss them, their cute
        little faces, the whiskers, those adorable gray suits. 
No, all beasts are welcome in my menagerie, ark
        of inconsolable barks and meows, sharp-toothed shark, 
OED of the deep ocean, sweet compendium
        of candy bars--Butterfingers, Mounds, and M&Ms-- 
packed next to the tripe and gizzards, trim and tackle
        of butchers and bakers, the painter's brush and spackle, 
quarks and black holes of physicists' theory. I'm building
        my own book as a mason makes a wall or a gelding 
runs round the track--brick by brick, step by step, word by word,
        jonquil by gerrymander, syllabub by greensward, 
swordplay by snapdragon, a never-ending parade
       with clowns and funambulists in my own mouth, homemade 
treasure chest of tongue and teeth, the brain's roustabout, rough
        unfurler of tents and trapezes, off-the-cuff 
unruly troublemaker in the high church museum
        of the world. O mouth--boondoggle, auditorium, 
viper, gulag, gumbo pot on a steamy August
        afternoon--what have you not given me? How I must 
wear on you, my Samuel Johnson in a frock coat,
        lexicographer of silly thoughts, billy goat, 
X-rated pornographic smut factory, scarfer
        of snacks, prissy smirker, late-night barfly, 
you are the megaphone by which I bewitch the world
        or don't as the case may be. O chittering squirrel, 
ziplock sandwich bag, sound off, shut up, gather your words
        into bouquets, folios, flocks of black and flaming birds.

My Factless Autobiography
 

I arise around survival of the event
as worse than the event
The whole place surrounds the smell
I take one step toward and ten paces back
breathless with the mirrors
with the fees and meters
Feces I fax my demon family
weeping on the bridge again

My condition was induced as follows
Releasing actual sales numbers, trying to mount
the policeman or his horse
tonguing captains manually
strong simultaneous tendencies to approach
and avoid appearance and avoidance

Men come to my cherry doors to carry on
about finance and cricket
coaxing a cavernous oath
wrestling natives into nestling

My part is basically to hatch
with regard for human dignity and life
In my best foreign automobile
stunting the stupor fronting us

In order to love my country better
I offer monthly meter readings
I am filled with rhythm, passion and speed
protruding in public
popping my collar into a wreck

My father sits me down
Son, he says, don't let them enter
your mouth I wrote a narrative
about our collective pain
and went shopping





of a butterfly in el barrio or a stranger in paradise
 

Home; 
a place to rest your feet, 
a place where you can sleep.
          Man, 
a place where you can shit, 
and no one can complain.

          My Home /      el barrio 
where people rest their feet 
outside on the fire escapes, 
where i have a place to sleep 
with my brothers, sisters, cousins
     oh yes, and Rover 
all in the same bed.
                              / where no can smell shit 
                                 'cause we've been living in it 
                                  all our lives 
     (we're immune to its stink)

          My home; 
where on hot summer days 
people gather on the grandstands /
                                                                  the fire escapes 
and in the box seats/
                                       the stoops
and cheer our home gang's stickball team
          (they call themselves "the new york junkies").

and on those cool summer evenings
we hang our legs from the windows /
the roofs /      the fire escapes
while eating pop corn and sippin coke
/ or snorting it   / shooting it
and watch the Saturday evening gang-fights.

          yes, this is home /      our paradises 
and you're always welcomed 
as long as you're poor.

and it was here       / in my home 
that a butterfly happened to wing by 
he was easily spotted as a UFO 
because of all his beautiful colors

                he flew over the buildings / 
                through the lots / 
                around home plate      a sewer top 
                in the middle of the street

he flew
in his dance about manner.

and i almost cried when i saw children reaching 
reaching out for him      reaching for hope 
for love / 
for that lost dream

and he continued dancing /     or maybe flying
away
away to save his beauty from these love-hungry
children

he flew        he flew
and i cried
when he fell down the sewer /
                                                       now he was part of us.





& as you bow your heads to pray
 

& as you bow your heads to pray /      pray 
a silent prayer
around a chicken who lies motionless 
before your hungry eyes /     dead 
dead as your dreams /      as your hopes 
            / dead as that silent prayer 
               that dies more & more each day /
                     that no ears will ever share 
               that that dead chicken      / which you 
               in your shame dare to call a turkey 
                     will never hear 
not that god /    lost in the heavens 
eating real turkey 
who to you now pray for blessings
        will never hear 
/ i wish you a happy thanksgiving.

& as you bow your heads to pray /      pray 
a silent prayer
for the little boy who dances in the snow / 
barefooted
he loves to greet new falling snow 
& has no shoes
& hopes that santa on christmas eve 
will slide down the chimney 
             of his tenement slum 
& in his stockings which he has hung 
by the fire escape
             / o so carefully 
                as not to tear them any more 
will find them filled with little hopes 
& tiny dreams
& beneath that narrow leaf       / which he 
in his shame dares call a tree
               / a christmas tree 
santa will leave toys
                   of wooden soldiers 
                    & plastic dolls 
filled with love for him and his (
                               & does not know 
                               that santa nods on roofs 
                               & climbs on fire escapes 
                               & snatches pocket-books

spring again
 

spring came /
the same way winter left
& summer will come
& summer will leave;        slowly
          / when no one's expecting it 
             when people are tired of waiting

like waiting for welfare checks /
          a long wait/             a slow wait

the windows are open 
but butterflies don't fly in 
to display a sense of love

           / only housefly enter 
              to sit on food       & eat crumbs

& dreams escape /
& become stolen      & lost      & used
& wasted        & thrown away
& dreamed anew

the junkies sit on the stoop 
& nod themselves into dreams
            / maybe into the ones which escaped 
& stinkball is played 
& on warm nights        the ghetto musicians play
 our ghetto song 
on garbage can tops         & bang on empty coke bottles
& sound real chvere

:tomorrow
the junkies will sit on the stoop
& nod themselves into dreams /
stickball will be played /
                                             the streets will become chalked 
                                             with 1st and 2nd & 3rd bases

hop scotch will become a game 
& tops will spin on sidewalks /

& everyone will anticipate summer.





Survey
 

I am so lonely for the twentieth century,
for the deeply felt, obscene graffiti
of armed men and the beautiful bridges
that make them so small and carry them
into the hearts of cities written like words
across nothing, the dense void
history became in my beautiful century.
When a man talks reason, he postpones something.
He gets in the way of a machine that knows him
for the sad vengeance he is, somewhere close
to the bald name of his city. "New York"
means "strike back." "Attica" means "strike back"
and so does anyplace in the world
in the huge eyes and tender hands of my century.

I went to the capital. I had a banner,
and there were thousands of people like me.
There was an airplane, and for a moment
heavy with laurel and sprays of peach blossom
something that has never happened before
stretched like a woman's shadow on a hedge
between the plane and the people who saw it flying.
It was the real name of the century.
It told everyone to strike back
until there was no reason in the world
except a machine stalled overhead
that knows everyone and is as delicate
as peach blossom. But the poor years come too late.





The Descent
 

The descent has deepened 
the interior lengthened

designated ending

Blind

pulled down inside and then 
shot up again

to see east via the plateglass 
a moon a monsoon an ashram


I used time almost wantonly 
in that bald but sensual sky

to give me gusts
and more measurement

not to snap the stars shut 
but Joseph said 
you really ought

to tender how you sail by eye 
your soul is just a length of baby





The Source
 

The source
I thought was Arctic

the good Platonic

Up the pole
was soaked film

an electric elevation
onto a fishy platform

and waves on two sides greenly welcoming

The sunwater poured on holy atheism

It was light that powered out

my ego or my heart
before ending with a letter





Consider the Hands that Write this Letter
 

after Marina Wilson
Consider the hands 
that write this letter.

Left palm pressed flat against paper, 
as we have done before, over my heart,

in peace or reverence to the sea, 
some beautiful thing

I saw once, felt once: snow falling
like rice flung from the giants' wedding,

or strangest of strange birds. & consider, then, 
the right hand, & how it is a fist,

within which a sharpened utensil, 
similar to the way I've held a spade,

the horse's reins, loping, the very fists
I've seen from roads through Limay & Estel.

For years, I have come to sit this way: 
one hand open, one hand closed,

like a farmer who puts down seeds & gathers up; 
food will come from that farming.

Or, yes, it is like the way I've danced
with my left hand opened around a shoulder,

my right hand closed inside 
of another hand. & how I pray,

I pray for this to be my way: sweet
work alluded to in the body's position to its paper:

left hand, right hand
like an open eye, an eye closed:

one hand flat against the trapdoor, 
the other hand knocking, knocking.





The 8 O'Clock Movie
 

Boston, 1973--Years had passed and I assumed a 
Different life when one night, while resting from 
Books on Marlborough Street (where things like 
This can happen), there came into my room images

In black-and-white with a flow of light that 
Would not die. It all came back to me in different 
Terms: characters were born again, met up with 
Each other in adult life, drifted across the

Screen to discover cattle and oil, traveled miles 
On horseback in dust and heat, characters whose 
Names emerged as if they mattered in a history 
Book. Some were swept up by power and prejudice

Toward neighbors different from themselves, 
Because that is what the picture is about, with 
Class distinctions moving the plot along. A few 
Could distinguish right from wrong; those who

Could not you condemned from the beginning when 
You noticed them at all. Still others married or 
Backed off from the ranch with poignant flair, 
Like James Dean, who in the middle of grazing land

Unearthed the treasures of oil, buried his soul in 
Money and went incoherent with alcohol. When the 40's 
Came, two young men were drafted, the one called Angel 
Dying at war. It's a generational tale, so everybody

Aged once more and said what they had to say along the 
Way according to the script. And then the end: the 
Hamburger joint brought into existence to the beat of 
"The Yellow Rose of Texas," Juana and her child the

Color of dark amber, foreshadowing the Mexican-looking 
Couple and their daughter, all in muteness, wanting 
To be served. I climbed out of bed and in my head 
Was a roaring of light--words spoken and unspoken

Had brought the obliterated back. Not again (I said, 
From my second-floor room)...let this not be happening. 
Three and-a-half hours had flicked by. As the sound 
Trailed off into nothing, memory would not dissolve.





Fight Scene Beginning
 

Bick Benedict, that is, Rock Hudson in the 
Time-clock of the movie, stands up and moves, 
Deliberate, toward encounter. He has come out 
Of the anxious blur of the backdrop, like

Coming out of the unreal into the world of 
What's true, down to earth and distinct; has 
Stepped up to Sarge, the younger of the two,

And would sure appreciate it if he: "Were a 
Little more polite to these people." Sarge, 
Who has something to defend, balks; asks 
(In a long-shot) if: "that there papoose down

There, his name Benedict too?," by which he 
Means one-year old Jordy in the background 
Booth hidden in the bosom of mother love of

Juana, who listens, trying not to listen. Rock 
Hudson, his hair already the color of slate, 
Who could not foresee this challenge, arms 
Akimbo (turning around), contemplates the stable

And straight line of years gone by, says: "Yeah, 
Come to think of it, it is." And so acknowledges, 
In his heart, his grandson, half-Anglo, half-

Brown. Sarge repents from words, but no 
Part of his real self succumbs: "All right--
Forget I asked you. Now you just go back 
Over there and sit down and we ain't gonna

Have no trouble. But this bunch here is 
Gonna eat somewhere's else." Never shall I 
Forget, never how quickly his hand threw my

Breathing off--how quickly he plopped the 
Hat heavily askew once more on the old 
Man's head, seized two fistsful of shirt and 
Coat and lifted his slight body like nothing,

A no-thing, who could have been any of us, 
Weightless nobodies bronzed by real-time far
Off somewhere, not here, but in another

Country, yet here, where Rock Hudson's face 
Deepens; where in one motion, swift as a 
Miracle, he catches Sarge off guard, grabs 
His arm somehow, tumbles him back against

The counter and draws fire from Sarge to 
Begin the fight up and down the wide screen 
Of memory, ablaze in Warner-color light.





History of sleep
 

(a myth of consequences)
The ivy across our back fence tangles gray 
into a green evening light.

How a second emptiness 
un-punctuates the first.

Disloyal,
we attempt to construct.

An ache will tighten 
but not form.

Making impossible
even this upsurge of crows across our sightline.

The Mayans invented zero so as not to ignore even the gods 
who wouldn't carry their burdens.

Too slippery as prayer, too effortless 
as longing.

Our problem was preparation. Premeditation 
neutered any rage potential.

Years later, the spine of our backyard 
appears to have always been crooked.

White jasmine, dove-calm in the lattice, is not 
a finely crafted lure.





Necessities
 

In through our bedroom window, the full dawn-scape concusses. 
Difficult to sustain sleep's equilibrium of wordlessness. 
Naming anything, like stepping barefoot in wet sand up to my ankles. 
Name after name, sinking me farther beneath waking's buoyancy.

House, this morning, is pale with the rush of what night siphoned off. 
Objects, still emptied of resemblance, hum their chord-less cantos. 
Bloodless, my knuckles knock on walls without echo, testing singularities.

Sun on the cutlery offers an ageless sheen. 
Though it ages the silver relentlessly.

New, but still rudimentary tools to be gleaned from my over-used weaponry.





Duck/Rabbit
 

We remember the rabbit when we see the duck, but we cannot experience both at the same time. --E.H. Gombrich, Art and Illusion
What do you remember? When I looked at
his streaky glasses, I wanted
to leave him. And before that? He stole those
cherries for me at midnight. We were walking
in the rain and I loved him.
And before that? I saw him coming
toward me that time at the picnic,
edgy, foreign.
 
But you loved him? He sat in his room with
the shades drawn, brooding. But you
loved him? He gave me
a photo of himself at sixteen, diving
from the pier. It was summer. His arms
outstretched. And before that?
His mother was combing his soft curls
with her fingers and crying. Crying.
 
Is that what he said? He put on the straw hat 
and raced me to the barn. What did he 
tell you? Here's the dried rose, brown 
as tobacco. Here's the letter that I tore
and pasted. The book of blank pages
with the velvet cover. But do you still
 
love him? When I rub the nap 
backwards, the colors lift, 
bristle. What do you mean? 
Sometimes, when I'm all alone, 
I find myself stroking it.





Eating Babies
 


            1

 fat
is the soul of this flesh.
Eat with your hands, slow, you will understand
breasts, why everyone
adores them--Rubens' great custard nudes--why
we can't help sleeping with
pillows.

The old woman in the park pointed,
Is it yours?
Her gold eye-teeth gleamed.

I bend down, taste the fluted 
nipples, the elbows, the pads 
of the feet. Nibble earlobes, dip 
my tongue in the salt fold 
of shoulder and throat.

Even now he is changing, 
as if I were 
licking him thin.


            2

he squeezes his eyes tight 
to hide
and blink! he's still here. 
It's always a surprise.

Safety-fat, 
angel-fat,

steal it in mouthfuls, 
store it away 
where you save

the face that you touched 
for the last time 
over and over, 
your eyes closed

so it wouldn't go away.


            3

watch him sleeping. Touch
the pulse where
the bones haven't locked
in his damp hair:
the navel of dreams.
His eyes open for a moment, underwater.

His arms drift in the dark 
as your breath 
washes over him.

Bite one cheek. Again. 
It's your own 
life you lean over, greedy, 
going back for more.





That Bright Grey Eye
 

The grey sky, lighter & darker 
greys,
            lights between & delicate 
            lavenders also 
blue-greys in smaller strokes,
                                                      & swashes 
of mauve-grey on the Hudson--
                                                           openings 
of light to the blue oblong 
off-center
                   where the door to the warehouse 
shows--
                the larger smearings darkening
                                                                          deep 
into blues
                             So alight that sky, 
                             late August, 
early evening,
                             I had to 
gasp at it,
                   stand there hardly moving 
to breathe it,       using 
whatever my body gave me,
                                                    at 
that moment       attending to it, 
thinking:
                  Turner, he should have 
seen it,
              he would have given it 
back to us,
                     not let it die away
                                                                       And that other 
evening, walking down Bank Street from marketing,
the sky fiery over the river,
                                                  luminous but 
hot in its flowering also,
                                              rich in color 
as Venice seen by Guardi--more aflame even, 
the sky moving in a pulse,
                                                its fire breathing 
in a pulse verging on danger--mane of a lioness 
affronted.
                         That brilliance--the eye of the lion 
filled to the lids with 
flame
                  And his eyes, Turner's, that bright grey eye 
at seventy-six,
                           "brilliant as 
the eye of a child"
                                 who grew his thumbnail 
in the shape of an eagle's claw,
                                                          the better 
to use it in painting
                                     In Kirby Lonsdale, Yorkshire, 
where Turner first drew mountain-landscapes, 
                                      I found Blake's Marriage 
of Heaven and Hell--sold for two guineas, 1821 
& Turner aged 46 that year
                                                  & there I read: 
"And when thou seest 
an Eagle, thou seest a portion of genius.
                                                                         Lift up 
thy head," says Blake.
                                        These afternoons now, 
                                         late in September, 76, 
the sky, the river are lit up
at the end of Bank Street, at Bethune.
                                                                     The pavement 
trembles with light pouring 
upon it
               We are held in it. 
We smile.
                   I hold my breath to see if 
the cashier in the supermarket 
will be gentle with the old lady who cannot 
read the price-tag on 
a loaf of bread.
                            Then I breathe freely, 
for yes, she is helpful, yes, she is 
kind.
                   Outside on 
the pavement, the light pouring itself away 
is the light in the eagle's 
eye        (or the eye of 
a child)
                              (I saw it in a man's eye once: 
                              but he's dead now more than 
                              four years) 
Drawing heat out of 
surfaces,
                      the light is 
without calculation,
                                    is a munificence now, 
is justified.

And I in My Bed Again
 

Last night
                     tossed in 
my bed
                     the sound of the rain turned me 
around,
                 a leaf 
in a dried gully
                            from side to 
side,
            the sound of the rain took me
apart,        opened to                 what is it?
breath caught in memory of 
a deep sweetness
                                     that sound
                                     unceasing
delicate,                the wetness running
through my body
                                    It might be nighttime 
                                    in a forest hut, 
the rain constant
                               in little rivulets 
splashing,
                          at times uncertain--
safe in each other's arms,
                                               the rain sheltering 
us       a depth opening 
bottomless to a terrible sweetness,
                                                    the small rain 
shaking us in our bed
                                              (the terror) 
whispering
                            End of a season, 
                            wind from the west

Winter Solstice
 

A cold night crosses 
our path
                  The world appears
very large, very
round now       extending 
far as the moon does
                                        It is from 
the moon this cold travels
                                        It is 
the light of the moon that causes 
this night reflecting distance in its own 
light so coldly
                                          (from one side of 
the earth to the other)
                                        It is the length of this coldness 
It is the long distance 
between two points which are 
not in a line        now
                                       not a 
straightness       (however 
straight) but a curve only, 
silver that is a rock reflecting
                                                      not metal 
but a rock accepting 
distance
                     (a scream in silence 
where between the two 
points what touches 
is a curve around the world
                                                      (the dance unmoving).

Hanukkah
 

This season for us, the Jews-- 
a season of candles,
                                      one more 
on the seven-branched candlestick for 
the seven days of the week,
                                                  but let it be seven 
in the sense of luck in dice,
                                          seven of the stars in 
the constellations:
                                  Orion, Aldebaran in the sky
                                                                                     lively
over Jerusalem
                               Let the fuel 
last the besieged       such as we are,
                                                             to nourish
us.
        Let the oil continue 
for heat, for illumination,
                                                flame crouching 
in the lamp,
                      the glass smoky
                                                   (December upon us) 
the light not fail.
                               The air has been mild 
for days--
                  & the 7 rings through my life 
despite the 8 of this week--
                                                     bushes 
in the doorway of 7 Charles where I lived, 51, 
crackle with dryness,
                                         are bare still. 
That house with the lucky 
number brought me luck & misluck, both,
                                                                        like the other
that added to 7, out of 4 & 3,
                                                    that seven 
underlying the eight of this week, 
the 8 just over, the 7 just under 
a third of the years with Stefan:
                                                          I praise them
both today--
                        the lasting oil 
in the seven-branched candlestick:
                                                                absence 
of all fear--the smallest 
drop of fuel enough to leap from.
new york, 1973





Bright Pittsburgh Morning
 

This must happen just after I die: At sunrise
I bend over my grandparents' empty house in Hazelwood
and pull it out of the soft cindered earth by the Mon River.
Copper tubing and electric lines hang down like hairs.
The house is the size of a matchbox. I sprinkle bits
of broken pallets, seeded grass, fingernails, and tamarack
needles in the open door of the porch. I scratch a Blue Tip
and blow vowels of fire through the living room,
the tunneled hallway. Flames run up the wooden stairs.
I put my ear beside the hot kitchen window
to hear the crackling voices of cupboards and walls.
I flip the welder's mask:
Sun off the rectangular glass, a rose glint before the white torch.





Teusaquillo, 1989
 

Eleven bombs had gone off the previous night, most of them in this neighborhood, which is called Teusaquillo, and it is one of the pleasantest in Bogot. --Alma Guillermoprieto
Flowering sietecueros trees:
How easily we married ourselves
to the idea of that bruised light
outside the window,
capillary
fibers of the linen,
stained wood of the door frame.
Deepening hallway.
Beyond
the stucco portal,
crushed purple.

At night, tinnitus
we thought,
the ringing after an explosion,
a frenzied inner ear axle squeal,
until I placed my stethoscope's bell
on the purpled ceiling:

Bats at roost
under the terracotta tiles,
each squeak a vector between mountains,
sicarios ricocheting through the dark.

"If you press your skull between the pillows, 
it's like a lullaby."

At dawn our windows
imploded from the street.
Before the glaziers knocked, a breeze:
Blood-sweet draft of begonias
rising again from the iron grillwork
of our little yard.





Faith
 

When I cannot believe,
The brown herds still move across green fields
Into the tufty hills, and I was born
Higher, where I could watch them as a bird might.
When even memory seems imagined, what
Can I bring to prayer? A pair of knees.
The great faith that built a stair to heaven
As now my memory tries to climb a hill,
Becomes an old stone building, a deaf priest
Whose hand is in the pockets of his parish,
Who longs to buy a bell he'll never hear.
The water in the font is cold, I trace
A circle on my brow and not a cross.





Wasps' Nest
 

It was the fruit I wanted, not the nest. 
The nest was hanging like the richest fruit 
against the sun. I took the nest

and with it came the heart, and in my hand 
the kingdom and the queen, frail surfaces, 
rested for a moment. Then the drones

awoke and did their painful business. 
I let the city drop upon the stones. 
It split to its deep palaces and combs.

It bled the insect gold,
the pupa queens like tiny eyes
wriggled from their sockets, and somewhere

the monarch cowered in a veil of wings 
in passages through which at evening 
the labourers had homed,

burdened with silence and the garden scents.
The secret heart was broken suddenly.
I, to whom the knowledge had been given,

who was not after knowledge but a fruit, 
remember how a knot of pains 
swelled my hand to a round nest;

blood throbbed in the hurt veins 
as if an unseen swarm mined there. 
The nest oozed bitter honey.

I swaddled my fat hand in cotton. 
After a week pain gave it back to me 
scarred and weakened like a shrivelled skin.

A second fruit is growing on the tree.
Identical--the droning in the leaves.
It ripens. I have another hand.





Conceit
 

She spun a line. She knew he was listening to her. 
She spun it and he took the fraying ends. 
Whatever she was saying, it was cotton,

Then as he rolled the thread between 
Forefinger and thumb it turned to silk, 
And as he took the needle up to thread it

The line she spun became thin finest gold. 
He knew not to believe her but he took it 
Because she kept on spinning like the truth

Was ravelling from her lips; he watched her lips.
Cotton, silk and gold, she wanted him
To take the line and sew the wound right up

Although she held the blade still in her hand 
Behind her back, and it was dripping, steaming. 
There under his left arm the gash lay open

Like a mouth in disbelief. And he believed her.





Notes for the Cactus Poem
 

The teddy bear cholla and the fat fat


 

Oh buckthorn, devil, whipple, teddy bear




Oh beavertail, oh pancake, porcupine


 

Oh plump saguaro with your hairy arms, I love 
Each of you with a different nerve of heart. 
Especially you, so trim, so pert, your birds 
Cupped in your pits and crotches, little friends


 

Oh areoles and aureoles, the orioles
With yellow caps are havering and hot
Making themselves a breeze with their cut wings


 

I ask the docent and he indicates


 

Oh nation, how you might have been, spread from 
So sure an order, with such tendering love





Inordinate Desires
 

'I believe it would go ill with many of us, if we were faced with a strong temptation, and I suspect that with many of us it does go ill.'                                                                             --Ivy Compton Burnett
He set out on the innocent exodus. He went at Easter
In a lengthening dawn, and he did not count the days.
He was young. With the wooden comb his mother made him
He parted his hair in the middle (his beard was slow).
He was fair still, he glowed like a source of light.

There were so many priests about, there was too much singing;
He did not like God the Father who came from Rome
With his tattered son and the incomprehensible bird.
Easter for him was other kinds of rebirth,
But from the trees and streams, the uplands and valleys
He knew the native spirits dislodged, crowding the shore
To cross over like no longer immortal souls, lined up
Awaiting the ferry and the disgruntled boatman.
They did not intend to fade out to the sound of bells and choiring;
They would find a new woodland or water for haunt, untroubled
By candles and books and the tedious, meaningless Latin.

Without farewell before daybreak he left home. 
He pushed past the visible almost crowd on the shore, 
Divine shapes, scents, their sorrowful voices and silences. 
He murmured out of respect and they let him pass through. 
Goodbye he declared to them and to his country.

First he crossed the small sea in a leather coracle 
Pointing the blunt prow at what looked like mainland. 
The sea was glassy, he paddled with his palms, at landfall 
Made fire and warmed them, conjuring spirits of a new place. 
They gathered around to gaze at his lovely body. 
He abandoned his boat and clambered up the rocks.

He climbed a hill, a ridge, and then a mountain.
It was a protracted joy, that crossing away
From the small sea. Looking back, Ireland got littler.
Then it and the smooth water were lost to view
And never again did he see what had been home,
Hear its lilt, or receive news of his many brothers
Who bred, and banked their fields, who fished and hunted,
And made a tribe, a village and a nation.

The uplands were lush and full of fauna, the grass 
Deep, humming, and everywhere were gods, 
Their tears, their wounds and resurrections. Spring 
Smattered the glades, flecked and mottled with blossom, 
The wheeling birds shouted their emphatic prayer; 
And deer: that enormous stag with a broken antler; 
Wolves and wild cats, too, a bear he saw, red pheasants, 
And rooting through an oak wood, a tusky boar...

He walked in amazement (he did not count the days)
Reading the symbols, and cheerful local gods
Skipped and tumbled before him, showing the way
Across the very backbone of that mainland.
It was not England yet. It was wilderness.
He wrapped his feet in grass and leaves, in strips of leather;
He wore a leathern kilt and a stiff hide waistcoat
Fragrant with wear and weather. As he went along
He runed, was merry, it was almost like rhyming.
He climbed jet black mountains veined with silver falls,
Washed face and hands in the frenzied spray of those tarns,
Made the noises of a man free now of Christendom,
In the uncharted, unmarred wilderness, his sweet voice
Gracing the ears of insects, beasts and wild fowl
And the ears of the local spirits, Orpheus,
Or as Adam's must have done when he told the animals
Who they were in the first sunrise of the world,
Before Eve had been carved out of his rejoicing
To correct and contradict him, and the tall fruit tree
Stood safe in his obedience, when at evening
God himself, not his bloodied Son, walked out in starlight
And kissed his creature, and lay with him in the dark.

It was not, he began to know, an innocent exodus. 
It was the long route to exile, the way that hermits
Took to white martyrdom, alone with their God for ever. 
He was not like them: wild-hearted spirits of place 
Coaxed his credulous footsteps past the equinox.

On the eastern shore of what was becoming England
He saw far off kernels of cities, squat towers, spires;
Rough roads north and south, wagons groaning with stone,
And into meagre harbours boats and barges
Hugging the coast bore produce in and away.
That world was not for him, with its crosses and crossroads.

He saw steep islands dark in a bigger sea,
No man mark on them, no smoke, no stone quarry,
No furrows or shepherds, in their thin woods no traps.
It was summer now (he did not count the days),
He sat on the summit of the last hill and looked east
Wondering where on that island he would build
His round stone dwelling and give his mortal days
To local grace, the gods of leaf and stone,
With his soul configured to love, like a hearth, his heart
On fire but unconsumed because such promiscuous heat
Amazes and makes not cinders but rapture and language.
His dwelling would be a beacon, a land-star radiant
To a lowering ocean unbroken beyond the islands
As far as the eye. Shading his eyes, he went on his way.

He crossed the bad sands not knowing they were bad 
Between two tides, two islands, walking ankle deep, knee, 
Then up to the waist, the paps, until only his upturned face 
Floated on the water, the mouth crying out joyful spells, 
Eyes fixed on the sun, the flaxen hair fanned out 
Like rays of a lesser sphere. He could not swim 
But there was no need, a sea god hovered ahead, 
Sandals firm on the wave.
                                                       Emerging step by step 
He was new, it was autumn, his homelessness 
This island, these tilting rocks. He chose for his dwelling 
A high place with a view of nothing but east, 
The rows of waves impatient to crash on the boulders,
Where the storms might climb and burst over his reflections,
And the fowls of the air become familiars.

He set to work carting stones, gods gathered nearby 
Harkening, making crowns of nettle, spears of bone, 
A cup from a gourd, and a dish. Each day his dwelling 
Grew higher, like a hive for bees, a dome, a cranium. 
One day, it was the solstice, a final stone 
Closed the fontanel. The votary moved in. 
He gathered the crowns and spears, the cup and dish 
And laid out the new table for his guests.

Would the gods sit down beside at his first supper?
He looked for them, he called out praising their names.
They had all gone off somewhere. There was nowhere to go!
The tide was full and even the deep route hither
Had gone under waves, the mainland had vanished in fog.
He sat alone at his table. He sat alone.
The gods who had brought him were gone. He started counting
Day one was the day when things began to go.

He watched his shadow every morning, lengthening
Over the water, over the sand and stones,
And being washed and parched like a piece of laundry
Until it was white as a nightshirt spread to dry
On a gorse bush, fluttering a little, an empty sleeve,
Saying go on, go back, go on, go back
The way waves do, the way the tides do, also,
Or simply wind blows and the tide says nothing at all.

How clean the stones and the sand, the breaking waves, 
How clean the moonlight, the sunlight, and his lovely throat 
Young and in love--is it still young and in love?-- 
With the spirits, his voice pure as a bird's, but he's counting, 
The days are shortening, his voice is growing darker. 
Surely they listen out and watch their votary 
There on the verge of the cliff in his careful dance 
Like a gull whose wings are reliance, like a guillemot.

So he chanted, he praised and danced, and it was the end
Of autumn. For the first time cold, he telt the bones in his flesh.
Above him, north, with terror he saw the Lights
And it was a human shadow that towered in them,
A man on a cross, a man with a cross inside him
Instead of a skeleton; the cross was still and shimmered
As if it held its breath so as to observe him.

He was trembling, he saw the ghostly limbs
Behind the bright-dim curtain, those long wired veins
Through which pulse flickered and the wine flowed,
The chest breathed with almost no sound at all.
This figure had nothing to do with the gods who brought him,
Tugged at his heart, took their leave when most he needed.
This looked like the son of the god he had sought to elude,
Now a giant surveying a world and a singular man
Abandoned by everything he'd served, but nonetheless
Dancing and shivering above the scrum of waves.

Cities had grown on the mainland meanwhile, monks and priors, 
Grew fat; there were nuns and teachers, the farmsteads prospered. 
The places he'd passed through had roads now, stone towers and walls, 
Where he'd chanted to wilderness out of a pagan heart.

To the east there is nothing.The sleet blows in. 
It is so cold now, winter hardening. 
The days are counted and are counting down. 
After laud and joy, the radiance fading, 
Winter is here, and bidding becomes of the body, 
The rings of light, of fire, the rings of starlight. 
The votary tries his tongue to find what he means. 
He tries to speak with what has been refined. 
He has no words at all. The feet that led, the hands 
That rested on his head, arrested him, are nowhere. 
He was grown old and unremarkable, and now 
He knows desire. He knows desire as he has never 
Known any passion in his person before, he desires 
A voice, a touch. From his precipice soon 
Like a gannet he's to dive, or like a stone.

Winter has come indeed, and the stars, he's wasted, wasted.
No devil arrives to offer long life and kingdoms,
To touch his brow, to kiss him on the lips.
No gods return with prayer mats and chains of flowers,
With brands and blankets, with warm thick drinks, with lamplight,
With meat or fruit, with a breathing loaf or a lamb.
(In the coldest night someone does cover him
And when he wakes he finds
A fire alive in the hearth, his table laid
With biscuit, and in the gourd a mouthful of pure water.)

He is old, his matted beard dark, filthy. He has
Praised presence and absence and set his glow
Fading on the island's seaward face. When he starts dying,
That night, in the flickering of his chamber,
The Vikings steer five ships packed with warriors
Around the end of his island, using his glimmer
As lighthouse and marker, reaching their intended haven.

Had he survived that night, even afar he'd have felt
The heat of the conflagration, smelled apocalypse
As the pagans returned and the little gods came with them,
Clapping their hands and rejoicing, and rushed to the woods
To be with their trees and streams and hills and valleys
As the church spires collapsed, the monks and priors and priests
Fuel for bonfires, and until the Vikings withdrew
They were safe, divine again, though the shuddering Lights
Disclosed the tall cross and the watcher, smoke in his heart.

The island's dark, the darker now for his dying, 
Unmarked and unremarked. But someone covers his face, 
Is winding in coarse scented cloth the extinguished body, 
Having tidied the wild hair, parted it in the centre, 
And washed at last the limbs that longed to be touched. 
Someone rolls them to the cliff edge, lets them go east.





'You with the Knees of a Fish'
 

You with the knees of a fish,
You with the fish's ears, the tongue in your round
Mouth that's nibbling the sweet air,
You with a fish's patience, on your side
Under the hot plank ot the keel, hook in your lip,
And your tail twitching like a bothered lily,
And the taste of your own bleeding on the air, salt on the sweetness,
You with a fish's voice, singing and still
Your aria, and the blue-silver flecks of light,
The water's scales, breathing the breeze
Abundant and not for you, you with a hook,
Absurd, you with lidless mercuried eyes;
And the reel whistles, the tall man's cast at you.

Istanbul 1983
 

In the frozen square, the student asks me if I will
sell him the books from my backpack. He hides them
under his winter coat. Steam rises from the whole 
wheat rolls we break open at the breakfast table.
We drink hot apple tea and pronounce the skyline
"charming. In a jail a man counts the visible bones,
and recounts them in the blaze of morning. To turn
a self to light proves painful--each piece must
be dissected in turn; you pass through every feeling
imaginable, so many you might make a dictionary--
dread to disgust, delight to degradation. The prisoner
remembers wanting only to read as if in a fever--
running fingers over pyramids of words as if he might
translate himself from this life to a more vivid existence
in which he cuts open the pages with a knife in 
plain sight of everyone like a man eating meat and 
potatoes at the dinner table. Not that world; this one
where blue light and sharpened files, where identikit
and stamps on passports, where the book in his back-
pack is a crime, and I have sold him down the river
for ideas I barely value--the volumes flung carelessly
across my hotel room, while he picks mushrooms on
the edge of dread, pallid ghosts of what won't speak
or be spoken. Or where I remember what it is to 
be present in the world, and I turn away, unable to
bear it--so much light and dread, so much in the darkness
growing or simply how hard to ever remain in place.





The Red Shoes
 

Someone buried red slippers under the floorboards
and the mice nested in them. The floors splintered no matter

how many cans of deck paint we used. And one night
at the Embajada I broke a tooth, and the very next

night three teenagers were shot dead as they sat at
a booth by the window eating mofongo. The neighbor

woman used to sing a funny song from the forties
about a "road and "clear day, a fast car and a woman

with a pistol. You could see her back had been broken,
and she dragged her left foot behind her down the

stairs to the mail room. And Junior began smoking 
crack after his church on Columbus failed and started

going by his birth name which was Jesus, until he
fell in love with Irma of the hideous rabbit-fur-and-

white-leather jacket, who stopped the cars by waving
her watery hands, smoothing her moth-bitten hair

from her moon-pale face, the violet lipstick she 
always wore, until she wound up drowned in the East

River, and no one would say if it was suicide or
murder. But Junior said there were eels inside her and

began preaching again, doped on the corner. Mr.
Rodriguez fired him, though he didn't want to, and after

Mr. Rodriguez often looked sweaty and pale as he 
labored to move stuff to the basement, which he had once 

done with Junior to help him. We painted our rooms 
cinnamon, Aegean blue, repainted them eggshell, gris-perle.

We fought, and you tore all my letters and diaries and
sprinkled them out the window where they landed on

the roof of your car, plastered there by a violent 
summer storm. It took hours to scrape them off; I wept

and Mr. Rodriguez gave me a small plastic-wrapped
packet of Kleenex and a month later you wound up in St.

Luke's on lockdown and Junior caught pneumonia, 
died that November. He was thirty-eight, though we

had believed him older. They buried him in Calvary
Cemetery in Queens. Once I rode a cab out that way--

we got lost, so many ticking minutes among the
slender white spikes of the graves. The red slippers--

they must have been for dancing, thin soled as if with
mouse skin, a powder inside that might have been talc,

rosin, or years of plaster dust, a piece of broken ribbon,
black at the edges as if burned off or torn and smeared with

shoe polish. Or the mice had gnawed it. And you
said "The name of the film, and I said I thought it was a

story older by far, a girl who puts on the shoes and cannot
get them off, who skips down a road, then another and

across the world, until her feet fall off, and her hands
and they make her wooden ones.





The African Burial Ground
 

They came as Congo, Guinea, & Angola,
   feet tuned to rhythms of a thumb piano.
      They came to work fields of barley & flax,

livestock, stone & slab, brick & mortar,
   to make wooden barrels, some going
      from slave to servant & half-freeman.

They built tongue & groove--wedged
   into their place in New Amsterdam.
      Decades of seasons changed the city

from Dutch to York, & dream-footed
   hard work rattled their bones.
      They danced Ashanti. They lived

& died. Shrouded in cloth, in cedar 
   & pine coffins, Trinity Church
      owned them in six & a half acres

of sloping soil. Before speculators
   arrived grass & weeds overtook
      what was most easily forgotten,

& tannery shops drained there.
   Did descendants & newcomers
      shoulder rock & heave loose gravel

into the landfill before building crews
   came, their guitars & harmonicas
      chasing away ghosts at lunch break?

Soon, footsteps of lower Manhattan
   strutted overhead, back & forth
      between old denials & new arrivals,

going from major to minor pieties,
   always on the go. The click of heels
      the tap of a drum awaking the dead.





Envoy to Palestine
 

I've come to this one grassy hill
in Ramallah, off Tokyo Street,
to place a few red anemones
& a sheaf of wheat on Darwish's grave.
A borrowed line transported me beneath
a Babylonian moon & I found myself
lucky to have the shadow of a coat
as warmth, listening to a poet's song
of Jerusalem, the hum of a red string
Caesar stole off Gilgamesh's lute.
I know a prison of sunlight on the skin.
The land I come from they also dreamt
before they arrived in towering ships
battered by the hard Atlantic winds.
Crows followed me from my home.
My coyote heart is an old runagate
redskin, a noble savage, still Lakota,
& I knew the bow before the arch.
I feel the wildflowers, all the grasses
& insects singing to me. My sacred dead
is the dust of restless plains I come from, 
& I love when it gets into my eyes & mouth
telling me of the roads behind & ahead.
I go back to broken treaties & smallpox,
the irony of barbed wire. Your envoy
could be a reprobate whose inheritance
is no more than a swig of firewater. 
The sun made a temple of the bones
of my tribe. I know a dried-up riverbed
& extinct animals live in your nightmares
sharp as shark teeth from my mountains
strung into this brave necklace around
my neck. I hear Chief Standing Bear
saying to Judge Dundy, "I am a man,
& now I know why I'd rather die a poet
than a warrior, tattoo & tomahawk.





To Juan Doe #234
 

I only recognized your hair: short,
neatly combed. Our mother

would've been proud.
                            In the Sonoran desert
your body became a slaughter-

house where faith and want were stunned,
hung upside down, gutted. We

                                           were taught

to bring roses, to aim for the bush. Remember?
You tried to pork

a girl's armpit. In Border Patrol
                                          jargon, the word

for border crossers is the same whether
                            they're alive or dead.
When I read his flesh fell

off the bones, my stomach rumbled,
                                                      my mouth

watered. Yesterday, our mother said,
                           "My high heels are killing me.
Let's go back to the funeral.

                                           You were always

her favorite. Slow cooking a roast
melts the tough tissue between the muscle fibers;

tender meat remains.

                   Remember the time
I caught you pissing
                              on a dog? You turned

away from me. In the small of your back
I thought I saw a face.
                                         Split lip,

broken nose. It was a mask.
                            I yanked it from your flesh. 
              I wear it often.





My Brother My Wound
 

He was calling in the bulls from the street.
They came like a dark river--
a blur of chest and hoof--
everything moving, under, splinter--hooked
their horns through the walls. Light hummed
the holes like yellow jackets. My mouth
was a nest torn empty.

Then, he was at the table.
Then, in the pig's jaws--
he was not hungry. He was stop.
He was bad apple. He was choking.

So I punched my fists against his stomach.
Mars flew out
and broke open or bloomed--
how many small red eyes shut in that husk?

He said, Look. Look. And they did.

He said, Lift up your shirt. And I did.

He slid his fork beneath my ribs--
Yes, he sang. A Jesus side wound.
It wouldn't stop bleeding.
He reached inside
and turned on the lamp--

I never knew I was also a lamp--until the light
fell out of me, dripped down my thigh, flew up in me,
caught in my throat like a canary.
Canaries really means dogs, he said.

He put on his shoes.
You started this with your mouth, he pointed.
Where are you going? I asked.
To ride the Ferris wheel, he answered,
and climbed inside me like a window.





It Was the Animals
 

Today my brother brought over a piece of the ark
wrapped in a white plastic grocery bag.

He set the bag on my dining table, unknotted it,
peeled it away, revealing a foot-long fracture of wood.
He took a step back and gestured toward it
with his arms and open palms--

            It's the ark, he said.
            You mean Noah's ark? I asked.
            What other ark is there? he answered.

            Read the inscription, he told me,
            it tells what's going to happen at the end.
            What end? I wanted to know.
            He laughed, What do you mean, "what end?
            The end end.

Then he lifted it out. The plastic bag rattled.
His fingers were silkened by pipe blisters.
He held the jagged piece of wood so gently.
I had forgotten my brother could be gentle.

He set it on the table the way people on television
set things when they're afraid those things might blow-up
or go-off--he set it right next to my empty coffee cup.

It was no ark--
it was the broken end of a picture frame
with a floral design carved into its surface.

He put his head in his hands--

            I shouldn't show you this--
            God, why did I show her this?
            It's ancient--O, God,
            this is so old.

            Fine, I gave in, Where did you get it?
            The girl, he said. O, the girl.
            What girl? I asked.
            You'll wish you never knew, he told me.

I watched him drag his wrecked fingers
over the chipped flower-work of the wood--

            You should read it. But, O, you can't take it--
            no matter how many books you've read.

He was wrong. I could take the ark.
I could even take his marvelously fucked fingers.
The way they almost glittered.

It was the animals--the animals I could not take--

they came up the walkway into my house,
cracked the doorframe with their hooves and hips,
marched past me, into my kitchen, into my brother,

tails snaking across my feet before disappearing
like retracting vacuum cords into the hollows
of my brother's clavicles, tusks scraping the walls,

reaching out for him--wildebeests, pigs,
the oryxes with their black matching horns,
javelinas, jaguars, pumas, raptors. The ocelots
with their mathematical faces. So many kinds of goat.
So many kinds of creature.

I wanted to follow them, to get to the bottom of it,
but my brother stopped me--

            This is serious, he said.
            You have to understand.
            It can save you.

So I sat down, with my brother wrecked open like that,
and two-by-two the fantastical beasts
parading him. I sat, as the water fell against my ankles,
built itself up around me, filled my coffee cup
before floating it away from the table.

My brother--teeming with shadows--
a hull of bones, lit only by tooth and tusk,
lifting his ark high in the air.





Second Mouth
 

Other-lips     whispering     between my legs.
What they called black hole     not-thing
is really packed full of secrets.     A rebel mouth

testifying from the underside.     Careful
not to let it     speak too loudly.     Only hum
demure     in polite company--never laugh

or spit on the sidewalk     or complain 
lest we both be dragged     under the wheels of
one of those.     Or worse     coddled

smiled at     as at a lapdog acting wolf.
Or worse     called ugly     a cruel joke. Or--
there are always     worse things.

Too many messengers     shot.     But then
who wouldn't fear     an eyeless face
whose ghost stories     always     come true?





The Talk
 

Pretty soon we'll have the talk.
She'll ask me where babies come from
And I will lie to her:
"Babies come from the chance meeting of sperm and egg
See the man deposits his sssperm which is like a pudding 
into the woman's vvagina and it travels up this tube-y thing
and only one of them gets the prize and bing! A cell becomes
a fetus becomes baby becomes you.
Go do your homework.
She will wait for me to calm down,
her eyes patient requiring the truth
and I will tell her:
"Babies come from Friday nights melted into Saturday mornings;
the Isley Brothers and 3 or 4 glasses of white zin; miniskirts
and aching zippers; sofa cushions sweaty and ogodthecondombroke;
Babies come from blue lights and e.p.t. tests and the wet spot on clean sheets;
Lonely knees that bump beneath the table; love letters sealed
with a miss and $758 phone bills; eyeliner and lips to match; muscled
Thighs and a sweet, milky quarter of yes in the center of pink panties.
You came from this: a separated daddy and a desperate mama; 
A ripped sonogram and hours spent on hardwood floors asking girlfriends:
Should I go through with this?
Grandma's washboard and the dust tracks Grandaddy made when he
left her with five girls to maim

You came from this: Maryland rain, nights of shag carpet lovin' and days
Just $2 short of the rent;
And one afternoon you came
I wanted your father so badly it hurt
Even took his last name and flung it behind yours like a spare tire
Whatever he gave me was never enough
It was like his love was a sieve
And my desire for him
Water
I was insane
Packed my dreams in a U-Haul and moved them to MD
Nothing better to do
30 and scared
You came from this:
Collision of longing
Tongue kissing and shame
The emptiness at the corner of GA Avenue
And the fullness of swollen ankles and readjusted dreams
You came from:
A poet and a singer
Fists and car keys
Peach cobbler and gumbo
Love
And that last dirty fight on the Beltway
You came baby
You came, here

And she'll say:
"Mama, babies come from peach cobbler?
and I'll say
yes.





Everybody Has a Heartache: A Blues
 

In the United terminal in Chicago at five on a Friday afternoon
The sky is breaking with rain and wind and all the flights
Are delayed forever. We will never get to where we are going
And there's no way back to where we've been.
The sun and the moon have disappeared to an island far from anywhere.

Everybody has a heartache--

The immense gatekeeper of Gate Z100 keeps his cool.
This guardian of the sky teases me and makes me smile through the mess,
Building up his airline by stacking it against the company I usually travel:
Come on over to our side, we'll treat you nice.
I laugh as he hands me back my ticket, then he turns to charm
The next customer, his feet tired in his minimum wage shoes.

Everybody has a heartache--

The man with his head bobbing to music no one else can hear has that satisfied
Feel--a full belly of sweet and a wife who sings heartache to sleep.
In his luggage (that will be lost and never found) is a musty dream of flying
Solo to Africa, with a stop on the return to let go the stories too difficult to
Carry home. He'll take off his shoes to walk in a warm, tropical sea.
He'll sing to the ancestors:
Take me home to mama. No one cooks like her.
But all the mamas worked to the bone gone too young. 
Broken by The Man.

Everybody has a heartache-- 

Everyone's mouthing fried, sweet, soft and fat,
While we wait for word in the heart of the scrambled beast.
The sparkle of soda wets the dream core.
That woman over there the color of broth did what she was told.
It's worked out well as can be expected in a world
Where she was no beauty queen and was never seen,
Always in the back of someplace in the back--
She holds the newest baby. He has croup.
Shush, shush. Go to sleep, my little baby sheepie.
He sits up front of her with his new crop of teeth.

Everybody has a heartache--

This man speaks to no one, but his body does.
Half his liver is swollen with anger; the other half is trying
To apologize--
What a mess I've made of history, he thinks without thinking.
Mother coming through the screen door, her clothes torn,
Whimpering: It's okay baby, please don't cry.
Don't cry. Baby don't cry.
And he never cries again.

Everybody has a heartache--

Baby girl dressed to impress, toddles about with lace on this and ruffle on that--
Her mother's relatives are a few hundred miles away poised to welcome.
They might as well live on a planet of ice cream.
She's a brand new wing, grown up from a family's broken hope.
Dance girl, you carry our joy.
Just don't look down.

Everybody has a heartache--

Good-looking punk girl taps this on her screen
to a stranger she has never seen:
Just before dawn, you're high again beneath a marbled sky,
I was slick fine leather with a drink in my hand.
Flying with a comet messenger nobody sees.
The quick visitor predicts that the top will be the bottom
And the bottom will flatten and dive into the sea.
I want to tell her:
You will dine with the lobster king, and
You will dance with crabs clicking castanets. You will sleep-
Walk beyond the vestibule of sadness with a stranger
You have loved for years.

Everybody has a heartache--

This silence in the noise of the terminal is a mountain of bison skulls.
Nobody knows, nobody sees--
Unless the indigenous are dancing powwow all decked out in flash and beauty
We just don't exist. We've been dispersed to an outlaw cowboy tale.
What were they thinking with all those guns and those handcuffs
In a size for babies?
They just don't choose to remember.
We're here.

In the terminal of stopped time I went unsteady to the beat,
Driven by a hungry spirit who is drunk with words and songs.
What can I do?
I have to take care of it.
The famished spirit eats fire, poetry, and rain; it only wants love.

I argue:

You want love?
Do you even know what it looks like, smells like?

But you cannot argue with hungry spirits.

I don't know exactly where I'm going; I only know where I've been,
I want to tell the man who sifted through the wreck to find us here
In the blues shack of disappeared history--
I feel the weight of his heart against my cheek.
His hand is on my back pulling me to him in the dark, to a place
No soldiers can reach.
I hear the whoop-cries of warriors calling fire for a stand 
Against the brutality of forgetfulness--

Everybody has a heartache--

We will all find our way, no matter fire leaping through holes in jump time,
No matter earthquake, or the breaking of love spilling over the dreck of matter
In the ether, stacking one burden
Against the other--

We have a heartache.





ICE Agents Storm My Porch
 

The Indiscriminate Citizenry of Earth
are out to arrest my sense of being a misfit.
"Open up! they bellow,
hands quiet before my door
that's only wind and juniper needles, anyway.


You can't do it, I squeak from inside.
You can't make me feel at home here
in this time of siege for me and mine, mi raza.
Legalized suspicion of my legitimacy
is now a permanent resident in my gut.


"Fruit of the prickly pear! they swear,
striding up to my table
to juice me a glass of pink nectar.
They've brought welcome baskets
stuffed with proof I'm earthling.


From under a gingham cover,
I tug a dark feather
iridescing green--cohering
to "magpie thought,
to memory's chatter,
to mind. Mine.


And here they have my mind translated
into a slate-surfaced pond, which
vibrates in the shape
of a cottonwood's autumn molt,
which trees me to dirt, which soils me
heat & freeze--


But you'll always be
one definitive document short! I complain.
Doubts can forever outstrip
your geo-logic.


For which they produce
a lock of my natal dust,
bronzed
to the fluttering fiber
of lacebark pine.


Where'd they get that stuff?


The baskets are bottomless,
and it's useless for me to insist
on being distinct.
Undergoing re-portation,
I'm awakened to a Center,


where walls
between all beings
are dreamt to dissolve.

She pressed her ear against the shell:
she wanted to hear everything
he never told her.



2


A single inch
separates their two bodies
facing one another
in the picture:
a framed smile
buried beneath the rubble.




3


Whenever you throw stones
into the sea
it sends ripples through me. 




4


My heart's quite small:
that's why it fills so quickly.




5


Water needs no wars
to mix with water
and fill up spaces.




6


The tree doesn't ask why it's not moving
to some other forest
nor any other pointless questions.

He watches tv
while she holds a novel.
On the novel's cover
there's a man watching tv
and a woman holding a novel.




8


On the first morning
of the new year
all of us will look up
at the same sun.




9


She raised his head to her chest.
He did not respond:
he was dead.




10


The person who gazed at me for so long,
and whose gaze I returned for just as long ...
That man who never once embraced me,
and whom I never once embraced...
The rain wrecked the colors around him
on that old canvas.




11


He was not with the husbands
who were lost and then found;
he did not come with the prisoners of war,
nor with the kite that took her,
in her dream,
to some other place,
while she stood before the camera
to have her smile
glued into the passport.




12


Dates piled high
beside the road:
your way
of kissing me.




13


Rapunzel's hair
reaching down
from the window
to the earth
is how we wait.




14


The shadows
the prisoners left
on the wall
surrounded the jailer
and cast light
on his loneliness.




15


Homeland, I am not your mother,
so why do you weep in my lap like this
every time
something hurts you?




16


Never mind this bird:
it comes every day
and stops at the branch's edge
to sing for an hour
or two.
That's all it does:
nothing makes it happier.




17


House keys, 
identity cards,
faded pictures among the bones ...
All of these are scattered
in a single mass grave.




18


The Arabic language
loves long sentences
and long wars.
It loves never-ending songs
and late nights
and weeping over ruins.
It loves working
for a long life
and a long death.




19


Far away from home--
that's all that changed in us.




20


Cinderella left her slipper in Iraq
along with the smell of cardamom
wafting from the teapot,
and that huge flower,
its mouth gaping like death.




21


Instant messages
ignite revolutions.
They spark new lives
waiting for a country to download,
a land that's little more
than a handful of dust
when faced with these words:
"There are no results that match your search.




22


The dog's excitement
as she brings the stick to her owner
is the moment of opening the letter.




23


We cross borders lightly
like clouds.
Nothing carries us,
but as we move on
we carry rain,
and an accent,
and a memory
of another place.




24


How thrilling to appear in his eyes.
She can't understand what he's saying:
she's too busy chewing his voice.
She looks at the mouth she'll never kiss,
at the shoulder she'll never cry on,
at the hand she'll never hold,
and at the ground where their shadows meet.





Good Friday
 

Jesus, I want my sins back.
My prattle, pride, and private prices--
climbing, clinching, clocking--

I might loan you a few for the evening, 
so you don't show up at your own crucifixion
naked of all purpose.

But for God's sake, don't spill any
redemption on them! They're my
signature looks. Body by Envy.

Make up & wardrobe provided by Avarice. Lord,
if you take away my inordinate cravings,
what the hell's left? Do you know

how much I paid for my best rages?
I want them all back if they're
so To Die For. Else shred my palms,

wash my face with spit, let the whip 
unlace my flesh and free the naked blood, 
let me be tumbled to immortality

with the stew of flood debris
that is my life.





ICC Kenya Trials: Witness
 

was it so I could 
never say 
across a courtroom
that man, the one
standing there

was it so you could
walk among us again
after
as if you had shed
the body that did
those things

was it because you could
not bear 
my pupils so huge
they would have swallowed you
my whites like flayed kneecaps

when you pressed down 
to singe them back
into my skull they were softer
than you expected
you had thought them
diamond hard
weapons turned on you

was it so you could
imagine a time
when you would be human
again among humans
that you had to leave
some of us 
alive?





What Could Have Happened
 

I doubt ... this is where I find it extremely difficult ... no government worth its salt plans to massacre its people. No. What could have happened is something went wrong when they were on the ground.

Have I spent too much time worrying about the boys
killing each other to pray for the ones who do it
with their own hands?

Is that not black on black violence?
Is that not a mother who has to bury her boy?

Is it not the same play?
The same plot & characters?

            The curtain rises, then:

                          a womb
                          a boy
                          a night emptied of music
                          a trigger
                          a finger
                          a bullet

            then:

                          lights.

It always drives the crowd to their feet.

An encore
of boy after boy
after sweet boy           --their endless, bloody bow.

They throw dirt on the actors like roses
until the boys are drowned by the earth

& the audience doesn't remember
what they're standing for.

Attenuate the Loss and Find
 

For Adrienne Rich
[Our burden to carry as she did
shift the weight of song, heft and gnosis
"body poetics
as a total event
her fullness rare in the amnesiac Kulchur
awake, awareness & urgency when poetry serves]
name appears
everywhere and in dream
body armor removed

what now, legacy, archivum
we female archons preserve of
intensity a durance a hand you recognize
(sounds sound)
assurance as lives on

drank of that
drank of this
almost suffocated, then drowned
downed but never

what only she could only know
as herself living in the brute time

speak of a syntax of rendition?
the politics of Empire chip away
as poetry attests, give it up

curve of a water-starved globe
to follow and be following?

racism, sexism, struggle

everything in intense grasp of
consciousness--cut in crystal observation
for her rapid and perched intellectus
privacy opens to vibrant light

this is stuff of Eros, of empathy
passionate edge of Adrienne
the American Skeptic

I feel you consociational in this light
a term of anthropology, to study
intersections in the annals we share

intergenerational, interspecies, interlanguage

move in parallelograms

getting it right as she did

The Skin of Sleep
 

The skin of sleep
is thin. It will not hold.
Its contents stumble out.
A nub of bone
lodged in earth
at the bottom of a pit.
A stranger staring
down from the rim.
The skin of sleep is thin.
It cannot hold.
Lost names spill out.
Children engraved
in ash. A sea of blood.
Only you, tenderness,
stillborn, beneath
the skin of sleep.





From "Citizen
 

/
You are in the dark, in the car, watching the black-tarred street being swallowed by speed; he tells you his dean is making him hire a person of color when there are so many great writers out there. 
You think maybe this is an experiment and you are being tested or retroactively insulted or you have done something that communicates this is an okay conversation to be having. 
Why do you feel okay saying this to me? You wish the light would turn red or a police siren would go off so you could slam on the brakes, slam into the car ahead of you, be propelled forward so quickly both your faces would suddenly be exposed to the wind.
As usual you drive straight through the moment with the expected backing off of what was previously said. It is not only that confrontation is headache producing; it is also that you have a destination that doesn't include acting like this moment isn't inhabitable, hasn't happened before, and the before isn't part of the now as the night darkens and the time shortens between where we are and where we are going.
/
When you arrive in your driveway and turn off the car, you remain behind the wheel another ten minutes. You fear the night is being locked in and coded on a cellular level and want time to function as a power wash. Sitting there staring at the closed garage door you are reminded that a friend once told you there exists a medical term--John Henryism--for people exposed to stresses stemming from racism. They achieve themselves to death trying to dodge the build up of erasure. Sherman James, the researcher who came up with the term, claimed the physiological costs were high. You hope by sitting in silence you are bucking the trend.
/
When the stranger asks, Why do you care? you just stand there staring at him. He has just referred to the boisterous teenagers in Starbucks as niggers. Hey, I am standing right here, you responded, not necessarily expecting him to turn to you.
He is holding the lidded paper cup in one hand and a small paper bag in the other. They are just being kids. Come on, no need to get all KKK on them, you say.
Now there you go, he responds.
The people around you have turned away from their screens. The teenagers are on pause. There I go? you ask, feeling irritation begin to rain down. Yes, and something about hearing yourself repeating this stranger's accusation in a voice usually reserved for your partner makes you smile.
/
A man knocked over her son in the subway. You feel your own body wince. He's okay, but the son of a bitch kept walking. She says she grabbed the stranger's arm and told him to apologize: I told him to look at the boy and apologize. And yes, you want it to stop, you want the black child pushed to the ground to be seen, to be helped to his feet and be brushed off, not brushed off by the person that did not see him, has never seen him, has perhaps never seen anyone who is not a reflection of himself.
The beautiful thing is that a group of men began to stand behind me like a fleet of bodyguards, she says, like newly found uncles and brothers.
/
The new therapist specializes in trauma counseling. You have only ever spoken on the phone. Her house has a side gate that leads to a back entrance she uses for patients. You walk down a path bordered on both sides with deer grass and rosemary to the gate, which turns out to be locked.
At the front door the bell is a small round disc that you press firmly. When the door finally opens, the woman standing there yells, at the top of her lungs, Get away from my house. What are you doing in my yard?
It's as if a wounded Doberman pinscher or a German shepherd has gained the power of speech. And though you back up a few steps, you manage to tell her you have an appointment. You have an appointment? she spits back. Then she pauses. Everything pauses. Oh, she says, followed by, oh, yes, that's right. I am sorry.
I am so sorry, so, so sorry.

Mosaic
 

I'm a'kickin' but not high,and I'm a'flappin' but I can't fly.          --Florence Church
A carpet of light, the
ocean alive < half a moon
muting the stars.

I tell myself
despair    is just

a bad attitude: Get up,
I say. Look--
and the shimmer

spends its name
in my head.
_____


These days    midlife
holds the jagged edge:

my nephew in prison,
a prisoner > friends insane

with work or sick
of trying to be loved,

my parents handing over their lives
like evidence: my good mother,

her mind     a trail of crumbs
in a woods flocked with birds.


                    --/--


To raise a child    break it
like a wild horse--
bend the will: get up,
get dressed.

I remember Emlen School
staring me down, my lunch box,
September:
the spiked fence freshly painted.

Then, the goodbye from my mother
who'd fought my hard hair,
lipstick like mist on my cheek.

                    --/--

That instant when eyes meet
and slide away--even love
blinks, looks off

like a stranger.

With: Who are you
with?

                    --/--

I suspect     everything.

Outside the air moves
a giant bird I cannot see.

Still laced in this
brown body: my aging heart--
a-loom     a-loomdoom-- 
still minds my thoughts,

but rolls his eyes.
_____


To see >< to be seen:  the life
of the visible.  Don't be shy.

Glances pick my face.

Once, I was a sperm and an egg,
but they didn't see me.

                    --/--

Too small to walk
alone: I held

my father's index
finger. Philadelphia police

caped in their black
jackets--big badges     almost

hungry--looking at us.

                    --/--

In a mall: say a food court
on Saturday     or a stadium
just before the game.

There's this drone, this
steady, muttering thrum

punctured by
packages--plastic this,
paper that--torn and torn.

"It's hard not to be hungry.

                    --/--

Time     for bed: my
mother reading The
Three Little Pigs, doing
all the voices. Remember
the pictures--those piggy
pants and shirts?

                    --/--

When you     see me,
what is that

image in the eye?
Solid ghosts, we are pictured
here--in the lit world.

Visible: we want to be seen: skin,
fancy legs     shoes and hats.

To want > to be seen and
wanted. Nice lips with a moist

sheen. Eyes, like mouths.
_____


What tortures, what tortures
me is     the question: what
are other people     thinking?

I keep watch--a vast horde
of Nikes has landed, running

sea     to shining sea.

                    --/--

In America skin was
where you belonged,     a who

you were     with, a reason

someone might: how--at the

parties     of hands unknown--

astonishing deaths
could meet you.

                    --/--

In Joy's arms, I believed
in perfect company, in the silk
of Her mouth--I believed:

my body off
the clock, my spine
all for touch.
_____


Six years old, I sang
like a chickadee. My father

slapped me for handing him
the scissors

wrong. What did I know?
What did I know?

                    --/--

Manuela
 

For Ofelia Camacho Delgado
She wakes to the odor of sheep,
trying to rub it off her hands.
Dressed up in her native colors,
standing by a tourist van, she is
a dandelion, golden like the alpaca
woven buttons of her sweater.
She is done with the tourists
taking her photo, holding a baby lamb.

Without official papers in a new country,
she briskly walks, and obscenely slow,
a foreign tongue slithers by; its scales are
the words she has not yet learned to trust.
The baby girl hiding in her belly's nest
will learn Quechua first, runa.                      the people

The sick horses are pushed off
the deck of a ship bound for Cuba.
Pursuing, their heads bobbing,
clearing the salt from their nostrils,
they kick. As long as they can,
they swim in the rushing swells, falling
behind the ship's scent, swine and men.

Know someone who needs their spirits lifted?
Why not try a lavender or a rose scent?

At the end of a hallway, a machine rattles
and spits out ice cubes, some dropping,
transparent on the dull vines of the carpet.
Manuela pushes a cart of towels, shampoo, 
lotion, and soap bars scented with rose oil.
Glancing down at the "Do Not Disturb" signs,
she walks past the banker taking his third shower
and the mother nursing her twins on a blanket
spread across the floor. The peepholes are
silent as a pile of dirty pillows, some dark
never blinking, others bullet holes of light.
Before leaving the Day's Inn on Mt. Vernon,
she steals a few soap bars for her daughter,
who places them in her dresser drawers,
scenting her lingerie, fresh as cut flowers.

A dandelion's root, far deeper,
tolerant of drought and poor soil,
is not an easily uprooted presence.

Manuela hears the creaking of planks,
the flapping of sails, and horses stomping,
nervous, eyeing the full moon. She sees
the marks of hooves in the sand, marks
coming out from the sea and vanishing inland.
She wakes to that odor again.

This time she stands beside her Incan city,
its green peaks cutting the sky open,
painted on La Carreta Restaurant's wall.
Her daughter is taking her photo,
saying, "Sonre, Mami, sonre."                        "Smile, Mom, smile."

The blindfolded horses are hoisted on board
in belly slings, and their feet are tied,
slightly touching the deck, suspended
for most of the voyage, but once on land
some will escape and revert to the wild.

Know someone who needs their spirits lifted?
Why not try a lavender or a rose scent?

She lets the desert in, wild sage.
The desert takes her back home
while a farmer's pig crosses the highway.
She sees her fake ID fly off the dashboard.
The wheels of her upside-down car spin:
Suspended, buckled to her seat, feet dangling,
she spots the moon on the shards
of her windshield, frozen tears, 
the peepholes blinking back at her.

Death touches down like a hoof.
A gust of wind pushes the seeds
of dandelions upward, a flock of white,
a gauze gown drifting over yuccas.
Memory is the scent of soap bars
taking refuge in a daughter's drawer.





El Tigre Market
 

As apparent as the rest, the asphalt cracks
are crowded with yellow weeds, the rust goes
beyond its bleeding color, and the lot's rails,
battered by cars, cast larger bars by noon.
On one side of the market someone painted
a row of flower pots, hanging geraniums
for the locals who must now go across town.
As apparent as the rest, El Tigre walks upright,
wears a tiny sombrero and sarape, and pushes
a grocery cart full of food. His painted stripes
are starting to flake like the bounty he wheels
for the families drifting into the parking lot
off 3rd Street and next to the train station
still waiting to the retrofitted for the big one.





Peculiar Properties
 

On my cutting board, I discovered them,
the tiniest of ants, roaming dots of lead.
At first, they were too few to classify, hiding
under crumbs, these scavengers of leftovers.
Admiring their labor, I immediately granted them
citizenship, these tailgaters of a kitchen's routines.

In Miami, I had no stove, working far from my home.
My wife was a midnight call to San Bernardino.
While searching for crumbs, especially for 
the taste of apricot jelly, they fell into a line
across my cutting board; I saw it again,
saw the line my sixth-grade teacher drew
on the board, pointing to each end.

While he planted himself on his desk, he leaned
his face toward us, telling us in a low voice:

"You don't see it yet, you're too young
still, but that line in front of you continues
infinitely on either side. And if there is
the slightest slope in that line, either way,
it will slowly begin to sag, then curve and veer
and eventually one end will find the other.

And lines, lines are never perfect, they are
like us, never completely straight. So just
imagine the searching that goes on all
around us, every day. And to happen on
that union is really to witness the most earthly
of forms you'll ever get to know. If you're lucky,
you'll see that, even luckier if you're part
of that union."





A Point West of Mount San Bernardino
 

For Father Bob
I.

            By the road she hovers in heat waves,
            propped up on a cinderblock wall,
            revived by mixed house paints,
            fending for herself like wild mint.

She is behind your shoulder,
a blind spot, your city's poverty.
A figure waits under a freeway ramp,
gesturing as if she knows you.

                        The fences and lots have the same dogs,
                        peering through the chain-links, curious.

            While at the hospital, you see kids play another
            game of tag outside the emergency room doors
            and know how fingerprints squander their ridges
            and how digital minutes dry up under a glare.

II.

A stump is all that is left of a surveyor's point,
a ponderosa pine in the foothills that started
the city's perfect grid.
                                             The sidewalks of Baseline
need more than a grocery bag's empty belly,
plastic, a ripped-up flame standing and calling
out to an old preacher like yourself.
                                                           By the cameras
mounted on the street lights, you wonder
if they recorded the street sinking in the eyes
of the woman who died on a bus bench.

You pause in front of a freshly painted sign
that says "Wrong Way," and see a sign within
a sign, a resistance to the newest strip mall,
the black lettering unevenly spaced and painted,
a homespun warning to keep moving on.





The Evidence is Everywhere
 

I.

The Santa Anas, childlike and profound,
blanket me; I see the dust stirring the valley
and clouding downtown San Bernardino;
I feel the sting of your loss.

The black oak leaves, brittle, tumbling,
crack under my feet. Is your hand
touching the dryness of my lips?

You sing: "Don't sit, mountain-still,
a coyote skull whistling."

I tug at the skin on my wrist, trying
to peel off the seam, my stubbornness.

On Sunday, I wear my only
decent dress, gypsy-green.
I hear heels scurry around me,
Our priest is a hinged tongue,
his verse tucking us in.

Why can't I focus on anyone's face?


II.

The winds fly from a canyon's belly
into a peasant blouse.

A stampede of leaves and twigs rushes by
a patch of grass, scraping across a sidewalk
and dragging their nails, fierce and defiant
as a local poet's words.

From the sides of mountains, waterfalls
of dust form, and during my pilgrimage,
the fate of lip-stained Styrofoam cups
will not unnerve me. Not worried
about compasses, I'll go by fences guarding
abandoned lots, through desperate patches of grass,
yellowing, past one-legged billboards of paper
and glue. Resting under the shade of bus stops,
I'll recite old tales to ward off the haunted
and the debris of family floods piling up.

When the voices on an updraft emphatically
circle like red-tailed hawks, I'll recall
the tail of a comet urging you to wrap 
yourself in its flames and dissolve.
Entranced by a burning equal to yours,
I'll walk eighty miles, traveling the routes
of my childhood candy wrappers.


III.

In the moisture
of a dirt road I traveled,
you are the rain that visited
the night before.

Does your tongue sense
the heat of bodies flying
in the Santa Anas?

Again, I am lost tracing
your face, a dry playa,
the eyes of clay, a brown
maze of upward glances.

Are you a creek bridge,
a fallen cedar, lodged
between sunbaked boulders
inviting me to cross?

You are the one
taking away my fear
of being wheeled down
a hallway without doors.


IV.

With twigs in my hair, I was found
somewhere near the national forest.
Bystanders pulled back their sniffing dogs
while I stood, barefoot and tired.

When I predicted earthquakes in China,
Peru and Cucamonga, California,
I baffled my psychiatric ward.

After a nurse removed my handout
of The Seasons: Winter, wildlife appeared
on the hospital grounds. A mule deer's 
antlers surfaced in the parking lot,
weaving among the staff's cars.
A coyote leaped into the patients' garden
and howled under a security light
as if to say: "I am here. Where are you?"
A roadrunner scooted across a lot,
losing one of its long tail feathers.
All this had the staff checking again
if their office windows were latched.

In my notebook, I drew a coy face
with blurry dots for eyes that peer out
of a hollow trunk, struck by lightning, 
charred by fire, with smoke still rising
under your vaulted sky.


V.

Outside my window,
                the sky is suddenly
draped by a hum,
                a hummingbird's hunger.
Her wings wrinkle the sky.
                             Unlike
a chickadee too busy
and full of seed chatter,
               the hummingbird
puffs up the air,
feeding like a storm,
a redness, a sideway rocket
            past the world's ear.

That spark reminds me of you.

Thin-rooted, lingering too
long, absorbed in window
reveries, I'll be released. Here,
the soil is moist, sponge-like,
storing. Worms surface,
               digesting their way up.
I, too, am ready
for the driving winds
               of another season.





First Thought
 

best thought, you had taught
me -- a river runs through it,
the foot of the soul standing
stubbornly in the freeze, all
the shards of ice crumpling up
the banks, what survives
in the ignorance. Play it away.
Be ceremony. Be a lit candle
to what blows you. Outside,
the sun gives a favorite present,
mountain nests in ironic meadows,
otter takes off her shoes, the small
hands of her feet reaching, reaching; still,
far away people are dying. Crisp
one dollar bills fold another life.
You taught me to care in the moment,
carve day into light, or something,
moving in the west that doesn't destroy
us. Look again, in the coming summer,
the cruelest month alive still eats up
the hours. Regret is an uneven hand,
a rough palm at the cheek -- tender
and calloused. I drink another glass
of water, turn on the tap
for what grows, for you,
for what lasts, for the last
and the first found thought of you.





Stenciled Memories
 

for Gra'ma
There was always fabric in your lap 
and a whistle in your heart. A sweet 
sap to be sucked waited in the garden. 
Nymphs of newts nestled under rock, 
your role as She Who Brings the Waters 
intact. Between the trilling of the crickets 
educating into the night and the sad sack 
of cans in the mornings something grew, 
flourished in the dark -- vines as sturdy 
as telephone wire writhed in the breezes. 
You patched together a blanket of us, 
sewed together the mismatched and lopped 
off edges. And anger grew a twin, ripped 
through the bermuda grass, something stubborn 
and determined: Me, in a leather patchwork skirt, 
the bitter lemon song returning to its beginning 
over and over on the Howdie Doody phonograph, 
a handful of bandages, a faceful of ghosts 
delivered from the mirrors. How did you stand it? 
All of it. Us crunching through your set life, 
kids scuffling through the mounds of leave. 
Always making do. Your sunshine eyes, 
those stenciled memories where 
we still live.

Independence Day 2010
 

Can be cracked or am that       you didn't 
consider me or I thought so 
recovering in a nap     You took the 4th 
of July beers

   In the movie 
she was Asian and playing an Asian 
part   singing white on white in the white 
room

      I want to strum 
or mask this day

Ask a question
of the large "picture window

to think of the napalmed girl 
in the picture





Night Work
 

All summer, the city engine's low 
roar capsizes our bodies into sleep, 
groans,
                evacuation--
                                                   Lost to a watery 
anamnesis so warm it requires a raft 
thatched from death's
                                         flotsam to necklace its shore

                              I swim on, calling your name

In my dreams, something is always deserting

But tonight, no fast shadows of birds
No oceanic flowers disrobing butterflies
or bright beach of child's porridge and bones--

                                                                                 Instead, someone weaving

a net from fallen hair in and around our bed 
to catch the breath, blood, and ritual 
motions that oiled us
                                            as one candle in a cave

In your dreams, someone is always resisting being saved

My teeth are on fire, you say I said

Don't fly for the labyrinth, once
I thought you were admonishing me to go away
I don't remember most others, a thousand seasons 
phonographed in through a wounded window

Everyone can't have a cactus

Just o.k. empty all the rice from my legs

Once I awoke screaming, paws red-hot embers
You opened my mouth and poured a night-cold river in

Once you died and my heart fished all winter

Once we were eating lunch inside a kiln

Once you thought you smelled death,
but the lavender farm was too large to shave

On the fifth straight morning I'd dreamt of water 
I stared at your face, its nacreous lids, 
and I swear I could see a Glorious Ghost shifting 
over your sun-warm waves

Water my birth sign, and one day my mother's death 
that protect-fills my love with sadness

There, in words to my coworkers 
it was still dripping, in my nods 
over a galapagos of pages and forms

All love is immigrant, that autumn apparently 
I mumbled

Your reply, after days: Turn off the steam in the trees

Somewhere right now, two lovers are conversing 
without even knowing what their lives mean

One's heart gazelle-quick to survey a mountain his dead
              father is always vandalizing 
The other frequently misplacing her hair, ears, or self-
sabotaging a crime

One usually struggling to stay alive 
The other often untethering something

Or is it my mitochondria that powder-sugars the moon? 
And you calcifying a promise inside to inscribe?

There is a dominion where inverses
invert until only terror, love, and imagination cling,

heavy, on human branches--enter your vista, phylum 
unsequenced, dimmer deeds

Can you hear it tonight?
Wind in iron jars buried inside the living:
Grandmothers, past spouses, cable men, priests

Now! I finally manage
as our train smokes out all the rats on their bed of leaves

All night, I dive
down to the soft structures of some blue civilization's faith

In this myth of life, I keep forgetting whose ideas and 
              sensations I'm supposed to be

Come morning: rain, trees, silvery 
sleet
              and daily, this new fresh bounty
                                                                        we share, side by side
like angels coming home from work at a pearl factory





If in America
 

Hmong Hunter Charged with 6 MurdersIs Said to Be a Shaman --new york times
If a tree falls in a forest, 
does it make a sound?

If a rifle fires a shot in the woods, 
whose body first hits the ground?

If a group of angry hunters 
surrounds, curses at, and accosts you 
for wandering onto their land

If you apologize for being lost,
inform you saw no posted signs, swallow
their chinks this and gooks taking over that;
are walking away over mud and fallen leaves when a loud
crack far behind you kicks up black earth

If your father was conscripted to fight
on the side of the United States
for the cia during the war in Vietnam

If he, your mother, you--the oldest son--
and all your younger siblings were later abandoned
in the hills of Laos as targets for genocide by the Viet Cong

If after five years in a Thai refugee camp, 
you come to this land as a teen, a casualty 
of history and time, then receive three years 
of training to become a sharpshooter 
in the u.s. military

If you spent your adolescence watching blacks, 
Asians, Latinos, and whites watching one 
another watch each other for weakness and flaws

If, after this first blast, you wheel 
around in a bright orange vest; glimpse 
in that split second an angry, possibly 
inebriated man lowering or resighting his rifle

If, in that icy moment, you recall 
the Native friend you used to collect cans with; 
once watched his three-hundred-pound father 
unload himself from a Chevy Impala and chase 
the boy down University with a ball-peen hammer

If, of your own children, your quietest 
son lately lacks the wherewithal at school 
to defend himself; and your oldest daughter 
has always been for some inexplicable reason 
ashamed of you

If hunting for you is not just a sport;
never a time to drink beers
with friends in a cabin, but rather
is a factor in considering your family's winter protein consumption

If you believe in God, but not the good in everyone

If you hate to think about this shit, because
why the fuck is it always on you
to preprove your loyalty and innocence?

If--frightened for your life and
the livelihood of your immediate and extended
family--in that split second, you reel
and train your own gun back at the far face
of that vapory barrel now aiming at your own

If, yes, you are sometimes angry and so look forward
to escaping your truck driver's life on certain
designated dates, on certain designated
lands, not always clearly demarcated, but always clearly stolen
from the ancestors of fat drunk red men
so confused they chase their own firey songs
in the form of their sons

Stolen from generations of skewed black backs, 
hunched your whole life on street corners laughing 
and picking their bones

Stolen from the paychecks of your brown coworker 
social security ghosts

Stolen like your own people 
from mountains in one land 
only to be resettled and resented here 
in projects and tenements

If you barely finished high school, but you know
from all you've ever seen of this system
Might Makes Right,
and excuses, treaties, and cover-ups
appear the only true code inscribed on most white men's souls

If, after such slurs, pushes, and threats in these woods
it is now also on you to assess
if that far rifle still locked on your face
just issued a mistake, a warning
shot, or murderous attempt--
                                    and the answer is:
your military muscle fibers 
act

If you then spot three four five six seven? other
hunters now scattering for their atvs
and, of course--if a gook,
don't be a dumb one--
scattering now also for their weapons

If you are alone in this land,
on foot, in miles of coming snow, wind, and branches
and don't even know
in which direction you'd run

If from birth you've seen
what men with guns, knives,
and bombs are capable of doing
for reasons you never wanted to understand

If in this very same county's court of all-white 
witnesses, counsel, judge, and jurors 
it will forever be your word against theirs 
because there was no forensic testimony 
over who shot first

If, yes, sometimes you can hear voices,
not because you're insane, but
in your culture
you are a shaman, a spiritual healer,
though in this very different land
of goods and fears, your only true worth
seems to be as a delivery man and soldier

If, upon that first fateful exchange in these woods,
your instinct, pushing pin to
balloon, were to tell you it's now
either you and your fatherless family of fourteen,
or all of them

Would you set your rifle down;
hope the right, the decent,
the fair thing on this buried American soil
will happen?

Or would you stay low, 
one knee cold, and do 
precisely as your whole life 
and history have trained?

And if you did,
would anyone even care
what really happened

that afternoon
eight bodies plummeted
to earth like deer?





Poetry Is a Sickness
 

You write not what you want,
but what flaws flower from rust

You want to write about the universe,
how the stars are really tiny palpitating ancestor hearts
watching over us

and instead what you get on the page
is that car crash on Fourth and Broadway--
the wails of the girlfriend or widow,
her long lamentation so sensuous
in terrible harmony with sirens in the distance

Poetry is a sickness

You want to write about Adoration,
the glistening sweat on your honey's chest
in which you've tasted the sun's caress,
and instead what you get
is a poem about the first of four times
your mother and father split up

Want to write about the perfection of God 
and end up with just another story 
of a uniquely lonely childhood

If I had a dime for every happy poem I wrote 
I'd be dead

Want to write about the war, oppression, injustice,
and look here, see, what got left behind
when all the sand and dust cleared
is the puke-green carpet in the Harbor Lights Salvation Army treatment center
A skinny Native girl no older than seventeen
braids the reddish hair
of her little four- or five-year-old Down's Syndrome daughter

Outside, no blinking stars
No holy kiss's approach
Only a vague antiseptic odor and Christian crest on the wall staring back at you

I didn't say all this to that dude who sent me his poems 
from prison

You want everyone to feel empowered
Want them to believe there is beauty locked in amber
inside each of us, and you chip away at that shit
one word at a time
You stampede with verbs, nouns, and scalpel adjectives
Middle-finger your literalist boss
Blow grocery cash on library fines
Sprain your left knee loading pallets all day for Labor Ready
You live in an attic for nine years
You go bankrupt
You smoke too much


Drink too much
Alienate family and friends
Say yes, poetry is a sickness, but fuck it
Do it long enough, and I promise like an anti-superhero
your secret power will become loss

Loss like only old people must know 
when the last red maple on the block goes

and the drizzle turns to snow

Maybe the best poem is always the one you shouldn't have written

The ghazal that bled your index finger
Or caused your sister to reject your calls for a year
The sonnet that made the woman you loved fear
That slam poem you're still paying for
The triolet that smiled to violate you
through both ears

But Poet, Sucker, Fool
It's your job
to find meaning in all this because
you are delusional enough to believe
that, yes, poetry is a sickness,
but somehow if you can just scrape together enough beauty and truth

to recall, yes, that Broadway car crash was fucked up, 
but the way the rain fell to wash away the blood 
not ten minutes after the ambulance left 
was gorgeous

Or how maybe your mother and father would sometimes scream, 
but also wrapped never-before-seen tropical 
fruit for one another every Xmas Eve

How in the morning before opting out I watched 
that tiny Native girl fumbling 
to braid her own and her now-
snoring mother's long black hair 
together
                   in a single cornrow--

If I can just always squiggle 
down like this:
                                even half as much 
as what I'd otherwise need 
to forget

maybe these scales
really will one day tip
to find each flaw that made us

Exquisite





A Rhyme for Halloween
 

Tonight I light the candles of my eyes in the lee 
And swing down this branch full of red leaves. 
Yellow moon, skull and spine of the hare, 
Arrow me to town on the neck of the air.

I hear the undertaker make love in the heather; 
The candy maker, poor fellow, is under the weather. 
Skunk, moose, raccoon, they go to the doors in threes 
With a torch in their hands or pleas: "O, please ..."

Baruch Spinoza and the butcher are drunk: 
One is the tail and one is the trunk 
Of a beast who dances in circles for beer 
And doesn't think twice to learn how to steer.

Our clock is blind, our clock is dumb. 
Its hands are broken, its fingers numb. 
No time for the martyr of our fair town 
Who wasn't a witch because she could drown.

Now the dogs of the cemetery are starting to bark 
At the vision of her, bobbing up through the dark. 
When she opens her mouth to gasp for air, 
A moth flies out and lands in her hair.

The apples are thumping, winter is coming. 
The lips of the pumpkin soon will be humming. 
By the caw of the crow on the first of the year, 
Something will die, something appear.





At Twilight on the Road to Sogamoso
 

The sun is beginning to go down
over a field of yellow onions. The edges
of the clouds are almost pink, and at this hour
the maguey rises up like a flower of dark blades.
I worked so long today I have forgotten
my own hunger. It takes a full minute
for me to remember a word I have used
all my life. What the Mexicans call poncho.
At twilight I see it, abandoned, hanging like a ghost
on the limb of a tree: my own brown ruana
next to gray speckled chickens pecking at roots
and a black track of storm coming west over the green mountain.

Several Altitudes of Not Talking
 

You are part of other people but not
like them. You live in a little wooden box
and wake up with your face
in your palm and some sunlight.
Which is a sign of resignation but not
for you. Which is part of what I meant
by trying to effect change
in myself and also talking. By describing
to you that before a city can become
spectacular its buildings must put on
an iron gown. And then some workers
climb all around it. And it is like having
no teeth because you are waiting
for better teeth. I tell you I am very attached
to my old teeth. In a game called all of this
is hypothetical I did not once slide
my teeth across the table. I do not
even remember what you offered
as the hypothetical exchange for a life
where I only drink soup. There were
some girls on their bikes
and wind. There were some people
reuniting after many years apart or just
a day. You were not like everyone else
making demands with wild
gesticulations. I thought about maybe
trying to sharpen my knowledge
of jokes. I thought about really 
needing a hug. A very important car 
with sirens rumbled by and sounded 
exactly right.





And Then It Was Less Bleak Because We Said So
 

Today there has been so much talk of things exploding
into other things, so much that we all become curious, that we
all run outside into the hot streets
and hug. Romance is a grotto of eager stones
anticipating light, or a girl whose teeth
you can always see. With more sparkle and pop
is the only way to live. Your confetti tongue explodes
into acid jazz. Small typewriters
that other people keep in their eyes
click away at all our farewell parties. It is hard
to pack for the rest of your life. Someone is always
eating cold cucumber noodles. Someone will drop by later
to help dismantle some furniture. A lot can go wrong
if you sleep or think, but the trees go on waving
their broken little hands.





Rain of Statues
 

From the Mithridatic Wars, first century BC
Our general was elsewhere, but we drowned.
While he rested, he shipped us home
with the bulk of his spoils
that had weighed his army down.
The thrashing storm
that caught us cracked the hulls
and made us offerings to the sea floor--
a rain of statues, gold, and men.

Released from service,
done with war,
the crash and hiss muted,
we fell through streams of creatures
whose lives were their purpose.
We settled with treasure looted
from temples of rubbled Athenian Greece;
among us, bronze and marble gods and goddesses
moored without grace,
dodged by incurious fish.
Their power was never meant to buoy us--
our pleasures were incidental gifts--
but, shaken by their radiance in our dust,
we had given them our voices.

Their faces, wings, and limbs
lie here with our sanded bones
and motionless devices. 
Little crabs attempt to don rings
set with agate and amethyst,
and many an octopus,
seeking an hour of rest,
finds shelter in our brain-cases.
So we are still of use.





Attack Underground
 

Themiscyra, 72 BC
While Lucullus raided cherry orchards,
he left us to besiege, 
grudgingly, this outlander fortress,
named for an Amazon queen,
while thinking of food and home.
Not one of us has seen
a single horse-borne warrior woman.
Meanwhile, we dug a tomb.

We intended it as the tunnel
through which we'd claim the fort.
We shored up the sifting roof
and dug by lamps 
that shed more shadows than light.
At last we formed up underground
to attack with sword and fire,
but the enemy tossed in hives,

and in a cloud of stinging bees
our torches jerked and swung or fell
so we could hardly tell
where to strike, or what, for next
our enemy sent weasels in, and foxes,
which seemed to be done in jest
until we felt their teeth
and heard, more than saw, the larger beasts.

A wolf began my death.
I lay in men's and weasels' blood
and heard the body
that dropped at my side
ask, What barbarian thought to make
of thoughtless creatures weapons of war?
But a flung torch showed me the face
of a bear that said nothing, and died.
Then came the boar.





Homage: Vallejo
 

Brailed up from birth, these obdurate, obituary corners
of second life the hospital light ravened solstice

blessed with a caesarean and now we have a republic,
the bread under arm, water-bearer of the sea: Cetus, Christ.

After the blackbird I put on my herringbone jacket,
the feather hummed gargoyles bearing down buildings,

rain scowled down, Vallejo and Vallejo as I hurried
up Eager Street; Thursday, I remember the white stone

in the flask and wild asterisks hissing; Thursdays, falling
at noon, at Cathedral Street, blackbirds falling quietly at Biddle Street.





A March
 

Lesson of the day: Syria and Styria.
For Syria, read: His conquering banner shook from Syria.
And for Styria: Look at this harp of blood, mapping.

Now I am tuned. I am going to go above
my voice for the sake of the forest shaken
on the bitumen. You can see stars in the skulls,

winking, synapses, intermittent, on edge
of shriek--perhaps a cluster of fir, birches?--
Anyways. Don't get too hung up

on the terms; they have entropy
in common, bad for the public weal,
those obtuse centurions in the flare

of the bougainvillea, their patent-seeking
gift kindled. Divers speech. Cruelty.
Justice. Never mind, but do

pay attention to the skirmish--the white
panther that flitters up the pole--
its shade grows large on the ground.





"A furnace in my fathers voice; I prayed for the coal stoves
 

A furnace in my father's voice; I prayed for the coal stove's
roses, a cruise ship lit like a castle

on fire in the harbor we never walked,
father and son, father drifting down

the ferned hell his shanty shone, where,
inside, in my head, the lamp was the lamp.

The market, the park, the library not a soul
but grandmother's morning wash lifting toward heaven,

the barrister sun punished my sister, I stared at my hand
in a book, the horizon declined in my mouth.

My little earthshaker, visored in placenta,
wonder of wonders, tremulous in amniotic

shield, ensouled already, father in the veritable
night, without house or harbor, 

soon sea in a voice will harrow
a scorpion's blaze in me, to the marrow.





"At nights birds hammered my unborn
 

At nights birds hammered my unborn
child's heart to strength, each strike bringing

bones and spine to glow, her lungs pestled
loud as the sea I was raised a sea anemone

among women who cursed their hearts
out, soured themselves, never-brides,

into veranda shades, talcum and tea moistened
their quivering jaws, prophetic without prophecy.

Anvil-black, gleaming garlic nubs, the pageant arrived with sails unfurled
from Colchis and I rejoiced like a broken

asylum to see burning sand grains, skittering ice;
shekels clapped in my chest, I smashed my head against a lightbulb

and light sprinkled my hair; I rejoiced, a poui
tree hit by the sun in the room, a man, a man.





The Judgment Tale
 

Over the growing shadows fell the dead weight of light.

With a long bark mules metered the distance and turned back.
Dust rose like columns of unpaid debt.
Spit dried before it could reach the ground.

Then the thin-barked orange trees disowned their thick-skinned fruit.
Then mosquitoes spat out bad blood into the gutters and were gone. 

Fish was opened like a two-page book,
its skeleton, caught aflame like an asp,
inscribed with fire along the bone lines,
then slapped on a stone face of a plate 
next to a Coca-Cola bottle as cold as hell.

In the market fruit prices jumped up so high--
the seller women turned into hawks.

With a gibbous peacock brushing by their feet,
in the woods where each leaf hides a face,
                          and each trunk a spine,
                                                 and each tree a crime,
                                                               where owls and angels,

a man and three women were contesting an apple.

The winner's body itself was an apple with skin chewed off.
Inside her breasts milk circled like a growling animal
locked behind two heavy nipples.

It was both day and night.
Her moon-white hand on the sun-gold fruit.
In her hair more stones than in a graveyard.

 So

    I followed the woman as she ate
    hoping if not for a bite
    then at least
    a spit in my direction.
    But she left nothing of that apple.
    Not even the memory of eating it

    ever.





My Meninas and the Moon
 

I would try to do it in my way, forgetting Velzquez ....  So, little by little, I would paint my Meninas ... they would be "my Meninas.                                          --Pablo Picasso
My meninas are as changeable as the moon.
Black and white and in color.
Happy, sad, and how many words there are
for red enough and the pallor of skin.

Their moments of verisimilitude do not outweigh
their flashes of pathos. Whole days go by
when they cannot appreciate the humor
of which the dog is one manner, the dwarf another.

My meninas are not puppets, but puppet theaters.
That it is the puppet master who draws the curtain
in the stairwell is pure whimsy on my part.
A minuet of despair, andante of foolhardiness.

How many times have I tried to explain these differences,
the sting of joy, a lilt of crimson,
the dark and the light of the moon not the moon,
the soul but a sphere predisposed to rotation?

The man in the doorway. The dog who lies sleeping.
These are my meninas. The sun in the mirror.
The sun and the moon and the man behind the easel,
mostly invisible, like the pictures on the wall.

The moon is not more changeable, however,
than they, my meninas, who never stop changing
and waiting on the children of the sun
and of the moon, for they will always be

my meninas, their eyes of every minim on the palette,
blue and tragical, white on white against
a black ground, until the moon sings every shape
and shade of gray from hope to ample. And again.





Refrain
 

It would never be possible for a stone, no more than for an airplane, to elevate itself toward the sun in jubilation.                                                     --Martin Heidegger
The dragonflies again; the last time seeing them 
skim the river close
                                    to forgotten--their singing, 
their shimmer--now remembered, becoming so much 
flame; 
            as tongues over the heads of the chosen in the child's picture 
book of Christ I learned by heart, descent and weight of after 
the fact, the gift 
                             the fork 
between hope and vanity, the river that eats
itself turned mirror broken into 
                                                           light; the corpse 
between the beloved's good word 
and the beloved 
                              who having spoken was ever spoken
into being, lies, unspeaking, and as with any heaviness that lowers
then hovers, remains 
                              inconceivable; so the letter given in stone, perfection 
in fire;
love; all
               love's failures; the winged animal
drops to the earth and is there buried in a hole where it digs 
in the grit like the blade 
                                            we left in the riverbed, adrift and cry-
shaped in the memory, both 
that dim and that loud; though 
                                                         no accosting why it
seems that way, everything ghost 
of itself or everything made 
                                                  of mythic proportion, the walker
sinking from the face of the waters, the dragon I
become when I talk to myself, what a belief
                                                                             is, terrifying
and relentless; I've never been 
able to tell the difference;
                                              the brute and the apparition
in reflection speak at once--the rock and the rock's light-- 
so that now the insect thrums 
                                                      and it is surely
a kind of tenderness, an ODing in secret, turning into while turning
from the soul the animal raised
                                                        and devoured in dream; imagine, 
the child's wished-for surface gives and ripples up 
                                                                                           to mouth
the perfect imprint, saying "aircraft and there are aircraft, amen,
the walker is surrounded by flight on all sides; 
                                                                                    the walker 
walks without wings; see,

the recollection is flawless, turning wings of jewels; 
the recollection is absolute, swallows whole; 

                                                                                 echoes;

and the dragon feasts; and the dragon flies again;





Lilac Field
 

To perform death is something only humans would do
No animal would sit there
With a blank look on its face
Just because the camera is there

No no an animal would look directly in it
Or cover its face, like the overweight
Woman in the picture in the magazine
By the room where I keep my bed

What people don't understand about beauty
Is that after all it is not fleeting
After all it is so gross to be that way
That someone sees among you

After all, to call into question
I painted my lips, my eyes
Only our scholars know that
To perform is to be malleable

To perform in language
Or was it
The large purple insect I let in the room
Or was it the furred face--the hippo or the gorge

That I was the devil in the wood
In my own bones that I knew the face
That I took that face
Was it midnight blue sky

No, were my wings iridescent
Even in these lines
The voice moves you
What sense of exquisite cause

Thought 
Moves you past these lines
Into conversation 
With the undead

I don't know
That is something
You will have to answer for yourself
I came back to this place to help you

And that I did
Shoot sparks of green and gray
Through time
What skin sack

I put myself in
I mean for what, why,
Or who
Did I manage to do this for if not you

Lilaced thing
The soft rustle of beetle wings
In air that is warm and gray
And is not strong

But there, is there to carry us past it





Flying Lesson
 

Focus on the shapes. Cirrus, a curl,
stratus, a layer, cumulus, a heap.

Humilis, a small cloud,
cumulus humilis, a fine day to fly.

Incus, the anvil, stay grounded.
Nimbus, rain, be careful,

don't take off near nimbostratus,
a shapeless layer

of rain, hail, ice, or snow.
Ice weighs on the blades of your propeller,

weighs on the entering edge of your wings.
Read a cloud,

decode it,
a dense, chilly mass

can shift, flood with light.
Watch for clouds closing under you,

the sky opens in a breath,
shuts in a heartbeat.





The End
 

Promising myself I would not do this again
Is what kept me going

A friend told me to
And I listened

Taking a thing to the end of its life
Is what I was made to do

I think I am not attuned
To the things that breathe

Well that's not true
I am in tune to breath and life

And little falls of flowers

When the moon was high
I went out to the stream

And brought in the water
For my folks, my kin, my brethren

I brought in the greenish milk
To feed the ones who were already dying

Oh did they go
Oh I do not know





Exuberance
 

Exuberance sips bootleg gin from a garter flask
with a ruby monogram "E.

She wears a red dress one size too small,
eyes wide, she flirts with everyone, dares

Lincoln Beachey to fly until he runs out of gas,
rides a dead engine all the way down.

She watches Ormer Locklear climb
out of the cockpit two hundred feet up,

tap dance on his upper wing
as the houses of honest families

with their square-fenced yards
slide below his shuffle. An oval pond

winks in the sun, like a zero.
Exuberance challenges pilots

to master the Falling Leaf, perfect the Tailspin,
ignore the Graveyard Spiral, the Doom Loop.

These aviators predict every American will fly.
Exuberance believes Everybody Ought

to Be Rich, John J. Raskob explains why
in the Ladies Home Journal. She gets stock tips

from her manicurist, call loans from her broker,
buys Radio, Seaboard Utilities, Sears,

orders shares in investment trusts--why not?--
chain stores keep multiplying, cars, trucks,

planes, houses. This nation is all about growth,
growth and leverage, look at the skyscrapers shooting up,

men rivet steel, floor after floor, high-speed elevators
spring through the cores, planes soar over them all.

Sherman Fairchild has made a million
selling aerial photographs of real estate.

Exuberance travels constantly, owns land
in Miami, Miami Beach, Coral Gables, Palm Beach,

she trades "binders on lots five times over,
befriends Mr. Charles Ponzi from Boston

who is raking in a bundle near Jacksonville.
Prices for sand and palms are sure to rise.

But how do we know when irrational exuberance
has unduly escalated asset values?

Wall Street has been wing walking,
call it barnstormer capitalism,

soon the bankers and the brokers will steal
the aviators' lexicon, claim their own tail risks,

graveyard spirals, doomsday cycles,
wonder how everything blue-sky stayed up so long.

Exuberance buys more stock on margin,
volume runs high, the ticker tape

can't keep up, higher, higher, higher,
Black Thursday, not a parachute in sight.





The Igloo
 

Outside the igloo he waited
for an invitation to come inside.
There was no knocker, no doorbell.
He coughed, there was no reply.

He crouched down and peered in.
He felt the warm air from a fire
pat his cheeks and ruffle his hair.
Hello he said quietly and repeated it.

The frost in his toes urged him in,
so did the pain in his gut. His knees
one by one welcomed the snow 
and brought him into the warmth.

He stood up and breathed deeply.
He held a foot up to the flames
then swapped it for the other foot.
He lay down on the polar bear rug

but a smell yanked him upright again
and led him to a dresser of bone
where a bowl sat with a cover on it.
He lifted this to reveal dried meat.

He grabbed a chunk and tore at it
with his teeth. It was reindeer.
He devoured all that was in the bowl
and went looking for some more.

He found none, but there was a bottle
of firewater which he swigged.
He swigged again and left it down.
He lay on the bearskin and fell asleep.





Gold
 

After the murder, I called a meeting
to see if we were happy. I declared
I was not--I said I liked the man
we shot. You all disagreed with this.
I asked if you knew him, his wife,
none of you did. "Kill me, then,
I said. You all stared at me. "Why,
Bernard? Of course we won't.
"Why not? I said. "He was a good
man, a better man than me. And
look at what I've brought you--
rubbish, dodgy tales, dross.
"Easy to dismiss that, you said.
"We appreciated it all. And you
wandered the wild paths to bring
it back to us--your songs, your
legends, magic stories, your gold.
I thanked you, but shook my head.
The good man was dead. I didn't care
what I'd brought you. I needed to go.
I packed up my sagas, my song lyrics,
my alchemy potions, my gold, and
I disappeared.





Lowering Your Standards for Food Stamps
 

Words fall out of my coat pocket,
soak in bleach water. I touch everyone's
dirty dollars. Maslow's got everything on me.
Fourteen hours on my feet. No breaks.
No smokes or lunch. Blank-eyed movements:
trash bags, coffee burner, fingers numb.
I am hourly protestations and false smiles.
The clock clicks its slow slowing.
Faces blur in a stream of hurried soccer games,
sunlight, and church certainty. I have no
poem to carry, no material illusions.
Cola spilled on hands, so sticky fingered,
I'm far from poems. I'd write of politicians,
refineries, and a border's barbed wire,
but I am unlearning America's languages
with a mop. In a summer-hot red
polyester top, I sell lotto tickets. Cars wait for gas
billowing black. Killing time has new meaning.
A jackhammer breaks apart a life. The slow globe
spirals, and at night black space has me dizzy.
Visionaries off their meds and wacked out
meth heads sing to me. A panicky fear of robbery
and humiliation drips with my sweat.
Words some say are weeping twilight and sunrise.
I am drawn to dramas, the couple arguing, the man
headbutting his wife in the parking lot.
911: no metered aubade, and nobody but
myself to blame.





Shock and Awe
 

Tightened jaw, I did not love.
Flashback of myself jerked about,
legs high above my head, men
laughing, I came to sea drifts,
movement and crashing. I found I am
not so far from God exploding.
Gifting, a friend once said, is why we live.
Seven storks still and white on a gold lake.
My lazy eye glances back to that original
split, myself high above myself.
Whiplashed into forgetting, I didn't know
hours from minutes. I was hypervigilant for
catastrophes. My head raging then numb.
The early garden bare, and now,
shocked with sudden memory,
I return to changing sky hues,
blooms of lilac bursting along sidewalks.
Lazy in the grass, I free myself of guilt,
imagine musicians in the park, us overcoming
ourselves. My eyes open before stars.
Holy these leaves, these skies.
What is torn opens for the light.





Lives of the Poets
 

One stood among the violets
listening to a bird. One went to the toilet
and was struck by the moon. One felt hopeless
until a trumpet crash, and then lo,
he became a diamond. I have a shovel.
Can I turn it into a poem? On my stove
I'm boiling some milk thistle.
I hope it will turn into a winged thesis 
before you stop reading. Look, I'm topless!
Listen: approaching hooves!
One drowned in a swimming pool.
One removed his shoes
and yearned off a bridge. One lives
with Alzheimer's in a state facility, spittle
in his white beard. It
turns out words are no help.
But here I am with my shovel
digging like a fool
beside the spilth and splosh
of the ungirdled sea. I can't stop.
The horses are coming, the thieves.
I still haven't found lasting love.
I still want to hear viols
in the little beach hotel
that's torn down and gone.
I want to see again the fish
schooling and glittering like a veil
where the waves shove
against the breakwater. Gone
is the girl in her white slip
testing the chill with one bare foot.
It's too cold, but she goes in, so
carefully, oh.





Carnot Cycle
 

Only sometimes does homegrown bedrock glow moneygreen.
     Sometimes rock whines mommy. Sometimes rock coos baby.
     Sometimes rock calls late with the mortgage. Sometimes rock
     knits shoulder blades right where you can't pluck.

Early mornings something doesn't sit right over the sink. Sits crooked.
     Slumps askew. Body doesn't lay the way you left it. Squinting gets
     you nowhere. You squat to the floor and feel around. Stop. Smell
     for it. Shrug. Still some dangling something modifies you.
     Smackdab midchest you feel lumpy empty. Sniff. Sniff.

Shrug.

Like those days we grab our own pickaxes and head down to the
    mine. We hum worksongs. We sing hymns. We chip worry stone.
    We gather moss. We lie flat. We scratch at the mineshaft. Not
     toward exit but deeper to the core.





Consequences of the Laws of Thermodynamics
 

When Albert Murray said
the second law adds up to
the blues that in other words
ain't nothing nothing he meant it

not quite the way my pops says
nomads don't show emotions
but more how my grandmother
warned that men like women

with soft hands blood red
nails like how Mingus meant
truth if you had time for it
facts if you got no time that

years pass. Zero
one two three and
the man you used

to flirt with you can
no longer flirt with
thank goodness.

He's now a man
you can't wear
your jaw out on

about weather
news or work

a perfect
strawberry

buried
beneath

a peck.





American Singer
 

In memory of Vic Chesnutt
when I walk
to the mailbox
holding the letter
that fails to say
how sorry I am
you feel your call
or any words at all
on that day
would have stopped
the great singer
who long ago
decided more
quickly through
to move
I notice probably
because you wrote
that strange
word funeral
the constant black
fabric I think
is taffeta
always draped
over the scaffolds
the figures
scraping paint
are wearing dusty
protective suits
and to each other
saying nothing
I move invisibly
like a breeze
around three men
wearing advanced
practically weightless
jackets impervious
to all possible
weather even
a hurricane
I hear them say
something German
then photograph
the pale blue
turrets that floating 
up in fog
seem noble
heads full
of important thoughts
like what revolution
could make us happy
from some window
wandering horns
he was three
when I was born
for a long time
I had no ideas
my father worked
in a private office
full of quiet
people working
I came to visit
it seemed correct
I went to college
studied things
dyed my hair
felt a rage
disguised as love
kept escaping
suffering only
a few broken bones
everything healed
now I live
in California
where in some
red and golden
theater I saw
him howl
such unfathomable
force from only
one lung
it was one
of his last shows
in Athens once
many years
ago we shared
a cigarette
a little smoke
from our faces
I can't remember
so many things
but see him
in his wheelchair
his folded body
it's all gone
but for electrons
I can still push
into my ears
I choose the song
the perfect one
hear his words
and see
the mirror
in the ancient
lighthouse blinking
brave ships
somehow
you crossed
the water carrying
what we need
you can rest
light as nothing
in the harbor
we will take it
and go on





Poem for Bill Cassidy
 

I wish I would
like a ship
that all night carries
its beloved captain
sleeping through
no weather
slip past dawn
and wake with nothing
but strange things
that did not happen
to report
but I get up
in the dark
and parachute
quietly down
to the kitchen
to begin
the purely mental
ritual plugging
in of the useless
worry machine
above me
she sleeps
like the innocent
still dreaming older
sister to all
gentle things
the white screen
impassively asks
me to say what
does not matter
does so I shut
it down and think
about the lake
near where I live
it's a lagoon
getting lighter
like an old blue
just switched on
television
maybe a Zenith
it has two arms
they stretch
without feeling
east to embrace
an empty park
a little light
then everything
has a shadow
I almost hear
a silent bell
low voices
I brought us
to this old city
the port connects
to the world
where everyone
pretends to know
they live
on an island
waiting for
the giant wave
in some form
maybe radiation
in the yard
the wind blows
the whole black
sky looks down
for an instant
through my sleepy
isolate frame
a complex child
hologram flickers
angrily holding
a green plastic shovel
then disappears
leaving an empty
column waiting
Bill who I knew
was so angry
is dead
whatever he was
going through
I kept away
I never did
anything
I love his poem
he was really good
I keep forgetting
his last name
I always leave
his handmade book
on my desk
not to remember
but because for hours
after everything
everyone says
sounds like a language
I never knew
but now speak
spirit I know
you would have hated
how I think
you would have liked
this music
in another room
pushing the alien
voice into
the millennium
the one you left
so early
spirit
you were right
all noble
things are gone
except to struggle
and be loved





Factory
 

He can say it was a painting
He can say we were the painting
Or that the painting wasn't painting
And that we only happen to ourselves

We can say we kept things running
by distracting ourselves 
from the hideous truth 
of how things run

That we were broken
That we lingered near a broken factory
That we had broken

We can say that the disappointment 
of slicing into a leek 
and not finding the requisite layers
but a thick white inedible core 
is not the disappointment 
of approaching a sleeping animal 
only to learn that it is dead
but it does nudge one slightly 
further into despair 

We said despair 
We meant the strings of impossible 
instruments that they made 
in the factory
That we had seen
That were broken
That there were different paintings
That could be played as songs

We had seen other things
That we had seen
That had come unstrung
and blown between adjacent bridges
whose river had presented us a city
That was broken
That we had been
That we were broken
That was our city
This was our city
that was a song replaying itself in the dark





Captain Lovell, ["Dad calls her the Dowager but I call her Aunt G."]
 

Dad calls her the Dowager but I call her Aunt G.
Aunt G. at the Polo Lounge. Aunt G. drinking gimlets
by the pool. Aunt G. asking about Babe even
though she's the only one who sees her that much
anymore. She wears ten rings. Seven on her
right hand, which Dad calls the Seven Stars.
They make the glass seem like it's going to crack.

She doesn't like me very much. I know it.
I'm not her kind of girl. I won't wear dresses
and when she placed the ring inside my hand
I just said, "No, thank you. Not even thinking
how rude that might sound. What would I do
with a ring like that? I've got my own stars
and she doesn't really want to give

me presents anyway. She gave Babe a car,
her dark brown Aston Martin. And she gave
David a watch to "remember home by.
She gave my Dad a look when he said, "David's
a good soldier. Like he gave her something bad
to eat. She just shook her head and said,
"I'll never understand what kind of man you are.

And then she said Dad would have that young boy's
blood on his hands. Which I don't understand.
Or why she said, "You've gone and lost the both
of them. You're your very own Pol Pot, while looking
through her purse. It shone so bright it blinded
me. For a second I saw spots and couldn't focus
on the thing. One clear stone that caught the light

and made reflections on my glasses. I didn't want
it. I don't wear things like that. "Who are you?
she asked, not in a mean way but like she truly
didn't know. And didn't really care. She took it back
and asked me if I'd talked to Babe and I said
I had not and no one else had either.
I said, "She's living in the hills.

And she looked at the ring for a minute
and put it back in her purse.





Captain Lovell, ["Shakey Eyes Horton had nystagmus too"]
 

Shakey Eyes Horton had nystagmus too.
That's what my father said and took me
to the record store so we could buy him
and take him home to listen. Babe says
he's so square but we go all over. We listen
to music for hours and dance around
the house like crazy skeletons: loose

with all our bones knocking, we go,
"click click click and wave our arms
and shake until we rattle all the china
in mom's cabinet. He turns the volume
up and we spin like planets round the sun.
Babe says he's no fun but I know different
because I see him laughing and I try,

which she just never does. She walks
into the house with Jasper waiting in the car.
She grabs some clothes or asks for money,
though she doesn't even come to do that
anymore. They don't even talk. Last time
we had the music on loud and we were dancing.
I was letting my head swing back and forth

and she just stood and watched us with the strangest
look and I said, "I'm Shakey Eyes! Come dance,
and moved my arms around. I followed her up
the stairs, swinging like a satellite and going,
"Ooh ooh ooooohhhhh, just like a low-down good-
for-nothing so and so. I know she thinks I'm funny
but she didn't laugh and I said, "Come dance!

You know you've got the blues. Then I said, "You're
no fun. She said, "You don't know him like I do.





Captain Lovell, ["My eyes are shaky and glimmer like the stars"]
 

My eyes are shaky and glimmer like the stars.
My head turns to the left and it moves
just like a pendulum. The kids laugh and shake
it back to me, all the ways I'm stupid,
not like them. But I know how the grass sounds
when the locusts come, like a spaceship
taking off and how it makes the air shake.

Captain Lovell, I heard it in the branches
and the leaves. I heard the rocket leaving.
My teacher said it wasn't so, that you're
past hearing but my father said I could.
He puts his hands hard on my shoulders
from behind and holds my head still
with his looking. But I can feel how much

I want to shake and let myself go loose
and double like a cloud of mayflies on the lake,
you know just how they rise so you couldn't
see just one of them, not even with your thumb
held up to catch one with your eyes. It's something
I can't do that Babe and David can, can't sight
the stars or use a telescope or ever fire a gun.

Dr. Lovell, I like to think you're spinning
and can't feel it like I can't feel the world shake
unless I'm really tired and then it's like a gift
to let it go and just stop trying so hard. I like
to think you let go too and when the kids
run at me and move their heads from left
to right and call me "Zigzag I look up

and wish myself up there with you
just calm and swinging through the stars.





On Hierophany
 

One example of hierophany is the apparition of angels. 
This is a new word I overheard this morning. It occurs
when the divine realm manifests--or the word intrudes-- 
into our quotidian realm. The natural one, an untidy 
fleshliness of the ordinary. Or the sacred and profane
is another way to say this. I asked whether it is a hernia, 
and the answer was no. A herniated condition is viscera 
on viscera--a disc, organs, the skin, or nerves. Besides, 
such a comparison would be profane. A figure of speech 
already exists, I said, in a hieratic silence of cursive 
writing long ago dead. Not long ago, those two phrases 
dwelled in separate worlds. I dare you to use the word 
hernia in a poem, said a friend. So I not only used
the word, I invited God into language. Or God existed 
before language, while God is also the word. Remember, 
all theophanies are forms of hierophany. However,
the converse is not always true--not all hierophanies
are theophanies--or God visible in our world.





Night Nurse
 

This night nurse is different.
She walks into my room and does not turn the light on.
She thinks I am sleeping.
I have just barely opened my left eye,
am looking through the slightest slit,
as moonlight exposes the room
for what it really is--a collection
of surfaces; lines and planes, mostly.
The night nurse puts a foot up on the radiator
and braces her clipboard on her knee
as she appears to take down a few notes.
I imagine she is working on a sonnet,
and that her ankle looks like polished walnut.
You imagine she is working on a crossword,
and that her feet are killing her.
The slightest slit is like an old gate
at a Japanese tea garden at night,
in the rain, that is supposed to be closed,
that is supposed to be locked.
"Someone has locked up poorly, you'd say.
"Incorrectly. But no one has asked you.





Advice for Horsemen
 

When trying to catch a horse it helps if you look away.
Eye contact just pisses them off.
But you can't fake looking away, horses
know when you are doing this.
You have to really look away.
Some horsemen never come out of this.





In a Grove
 

Kurosawa was a moralist.
It is said he took and gently bent
Akutagawa's grove.

Akutagawa was trying to show
us something. It is said he wore
cold wet gloves when he wrote.





Mary
 

My mother is obsessed with reading about Jesus these days.
I see books piled by her bed, most of them borrowed from my library: novels, handbooks, sectarian polemics, writers coming to blows. Sometimes when I'm passing by her room she calls on me to step between them and resolve their disputes. (A little while ago I came to the aid of a historian called Kamal Salibi, whose forehead had been split open by a Catholic stone.)
What a diligent reader she is when she's searching for Jesus, this woman I never failed to disappoint: I was not martyred in the first intifada, nor in the second, nor in the third. And just between you and me, I won't be martyred in any future intifada either, nor will I be killed by some booby-trapped stork.
As she reads, her orthodox imagination crucifies me with every page.... while I do nothing but supply it with more books and nails.





Want Ad
 

I need a strict manager
and an energetic secretary
and a correspondent to make my coffee
and my tea
I need an intellectual
and a poet
and a mafia godfather
to divide my life among them

And I'll announce, after a while
my bankruptcy
like the companies do

I need a servant
and a traitor
a lover to have me murdered
beaten to death
by sandals in the bath:
I need a queen
to betray me with the king





A Moment of Silence
 

And what did the Armenians say?

An Umayyad monk
spins wheat and wool above us

Time is a scarecrow





That's what the Armenians said

I want to be understood,

                                  Last week's weather is worth a pound of salt, just
                                   like the lot of wives or the snowy pillars of Danton. 

                           There's not a crowd in the sky. Familiarity breeds

                   content. Yesterday's

                                               weather is as

            beyond reach as tomorrow's

                                                                                                  dreams. The

                                                               reading often got drowned in the

bathwater, even if we could never find the baby. I wouldn't join a poetic

As dry as a bubble, as expectant as the dead

                             of night. Without product placement, poetry 
                             as we know it

                                                                              cannot sur-

                       Poetry should not be in the service of art any more than religion, ideology, 
                       or morality. Poetry should be in the service of nothing--and not even 
                       that. 

                       If you can identify someone as gnostic they are probably

                     not

gnostic enough,

                                                      for my money.

            I believe in my disbelief, have faith in my reason.

                       The sacred in a poem is nowhere seen and everywhere

                       felt. There's

                more to transgression than

                                                                           ritual, but not enough

more. There is more

               to liturgy than doctrine,

       once in a blue

                                                                m-

                                                                                     oo-

I left my purpose in my other pants.

       You're not the only paddle in the ocean, shadow in the dark, line in 
       the poem, lobster in the trap, pot on the stove, wheel on the truck, 
       letter on the keypad, scythe in the field, lever on the controls, cloud 
       in the sky, fruit in the tree, rat in the lab.

                 Reality is usually a poor copy of the imitation. The original
            is an echo of what is yet to be.

                                  Time is neither linear nor circular; it is excremental.

       Beauty is the memory of the loss of time.

                                    Memory
                                     is
                                     the
                                     reflection
                                     of
                                     the
                                     loss
                                     of
                                     beauty.

               American poetry suffers from its lack of

     uncreativity. I have no faith in faith, or hope
                                  for hope, no belief in belief, no doubt of doubt.

                                                         They say God is in the details. That's
                                                   because the Devil has the rest

                                   covered.

God is weak and imaginary--a flickering possibility. The dogma of an 
omniscient and omnipotent God maligns hope and denies the sacred, as 
it turns its back on the world.

        God has no doctrine, no morality, no responsibility. To sin against
    God is to use that name to justify any action or prohibition, whether
    murder or martyrdom.

I've got authenticity, you've got dogma...proclaimeth the Lord.

                                                     Saying one more time:
                                                     It's true but I don't believe it
                                                     I believe it but it's not so.

from Raw Meditations on Money, 1. She Speaks: A School Teacher from South India
 

Portions of a mango tree the storm cut down, 
a green blaze bent into mud 
and they come to me, at dawn

three girls from Kanpur, far to the north admittedly 
(we know this from national geography class, 
the borders of states, the major cities).

They hung themselves from fans.
In the hot air they hung themselves
so that their father would not be forced to tender gold

he did not have, would not be forced
to work his fists to bone.
So that is how a portion of the story goes.

Slowly in the hot air they swung, three girls. 
How old were they?
Of marriageable age certainly.

Sixteen, seventeen, and eighteen, something of that sort.
How do I feel about it?
What a question! I am one of three sisters,

most certainly I do not want father to proffer money
he does not have for my marriage.
Get a scooter, a refrigerator, a horde of utensils,

silks, and tiny glittering bits of gold
to hang about my ears and throat.
Gold is labor time accumulated . . . labor time defined.

Who said that? Yes, I am a schoolteacher, fifth standard 
trained in Indian history and geography, 
Kerala University, first class first.

The storm tree puts out its limbs and
I see three girls swinging. One of them is me.
Step back I tell myself.

Saumiya, step back. The whole history 
of womankind is compacted here. 
Open your umbrella, tuck your sari tight,

breathe into the strokes of catastrophe,
and let the school bus wait.
You will get to it soon enough and the small, hot faces.

See how the monsoon winds soar and shunt 
tropic air into a house of souls, 
a doorway stopped by clouds.

Set your feet into broken stones 
and this red earth and pouring rain. 
For us there is no exile.





Dog Days of Summer
 

In the dog days of summer as muslin curls on its own heat 
And crickets cry in the black walnut tree

The wind lifts up my life
And sets it some distance from where it was.

Still Marco Polo Airport wore me out,
I slept in a plastic chair, took the water taxi.

Early, too early the voices of children 
Mimicking the clatter in the Internet caf

In Campo Santo Stefano in a place of black coffee 
Bordellos of verse, bony accolades of joy,

Saint Stephen stooped over a cross,
A dog licking his heel, blood drops from a sign

By the church wall--Anarchia  ordine-- 
The refugee from Istria gathers up nails.

She will cobble together a gondola with bits of driftwood
Cast off the shores of the hunger-bitten Adriatic.

In wind off the lagoon,
A child hops in numbered squares, back and forth, back and forth,

Cap on his head, rhymes cool as bone in his mouth. 
Whose child is he?

No one will answer me.
Voices from the music academy pour into sunlight

That strikes the malarial wealth of empire, 
Dreams of an old man in terrible heat,

Hands bound with coarse cloth, tethered to a scaffold, 
Still painting waves on the walls of the Palazzo Ducale.





Cadenza
 

I watch your hands at the keyboard 
Making music, one hand with a tiny jot, 
A birthmark I think where finger bone 
Joins palm, mark of the fish, 
Living thing in search of a watering 
Hole set in a walled garden, 
Or in a field with all the fences torn: 
Where I hear your father cry into the wind 
That beats against stones in a small town 
Where you were born; its cornfields 
Skyward pointing, never sown, never 
To be reaped, flagrant, immortal.





Lychees
 

Terrace deep as the sky.
Stone bench where I sit and read,

I wandered by myself
Into the heart of the mountains of Yoshino.

In one hand a book, in the other, a bag made of newsprint--
No weather-beaten bones here

Just lychees bought in the market, 
Thirty rupees per kilogram.

Stalks mottled red tied up with string, 
Flesh the color of pigeon wings--

Sweet simmering. 
Sunlight bruises air

Pine trees blacken. 
Where shall I go?

The Dhauladhar peaks 
Are covered in snow.





For My Father, Karachi 1947
 

Mid-May, centipedes looped over netting at the well's mouth. 
Girls grew frisky in summer frocks, lilies spotted with blood.

You were bound to meteorology, 
Science of fickle clouds, ferocious winds.

The day you turned twenty-six fighter planes cut a storm, 
Fissured air baring the heart's intricate meshwork

Of want and need--
Springs of cirrus out of which sap and shoot you raised me.

Crossing Chand Bibi Road,
Named after the princess who rode with hawks,

Slept with a gold sword under her pillow, 
Raced on polo fields,

You saw a man lift a child, her chest burnt with oil, 
Her small thighs bruised.

He bore her through latticed hallways 
Into Lady Dufferin's hospital.

How could you pierce the acumen of empire, 
Mesh of deceprion through which soldiers crawled,

Trees slashed with petrol,
Grille work of light in a partitioned land?

When you turned away,
Your blue black hair was crowned with smoke--

You knelt on a stone. On your bent head 
The monsoons poured.





Birthplace with Buried Stones
 


     I

In the absence of reliable ghosts I made aria, 
Coughing into emptiness, and it came

A west wind from the plains with its arbitrary arsenal: 
Torn sails from the Ganga river,

Bits of spurned silk,
Strips of jute to be fashioned into lines,

What words stake--sentence and make-believe, 
A lyric summoning.


     II

I came into this world in an Allahabad hospital, 
Close to a smelly cow pasture.

I was brought to a barracks, with white walls 
And corrugated tin roof,

Beside a civil aviation training center.
In World War II officers were docketed there.

I heard the twang of propellers, 
Jets pumping hot whorls of air,

Heaven bent, 
Blessing my first home. 


     III

In an open doorway, in half darkness 
I see a young woman standing.

Her breasts are swollen with milk. 
She is transfixed, staring at a man,

His hair gleaming with sweat, 
Trousers rolled up

Stepping off his bicycle,
Mustard bloom catches in his shirt.

I do not know what she says to him,
Or he to her, all that is utterly beyond me.

Their infant once a clot of blood 
Is spectral still.

Behind this family are vessels of brass 
Dotted with saffron,

The trunk of a mango tree chopped into bits, 
Ready to be burnt at the household fire.


     IV

Through the portals of that larger chaos,
What we can scarcely conceive of in our minds--

We'd rather think of starry nights with biting flames 
Trapped inside tree trunks, a wellspring of desire

Igniting men and gods,
A lava storm where butterflies dance--

Comes bloodletting at the borders, 
Severed tongues, riots in the capital,

The unspeakable hurt of history:
So the river Ganga pours into the sea.


     V

In aftermath--the elements of vocal awakening: 
Crud, spittle, snot, menstrual blistering,

Also infant steps, a child's hunger, a woman's rage 
At the entrance to a kitchen,

Her hands picking up vegetable shavings, chicken bones, 
Gold tossed from an ancestral keep.

All this flows into me as mottled memory, 
Mixed with syllables of sweat, gashed syntax,

Strands of burst bone in river sand,
Beside the buried stones of Sarasvati Koop--

Well of mystic sky-water where swans 
Dip their throats and come out dreaming.





Ramadan
 

My mother forgets to feed her animals
because it's only fair.
She rushes to them when
she hears hoarse roosters crowing
and billy goats butting
over a last straw.

This month the moon becomes a princess.
The stars fan her,
Jupiter pours cups of wine,
Mars sings melancholy mawals.
Bearded men holding prayer beads
and yellow booklets stare at her
and point aching fingers at her waist.

In our house we break a fast 
with dates from Huun 
and glasses of buttermilk. 
Then on to bowls of lamb soup 
flavored with mint, trays 
of stuffed grape leaves, 
spiced fava beans drenched 
in olive oil and lemon juice. 
And that is only the beginning.

The spirits of Johnny Walker and gin 
hide in the trunks of white Peugeots. 
In the nightclubs of my city, waiters 
serve only non-alcoholic beer 
and belly dancers cover themselves.

Father of sixteen children, our neighbor
visits bringing two kilos of baklava.
He washes them down with a dozen
demitasses of sweet sage tea.
Before dawn he runs to one
of his two wives, both named Salma,
and loves her hurriedly,
his hands barely touching a breast.





What She Said on a Lewd Lute Night
 

So I go to Ashenda
to get some fix
Shandar there
playing his lute
& a dark haired angel
combing a violin
I cry Anatolia! Anatolia!
I'm a nightingale shrieking
dawn's first flick
I'm the unknown soldier
singing it's me again
I say one more
& I'm ready for the Western World
Then I'm at a bar
with Lucinda
& we're drooling
on the body on
discipline and the reign
of Robespierre
Then it's consummation time
& I say hey

there's a ram butting
at the door & a widow's
crying for something
I say Lucinda
I've got a drum in my belly
& she says
I'm a goddamn
shivering eel
Then it's polka
on a South Dakota lawn
Shandar doodling
Shahrazad stomping
by the window
soaking up the light
Then we all smoke Camels
& Lucinda says
I wish I could live
without having to disown
& I say yeah
tell me more
about that





Date Palm Trinity
 

Today the date palms were pruned,
the branches taken before the fruit ripened,
before sweetness littered the sidewalks.
The man who sawed them worked alone,
a crane lifting him to the yellowed fronds.
Beside his truck, he stood tall, American,
a pensive pioneer. The top of each palm
looked like the back of a man's head
after a close-crop haircut, the neck
cooled to a stubbly remembrance of hair,
or was like a cat after being spayed,
startled by a strange newness, pacing
familiar rooms, darting, confused, and you
(had you wished to console) are greeted
with a barren gaze. The rubble of bark
and fronds reminded me of Iraq,
not the ruined bridges, or the surrendering
soldiers' hands begging food, but the 16 million
date palms, one per capita, lining
the seams of the Tigris and Euphrates,
a reminder of my own Libya
and its 10 million date palms and the years
of easy wealth that brought them neglect
except in Huun, a magical city where
they stuffed dates with almonds and sent them
as far as Tanta and Oum Dourman.
From Huun this story: a boy stands by a palm
imploring his uncle to toss him a fistful of dates.
Flustered by the boy's monotonous cries
the uncle loses his feet, and as he falls
to his death, cries down "Here nephew,
I'm coming down with the dates!"
So that's what we got from Huun, almond
stuffed wonders and proverbial last words.
There was another reminder, a tale
of the prophet Muhammad living for months
on water and coarse wheat bread, his wives
protesting the austere measures of his faith.
Muhammad, who praised honey and had
a professed love for cantaloupes, and who once 
declared "the best meat is that which lines the bones,"
found in dates the solution he required. 
To his Arab followers, and to his wives, 
the fruit was "three skies above luxury," 
and as indispensable as water and air.

I once had this dream of Whitman:
I found him under one of the palms
on Sherman Way gazing admiring. 
Though he had seen palms by the Gulf of Mexico,
he had never tasted a date. So we drove
to a supermarket, and he who had been
thoughtful, even dignified, until then, began
to sign and moan at the taste of "Araby's
sugared dust clouds." When we walked
the aisles he insisted on pushing the cart.
The frozen foods did not surprise him since
his Granny buried potatoes in the cold dirt
of her homestead. Still I had to explain
tofu, plastic, tacos, and the foods labeled free.
He ran his hands caressing the waxed floor;
"Smooth as a girl's wrist," he exclaimed.
The bright fluorescent lights reminded hirn
of the opera, and Walt sang a gravelly tune.
The children sitting in carts reached for him,
their hands were Lorca's butterflies on his beard.
At the cashier he filled pockets with candy,
and was shocked by the headlines of our news.
Honda, Toyota, Saturn, Oldsmobile--
in the parking lot the names waltzed
on his tongue. At the fast food stand he ate
heartily, the burger's slipperiness amused him,
and at his clumsiness we both had a laugh.
Then the talk grew quiet, the table stretching
like the expanse of time dividing us; I felt
he no longer wanted company, having begun
to understand our world. Despite his old resentment
of Blacks, and now my neighbors, the foreign-born
Hispanics and their engines roaring through 
Balboa and Saticoy, and the Koreans' karoake-- 
the baseline's muffled thuds, voices doused 
in Canadian Mist, and the off-key pleadings 
to the lover who never comes--, America 
remained to him luminous-industrial-fuming-
sublime, and as he wished, beyond others' 
adjectives, beyond what anyone could have conceived. 
Mumbling a farewell, Whitman stood to leave. 
And with this my dream ended, Whitman wishing 
to depart and I holding on to his wrists. 
All day I wanted to hold his wide wrists.

If you drive west of Alexandria
your path will run through Alamain,
Barani, and Matrouh. Then Egypt will end 
with a town on a steep hill called Sallum. 
If you go through the two checkpoints, 
Libya will unfold its dry pastures for you. 
On the Sallum hill there is a hotel 
where people stay to await relatives 
crossing the border or to hear word 
if it is safe to return. Across the road 
a tired bluegreen tea house sits 
like a bruise permanently on the verge 
of fading from the prairies' skin. 
You will also see the money changers-- 
all teenage boys. With their right hands 
they will wave thick wads of money 
at your windshield, and with their left 
they will jostle to give you the best rate. 
The last time I stayed in Sallum 
few cars came from either direction, 
and among the boys fights flared 
with curses and stones hurled at brows. 
When the boys' rabble grew loud 
a man lazily stepped out of the tea house 
to call them bastards and sons of whores. 
This went on for hours until
the sun settled in the middle of the sky,
the boys taking shelter under
a torn canvas shed, and the man
to the tea house's dusty cool.
Then just when all movement
and noise seemed to surrender
to the September wind and heat,
four of the boys broke for a run
racing--money still clutched in their hands--
to a young date palm in the distance.
Pressing shoulders and backs against it,
they shook the palm until the season's
first fruit began to rain. The other boys
joined them, and soon the tea house
emptied of the men slouching inside.
Those were my brothers who cowered beneath
the date palm to gather handfuls of fruit,
rubbing each date clean on their sleeves,
chewing softly to savor the taste
as though it were a good omen, and rising
to resume their lives, on their faces
the smiles of those who once were blessed.





In that Part of the World
 


I

The sky here is American like the blue of your eyes; 
the folds of your eyelids the Hindu Kush mountain.

The rich vein of the Hindu Kush only a stony ridge 
cutting across the parched soil of Afghanistan

on which the primal play of progress comes to pass.


II

Locked in, its people:
nomadic, peasant or simply pleasant,
green-eyed, blue-eyed, brown-eyed or simply wide-eyed.

Its great teacher: Noor Mohammad Taraki, 
the proud translator of great works 
into Pashto, Dari, Turkic and Uzbek. 
Its cities: Herat, Kabul, Kandahar.


III

Assuredly, the pilgrims descend the emerald-strewn 
Panjsher valley. They have come to water and tend

a young tree. Time is at hand, for the unhurried 
descent of the Western offering,

whose yellow parachute will slow its fall.
And this tree, which will grow underneath the cluster bomb,
will hold up the pomegranate to the blue sky.


IV

The tick tock and whirr of metal and material 
in the hidden azure vault of the air

has so far unleashed the American ahistoricality 
upon the two tall Bamiyan Buddhas.

Ordained stone must give way to bared rock face. 
Grieve not. Rejoice, for the spirit triumphs here.


V

When Kabul was as beautiful as Leningrad,
when our hearts hadn't grown weary,
when Taraki could take a stroll down
the streets of Kabul with a confident smile,
when he could still be Afghanistan's Maxim Gorky,
when our erstwhile bachelor could enjoy
the company of dancing girls like a mogul emperor,
when the way forward was the way forward.


VI

The uncertain exile is never to Rome--
no picture postcards of the coliseum to send home--

but to a mud hovel among other mud hovels
by the edge of the city of Islamabad.

For the uncertain exile has nothing to do
with the divine or with any other kind of comedy,

but with what has remained or with what reminds: 
with the trace of terror that persists.


VII

In this part of the world the children know and have desires 
to be a martyr, to enter paradise, to leave this life.

Of the twenty-nine different names for the garden, 
they know all twenty-nine by heart.

For this part of the world began with a garden and 
will end as an open ditch piled up with bodies.


VIII

Grant me Antigone's strength to forbear
for the sun has come unstuck from a blue sky gone black,

stolen for effect, and the veiled moon stands in,
for the mourning women standing next to platters of rice,

signifying the historically sound end of forgetfulness, 
returning our agency to mourn

the collaborations of the merchant capitalist class 
with the unlistening, ahistorical God.


IX

If only Gandhi's spinning wheel had spun 
a million yards of cloth

we would have covered all our war dead. 
And as for tents, we would have built

cities upon cities of tents to keep the rain out 
for all our refugees. And then and only then

would we have mourned our war dead, 
mourned our war dead.





The Emerald Mosque on the Hill
 

In the lull, the afternoon sun warms 
the linseed field. The flowers are quiet,

their bright subdued in the green 
while the mind wanders

to the emerald mosque upon the hill, 
built around a flowing spring, 

the easy absolutions and ablutions 
in that mosque where the spring water

has been let loose to meander
over marble courtyards and inner chambers,

across the geometric, green-tiled floor that 
cools the heels of the faithful.





Narrowing Hallway
 

The unkempt beard of the fearsome mullah 
overwhelms the two aging poets from the periphery, 
the far-flung provinces of Iran and Iraq.

They stand tiptoe, toe deep in the master culture, 
arguing in an emptying, narrowing hallway, 
in the high imperial language of their poetry,

over what became of the muffled, cuffed bulbul
or of the straw-stuffed, stone-eyed mynah,
over the proper ornithology for the symbols of woe.





En Route to Bangladesh, Another Crisis of Faith
 

--at Dubai International Airport and ending with a line by Csar Vallejo
Because I must walk
            through the eye-shaped 
shadows cast by these
            curved gold leaves thick 
atop each constructed
            palm tree, past displays 
of silk scarves, lit
            silhouettes of blue-bottled 
perfume--because
            I grip, as though for the first 
time, a paper bag
            of french fries from McDonald's, 
and lick, from each fingertip,
            the fat and salt as I stand alone
to the side of this moving
            walkway gliding me past dark-
eyed men who do not look
            away when I stare squarely 
back--because standing
            in line to the restroom I want 
only to pluck from her
            black sweater this one shimmering 
blond hair clinging fast--
            because I must rest the Coke, cold 
in my hand, beside this
            toilet seat warmed by her thighs, 
her thighs, and hers.
            Here, at the narrow mouth 
of this long, humid
            corridor leading to the plane, 
I take my place among
            this damp, dark horde of men 
and women who look like me--
            because I look like them-- 
because I am ashamed
            of their bodies that reek so 
unabashedly of body--
            because I can--because I am 
an American, a star
            of blood on the surface of muscle.





Reading Celan at the Liberation War Museum
 

--Independence Day Celebration 2011, Dhaka

            i.

In a courtyard, in these stacks of chairs 
            before the empty stage--near are
we Lord, near and graspable. Lord,
            accept these humble offerings: 

stacks of biscuits wrapped in cellophane, 
            stacks of bone in glass: thighbone,
spine. Stacks of white saucers, porcelain
            circles into which stacks of lip-worn

cups slide neat. Jawbone, Lord. Galleries
            of laminated clippings declaring war.
Hands unstack chairs into rows. The dead: 
            they still go begging. What for, Lord?

Blunt bayonets, once sharp as wind?
            Moon-pale stacks of clavicle? A hand--


            ii.

 Moon-pale stacks of clavicle a hand
            brushes dust from. I lost a word

that was left to me: sister. The wind
             severs through us--we sit, wait

for songs of nation and loss in neat
            long rows below this leaf-green

flag--its red-stitched circle stains
            us blood-bright blossom, stains

us river-silk--I saw you, sister, standing
            in this brilliance--I saw light sawing

through a broken car window, thistling
            us pink--I saw, sister, your bleeding

head, an unfurling shapla flower
            petaling slow across mute water--


            iii.

Petaling slow
                        across mute water, 
bows of trawlers
                               skimming nets 
of silver fish that ripple
                                        through open 
hands that will carve them
                                                  skin-
less. We were hands,
                                      we scooped 
the darkness empty. We
                                              are rooted 
bodies in rows silent before
                                                    the sparked 
blue limbs of dancers
                                       leafing the dark
light indigo, then
                               jasmine alighting 
into a cup, then
                             hands overturning 
postcards bearing flag
                                         and flower, hands 
cradling the replica of a boat,
                                                     hands
thrust there and into
                                             nothingness. You,
a corpse, sister, bathed 
                                          jasmine, blue--


            iv.

A corpse: sister, bathed jasmine. Blue,

                                       the light leading me from this gift shop into

a gallery of gray stones: Heartgray puddles,
                          two mouthfuls of silence: the shadow

            cast by the portrait of a raped woman trapped 

in a frame, face hidden behind her own black

                            river of hair: photo that a solemn girl 

your corpse's age stands still and small


                         before. She asks, Did someone hurt her? 

               Did she do something bad? Her mother

                                           does not reply. Her father turns, shudders, 

as the light drinks our silences, parched--


                             as I too turn in light, spine-scraped--

you teach you teach your hands to sleep



            v.

 you teach you teach your hands to sleep 

because her hands can't hold the shape 

of a shapla flower cut from its green leaf 

because her hands can't hold grief 

nor light nor sister     in her hands fistfuls 

of her own hair    on her wrists glass bangles 

like the one you struggled over your hand 

the same hand that slapped a sister's wan 

face    look   the young girl stands before 

the photo of the young woman who swore

she would not become the old woman

crouched low on a jute mat holding

out to you a bangle    a strange lostness was

bodily present       you came near to living


            vi.

Bodily present, you came near to living,
            Poet, in this small blue dress still stained,

the placard states, with the blood of the child
            crushed dead by a soldier's boot. Who failed

and fails?--nights you couldn't bear the threshed 
            sounds of your heart's hard beating. I press

a button: 1971 springs forth: black and white
            bodies marching in pixelated rows. Nights

you resuscitated the Word, sea-overflowed,
            star-overflown. A pixelated woman tied

with a white rope to a black pole, her white
            sari embroidered with mud or blood. Nights

you were the wax to seal what's unwritten--
            the screen goes white in downdrifting light.


            vii.

The screen goes white. In downdrifting light,
            the stairwell is a charred tunnel. We walk out 
of it into the couttyard--my skirt flares a rent
            into the burnt evening. Something was silent,

something went its way--something gnashes
            inside me, sister--along the yellow gashes
of paint guiding me through these rooms lined
            with glass cases, past machine gun chains

shaped into the word Bangla. Here, on this 
            stage, a dancer bows low her limbs
once more before us. The stage goes silent.
            We gather ourselves: souvenirs of bone.

Pray, Lord. We are near. Near are we, Lord-- 
            in a courtyard, in these stacks of chairs.





Aubade Ending with the Death of a Mosquito
 

--at Apollo Hospital, Dhaka
Let me break
                            free of these lace-frail 
                            lilac fingers disrobing
the black sky
                            from the windows of this 
                            room, I sit helpless, waiting,
silent--sister,
                            because you drew from me
                            the coil of red twine: loneliness--
spooled inside--
                            once, I wanted to say one 
                            true thing, as in, I want more
in this life,
                            or, the sky is hurt, a blue vessel-- 
                            we pass through each other,
like weary
                            sweepers haunting through glass 
                            doors, arcing across gray floors
faint trails
                            of dust we leave behind--he 
                            touches my hand, waits for me
to clutch back
                            while mosquitoes rise like smoke 
                            from this cold marble floor,
from altars,
                            seeking the blood still humming 
                            in our unsaved bodies--he sighs,
I make a fist,
                            I kill this one leaving raw
                            kisses raised on our bare necks--
because I woke
                            alone in the myth of one life, I will 
                            myself into another--how strange,
to witness
                            nameless, the tangled shape 
                            our blood makes across us,
my open palm.





For a Traveler
 

I only have a moment so let me tell you the shortest story,
about arriving at a long loved place, the house of friends in Maine,
their lawn of wildflowers, their grandfather clock and candid
portraits, their gabled attic rooms, and woodstove in the kitchen,
all accessories of the genuine summer years before, when I was
their son's girlfriend and tied an apron behind my neck, beneath
my braids, and took from their garden the harvest for a dinner
I would make alone and serve at their big table with the gladness
of the found, and loved. The eggplant shone like polished wood,
the tomatoes smelled like their furred collars, the dozen zucchini
lined up on the counter like placid troops with the onions, their
minions, and I even remember the garlic, each clove from its airmail 
envelope brought to the cutting board, ready for my instruction.
And in this very slight story, a decade later, I came by myself,
having been dropped by the airport cab, and waited for the family
to arrive home from work. I walked into the lawn, waist-high
in the swaying, purple lupines, the subject of June's afternoon light
as I had never been addressed--a displaced young woman with
cropped hair, no place to which I wished to return, and no one
to gather me in his arms. That day the lupines received me,
and I was in love with them, because they were all I had left,
and in that same manner I have loved much of the world since then,
and who is to say there is more of a reason, or more to love?





The Fair
 

The fair rolled into town surprisingly 
intact, like a plate unbreakable because 
it has been dropped and glued so many times
that it is all glue and no plate. The fair 
was no fair. But, oh, it was a thrill!

The fair slid into town just as a clown 
slides into pants. The fit was loose but right.
The sheriff had a job directing traffic.
The barber was the sheriff for a night,
and people paid to see a human ape.
They frowned to find her happy and alive.

The fair spilled into town like a box of tacks.
Later that month, in with the rest at church, 
were people no one knew,
though none could tell exactly who was who.





On the Bus Someday
 

Of that string of memories about our lost friendship I remember
being invited places as a pair, like a comedy team; and after
one party, our self-parody of our own stammering
speechlessness when introduced to Henrik, the Swedish god
auto mechanic; our twin, garish, purple-flowered swimsuits
from Kmart, outlining, around Texas, our sameness
and differences; our dual waitressing shifts across town,
and the long phone calls that followed with their emphatic
reiteration of every stingy six-top ordering candy-flavored
alcoholic drinks; the after-work visit where we brayed,
stomped, then blinked stupidly (while the needle hit
the LP's end) at the empty fifth of gin left on the coffee table,
prompting a dim: Uh oh; your imitation of your mother's
habitual and by-the-way inexplicable confession about you
to shoe salesmen: She has a funny foot; the apartments,
the Olivettis, the boyfriends, all the thoughts exchanged
unedited like an experiment of the big, walk-in consciousness,
which we might have assumed the verbal equivalent
of sex for friends, and whatever closeness meant, we wanted
as much as we could have, it was our post-graduate work
in The Humanities. Even now, I can't resist striking up
a conversation while standing on line, any line, or introducing
myself enthusiastically to whomever I am introduced,
but the truth is I am not looking for new friends at this point;
I am trying to locate the lost ones, the ones who left
through the hole of an argument decades ago,
a time more panicked and carefree than any other, except maybe
the early years of motherhood, which I missed sharing
with you on playground benches. But surely I will see you
on the bus someday, and your greeting will package
our jokes, advice, tears, book talk, our years of reliance.
And so I will expect you will tell me how much I have
misunderstood and wrongly assumed in these descriptions,
because I never expect those people who have mattered
to remain completely gone, even through death, or rebuke.
And of course I have to remember what parted us,
that I found faults with your other friends, that I spoke
as critically and crassly about them as I did about my own person,
and to this day I have to be careful of that trait, my junkyard
dog of expression, safe only with me on a too-long leash. Here,
again, telling you everything with no reason but for
memory's insistence that I string an apology from what I see.





The pregnancy of words
 

Eros scrabbles to rose and rage
to gear or gare, as in Gare du Nord,
where I trained in to Paris from not
smoking pot in Master Mad, I'm sorry,
Amsterdam, with its canals
called grachts and clocks
that bonged my homesick hours
at different times. Which is smite
for you violet types, a flower
that says "love it if you listen. Me, I do
and don't feel it matters that evil thrives
in live, that we tinker and smash
everything down to bits and then
try to patch a path back home, it's our lotto
in life, to have no clue
what a natural disaster is
when that disaster is us. That's what I love
about the shrug, it says zilch
sans le mouth and becomes
more aerobic the more you admit
the less you know, you know? It's a jumble
out there, kids, with slips and slides
and elide's eally ool, depending
what's lopped off, as in light of hand
or slight of and, but I better spot
before you pots how sparse
this parsing is. Besides, what can I say
about language other than it's an anal egg
in need of one glorious u. Words
or sword--pick your poisson. Every time
I try to peak into speaking, the bag
of gab to learn what our noodles
are really up to, I get flummoxed
that the tools I use
are the stool I stand on
to see a way in or out. I can't even tell
if I'm more trapped or rapt,
if meaning's mean or play's
a dumb waiter riding numbly
up and down. But have you noticed
read becomes dear
if you ignore the world
as you find it and find it in you
to swirl the word, in the way
solve and loves are the same
bones, different skeletons.





After Vallejo
 

intensity and height


I want to write, but only foam comes out,
I want to say so much but it's all crap--
there aren't any numbers left that can't be added up,
nobody writes down pyramids without meaning it.

I want to write, but I've got a puma's brains;
I want to crown myself with laurel, but it stinks of onions.
There's no word spoken that doesn't dissolve in mist,
there's no god and no son of god, only progress.

So come on, to hell with it, let's go eat weeds,
eat the flesh and fruit of our stupid
tears and moans, of our pickled melancholy souls.

Come on! Let's go! So what if I'm wounded--let's go
drink what's already been drunk,
let's go, crow, and find another crow to fuck.



hat, coat, gloves


Right in front of the Comedie-Francaise 
is the Regency Cafe; and right inside it, there's this room, hidden, 
with a table and an easy chair. When I go in, 
house dust, already on its feet, stands motionless. 

Between my lips made of rubber, a cigarette butt 
smolders, and in the smoke you can see two intensive 
smokes, the cafe's thorax, and in that 
thorax an oxide of elemental grief. 

It matters that autumn grafts itself into other autumns, 
it matters that autumn merges into young shoots, 
the cloud into half-years, cheekbones into a wrinkle. 

It's crucial to smell like a madman who spouts 
theories about how hot snow is, how fugitive the turtle, 
the "how how easy, how deadly the "when. 



best case


Look, at the very best, I'm someone other -- 
some guy who walks around marble statues, who enters 
his adult clay into indexes of blood, and feels 
the rage and fear of the fox chased to its hole -- 

and if someone anoints my shoulders 
with indigos of mercy, I'll declare 
to my absent soul that there's no hellishly 
paradisal elsewhere for me to go. 

And if they try to choke me on the sea's wafer, 
telling me it tastes like His flesh, more acid 
than sweet, like Kant's notions of truth, I'll cough 

it all up: No, never! I'm other as a germ, a satanic 
tubercle, a moral ache in a plesiosaur's molar: 
in my posthumous suspicions, all bets are off! 



another day of life


I'll die in my apartment on a cold bright day, 
with nobody around, the apartment next door gone 
dead still while wind whistles through the balcony, 
though the branches somehow aren't moving, just as the sun 

doesn't move, everything's so quiet, so frozen. 
Parked cars, plastic bags bleached in the bare trees, 
a couple of those Mylar balloons tied to a chair on 
the balcony next door, celebrating something, maybe? 

... now sagging listless on the floor, 
as if every last molecule had been pierced by a needle -- 
Tom Sleigh is dead, he stared up into the air, 

the sky was pale blue as usual and he couldn't feel 
the cold coming through the window, and there wasn't 
much to say or not say -- and nobody, anyway, to say or not say it. 



my jailer won't weep to be my liberator


My cell's four walls, whitening in the sun, 
keep counting one another -- but their number 
never changes, despite my jailer's 
innumerable keys to chains 

wrenching the nerves to their extremities. 
The two longer walls hurt me more -- who knows why -- 
their salt-stained cracks like two mothers who die 
after labor, but give birth to twin boys 

whose hands they still hold. And here I am, 
all alone, with just my right hand to make do 
for both hands, raising it high into 

the air to search for the third arm 
that between my where and my when 
will father this crippled coming-of-age of a man. 



insomnia is the only prayer left


How childish is the spectacle of the stained 
glass's holiness: the night doesn't give a shit what 
goes on inside human beings, the night 
has its own web of dendrites refuting the inane 

prayers prayed for the dying, for the confessions 
going on between earthworms and earth, between 
the way a man argues with his own shoulder bones. 
All the while, barracudas in a coral canyon, 

a sea turtle flying, swim through fathoms 
and fathoms of images that keep crashing 
on the shore of the eye that never shuts -- 

and smarts in its sleeplessness staring 
up into the dark shadowed by stingrays, gas stations, 
the slow flapping wing of a lottery ticket.





The Animals in the Zoo Dont Seem Worried
 

Looking at the lion behind the plate glass
I wasn't sure what I was looking at: a lion, OK,
but he seemed to come apart, not literally

I mean, but I couldn't see him whole:
Mane. Teeth. The slung belly pumping
as he panted and began to roar. His balls

sheathed in fur swaying a little. His tail's tuft
jerking in an arc like an old-time pump handle
rusted in midair. Somebody or something

I read once said that when Jesus had his vision
of what his father, God, would do to him,
that Jesus could only see pieces of a cross,

pieces of a body appearing through flashes
of sun, as if the body in his vision
was hands looking for feet, a head for a torso,

everything come unmagnetized from the soul:
the lion caught me in his stare not at
or through me but fixated on the great chain

of being that Jesus couldn't see and that
a zebra might gallop in--black and white stripes
marking longitudes of this world turning

to meat, bloody meat--this vision of an inmate
that Jesus's father helped to orchestrate by
making a cageless cage with glass instead

of bars--though the lion didn't seem to care,
he was roaring for his keepers to bring
him food, so everything's what it should be

if you're a lion. Nor did the sea lion
seem concerned about having gone a little
crazy, barking incessantly so I could see

the plush, hot pink insides of its throat,
though like the lion through the glass
there's this distortion, my reflection

I'm looking through that makes me float above
the zoo: and now this silence at closing time
pours like a waterfall in different zones

of silences that, pouring through my head,
surround roaring, barking, human muttering--
is any of that what being sounds like?

Or is it just animal gasping like what
Jesus must have heard from the thieves
hanging beside him, one damned, one saved?

What was in his heart when his vision
clarified and he saw it was a hand he
recognized that the nail was driving through?





Holding Court
 

Today I became King
of the Court w/out a diamond-
encrusted crown thrust upon 
my sweaty head. Instead
my markings of royalty
were the t-shirt draping 
my body like a robe soaked 
in champagne & the pain
in my right knee--a sign 
of a battle endured, my will 
tested & bested by none 
as the ball flew off my hands
as swift as an arrow toward
the heart of a target--my fingers 
ringless yet feeling like gold.





Forged
 

My brother wore bags over his boots
              to keep the grease & grime from his time
                           at the steel mill off the carpet & steps

he mounted, heaving each foot
               like a monster born of the grave
                            -yard shift--stiff & awkward,

his arms smeared w/dark matter,
               the lather of machine & industry
                             bathing his clothes & face in a glaze

of sweat & smoke, oil & the dirt
               of what's been done before--the work
                             of uncles & cousins who wore the same

jumpsuit, goggles & gloves to grab hold
               of cold finished bars using their backs
                             & shoulders to move the weight around

w/the help of machines, the knobs
               to control the two-ton bundles
                             held by a buckle above the heads

of hard-hatted men that could snap
               & let loose the mass of all that metal
                             meant to weld into a foundation,

a beginning to build upon
               when it was his time to work,
                            to clock in clean & leave

feeling filthy no matter the shift
               or stiffness in the bones creaking
                             like the wooden stairs he climbed





Blockbusters
 

He lives in Leeds, completely out of the literary world.--John FreemanThrillers like The Da Vinci Code are one of the key indicators of contemporary ideological shifts.--Slavoj iek
For what might break a writer's block that grips
my pen as if King Arthur's sword, I quest
through bookshops of My Lady Charity
in Urbs Leodiensis Mystica,
completely outside Freeman's (as most) worlds,
where locals speak blank verse (says Harrison);
Back-to-Front Inside-Out Upside-Down Leeds,
according to the Nuttgens book I bagged
along with authors promising keys to open
secrets of iambic pentameter,
how it's a ball and chain, a waltz--but best,
in iek's wind sock for the New World Order,
Gnostic code imprinted by five feet
that lead us to a Grail Brown liquefies
as Shakespeare melts to decasyllabics
like congealed saint's blood in a Naples shrine.
Brown quotes from Philip's Gospel where it suits
to build on Rosslyn Chapel's premises
vast hypophetic labyrinths in the air
yet blind to masons' mysteries below,
who carved among the seven virtues greed
with charity being made a deadly sin...
The world was made in error, Philip wrote--
Savonarola, in The Rule of Four
(another blockbuster from Oxfam's shelves)
is made to quote "the Gospel of Paul--
does error here disguise some secret truth?
What if Paul's Gospel were real, a Gnostic text
thrown on the Bonfire of the Vanities
so seen there by our zealot's burning eyes,
its road map to the true Grail turning to ash?
My back-to-back looks on a blind man's road
to Wilfred's city, where he came from Rome
to blitz our monks for "Simon Magus tonsures
after that Gnostic heresiarch
a dog denounces in St. Peter's Acts,
while Peter raised smoked tuna from the dead,
explained his crucifixion upside down,
then how God's Kingdom might be found on Earth:
make right your left, back forwards, low your high...
quite suddenly, like Paul I saw the light
through Peter's apophatic paradox,
my block was my von Eschenbach stone grail,
freeing my pen like Arthur's sword to write
this poem backwards, as Da Vinci might.





Intelligent Design
 

Shiraishi called upon the great sky cock,
wanted an explanation, wondered, why
the echo of form without the wisdom,
why the bent wit without the timing.
Wondered, as I have, how a man, bare
upon the bed may rise as if in praise
but fail to be grateful for the gift at hand.
O dick of questionable devise.
O schlong of longing, as present
but ultimately unknowable as your
maker, I would worship at the fount
if I had more faith, if I knew your
weeping eye was on me alone.





"Lucretius grabbed my arm and lead me
 

Lucretius grabbed my arm and lead me
to the spot where he went nuts. I watered little
drums right away and entangled the Sava River
with knitting needles. I putrefied a small soup,
dismembered seven towels. There, He--The 
Terrible--burnt on the stake, squatted, too.
My god, I beat him up his ass. Puff, puff, but 
no one had heard a thing. Now here, I'm flooded
with flowers by cumin. Even Tarkovsky appears.
Now I will suck you with my thumbs, mold
you like clay with my horns, till he'd vaporize and
see into what and where I've traveled to. Into
honor. Into white birch trees. Into the pouch
used for bread. I hung around the world a lot,
frothily crushing the mountain range. With no
avail, with no day's pay, sticky are my laws.
I protected an elephant as much as I could,
stared at the back of the horse. Joshed the others
now, too, tested spring mattresses. Kept
gulping nirvana. Loosened feathery leaves,
wrapped the emperor into a roll. To not let my
senses perish, to gallop without a break.





Legs on the Signpost
 

The insane devotee throbs with his
small legs, I don't dare more.

The insane devotee throbs with his
small legs, I cannot do more. Bricks are

yellow, made of polyvinyl, fattish. We
people die. Lemme aks you, no l's no

r's from the Japanese and Chinese,
only the white mushroom,

a cataract. Animals are prolific. You
come from the valley, from your

spine. From something more? From
the risen sun. To smoke oneself

on the roof. To change clothes and
dry one's hair in water lily.





The Rise of the Zebra
 

The rise of the zebra hurts the zebra.
As if she would breathe fire.
If we put natural gold and the black blue into 
the loaf of bread it bursts.

Find and shove,
open and wound.

The oars when kneaded in and then stretched,
row.
How they bump into wheat
on the white surface again.

Maenka!
There are three corpses in Gravel Cave.
One keeps silent.
One snowballs.
One conceals.





Mrs. God
 

God and Mrs. God in watercolor blue skirt desolate.--David Schubert
I am not a woman, I
am a man. Made in His image.
I keep the house, a gray Cape Cod,
and broom it well. I wear a skirt to be
comfortable. I build the fire.
When my husband comes home I don't pester Him with questions.
He knows where to find His slippers and His pipe.
Out our kitchen back door I see the prophets freight-hopping
the long bad Western in ancient English
that no one need read to know. Everyone speaks his part:
the women keep their heads down
while the men are losing theirs. Children?
How often I've prayed for a child, which means
slipping meaning looks to my husband as we rock
together on the porch of an evening, drinking lemonade
and playing Scrabble. If He lets me win
it's a sign. I haven't won yet.
But the neighbor children come and go
and take the pies cooling on the windowsill
without thanks. Sometimes terrible things
happen to them--some man
spills the blood
cradled so carefully in every hand. I accept
no blame. The pies were there to leave alone,
or not. God says nothing
but taps out His pipe, stands, with a hand
to ease His aching back. Time for bed.
Our bed is a rolling ocean that I tread alone
just a head bobbing above the ash-colored waves
while the moon waits for me and everything
to drown, to know again the peace
the moon knows, the silence interrupted by astronauts,
little green men, the spectacle a mother
can't help but make of herself. God
comes to bed
and I clutch a spar, a barrel, an oar,
and ride out the night with it. When He fucks me
still He doesn't speak, for speech is creation
but I rock with him, I roll inside
what cannot be comprehended, in force. I forget
that I'm a man, I forget the wild sea, I let slip
my grasp and the colors I have
that cover me. Once I dreamed
of the morning: we left the house together
in identical sober suits, we stood in the street
and beheld the sad little town, wreathed in black crepe
for its children. As though the morning
could show me His face. He coughed.
And when I awoke
in our ordinary bed, streaked by sun through leaded windows, I held
my baby to my breast and watched the roof beam
and whispered to her, It's all right,
we are safe only and always 
from our dreams.





Animals
 

As the extinguished.
As creatures, coming out to play
in the twilight of creation
human faces intelligent and suffering,
turned upward entering the trees.
The charismatic megafauna:
polar bears, moose, rippling massive flanks
to shake loose biting flies.
The fox and the vixen. The leopard
dazzling in his camouflage, breaking
the urgent glass. In the underlayer
of humus and moss and broken clay
the cryptogams, the earthworms turning
between the wizardly fingers
of the forest, managed growth
of the second order, the third, steered
toward what shoal, a history
for the benefit of imaginary extrinsic persons.
In the branches snowy owls
and ravens, or the rock pigeons we call
pigeons, that can't perch in trees, that swarm cities
like the flying rats they are, hungry,
iridescent at the neck like the
rats themselves shining like a collar
at the base of a public sculpture
monument to the fundamental flight
through corridors of power, mathematics,
heat death rippling like an invisible wave
down State Street, paralleling Michigan,
pushed by the restless concinnations
of the El, cutting longitudes across the lake itself,
desert of water
meeting the migrations of alien carp and
cosmic rays, diving deep for the wreck
of the Edmund Fitzgerald
or swimming invisible lines, boundaries
policed by radar, from Canada
a mass of air launched by minute variations
in temperature, push and pull over heat
islands, carbon dioxide absorption,
ozone exhaustion invisible and intervening
like a god: that which manifests
through its action on substance, not itself
substance: weak forces, atmospheres,
unnamed unmet animal species
gone extinct, whole genuses, phyla,
unknowable kingdoms and principalities,
coral reefs burned black like
the crouched and burdened angels,
muscular sketches of our vacancy
as in an etching by Blake, horizontal,
the spiritual body 
dividing like a hyphen the upper from the lower,
phatic messenger of betweenness,
inhuman round eyes fixed on nothing, on suffering,
folly, sporting events, on Gaza--
wings outstretched to bandage the eyes of Heaven,
our eyes
as they would bandage the wound of a headless child 
or conceal the strength of a people
from their weakness, the mortals
masquerading as their own fates, individuals
slashed open by solitude, acts of mourning
and revenge, writing themselves
into the text of righteousness. The messengers
reveal nothing, like the animals
marching slowly toward me now, two by two,
tongues lolling, eyes lit from within hollow and sparkling
as a cave concealed from light for thirty thousand years
but concealed no longer. Grace have I none
but what can be inferred
by arms opening, palms, head tilting back
to catch rain in my jaws:
what is born, now, what wrests its way
out of the eternal feminine, the body
my only warrant, against monuments my pledge
to the immaculate moment. What is born
is not of me, or the we, or of god, or animals.
It is a wing. It is bleeding.
It masks my eyes until the thunder comes
to open the openness over all.





The Same Old Riddle
 

We keep trying to kill it, split it, hack
It to itsy bits. We suspend it
On the wall where we can see it
Passing. We hang it around our necks

Or wrists, laying pulse next to
Pulse as if each might like 
Company. Ba-bump, etc. Rising 
And setting has everything to do

With it. In the afternoon we feel so
Lazy we try not to close our eyes
And jerk awake, wondering what has
Passed, and where did we go

For that suspended hour,
And could anything keep us here.





Kept in Mind
 

Hildegard believed
A woman's brain drew

Heat to itself, drew seed
From a man all the way up

The spine's long stair
The stake bracing the spine

Licking all the way orange,
Red, blue--shut it--

And why not? My brain has been
Hungry all this time.





From Space
 

You are smaller than I remember
And so is the house, set downhill
Afloat in a sea of scrub oak. From up here
It's an ordinary box with gravel

Spread over its lid, weighting it, but
Inside it's full of shadows and sky.
Clouds pull themselves over dry
Grass, which, if I'm not mistaken, will erupt

Any minute in flame. Only 
A spark, a sunbeam focused. From up 
Here, enjoying the view, I can finally 
Take you in. Will you wave back? I keep

Slingshotting around. There's gravity
For you, but all I ever wanted was to fly.





Triolet with Pachyderm
 

I don't have to outrun the elephant,
I just have to outrun you.
I don't have to race with a belligerent 
ten-point buck, outpace an elephant
in musth. I don't need to flee a wrathful firmament
or dance with a choleric jackboot.
I don't have to outrun the elephant.
I only have to outrun you.





Albino
 

A lot more of than thought, unsought, come out white.
Lemurs of Madagascar, and leopards sans spots.

Brilliant, I think, to spurn pigment and burn
in December light, a December filament.

No one would know if there's snow in your hair,
or whether or not, when they knock, you are there.





Brown Girl Manifesto (Too)
 

Metaphor     metaphor     my pestilential aesthetic
      A tsunami powers through     my mother's ruins
Delta     delta     moist loins of the republic
      Succumb to the low-lying succubus     do!

Flagpole     flagpole     my father's polemics
      A bouquet of     fuck-u-bastard flowers
Fist me     embrace me     with your phantom limbs
      Slay me     with your slumlord     panegyrics

Flip over     so I can see your pastoral mounts
      Your sword     slightly parting     from the scabbard
Girl skulls     piled like fresh-baked loaves
      A foul wind     scours my mother's cadaver

Ornamental     Oriental     techno     impresarios
      I am your parlor rug     your chamber bauble
Love me     stone me     I am all yours
      Pound     Pound     my father's Ezra

Freedom     freedom     flageolet-tooting   girls
Dancing     on the roof     of the maquiladoras





From "YOU DA ONE
 

At the airport, we all take a shot of aguardiente
because we all had each other's faces
When I saw my brother I saw my face
I saw my grandmother I saw my face
I saw my aunt I saw my stupid face
On the way up the mountain I saw my face in a pile of trash
I saw my face in the mule's ass
I saw my lover I saw my face but it was white & weary
I saw my brother again and there was my face;
               my other brother, my other face
I saw my face in the American Apparel ivory chiffon blouse
I brought for this occasion
In the occasion I saw my face, I did

I saw my face in the pankekes the next morning
My face was in the talk of death
My face was in her teeth, the pavement, etc.,
There was a jail cell at the Museo Nacional, I saw my face
A woman flowercunted & crosslegged, my face & my face
Everywhere my face like I didn't have one
Botero's asses all my faces
I took down notes when it came to torture
& the inquisition and saw my face in the leather swing set
Clavicle spikerest & eye ruptrest
Faces, I suppose, are a type of torture
to look like one but never be one

The Gospel of Ometotl, the Brown Adam
 

People walk through you, the wind steals your voice,you're a burra, buey, scapegoat,forerunner of a new race,half and half--both woman and man, neither--a new gender.                          --Gloria Anzalda
Jasmine garlands thin
             for the rib's cartilage ring.

The heart shudders with pure mission.

                                                         She spreads
                                                          & knows herself as Adam,
                                                          Ometotl,

                                                          but through himself,
                                                          Omechuatl,

                                                          he is Eve.

             He knows but what the garden gives:

                        the garden's soot
                         awakened tongueless in root.

             Cerise chrysantha
                         coils around his leg.

             Gathering the tides
                                     of the seas to his side,
                                     she conceives

                                     where impossibilities seed.

            Clarity burning coal,                he takes two knots

                                                of grass
                                                & strings

                        four birds-of-paradise

            through the ceiba's rotted leaves:

                                    she fashions the sorrows
                                     from winter's purse,

                                     sea
                                     & sun

                                     sifted for sum.

                         Entrammeled, Ometotl rises
                                     one among one

                         body stitched in strange altar.





Teresa the Idiot
 

In reality my loves
are the strange box of a Polish doll
The blonde's eyes appearing
fixed to her hips long after midnight
the garret always singular to loosen
a massive mane 
across her back, its strands
thick and fine draping
her otter-like chin
Deliberately she'd peer out from the wall 
and nothing could be seen but the shadow of her breasts
hidden beneath marmots of hair
And lovely was her skin's radiance
at that unusual hour
Her waist's digressions
easily discerned
as bees through grass
the window neither open nor closed
What I saw, yellow like crystal,
rose from sleepy thighs
amassed in unseemly tourniquets
Everything before me, a pale shimmer
of hairs fanning delicately
to reveal the pink or green skin I no longer know
of hips a million centimeters
from my gaze.





Dream Song #16
 

Hay golpes en la vida, tan fuertes...Yo no s!                       --Csar Vallejo
They sniffed us out of the holes with the animals
they had programmed and there are blows in life so
powerful we just don't know and there were trenches
and there was water and it poured in through our mouths

and out of our ears and there were things we saw in the
sand at that moment of sinking: mountains and daisies
and tulips and rivers and the bodies of the people we
had been and the bodies of the people we had loved

and we felt hooks coming through the trenches and we
felt hooks coming through the sand and I saw hooks coming
through my child's clothes and I wanted him to know that they
would never be able to scoop us out of the sand but of course

it wasn't true they had scooped us out of the sand and our
mouths were so full of dirt it is what they do when you're
dead and they made us spit and they beat us until our mouths
were empty and they paid us for constructing the mountain and

it was me and L and we looked for S and we looked for J and J
and we looked for O and we looked for R and we looked for J
and S in the holes in which the bodies of those we loved were
hiding or dying or sinking or stealing some shelter some little

worm's worth of cover to keep their bodies from dissolving
into the maniac murmurs of this impossible carcass economy





Dream Song #17
 

They took my body to the forest
They asked me to climb a ladder

I did not want to climb a ladder
But they forced me to climb the ladder

If you don't climb the ladder
we will bury you in the foamy mud

I had to decide: should I die
by hanging or by burial

I climbed the ladder and they wrapped
a belt around the thick limb of a tree

And then when I could no longer breathe
they tossed me into a stream

And I floated to the edge of the village
where someone prayed for my soul

It's like this in a lullaby
for the end of the world:

The options for the end
are endless

But this is not really a lullaby
for the end of the world

It's about the beginning
what happens when we start to rot

in the daylight
The way the light shines on

the ants and worms and parasites
mauling our bodies

It's about the swarms of dogs
gnawing our skin and bones

Do you know what it's like
when a ghost licks your intestines

Do you know what it's like
when a rat devours your brain

To avoid the hole
the children must sing sweetly, softly

To avoid the hole
they must fill their songs with love





Sparks, Nevada
 

In the middle of the night, father
Brought me a falcon.

By morning, it ripped the wire and flew the hill
Into the highway.

When they found me in that car
My sleeve stemmed in blood,

I didn't know what it was
I was trying to kill.

I saw a craft of orphans steaming down the river.
They were dressed in white and silent as a sance.

It was then I spoke to the bird.

Already God is shaking his black seed
Back into me.





Twelve in Yellow-Weed at the Edge
 

Then, the police arrive--they don't find me.
I'm disguised as a boy in a champagne wig
And hid inside the gold rattle of a warm Appalachia wind.
Beneath the trash of willow, I am. The sorrow
Of trailer parks and carnie uncles. The poor
Girl's underworld, a weedy thing. The night,
With its kingdom of lanterns and awful blue lark.
How we waited, how we hid
Like wolves, in the revolving question of a field.





To Love as Aswang
 

With razorblade eyes                       The Filipina is most sincere
With too much water                      And will make a very good wife.

With animal teeth                            The Filipina is a loyal partner,
We sometimes kill                            Deserving of all your love.

With splintered hands                    The Filipina is the total package,
With too much life                           Much more than meets the eye.

With ribcage unlocked                   The Filipina is not for you,
We wither your roots                     If you cannot handle her claws.







To Be Walang Hiya
 

Bubblegum lip gloss kissed,                Our lifelines, our mirrors,

I was never a singkil princess            These are Luminous Mysteries--

Knuckle cracking, polished toes,        Our notebooks, our language,

I was never a Santacruzan queen      To witness, to make way,

Black eyeliner, push up bra                  Our thirst and our wedding bands--

I was never a curtsying debutante    To fill stone jars with water, to wed,

Loud, gum-smacking babygirl             Our glamour and our armor.

I was never a tiaraed Miss Fil Am     To transfigure, dazzling as the sun.





My Daughter Charity Thinketh No Evil
 

After Herman Melville
Glad, on
time pennies
click hard
at your teeth

everyone is throwing them

Gathered about you in a circle
on the deck
everyone is catching them
a blue flame about their heads cocked back
               over the railing

Glass
you think
in the middle
and wheat stands from which time
is made

on the upper decks'
passing of the banks

That's not the brittle
moment above you

On shore, leaves turn
their gray
sunless sides
every which way

The riverboat
is very small

it will never get here





From a Finished Basement
 

In our arteries and eyes, a hundred lightbulbs 
throb like drugs. The furnace: 
a permanent mishap.

 And up in the dusk, there is lucid debris-- 
a conduit, a wire mask, a swastika 
of corn.

Boy- and/or girl-small, we'll find 
some horizon, an intricate faking 
in which to lose way.

Here we are, not speaking 
or dead. Here we are 
or dead.

To what do we owe this
forgetting not to kiss?
Not that any given face is not afraid.





Pop Song
 

Don't let me down.
Don't not let the day drown.

Face your waste of time. 

 This is all.
 This is all you are.

 This is all you are allowed.





Day After Day of the Dead
 

--"mu forty-eighth part--
"While we're alive, we kept
     repeating. Tongues, throats,
 roofs of our mouths bone dry,
       skeletons we'd someday
                                                    be...
    Panicky masks we wore for
        effect more than effect,
      more real than we'd admit...
  
  No longer wanting to know
    what soul was, happy to
                                               see
       shadow, know touch...
  Happy to have sun at our
    backs, way led by shadow,
  happy to have bodies, block
                                                     light...
 Afternoon sun lighting leaf,
        glint of glass, no matter what,
            about to be out of body it
                                                            seemed...
    Soon to be shadowless we thought,

     said we thought, not to be offguard,
  caught out. Gray morning we            
                                                         meant
           to be done with, requiem so
       sweet we forgot what it lamented,
                                                                     teeth
     turning to sugar, we
   grinned
  
                        
  
   Day after day of the dead we were
     desperate. Dark what the night
 before we saw lit, bones we'd
        eventually be... At day's end a
                                                             new
   tally but there it was, barely
                                                      begun,
   rock the clock tower let go of,
      iridescent headstone, moment's
     rebuff... Soul, we saw, said we
                                                           saw,
 invisible imprint. No one wanted to
                                                                  know
    what soul was... Day after day of
        the dead we were deaf, numb to
      what the night before we said moved
                                                                         us,
    fey light's coded locale... I fell away,
 we momentarily gone, deaf but to
       brass's obsequy, low brass's
    croon begun. I fell away, not fast,
                                                                floated,
         momentary mention an accord
   with the wind, day after day of the dead
     the same as day before day of
  
the dead... "No surprise, I fell away
       muttering, knew no one would
                                                               hear,
    not even
      me

                       

   We wore capes under which we
were in sweaters out at the elbow.
 Arms on the table, we chewed our
                                                                spoons...
      Mouthing the blues, moaned an
 abstract truth, kept eating. The
  dead's morning-after buffet
someone said it was. Feast of 
                                                      the
unfed said someone else... What
  were we doing there the exegete
 kept asking, adamant, uninvited,
                                                              morose...

     Elbows in the air like wings, we
         kept eating, rolled our eyes,
                                                            kept
      shoveling it in... Day after day
of the dead we were them. We
  ate inexhaustibly, ate what wasn't
                                                                there,
        dead no longer dying of thirst,
      hung over, turned our noses up
                                                                to
    what
   was





             ________________

  It was me, we were it, insensate,
   sugared sweat what what we drank
tasted like. Even so, the tips of
                                                         our
   tongues tasted nothing, we sipped
without wincing... We ate cakes,
                                                            we
ate fingernail soup, a new kind of
    gazpacho, no one willing to say
  what soul was... Knucklebone
souffl we ate, we ate gristle, eyes
                                                              we
     took from flies flying backward
   a kind of caviar, none of us wanting
                                                                   to say
 what soul
was





Lone Coast Anacrusis
 

--"mu fifty-third part--
 
    Some new Atlantis known as Lower
 Ninth we took leave of next, half the
   turtle's back away. Whole bodies
         we saw floating, not only heads...
      Endless letting go, endless looking
                                                                     else-
    where, endless turning out to be
  otherwise... Woods all around where
        we came to next. We'd been
     eating wind, we'd been drinking
                                                                wind,
    rumoring someone looked at God eye
  to eye... In what seemed a dream but
         we saw wasn't we saw dirt sliding.
       We were back and all the buildings
      were gone. What were cliffs to us
                                                                  we
   wondered, blown dust of Bandiagara,
                                                                       what
 the eroding precipice we saw... Ground
     acorns ground our teeth now. All but
   all gums, we were where the Alone
      lived, came to a clearing lit by light
                                                                       so
     bright we staggered, Nub it was we knew
         we were still in... The mountain of
       the night a mound of nothing, Toulali's
                                                                              burr
   what balm there was. Toulali's burr what
     balm, remote though it was, lifetimes
 behind us now... Voice laryngitic, lost
        and lost again, blown grit rubbed it
                                                                        away...
     Someone had said something came to
 mind. Someone had sung something, what
   its words were no one could say. Sang
                                                                        it
       bittersweet, more brusque than bitter,
                                                                            song's
     cloth endowment stripped... Choric strain,
         repeatedly slipped entablature. Given...
                                                                                 Given
           endlessly again... No telling when but
         intent on telling, no telling what. Wished
                                                                                   we
       were home
    again
  

                     
  
   Refugees was a word we'd heard,
 raw talk of soul insistent, adamant,
       the nonsong we sang or the song
     we nonsang, a word we'd heard we
                                                                    heard
   was us... Wept in our sleep, again
 one with what would never again be
     there, raw talk rummaged our book,
                                                                      the
          backs of our hands written on with
       cornmeal, the awaited ones reluctant
                                                                          again...
             The city of sad children's outskirts we
       were in, woods notwithstanding, woods
        nonetheless, bright light the light we
                                                                           saw
            as we were jolted, raw talk spiraling
                                                                              away...
                We were there and somewhere else no
              matter where we were, everywhere more
                than where we were... Where the Alone
          lived we donned abalone-shell ornaments,
            light's clarity conceded, night yet to relent,
                                                                                          Toulali
                 smoldered on, semisang, semispoke, wrestled
         with his tongue it seemed... We trudged in place,
               barely lifted our feet, backbeat hallowing
             every step we took,       moved us albeit we
                                                                                          stayed
                    put. We were where we were, somewhere
                  else no matter where, evacuees a word we'd
                                                                                                 heard...
      Stutter step, stuck shuffle, dancelike, Toulali's
         croon enticed us, toyed with us, ground gone
                                                                                          under
    where we
 stood



             ______________

   Day of the new dead or a new day
of the dead, La Catrina had we been
       farther south... One of us out
    of Mexico remembered, with us
                                                              from
        no one could say when... Day
      of the new dead a new day of the 
                                                                  dead...
   Wind in off the water blew us there.

     A beat before. Beginning's beginning.
Never to be there again... Beginning beaten
   back, aboriginal. The Alone collecting
                                                                        shells
    on Lone Coast... They were the awaited
                                                                            ones'
        grudge not the awaited ones, the awaited
    ones' wish not to be there... Grudge or its
       ghost, grudge against going, grudge to've
     been anywhere at all... Gnostic hostages
                                                                              down
         on all fours, then-again's beginning, beat
                                                                                    before
         beginning be-
      grudged



                    

    We were in the woods again circling,
not far from Lone Coast,        kids again,
  wondered why anything was. The city of
          sad children a mood swing away,
                                                                       we
      strode imagining nothing, redwoods
   everywhere, muttered barely audibly,
         "Nothing is, nothing ever was,
                                                                  chill
 so intrinsic we shook... No lament was
     it, not exactly insight, precocious not
   quite what it was. Beginning's beginning
it seemed we came abreast of, beginning's 
  beginning's ghost... We shivered, would've

          except we stopped, stood looking at the sunlight

Ghost of a Trance
 

--"mu sixty-first part--
 
    Gray morning, blue morning, a
 feather blown between. Mashed
   earth incumbent, gone up from,
                                                             never
       more naked if ever to be naked,
         brink what it was to be on...
   Where next we came stick-figure
     people greeted us. Abstract
                                                        was
 abstract, also something else. Line,
     shape, extension each other
    than itself, of number we'd have
        said the same... Aspect arrested
      us, riveted we stood... Stick-
    figure epiphany held us in our
                                                            tracks,
        everyone's bones in full view...

      morning, blue morning, an unheard
 string between. Bad heads' morning
    reluctance, ennui's next-day dispatch...
                                                                           We
        were chill, shiver, exegetic sweat, backed-
      up interpreters put upon by sluff, none
 of us could say what was what. Pale
   admonishment poised upon lack,
                                                               like

        to what would otherwise not have been.
 We contested birth, we wanted to be pre-
   andoumboulouous, done-dead gnostics
                                                                           again...
      Sound bubbled up, it kept bubbling, sonic
    residue, sonic remit. A fickle sonance,
 fraught sonance, warning we knew nothing,
     stick-figure entourage otherwise issue-
   less, beginning to be remiss it seemed...
                                                                           Erst-

        of what lifted us, ghost what lifted us,

   extended. Pilgrim someone called me, I said

       been and we were again where the Alone lived,
           adage, had it not been so abstract, it might've
        been... Long day of the abalone-shell sunset...
                                                                                            Stood
           among redwoods expecting the worst... What

   Told my horse we would gather at

  drank, planet sludge. Double-take
told its horse whoa, told it unwhoa,

Song of the Andoumboulou: 85
 

 
    Came now to another crossroads.
 Stick people stood awaiting us, to
  the left, straight ahead, to the right.
         What was that song you sang,
                                                                they
   asked, spoke without sound sound's
     immanence, not without song but
 only one song, the one song summon-
  ing song's eclipse... The one song
                                                               sang
      song's inconsequence, crooned it
    could not've been otherwise, song
          song's own lament... The one
       song sang song's irrelevance, we
                                                                   were
    exhausted, we looked straight ahead,
                                                                        left,
 right. The stick people's question fa-
   tigued us, glyphed riddle whose
 decipherment they said we'd someday
                                                                      be,
      exegetes against our will... Lack,
    reluctance, pallor, eidolon. Crossroads
 cryptogram, they themselves were sing-
  ing, nothing not what could be seen they
                                                                             said,
   soul not sign if not eyelight, song more
     what could be seen than they could
 say, wan unwillingness they said... Slick
                                                                         stick
  people, tricky, soul a sick thing they said...
 Signs all said Stick City. Stick City straight
       ahead, to the left, to the right, signs pointed
                                                                                        every
     which way... Stick sublimity sent us reeling,
   a we that wasn't we against one that was. Mass,
 intangible we it was we were, beads thrown off
  in a row... We'd have given anything to get to
                                                                                     Stick
         City and there we were. Whatever way we
       took would take us there. Stick City loomed
  ahead and to the left and to the right, any which
    way but in back of us, Stick City meant no
 turning back... Signs all said Stick City. We
                                                                               read
      them all out loud, "Stick City. "Styxicity,
                                                                                   Itamar
   quipped... It wasn't water we crossed, it wasn't
      hell we were in. Stick City housed our hearts'
desires we were told, Stick City stood without
  end or assistance, line long since what stuck...
                                                                                       Line
        was all point, point all extensity, stick's own
    deictic drop... No longer point less point than
      point's target, Stick City made them one and the
  same... So it was on to where the signs said next,
                                                                                           Stick
           the one place we were yet to arrive at, Diddie Wa
       Diddie's twin. A winding road it now was we were
         on, so curved we could see our backs. No work,
     no worry up ahead we heard, music's utopic
                                                                                       stir...
         Hogs lay stuck with knives and forks, chickens
       likewise we heard. A wall of beats for backup, Stick
                                                                                                    City
     way off somewhere... As quick as that we were there,
 Stick City. It wasn't the way we heard it was. Everyone
  limped, walked with a cane, no way how we heard it
                                                                                                 was...
      As quick as that there we were. Stick City lay before
  us, lied about. Legbaland it might've been... Diddie Wa
    Diddie's non-identical twin if twin it was, no way the
                                                                                                    way
      we heard it
    was



                    

   Stick-figure escorts ushered us in,
pointed out what was what. Stick
      people's gait was flawless, they
    said, unstick people limped on
                                                             sticks...
  A strand of horsehair lay in the
    road, hair from a horse's tail. Come
rain it became a snake, would-be stick
                                                                      though
      Stick City said no... It was getting
                                                                   to
  be late again, the arcade's light less

       kept in name only, "Stick City ours

gathered, mum to the bone. Frown, furrowed

    no song we sang, what the song was we sang
   moot... The strand-of-horsehair-become-a-snake
became a rope around our necks, rope what the

Venus and Adonis
 

 
 Even as the sun with purple-colour'd face
      Had ta'en his last leave of the weeping morn,
      Rose-cheek'd Adonis tried him to the chase;
      Hunting he lov'd, but love he laugh'd to scorn;      
        Sick-thoughted Venus makes amain unto him,
        And like a bold-fac'd suitor gins to woo him.
  
      Thrice fairer than myself,' thus she began,
      The field's chief flower, sweet above compare,        
      Stain to all nymphs, more lovely than a man,
      More white and red than doves or roses are;
        Nature that made thee, with herself at strife,
        Saith that the world hath ending with thy life.     
  
      Vouchsafe, thou wonder, to alight thy steed,
      And rein his proud head to the saddle-bow;
      If thou wilt deign this favour, for thy meed
      A thousand honey secrets shalt thou know:    
      Here come and sit, where never serpent hisses;
      And being set, I'll smother thee with kisses:
  
      And yet not cloy thy lips with loath'd satiety,
      But rather famish them amid their plenty,    
      Making them red and pale with fresh variety;
      Ten kisses short as one, one long as twenty:
        A summer's day will seem an hour but short,
        Being wasted in such time-beguiling sport.'         
  
      With this she seizeth on his sweating palm,
      The precedent of pith and livelihood,
      And, trembling in her passion, calls it balm,
      Earth's sovereign salve to do a goddess good:
        Being so enrag'd, desire doth lend her force
        Courageously to pluck him from his horse.
  
      Over one arm the lusty courser's rein
      Under her other was the tender boy, 
      Who blush'd and pouted in a dull disdain,
      With leaden appetite, unapt to toy;
        She red and hot as coals of glowing fire
        He red for shame, but frosty in desire. 
  
      The studded bridle on a ragged bough
      Nimbly she fastens;--O! how quick is love:--
      The steed is stalled up, and even now
      To tie the rider she begins to prove:  
        Backward she push'd him, as she would be thrust,
        And govern'd him in strength, though not in lust.
  
      So soon was she along, as he was down,
      Each leaning on their elbows and their hips: 
      Now doth she stroke his cheek, now doth he frown,
      And gins to chide, but soon she stops his lips;
      And kissing speaks, with lustful language broken,
      If thou wilt chide, thy lips shall never open.'      
  
      He burns with bashful shame; she with her tears
      Doth quench the maiden burning of his cheeks;
      Then with her windy sighs and golden hairs
      To fan and blow them dry again she seeks:  
        He saith she is immodest, blames her miss;
        What follows more she murders with a kiss.
  
      Even as an empty eagle, sharp by fast,
      Tires with her beak on feathers, flesh and bone,      
      Shaking her wings, devouring all in haste,
      Till either gorge be stuff'd or prey be gone;
      Even so she kiss'd his brow, his cheek, his chin,
      And where she ends she doth anew begin.      
  
      Forc'd to content, but never to obey,
      Panting he lies, and breatheth in her face;
      She feedeth on the steam, as on a prey,
      And calls it heavenly moisture, air of grace;         
        Wishing her cheeks were gardens full of flowers
        So they were dewd with such distilling showers.
  
      Look! how a bird lies tangled in a net,
      So fasten'd in her arms Adonis lies;         
      Pure shame and aw'd resistance made him fret,
      Which bred more beauty in his angry eyes:
        Rain added to a river that is rank
        Perforce will force it overflow the bank.  
  
  
      Still she entreats, and prettily entreats,
      For to a pretty ear she tunes her tale;
      Still is he sullen, still he lours and frets,
      Twixt crimson shame and anger ashy-pale;    
        Being red she loves him best; and being white,
        Her best is better'd with a more delight.
  
      Look how he can, she cannot choose but love;
      And by her fair immortal hand she swears,    
      From his soft bosom never to remove,
      Till he take truce with her contending tears,
        Which long have rain'd, making her cheeks all wet;
        And one sweet kiss shall pay this countless debt.
  
      Upon this promise did he raise his chin      
      Like a dive-dapper peering through a wave,
      Who, being look'd on, ducks as quickly in;
      So offers he to give what she did crave;     
        But when her lips were ready for his pay,
        He winks, and turns his lips another way.
  
      Never did passenger in summer's heat
      More thirst for drink than she for this good turn.    
      Her help she sees, but help she cannot get;
      She bathes in water, yet her fire must burn:
        O! pity,' gan she cry, flint-hearted boy:
        Tis but a kiss I beg; why art thou coy?   
  
      I have been woo'd, as I entreat thee now,
      Even by the stern and direful god of war,
      Whose sinewy neck in battle ne'er did bow,
      Who conquers where he comes in every jar;    
        Yet hath he been my captive and my slave,
        And begg'd for that which thou unask'd shalt have.
  
      Over my altars hath he hung his lance,
      His batter'd shield, his uncontrolled crest,         
      And for my sake hath learn'd to sport and dance
      To toy, to wanton, dally, smile, and jest;
        Scorning his churlish drum and ensign red
        Making my arms his field, his tent my bed.         
  
      Thus he that overrul'd I oversway'd,
      Leading him prisoner in a red-rose chain:
      Strong-temper'd steel his stronger strength obey'd,
      Yet was he servile to my coy disdain.       
        O! be not proud, nor brag not of thy might,
        For mastering her that foil'd the god of fight.
  
      Touch but my lips with those falr lips of thine,--
      Though mine be not so fair, yet are they red,--      
      The kiss shall be thine own as well as mine:
      What seest thou in the ground? hold up thy head:
        Look in mine eyeballs, there thy beauty lies;
        Then why not lips on lips, since eyes in eyes?     
  
      Art thou asham'd to kiss? then wink again,
      And I will wink; so shall the day seem night;
      Love keeps his revels where there are but twain;
      Be bold to play, our sport is not in sight: 
        These blue-vein'd violets whereon we lean
        Never can blab, nor know not what we mean.
  
      The tender spring upon thy tempting lip    
      Shows thee unripe, yet mayst thou well be tasted:
      Make use of time, let not advantage slip;
      Beauty within itself should not be wasted:
        Fair flowers that are not gather'd in their prime
        Rot and consume themselves in little time.         
  
      Were I hard-favour'd, foul, or wrinkled-old,
      Ill-nurtur'd, crooked, churlish, harsh in voice,
      O'erworn, despised, rheumatic, and cold,
      Thick-sighted, barren, lean, and lacking juice,      
        Then mightst thou pause, for then I were not for thee;
        But having no defects, why dost abhor me?
  
      Thou canst not see one winkle in my brow;  
      Mine eyes are grey and bright, and quick in turning;
      My beauty as the spring doth yearly grow;
      My flesh is soft and plump, my marrow burning;
        My smooth moist hand, were it with thy hand felt.
        Would in thy palm dissolve, or seem to melt.       
  
      Bid me discourse, I will enchant thine ear,
      Or like a fairy, trip upon the green,
      Or, like a nymph, with long dishevell'd hair,
      Dance on the sands, and yet no footing seen:         
        Love is a spirit all compact of fire,
        Not gross to sink, but light, and will aspire.
  
      Witness this primrose bank whereon I lie;  
      These forceless flowers like sturdy trees support me;
      Two strengthless doves will draw me through the sky,
      From morn till night, even where I list to sport me:
        Is love so light, sweet boy, and may it be
        That thou shouldst think it heavy unto thee?       
  
      Is thine own heart to shine own face affected?
      Can thy right hand seize love upon thy left?
      Then woo thyself, be of thyself rejected,
      Steal thine own freedom, and complain on theft.      
        Narcissus so himself himself forsook,
        And died to kiss his shadow in the brook.
  
      Torches are made to light, jewels to wear,
      Dainties to taste, fresh beauty for the use,         
      Herbs for their smell, and sappy plants to bear;
      Things growing to themselves are growth's abuse:
        Seeds spring from seeds, and beauty breedeth beauty;
        Thou wast begot; to get it is thy duty.   
  
      Upon the earth's increase why shouldst thou feed,
      Unless the earth with thy increase be fed?
      By law of nature thou art bound to breed,
      That thine may live when thou thyself art dead;      
        And so in spite of death thou dost survive,
        In that thy likeness still is left alive.'
  
      By this the love-sick queen began to sweat,
      For where they lay the shadow had forsook them,      
      And Titan, tired in the mid-day heat
      With burning eye did hotly overlook them,
        Wishing Adonis had his team to guide,
        So he were like him and by Venus' side.   
  
      And now Adonis with a lazy spright,
      And with a heavy, dark, disliking eye,
      His louring brows o'erwhelming his fair sight,
      Like misty vapours when they blot the sky,  
        Souring his cheeks, cries, Fie! no more of love:
        The sun doth burn my face; I must remove.'
  
      Ay me,' quoth Venus, young, and so unkind!
      What bare excuses mak'st thou to be gone!   
      I'll sigh celestial breath, whose gentle wind
      Shall cool the heat of this descending sun:
        I'll make a shadow for thee of my hairs;  
        If they burn too, I'll quench them with my tears.
  
      The sun that shines from heaven shines but warm,
      And lo! I lie between that sun and thee:
      The heat I have from thence doth little harm,
      Thine eye darts forth the fire that burneth me;      
        And were I not immortal, life were done
        Between this heavenly and earthly sun.
  
      Art thou obdurate, flinty, hard as steel?
      Nay, more than flint, for stone at rain relenteth:   
      Art thou a woman's son, and canst not feel
      What tis to love? how want of love tormenteth?
        O! had thy mother borne so hard a mind,   
        She had not brought forth thee, but died unkind.
  
  
      What am I that thou shouldst contemn me this?
      Or what great danger dwells upon my suit?
      What were thy lips the worse for one poor kiss?
        Speak, fair; but speak fair words, or else be mute:
        Give me one kiss, I'll give it thee again,         
      And one for interest if thou wilt have twain.
  
      Fie! lifeless picture, cold and senseless stone,
      Well-painted idol, image dull and dead,     
      Statue contenting but the eye alone,
      Thing like a man, but of no woman bred:
        Thou art no man, though of a man's complexion,
        For men will kiss even by their own direction.'    
  
      This said, impatience chokes her pleading tongue,
      And swelling passion doth provoke a pause;
      Red cheeks and fiery eyes blaze forth her wrong;
      Being judge in love, she cannot right her cause:     
        And now she weeps, and now she fain would speak,
        And now her sobs do her intendments break.
  
      Sometimes she shakes her head, and then his hand;
      Now gazeth she on him, now on the ground;   
      Sometimes her arms infold him like a band:
      She would, he will not in her arms be bound;
        And when from thence he struggles to be gone,
        She locks her lily fingers one in one.    
  
      Fondling,' she saith, since I have hemm'd thee here
      Within the circuit of this ivory pale,
      I'll be a park, and thou shalt be my deer;
      Feed where thou wilt, on mountain or in dale:        
        Graze on my lips, and if those hills be dry,
        Stray lower, where the pleasant fountains lie.
  
      Within this limit is relief enough,
      Sweet bottom-grass and high delightful plain,        
      Round rising hillocks, brakes obscure and rough,
      To shelter thee from tempest and from rain:
        Then be my deer, since I am such a park;  
        No dog shall rouse thee, though a thousand bark.'
  
      At this Adonis smiles as in disdain,
      That in each cheek appears a pretty dimple:
      Love made those hollows, if himself were slain,
      He might be buried in a tomb so simple;     
        Foreknowing well, if there he came to lie,
        Why, there Love liv'd, and there he could not die.
  
      These lovely caves, these round enchanting pits,
      Open'd their mouths to swallow Venus' liking.        
      Being mad before, how doth she now for wits?
      Struck dead at first, what needs a second striking?
        Poor queen of love, in thine own law forlorn,
        To love a cheek that smiles at thee in scorn!      
  
      Now which way shall she turn? what shall she say?
      Her words are done, her woes the more increasing;
      The time is spent, her object will away,
      And from her twining arms doth urge releasing:       
        Pity,' she cries; some favour, some remorse!'
        Away he springs, and hasteth to his horse.
  
      But lo! from forth a copse that neighbours by,
      A breeding jennet, lusty, young, and proud, 
      Adonis' tramping courier doth espy,
      And forth she rushes, snorts and neighs aloud:
        The strong-neck'd steed, being tied unto a tree,
        Breaketh his rein, and to her straight goes he.    
  
      Imperiously he leaps, he neighs, he bounds,
      And now his woven girths he breaks asunder;
      The bearing earth with his hard hoof he wounds,
      Whose hollow womb resounds like heaven's thunder;
        The iron bit he crusheth tween his teeth,         
        Controlling what he was controlled with.
  
      His ears up-prick'd; his braided hanging mane
      Upon his compass'd crest now stand on end;  
      His nostrils drink the air, and forth again,
      As from a furnace, vapours doth he send:
        His eye, which scornfully glisters like fire,
        Shows his hot courage and his high desire.         
  
      Sometime he trots, as if he told the steps,
      With gentle majesty and modest pride;
      Anon he rears upright, curvets and leaps,
      As who should say, Lo! thus my strength is tried;
        And this I do to captivate the eye        
        Of the fair breeder that is standing by.'
  
      What recketh he his rider's angry stir,
      His flattering Holla', or his Stand, I say'?       
      What cares he now for curb or pricking spur?
      For rich caparisons or trapping gay?
        He sees his love, and nothing else he sees,
        Nor nothing else with his proud sight agrees.      
  
      Look, when a painter would surpass the life,
      In limning out a well-proportion'd steed,
      His art with nature's workmanship at strife,
      As if the dead the living should exceed;    
        So did this horse excel a common one,
        In shape, in courage, colour, pace and bone.
  
      Round-hoof'd, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,
      Broad breast, full eye, small head, and nostril wide,
      High crest, short ears, straight legs and passing strong,
      Thin mane, thick tail, broad buttock, tender hide:
        Look, what a horse should have he did not lack,
        Save a proud rider on so proud a back.    
  
      Sometimes he scuds far off, and there he stares;
      Anon he starts at stirring of a feather;
      To bid the wind a base he now prepares,
      And whe'r he run or fly they know not whether;       
        For through his mane and tail the high wind sings,
        Fanning the hairs, who wave like feather'd wings.
  
      He looks upon his love, and neighs unto her;
      She answers him as if she knew his mind;    
      Being proud, as females are, to see him woo her,
      She puts on outward strangeness, seems unkind,
        Spurns at his love and scorns the heat he feels,
        Beating his kind embracements with her heels.      
  
      Then, like a melancholy malcontent,
      He vails his tail, that, like a falling plume,
      Cool shadow to his melting buttock lent:
      He stamps, and bites the poor flies in his fume.     
        His love, perceiving how he is enrag'd,
        Grew kinder, and his fury was assuag'd.
  
      His testy master goeth about to take him;
      When lo! the unback'd breeder, full of fear,         
      Jealous of catching, swiftly doth forsake him,
      With her the horse, and left Adonis there:
        As they were mad, unto the wood they hie them,
        Outstripping crows that strive to overfly them.    
  
      All swoln with chafing, down Adonis sits,
      Banning his boisterous and unruly beast:
      And now the happy season once more fits,
      That love-sick Love by pleading may be blest;        
        For lovers say, the heart hath treble wrong
        When it is barr'd the aidance of the tongue.
  
      An oven that is stopp'd, or river stay'd,
      Burneth more hotly, swelleth with more rage:         
      So of concealed sorrow may be said;
      Free vent of words love's fire doth assuage;
        But when the heart's attorney once is mute
        The client breaks, as desperate in his suit.       
  
      He sees her coming, and begins to glow,--
      Even as a dying coal revives with wind,--
      And with his bonnet hides his angry brow;
      Looks on the dull earth with disturbed mind,         
        Taking no notice that she is so nigh,
        For all askance he holds her in his eye.
  
      O! what a sight it was, wistly to view
      How she came stealing to the wayward boy;   
      To note the fighting conflict of her hue,
      How white and red each other did destroy:
        But now her cheek was pale, and by and by
        It flash'd forth fire, as lightning from the sky.  
  
      Now was she just before him as he sat,
      And like a lowly lover down she kneels;
      With one fair hand she heaveth up his hat,
      Her other tender hand his fair cheek feels: 
        His tenderer cheek receives her soft hand's print,
        As apt as new-fall'n snow takes any dint.
  
      O! what a war of looks was then between them;
      Her eyes petitioners to his eyes suing;     
      His eyes saw her eyes as they had not seen them;
      Her eyes woo'd still, his eyes disdain'd the wooing:
        And all this dumb play had his acts made plain
        With tears, which, chorus-like, her eyes did rain.
  
      Full gently now she takes him by the hand,  
      A lily prison'd in a gaol of snow,
      Or ivory in an alabaster band;
      So white a friend engirts so white a foe:   
        This beauteous combat, wilful and unwilling,
        Show'd like two silver doves that sit a-billing.
  
      Once more the engine of her thoughts began:
      O fairest mover on this mortal round,      
      Would thou wert as I am, and I a man,
      My heart all whole as thine, thy heart my wound;
        For one sweet look thy help I would assure thee,
        Though nothing but my body's bane would cure thee.'
  
      Give me my hand,' saith he, why dost thou feel it?'
      Give me my heart,' saith she, and thou shalt have it;
      O! give it me, lest thy hard heart do steel it,
      And being steel'd, soft sighs can never grave it:    
        Then love's deep groans I never shall regard,
        Because Adonis' heart hath made mine hard.'
  
      For shame,' he cries, let go, and let me go;
      My day's delight is past, my horse is gone, 
      And tis your fault I am bereft him so:
      I pray you hence, and leave me here alone:
        For all my mind, my thought, my busy care,
        Is how to get my palfrey from the mare.'  
  
      Thus she replies: Thy palfrey, as he should,
      Welcomes the warm approach of sweet desire:
      Affection is a coal that must be cool'd;
      Else, suffer'd, it will set the heart on fire:       
        The sea hath bounds, but deep desire hath none;
        Therefore no marvel though thy horse be gone.
  
      How like a Jade he stood, tied to the tree,
      Servilely master'd with a leathern rein!    
      But when he saw his love, his youth's fair fee,
      He held such petty bondage in disdain;
        Throwing the base thong from his bending crest,
        Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.     
  
      Who sees his true-love in her naked bed,
      Teaching the sheets a whiter hue than white,
      But, when his glutton eye so full hath fed,
      His other agents aim at like delight?       
        Who is so faint, that dare not be so bold
        To touch the fire, the weather being cold?
  
      Let me excuse thy courser, gentle boy;
      And learn of him, I heartily beseech thee,  
      To take advantage on presented joy
      Though I were dumb, yet his proceedings teach thee.
        O learn to love, the lesson is but plain,
        And once made perfect, never lost again.  
  
      I know not love,' quoth he, nor will not know it,
      Unless it be a boar, and then I chase it;
      Tis much to borrow, and I will not owe it;
      My love to love is love but to disgrace it; 
        For I have heard it is a life in death,
        That laughs and weeps, and all but with a breath.
  
      Who wears a garment shapeless and unfinish'd?
      Who plucks the bud before one leaf put forth?        
      If springing things be any jot diminish'd,
      They wither in their prime, prove nothing worth;
        The colt that's back'd and burden'd being young
        Loseth his pride, and never waxeth strong.         
  
      You hurt my hand with wringing. Let us part,
      And leave this idle theme, this bootless chat:
      Remove your siege from my unyielding heart;
      To love's alarms it will not ope the gate:  
        Dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your flattery;
        For where a heart is hard they make no battery.'
  
      What! canst thou talk?' quoth she, hast thou a tongue?
      O! would thou hadst not, or I had no hearing;        
      Thy mermaid's voice hath done me double wrong;
      I had my load before, now press'd with bearing:
        Melodious discord, heavenly tune, harsh-sounding,
        Ear's deep-sweet music, and heart's deep-sore wounding.
  
      Had I no eyes but ears, my ears would love 
      That inward beauty and invisible;
      Or were I deaf, thy outward parts would move
      Each part in me that were but sensible:     
        Though neither eyes nor ears, to hear nor see,
        Yet should I be in love by touching thee.
  
      Say, that the sense of feeling were bereft me,
      And that I could not see, nor hear, nor touch,       
      And nothing but the very smell were left me,
      Yet would my love to thee be still as much;
        For from the stillitory of thy face excelling
        Comes breath perfum'd that breedeth love by smelling.
  
      But O! what banquet wert thou to the taste,         
      Being nurse and feeder of the other four;
      Would they not wish the feast might ever last,
      And bid Suspicion double-lock the door,
        Lest Jealousy, that sour unwelcome guest,
        Should, by his stealing in, disturb the feast?'    
  
      Once more the ruby-colour'd portal open'd,
      Which to his speech did honey passage yield,         
      Like a red morn, that ever yet betoken'd
      Wrack to the seaman, tempest to the field,
        Sorrow to shepherds, woe unto the birds,
        Gusts and foul flaws to herdmen and to herds.      
  
      This ill presage advisedly she marketh:
      Even as the wind is hush'd before it raineth,
      Or as the wolf doth grin before he barketh,
      Or as the berry breaks before it staineth,  
        Or like the deadly bullet of a gun,
        His meaning struck her ere his words begun.
  
      And at his look she flatly falleth down
      For looks kill love, and love by looks reviveth;     
      A smile recures the wounding of a frown;
      But blessed bankrupt, that by love so thriveth!
        The silly boy, believing she is dead
        Claps her pale cheek, till clapping makes it red;  
  
      And all amaz'd brake off his late intent,
      For sharply he did think to reprehend her,
      Which cunning love did wittily prevent:
      Fair fall the wit that can so well defend her!       
        For on the grass she lies as she were slain
        Till his breath breatheth life in her again.
  
      He wrings her nose, he strikes her on the cheeks,
      He bends her fingers, holds her pulses hard,         
      He chafes her lips; a thousand ways he seeks
      To mend the hurt that his unkindness marr'd:
        He kisses her; and she, by her good will,
        Will never rise, so he will kiss her still.        
  
      The night of sorrow now is turn'd to day:
      Her two blue windows faintly she up-heaveth,
      Like the fair sun, when in his fresh array
      He cheers the morn, and all the world relieveth:     
        And as the bright sun glorifies the sky,
        So is her face illumin'd with her eye;
  
      Whose beams upon his hairless face are fix'd,
      As if from thence they borrow'd all their shine.     
      Were never four such lamps together mix'd,
      Had not his clouded with his brow's repine;
        But hers, which through the crystal tears gave light
        Shone like the moon in water seen by night.        
  
      O! where am I?' quoth she, in earth or heaven,
      Or in the ocean drench'd, or in the fire?
      What hour is this? or morn or weary even?
      Do I delight to die, or life desire?        
        But now I liv'd, and life was death's annoy;
        But now I died, and death was lively joy.
  
      O! thou didst kill me; kill me once again:
      Thy eyes' shrewd tutor, that hard heart of thine,    
      Hath taught them scornful tricks, and such disdain,
      That they have murder'd this poor heart of mine;
        And these mine eyes, true leaders to their queen,
        But for thy piteous lips no more had seen.         
  
      Long may they kiss each other for this cure!
      O! never let their crimson liveries wear;
      And as they last, their verdure still endure,
      To drive infection from the dangerous year: 
        That the star-gazers, having writ on death,
        May say, the plague is banish'd by thy breath.
  
      Pure lips, sweet seals in my soft lips imprinted,
      What bargains may I make, still to be sealing?       
      To sell myself I can be well contented,
      So thou wilt buy and pay and use good dealing;
        Which purchase if thou make, for fear of slips
        Set thy seal-manual on my wax-red lips.   
  
      A thousand kisses buys my heart from me;
      And pay them at thy leisure, one by one.
      What is ten hundred touches unto thee?
      Are they not quickly told and quickly gone? 
        Say, for non-payment that the debt should double,
        Is twenty hundred kisses such a trouble?'
  
      Fair queen,' quoth he, if any love you owe me,
      Measure my strangeness with my unripe years:         
      Before I know myself, seek not to know me;
      No fisher but the ungrown fry forbears:
        The mellow plum doth fall, the green sticks fast,
        Or being early pluck'd is sour to taste.  
  
      Look! the world's comforter, with weary gait
      His day's hot task hath ended in the west;
      The owl, night's herald, shrieks, tis very late;
      The sheep are gone to fold, birds to their nest,     
        And coal-black clouds that shadow heaven's light
        Do summon us to part, and bid good night.
  
      Now let me say good night, and so say you;
      If you will say so, you shall have a kiss.' 
      Good night,' quoth she; and ere he says adieu,
      The honey fee of parting tender'd is:
        Her arms do lend his neck a sweet embrace;
        Incorporate then they seem, face grows to face.    
  
      Till, breathless, he disjoin'd, and backward drew
      The heavenly moisture, that sweet coral mouth,
      Whose precious taste her thirsty lips well knew,
      Whereon they surfeit, yet complain on drouth:        
        He with her plenty press'd, she faint with dearth,
        Their lips together glu'd, fall to the earth.
  
      Now quick desire hath caught the yielding prey,
      And glutton-like she feeds, yet never filleth;       
      Her lips are conquerors, his lips obey,
      Paying what ransom the insulter willeth;
        Whose vulture thought doth pitch the price so high,
        That she will draw his lips' rich treasure dry.    
  
      And having felt the sweetness of the spoil,
      With blindfold fury she begins to forage;
      Her face doth reek and smoke, her blood doth boil,
      And careless lust stirs up a desperate courage;      
        Planting oblivion, beating reason back,
        Forgetting shame's pure blush and honour's wrack.
  
      Hot, faint, and weary, with her hard embracing,
      Like a wild bird being tam'd with too much handling,
      Or as the fleet-foot roe that's tir'd with chasing,  
      Or like the froward infant still'd with dandling,
        He now obeys, and now no more resisteth,
        While she takes all she can, not all she listeth.  
  
      What wax so frozen but dissolves with tempering,
      And yields at last to every light impression?
      Things out of hope are compass'd oft with venturing,
      Chiefly in love, whose leave exceeds commission:     
        Affection faints not like a pale-fac'd coward,
        But then woos best when most his choice is froward.
  
      When he did frown, O! had she then gave over,
      Such nectar from his lips she had not suck'd.        
      Foul words and frowns must not repel a lover;
      What though the rose have prickles, yet tis pluck'd:
        Were beauty under twenty locks kept fast,
        Yet love breaks through and picks them all at last.
  
      For pity now she can no more detain him;    
      The poor fool prays her that he may depart:
      She is resolv'd no longer to restrain him,
      Bids him farewell, and look well to her heart,       
        The which, by Cupid's bow she doth protest,
        He carries thence incaged in his breast.
  
      Sweet boy,' she says, this night I'll waste in sorrow,
      For my sick heart commands mine eyes to watch.       
      Tell me, Love's master, shall we meet to-morrow
      Say, shall we? shall we? wilt thou make the match?'
        He tells her, no; to-morrow he intends
        To hunt the boar with certain of his friends.      
  
      The boar!' quoth she; whereat a sudden pale,
      Like lawn being spread upon the blushing rose,
      Usurps her cheeks, she trembles at his tale,
      And on his neck her yoking arms she throws: 
        She sinketh down, still hanging by his neck,
        He on her belly falls, she on her back.
  
      Now is she in the very lists of love,
      Her champion mounted for the hot encounter: 
      All is imaginary she doth prove,
      He will not manage her, although he mount her;
        That worse than Tantalus' is her annoy,
        To clip Elysium and to lack her joy.      
  
      Even as poor birds, deceiv'd with painted grapes,
      Do surfeit by the eye and pine the maw,
      Even so she languisheth in her mishaps,
      As those poor birds that helpless berries saw.       
        The warm effects which she in him finds missing,
        She seeks to kindle with continual kissing.
  
      But all in vain, good queen, it will not be:
      She hath assay'd as much as may be prov'd;  
      Her pleading hath deserv'd a greater fee;
      She's Love, she loves, and yet she is not lov'd.
        Fie, fie!' he says, you crush me; let me go;
        You have no reason to withhold me so.'    
  
      Thou hadst been gone,' quoth she, sweet boy, ere this,
      But that thou told'st me thou wouldst hunt the boar.
      O! be advis'd; thou know'st not what it is
      With javelin's point a churlish swine to gore,       
        Whose tushes never sheath'd he whetteth still,
        Like to a mortal butcher, bent to kill.
  
      On his bow-back he hath a battle set
      Of bristly pikes, that ever threat his foes;         
      His eyes like glow-worms shine when he doth fret;
      His snout digs sepulchres where'er he goes;
        Being mov'd, he strikes whate'er is in his way,
        And whom he strikes his crooked tushes slay.       
  
      His brawny sides, with hairy bristles arm'd,
      Are better proof than thy spear's point can enter;
      His short thick neck cannot be easily harm'd;
      Being ireful, on the lion he will venture:  
        The thorny brambles and embracing bushes,
        As fearful of him, part, through whom he rushes.
  
      Alas! he nought esteems that face of thine,
      To which Love's eyes pay tributary gazes;   
      Nor thy soft hands, sweet lips, and crystal eyne,
      Whose full perfection all the world amazes;
        But having thee at vantage, wondrous dread!
        Would root these beauties as he roots the mead.
  
      O! let him keep his loathsome cabin still; 
      Beauty hath nought to do with such foul fiends:
      Come not within his danger by thy will;
      They that thrive well take counsel of their friends.
        When thou didst name the boar, not to dissemble,
        I fear'd thy fortune, and my joints did tremble.
  
      Didst thou not mark my face? was it not white?
      Saw'st thou not signs of fear lurk in mine eye?      
      Grew I not faint? And fell I not downright?
      Within my bosom, whereon thou dost lie,
        My boding heart pants, beats, and takes no rest,
        But, like an earthquake, shakes thee on my breast.
  
      For where Love reigns, disturbing Jealousy 
      Doth call himself Affection's sentinel;
      Gives false alarms, suggesteth mutiny,
      And in a peaceful hour doth cry "Kill, kill!"        
        Distempering gentle Love in his desire,
        As air and water do abate the fire.
  
      This sour informer, this bate-breeding spy,
      This canker that eats up Love's tender spring,       
      This carry-tale, dissentious Jealousy,
      That sometime true news, sometime false doth bring,
        Knocks at my heart, and whispers in mine ear
        That if I love thee, I thy death should fear:      
  
      And more than so, presenteth to mine eye
      The picture of an angry-chafing boar,
      Under whose sharp fangs on his back doth lie
      An image like thyself, all stain'd with gore;        
        Whose blood upon the fresh flowers being shed
        Doth make them droop with grief and hang the head.
  
      What should I do, seeing thee so indeed,
      That tremble at the imagination?   
      The thought of it doth make my faint heart bleed,
      And fear doth teach it divination:
        I prophesy thy death, my living sorrow,
        If thou encounter with the boar to-morrow.         
  
      But if thou needs wilt hunt, be rul'd by me;
      Uncouple at the timorous flying hare,
      Or at the fox which lives by subtilty,
      Or at the roe which no encounter dare:      
        Pursue these fearful creatures o'er the downs,
        And on thy well-breath'd horse keep with thy hound.
  
      And when thou hast on foot the purblind hare,
      Mark the poor wretch, to overshoot his troubles      
      How he outruns the winds, and with what care
      He cranks and crosses with a thousand doubles:
        The many musits through the which he goes
        Are like a labyrinth to amaze his foes.   
  
      Sometime he runs among a flock of sheep,
      To make the cunning hounds mistake their smell,
      And sometime where earth-delving conies keep,
      To stop the loud pursuers in their yell,    
        And sometime sorteth with a herd of deer;
        Danger deviseth shifts, wit waits on fear:
  
      For there his smell with others being mingled,      
      The hot scent-snuffing hounds are driven to doubt,
      Ceasing their clamorous cry till they have singled
      With much ado the cold fault cleanly out;
        Then do they spend their mouths: Echo replies,
        As if another chase were in the skies.    
  
      By this, poor Wat, far off upon a hill,
      Stands on his hinder legs with listening ear,
      To hearken if his foes pursue him still:
      Anon their loud alarums he doth hear;       
      And now his grief may be compared well
      To one sore sick that hears the passing bell.
  
      Then shalt thou see the dew-bedabbled wretch
      Turn, and return, indenting with the way;   
      Each envious briar his weary legs doth scratch,
      Each shadow makes him stop, each murmur stay:
        For misery is trodden on by many,
        And being low never reliev'd by any.      
  
      Lie quietly, and hear a little more;
      Nay, do not struggle, for thou shalt not rise:
      To make thee hate the hunting of the boar,
      Unlike myself thou hear'st me moralize,     
        Applying this to that, and so to so;
        For love can comment upon every woe.
  
      Where did I leave?' No matter where,' quoth he
      Leave me, and then the story aptly ends:   
      The night is spent,' Why, what of that?' quoth she.
      I am,' quoth he, expected of my friends;
        And now tis dark, and going I shall fall.'
        In night,' quoth she, desire sees best of all.'  
  
      But if thou fall, O! then imagine this,
      The earth, in love with thee, thy footing trips,
      And all is but to rob thee of a kiss.       
      Rich preys make true men thieves; so do thy lips
        Make modest Dian cloudy and forlorn,
        Lest she should steal a kiss and die forsworn.
  
      Now of this dark night I perceive the reason:
      Cynthia for shame obscures her silver shine 
      Till forging Nature be condemn'd of treason,
      For stealing moulds from heaven that were divine;
        Wherein she fram'd thee in high heaven's despite,
        To shame the sun by day and her by night. 
  
      And therefore hath she brib'd the Destinies,
      To cross the curious workmanship of nature
      To mingle beauty with infirmities,
      And pure perfection with impure defeature;  
        Making it subject to the tyranny
        Of mad mischances and much misery;
  
      As burning fevers, agues pale and faint,
      Life-poisoning pestilence and frenzies wood,         
      The marrow-eating sickness, whose attains
      Disorder breeds by heating of the blood;
        Surfeits, imposthumes, grief, and damn'd despair,
        Swear nature's death for framing thee so fair.     
  
      And not the least of all these maladies
      But in one minute's fight brings beauty under:
      Both favour, savour hue, and qualities,
      Whereat the impartial gazer late did wonder,         
        Are on the sudden wasted, thaw'd and done,
        As mountain-snow melts with the mid-day sun.
  
      Therefore, despite of fruitless chastity,
      Love-lacking vestals and self-loving nuns,  
      That on the earth would breed a scarcity
      And barren dearth of daughters and of sons,
        Be prodigal: the lamp that burns by night
        Dries up his oil to lend the world his light.      
  
      What is thy body but a swallowing grave,
      Seeming to bury that posterity
      Which by the rights of time thou needs must have,
      If thou destroy them not in dark obscurity? 
        If so, the world will hold thee in disdain,
        Sith in thy pride so fair a hope is slain.
  
  
      So in thyself thyself art made away;
      A mischief worse than civil home-bred strife,        
      Or theirs whose desperate hands themselves do slay,
      Or butcher-sire that reeves his son of life.
        Foul-cankering rust the hidden treasure frets,
        But gold that's put to use more gold begets.'      
  
      Nay then,' quoth Adon, you will fall again
      Into your idle over-handled theme;
      The kiss I gave you is bestow'd in vain,
      And all in vain you strive against the stream;       
        For by this black-fac'd night, desire's foul nurse,
        Your treatise makes me like you worse and worse.
  
      If love have lent you twenty thousand tongues,
      And every tongue more moving than your own, 
      Bewitching like the wanton mermaid's songs,
      Yet from mine ear the tempting tune is blown;
        For know, my heart stands armed in mine ear,
        And will not let a false sound enter there;        
  
      Lest the deceiving harmony should run
      Into the quiet closure of my breast;
      And then my little heart were quite undone,
      In his bedchamber to be barr'd of rest.     
        No, lady, no; my heart longs not to groan,
        But soundly sleeps, while now it sleeps alone.
  
      What have you urg'd that I cannot reprove?
      The path is smooth that leadeth on to danger;        
      I hate not love, but your device in love
      That lends embracements unto every stranger.
        You do it for increase: O strange excuse!
        When reason is the bawd to lust's abuse.  
  
      Call it not, love, for Love to heaven is fled,
      Since sweating Lust on earth usurp'd his name;
      Under whose simple semblance he hath fed
      Upon fresh beauty, blotting it with blame;  
        Which the hot tyrant stains and soon bereaves,
        As caterpillars do the tender leaves.
  
      Love comforteth like sunshine after rain,
      But Lust's effect is tempest after sun;     
      Love's gentle spring doth always fresh remain,
      Lust's winter comes ere summer half be done.
        Love surfeits not, Lust like a glutton dies;
        Love is all truth, Lust full of forged lies.       
  
      More I could tell, but more I dare not say;
      The text is old, the orator too green.
      Therefore, in sadness, now I will away;
      My face is full of shame, my heart of teen: 
        Mine ears, that to your wanton talk attended
        Do burn themselves for having so offended.'
  
      With this he breaketh from the sweet embrace         
      Of those fair arms which bound him to her breast,
      And homeward through the dark laund runs apace;
      Leaves Love upon her back deeply distress'd.
        Look, how a bright star shooteth from the sky
        So glides he in the night from Venus' eye;         
  
      Which after him she darts, as one on shore
      Gazing upon a late-embarked friend,
      Till the wild waves will have him seen no more,
      Whose ridges with the meeting clouds contend:        
        So did the merciless and pitchy night
        Fold in the object that did feed her sight.
  
      Whereat amaz'd, as one that unaware
      Hath dropp'd a precious jewel in the flood, 
      Or stonish'd as night-wanderers often are,
      Their light blown out in some mistrustful wood;
        Even so confounded in the dark she lay,
        Having lost the fair discovery of her way.         
  
      And now she beats her heart, whereat it groans,
      That all the neighbour caves, as seeming troubled,
      Make verbal repetition of her moans;
      Passion on passion deeply is redoubled:     
        Ay me!' she cries, and twenty times, Woe, woe!'
        And twenty echoes twenty times cry so.
  
      She marking them, begins a wailing note,
      And sings extemporally a woeful ditty;      
      How love makes young men thrall and old men dote;
      How love is wise in folly foolish-witty:
        Her heavy anthem still concludes in woe,
        And still the choir of echoes answer so.  
  
      Her song was tedious, and outwore the night,
      For lovers' hours are long, though seeming short:
      If pleas'd themselves, others, they think, delight
      In such like circumstance, with such like sport:     
        Their copious stories, oftentimes begun,
        End without audience, and are never done.
  
      For who hath she to spend the night withal,
      But idle sounds resembling parasites;       
      Like shrill-tongu'd tapsters answering every call,
      Soothing the humour of fantastic wits?
        She says, Tis so:' they answer all, Tis so;'
        And would say after her, if she said No'.         
  
      Lo! here the gentle lark, weary of rest,
      From his moist cabinet mounts up on high,
      And wakes the morning, from whose silver breast
      The sun ariseth in his majesty;    
        Who doth the world so gloriously behold,
        That cedar-tops and hills seem burnish'd gold.
  
      Venus salutes him with this fair good morrow:
      O thou clear god, and patron of all light, 
      From whom each lamp and shining star doth borrow
      The beauteous influence that makes him bright,
        There lives a son that suck'd an earthly mother,
        May lend thee light, as thou dost lend to other'
  
      This said, she hasteth to a myrtle grove,   
      Musing the morning is so much o'erworn,
      And yet she hears no tidings of her love;
      She hearkens for his hounds and for his horn:        
        Anon she hears them chant it lustily,
        And all in haste she coasteth to the cry.
  
      And as she runs, the bushes in the way
      Some catch her by the neck, some kiss her face,      
      Some twine about her thigh to make her stay:
      She wildly breaketh from their strict embrace,
        Like a milch doe, whose swelling dugs do ache,
        Hasting to feed her fawn hid in some brake.        
  
      By this she hears the hounds are at a bay;
      Whereat she starts, like one that spies an adder
      Wreath'd up in fatal folds just in his way,
      The fear whereof doth make him shake and shudder;
        Even so the timorous yelping of the hounds         
        Appals her senses, and her spirit confounds.
  
      For now she knows it is no gentle chase,
      But the blunt boar, rough bear, or lion proud,       
      Because the cry remaineth in one place,
      Wilere fearfully the dogs exclaim aloud:
        Finding their enemy to be so curst,
        They all strain courtesy who shall cope him first.
  
      This dismal cry rings sadly in her ear,     
      Througll which it enters to surprise her heart;
      Who, overcome by doubt and bloodless fear,
      With cold-pale weakness numbs each feeling part;
        Like soldiers, when their captain once doth yield,
        They basely fly and dare not stay the field.
  
      Thus stands she in a trembling ecstasy,
      Till, cheering up her senses sore dismay'd, 
      She tells them tis a causeless fantasy,
      And childish error, that they are afraid;
        Bids them leave quaking, bids them fear no more:
        And with that word she spied the hunted boar;
  
      Whose frothy mouth bepainted all with red,  
      Like milk and blood being mingled both together,
      A second fear through all her sinews spread,
      Which madly hurries her she knows not whither:       
        This way she runs, and now she will no further,
        But back retires to rate the boar for murther.
  
      A thousand spleens bear her a thousand ways,
      She treads the path that she untreads again;         
      Her more than haste is mated with delays,
      Like the proceedings of a drunken brain,
        Full of respects, yet nought at all respecting,
        In hand with all things, nought at all effecting.
  
      Here kennel'd in a brake she finds a hound, 
      And asks the weary caitiff for his master,
      And there another licking of his wound,
      Gainst venom'd sores the only sovereign plaster;     
        And here she meets another sadly scowling,
        To whom she speaks, and he replies with howling.
  
      When he hath ceas'd his ill-resounding noise,
      Another flap-mouth'd mourner, black and grim,        
      Against the welkin volleys out his voice;
      Another and another answer him,
        Clapping their proud tails to the ground below,
        Shaking their scratch'd ears, bleeding as they go.
  
      Look, how the world's poor people are amaz'd         
      At apparitions, signs, and prodigies,
      Whereon with fearful eyes they long have gaz'd,
      Infusing them with dreadful prophecies;     
        So she at these sad sighs draws up her breath,
        And, sighing it again, exclaims on Death.
  
      Hard-favour'd tyrant, ugly, meagre, lean,  
      Hateful divorce of love,'--thus chides she Death,--
      Grim-grinning ghost, earth's worm, what dost thou mean
      To stifle beauty and to steal his breath,
        Who when he liv'd, his breath and beauty set
        Gloss on the rose, smell to the violet?   
  
      If he be dead, O no! it cannot be,
      Seeing his beauty, thou shouldst strike at it;
      O yes! it may; thou hast no eyes to see,
      But hatefully at random dost thou hit.      
        Thy mark is feeble age, but thy false dart
        Mistakes that aim and cleaves an infant's heart.
  
      Hadst thou but bid beware, then he had spoke,
      And, hearing him, thy power had lost his power.      
      The Destinies will curse thee for this stroke;
      They bid thee crop a weed, thou pluck'st a flower.
        Love's golden arrow at him shoull have fled,
        And not Death's ebon dart, to strike him dead.     
  
      Dost thou drink tears, that thou provok'st such weeping?
      What may a heavy groan advantage thee?
      Why hast thou cast into eternal sleeping
      Those eyes that taught all other eyes to see?        
        Now Nature cares not for thy mortal vigour
        Since her best work is ruin'd with thy rigour.'
  
      Here overcome, as one full of despair,
      She vail'd her eyelids, who, like sluices, stopp'd   
      The crystal tide that from her two cheeks fair
      In the sweet channel of her bosom dropp'd
        But through the flood-gates breaks the silver rain,
        And with his strong course opens them again.       
  
      O! how her eyes and tears did lend and borrow;
      Her eyes seen in the tears, tears in her eye;
      Both crystals, where they view'd each other's sorrow,
      Sorrow that friendly sighs sought still to dry;      
        But like a stormy day, now wind, now rain,
        Sighs dry her cheeks, tears make them wet again.
  
      Variable passions throng her constant woe,
      As striving who should best become her grief;        
      All entertain'd, each passion labours so,
      That every present sorrow seemeth chief,
      But none is best; then join they all together,
      Like many clouds consulting for foul weather.        
  
      By this, far off she hears some huntsman holloa;
      A nurse's song no'er pleas'd her babe so well:
      The dire imagination she did follow
      This sound of hope doth labour to expel;    
        For now reviving joy bids her rejoice,
        And flatters her it is Adonis' voice.
  
      Whereat her tears began to turn their tide,
      Being prison'd in her eye, like pearls in glass;     
      Yet sometimes falls an orient drop beside,
      Which her cheek melts, as scorning it should pass
        To wash the foul face of the sluttish ground,
        Who is but drunken when she seemeth drown'd.
  
      O hard-believing love! how strange it seems 
      Not to believe, and yet too credulous;
      Thy weal and woe are both of them extremes;
      Despair and hope make thee ridiculous:      
        The one doth flatter thee in thoughts unlikely,
        In likely thoughts the other kills thee quickly.
  
      Now she unweaves the web that she hath wrought,
      Adonis lives, and Death is not to blame;    
      It was not she that call'd him all to naught,
      Now she adds honours to his hateful name;
        She clepes him king of graves, and grave for kings,
        Imperious supreme of all mortal things.   
  
      No, no,' quoth she, sweet Death, I did but jest;
      Yet pardon me, I felt a kind of fear
      Whenas I met the boar, that bloody beast,
      Which knows no pity, but is still severe;  
        Then, gentle shadow,--truth I must confess--
        I rail'd on thee, fearing my love's decease.
  
      Tis not my fault: the boar provok'd my tongue;
      Be wreak'd on him, invisible commander;    
      Tis he, foul creature, that hath done thee wrong;
      I did but act, he s author of my slander:
        Grief hath two tongues: and never woman yet,
        Could rule them both without ten women's wit.'
  
      Thus hoping that Adonis is alive, 
      Her rash suspect sile doth extenuate;
      And that his beauty may the better thrive,
      With Death she humbly doth insinuate;      
        Tells him of trophies, statues, tombs; and stories
        His victories, his triumphs, and his glories.
  
      O Jove!' quoth she, how much a fool was I,
      To be of such a weak and silly mind        
      To wail his death who lives and must not die
      Till mutual overthrow of mortal kind;
        For he being dead, with him is beauty slain,
        And, beauty dead, black chaos comes again.        
  
      Fie, fie, fond love! thou art so full of fear
      As one with treasure laden, hemm'd with thieves
      Trifles, unwitnessed with eye or ear,
      Thy coward heart with false bethinking grieves.'    
        Even at this word she hears a merry horn
        Whereat she leaps that was but late forlorn.
  
      As falcon to the lure, away she flies;
      The grass stoops not, she treads on it so light;    
      And in her haste unfortunately spies
      The foul boar's conquest on her fair delight;
        Which seen, her eyes, as murder'd with the view,
        Like stars asham'd of day, themselves withdrew:
  
      Or, as the snail, whose tender horns being hit,     
      Shrinks backwards in his shelly cave with pain,
      And there, all smother'd up, in shade doth sit,
      Long after fearing to creep forth again;   
        So, at his bloody view, her eyes are fled
        Into the deep dark cabills of her head;
  
      Where they resign their office and their light
      To the disposing of her troubled brain;    
      Who bids them still consort with ugly night,
      And never wound the heart with looks again;
        Who, like a king perplexed in his throne,
        By their suggestion gives a deadly groan,         
  
      Whereat each tributary subject quakes;
      As when the wind, imprison'd in the ground,
      Struggling for passage, earth's foundation shakes,
      Which with cold terror doth men's minds confound.
        This mutiny each part doth so surprise   
        That from their dark beds once more leap her eyes;
  
      And, being open'd, threw unwilling light
      Upon the wide wound that the boar had trench'd
      In his soft flank; whose wonted lily white 
      With purple tears, that his wound wept, was drench'd:
        No flower was nigh, no grass, herb, leaf, or weed
        But stole his blood and seem'd with him to bleed.
  
      This solemn sympathy poor Venus noteth,    
      Over one shoulder doth she hang her head,
      Dumbly she passions, franticly she doteth;
      She thinks he could not die, he is not dead:        
        Her voice is stopp'd, her joints forget to bow,
        Her eyes are mad that they have wept till now.
  
      Upon his hurt she looks so steadfastly,
      That her sight dazzling makes the wound seem three;
      And then she reprehends her mangling eye,  
      That makes more gashes where no breach should be:
        His face seems twain, each several limb is doubled;
        For oft the eye mistakes, the brain being troubled.
  
      My tongue cannot express my grief for one,         
      And yet,' quoth she, behold two Adons dead!
      My sighs are blown away, my salt tears gone,
      Mine eyes are turn'd to fire, my heart to lead:     
        Heavy heart's lead, melt at mine eyes' red fire!
        So shall I die by drops of hot desire.
  
      Alas! poor world, what treasure hast thou lost!
      What face remains alive that's worth the viewing?
      Whose tongue is music now? what canst thou boast
      Of things long since, or anything ensuing? 
        The flowers are sweet, their colours fresh and trim;
        But true-sweet beauty liv'd and died with him.
  
      Bonnet nor veil henceforth no creature wear!       
      Nor sun nor wind will ever strive to kiss you:
      Having no fair to lose, you need not fear;
      The sun doth scorn you, and the wind doth hiss you:
        But when Adonis liv'd, sun and sharp air 
        Lurk'd like two thieves, to rob him of his fair:
  
      And therefore would he put his bonnet on,
      Under whose brim the gaudy sun would peep; 
      The wind would blow it off, and, being gone,
      Play with his locks: then would Adonis weep;
        And straight, in pity of his tender years,
        They both would strive who first should dry his tears.
  
      To see his face the lion walk'd along     
      Behind some hedge, because he would not fear him;
      To recreate himself when he hath sung,
      The tiger would be tame and gently hear him;        
        If he had spoke, the wolf would leave his prey,
        And never fright the silly lamb that day.
  
      When he beheld his shadow in the brook,
      The fishes spread on it their golden gills;         
      When he was by, the birds such pleasure took,
      That some would sing, some other in their bills
        Would bring him mulberries and ripe-red cherries
        He fed them with his sight, they him with berries.
  
      But this foul, grim, and urchin-spouted boar,      
      Whose downward eye still looketh for a grave,
      Ne'er saw the beauteous livery that he wore;
      Witness the entertainment that he gave:    
        If he did see his face, why then I know
        He thought to kiss him, and hath killed him so.
  
      Tis true, tis true; thus was Adonis slain:
      He ran upon the boar with his sharp spear, 
      Who did not whet his teeth at him again,
      But by a kiss thought to persuade him there;
        And nuzzling in his flank, the loving swine
        Sheath'd unaware the tusk in his soft groin.      
  
      Had I been tooth'd like him, I must confess,
      With kissing him I should have kill'd him first;
      But he is dead, and never did he bless
      My youth with his; the more am I accurst.' 
        With this she falleth in the place she stood,
        And stains her face with his congealed blood.
  
      Sho looks upon his lips, and they are pale;
      She takes him by the hand, and that is cold;        
      She whispers in his ears a heavy tale,
      As if they heard the woeful words she told;
      She lifts the coffer-lids that close his eyes,
      Where, lo! two lamps, burnt out, in darkness lies;
  
      Two glasses where herself herself beheld   
      A thousand times, and now no more reflect;
      Their virtue lost, wherein they late excell'd,
      And every beauty robb'd of his effect:     
        Wonder of time,' quoth she, this is my spite,
        That, you being dead, the day should yet be light.
  
      Since thou art dead, lo! here I prophesy,
      Sorrow on love hereafter shall attend:     
      It shall be waited on with jealousy,
      Find sweet beginning, but unsavoury end;
        Ne'er settled equally, but high or low;
        That all love's pleasure shall not match his woe.
  
      It shall be fickle, false, and full of fraud,      
      Bud and be blasted in a breathing-while;
      The bottom poison, and the top o'erstraw'd
      With sweets that shall the truest sight beguile:    
        The strongest body shall it make most weak,
        Strike the wise dumb and teach the fool to speak.
  
      It shall be sparing and too full of riot,
      Teaching decrepit age to tread the measures;        
      The staring ruffian shall it keep in quiet,
      Pluck down the rich, enrich the poor with treasures;
        It shall be raging mad, and silly mild,
        Make the young old, the old become a child.       
  
      It shall suspect where is no cause of fear;
      It shall not fear where it should most mistrust;
      It shall be merciful, and too severe,
      And most deceiving when it seems most just;         
        Perverse it shall be, where it shows most toward,
        Put fear to velour, courage to the coward.
  
      It shall be cause of war and dire events,
      And set dissension twixt the son and sire;         
      Subject and servile to all discontents,
      As dry combustious matter is to fire:
        Sith in his prime Death doth my love destroy,
        They that love best their love shall not enjoy.'  
  
      By this, the boy that by her side lay kill'd
      Was melted like a vapour from her sight,
      And in his blood that on the ground lay spill'd,
      A purple flower sprung up, chequer'd with white;    
        Resembling well his pale cheeks, and the blood
        Which in round drops upon their whiteness stood.
  
      She bows her head, the new-sprung flower to smell,
      Comparing it to her Adonis' breath;        
      And says within her bosom it shall dwell,
      Since he himself is reft from her by death:
        She drops the stalk, and in the breach appears
        Green dropping sap, which she compares to tears.
  
      Poor flower,' quoth she, this was thy father's guise,
      Sweet issue of a more sweet-smelling sire,
      For every little grief to wet his eyes:
      To grow unto himself was his desire,       
        And so tis shine; but know, it is as good
        To wither in my breast as in his blood.
  
      Here was thy father's bed, here in my breast;
      Thou art the next of blood, and tis thy right:     
      Lo! in this hollow cradle take thy rest,
      My throbbing heart shall rock thee day and night:
        There shall not be one minute in an hour
        Wherein I will not kiss my sweet love's flower.'
  
      Thus weary of the world, away she hies,    
      And yokes her silver doves; by whose swift aid
      Their mistress, mounted, through the empty skies
      In her light chariot quickly is convey'd;  
        Holding their course to Paphos, where their queen
        Means to immure herself and not be seen.





Speech:"Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back
 

Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back,
Wherein he puts alms for oblivion,
A great-sized monster of ingratitudes:
Those scraps are good deeds past; which are devour'd
As fast as they are made, forgot as soon 
As done: perseverance, dear my lord,
Keeps honour bright: to have done is to hang
Quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail
In monumental mockery. Take the instant way;
For honour travels in a strait so narrow,
Where one but goes abreast: keep then the path;
For emulation hath a thousand sons
That one by one pursue: if you give way,
Or hedge aside from the direct forthright,
Like to an enter'd tide, they all rush by
And leave you hindmost;
Or like a gallant horse fall'n in first rank,
Lie there for pavement to the abject rear,
O'er-run and trampled on: then what they do in present,
Though less than yours in past, must o'ertop yours; 
For time is like a fashionable host
That slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand,
And with his arms outstretch'd, as he would fly,
Grasps in the comer: welcome ever smiles,
And farewell goes out sighing. O, let not virtue seek
Remuneration for the thing it was;
For beauty, wit,
High birth, vigour of bone, desert in service,
Love, friendship, charity, are subjects all 
To envious and calumniating time.
One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,
That all with one consent praise new-born gawds,
Though they are made and moulded of things past,
And give to dust that is a little gilt 
More laud than gilt o'er-dusted.
The present eye praises the present object.
Then marvel not, thou great and complete man,
That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax;
Since things in motion sooner catch the eye 
Than what not stirs. The cry went once on thee,
And still it might, and yet it may again,
If thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive
And case thy reputation in thy tent;
Whose glorious deeds, but in these fields of late, 
Made emulous missions 'mongst the gods themselves
And drave great Mars to faction.





Speech:"Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow
 

(from Macbeth, spoken by Macbeth)
Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,
To the last syllable of recorded time;
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!
Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player,
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,
And then is heard no more. It is a tale
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
Signifying nothing.





Speech:"To be, or not to be, that is the question
 

(from Hamlet, spoken by Hamlet)
To be, or not to be, that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
And by opposing end them. To die--to sleep,
No more; and by a sleep to say we end
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to: 'tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
To sleep, perchance to dream--ay, there's the rub:
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause--there's the respect
That makes calamity of so long life.
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
Th'oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
The pangs of dispriz'd love, the law's delay,
The insolence of office, and the spurns
That patient merit of th'unworthy takes,
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
But that the dread of something after death,
The undiscovere'd country, from whose bourn
No traveller returns, puzzles the will,
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Than fly to others that we know not of?
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
And enterprises of great pitch and moment
With this regard their currents turn awry
And lose the name of action.





Speech:"All the worlds a stage
 

(from As You Like It, spoken by Jacques)
All the world's a stage,
And all the men and women merely players;
They have their exits and their entrances;
And one man in his time plays many parts,
His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms;
And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel
And shining morning face, creeping like snail
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,
Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,
Seeking the bubble reputation
Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
In fair round belly with good capon lin'd,
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
Full of wise saws and modern instances;
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;
His youthful hose, well sav'd, a world too wide
For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
That ends this strange eventful history,
Is second childishness and mere oblivion;
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.





Speech:"This day is called the feast of Crispian
 

(from Henry V, spoken by King Henry)
This day is called the feast of Crispian:
He that outlives this day, and comes safe home,
Will stand a tip-toe when the day is named,
And rouse him at the name of Crispian.
He that shall live this day, and see old age,
Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours,
And say To-morrow is Saint Crispian:'
Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars.
And say These wounds I had on Crispin's day.'
Old men forget: yet all shall be forgot,
But he'll remember with advantages
What feats he did that day: then shall our names.
Familiar in his mouth as household words
Harry the king, Bedford and Exeter,
Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester,
Be in their flowing cups freshly remember'd.
This story shall the good man teach his son;
And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by,
From this day to the ending of the world,
But we in it shall be remember'd;
We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;
For he to-day that sheds his blood with me
Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile,
This day shall gentle his condition:
And gentlemen in England now a-bed
Shall think themselves accursed they were not here,
And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks
That fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day.





Speech:"Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears
 

(from Julius Caesar, spoken by Marc Antony)
Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;
I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.
The evil that men do lives after them;
The good is oft interred with their bones;
So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus
Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:
If it were so, it was a grievous fault,
And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.
Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest
For Brutus is an honourable man;
So are they all, all honourable men
Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.
He was my friend, faithful and just to me:
But Brutus says he was ambitious;
And Brutus is an honourable man.
He hath brought many captives home to Rome
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:
Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?
When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
And Brutus is an honourable man.
You all did see that on the Lupercal
I thrice presented him a kingly crown,
Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
And, sure, he is an honourable man.
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,
But here I am to speak what I do know.
You all did love him once, not without cause:
What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?
O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,
And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;
My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,
And I must pause till it come back to me.





Speech:"No matter where; of comfort no man speak
 

(from Richard II, spoken by King Richard)
No matter where; of comfort no man speak:
Let's talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs;
Make dust our paper and with rainy eyes
Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth,
Let's choose executors and talk of wills:
And yet not so, for what can we bequeath
Save our deposed bodies to the ground?
Our lands, our lives and all are Bolingbroke's,
And nothing can we call our own but death
And that small model of the barren earth
Which serves as paste and cover to our bones.
For God's sake, let us sit upon the ground
And tell sad stories of the death of kings;
How some have been deposed; some slain in war,
Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed;
Some poison'd by their wives: some sleeping kill'd;
All murder'd: for within the hollow crown
That rounds the mortal temples of a king
Keeps Death his court and there the antic sits,
Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp,
Allowing him a breath, a little scene,
To monarchize, be fear'd and kill with looks,
Infusing him with self and vain conceit,
As if this flesh which walls about our life,
Were brass impregnable, and humor'd thus
Comes at the last and with a little pin
Bores through his castle wall, and farewell king!
Cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood
With solemn reverence: throw away respect,
Tradition, form and ceremonious duty,
For you have but mistook me all this while:
I live with bread like you, feel want,
Taste grief, need friends: subjected thus,
How can you say to me, I am a king?





Speech:"Is this a dagger which I see before me
 

(from Macbeth, spoken by Macbeth)
Is this a dagger which I see before me,
 The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee.
 I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.
 Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible
 To feeling as to sight? or art thou but
 A dagger of the mind, a false creation,
 Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?
 I see thee yet, in form as palpable
 As this which now I draw.
 Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going;
 And such an instrument I was to use.
 Mine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses,
 Or else worth all the rest; I see thee still,
 And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood,
 Which was not so before. There's no such thing:
 It is the bloody business which informs
 Thus to mine eyes. Now o'er the one halfworld
 Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse
 The curtain'd sleep; witchcraft celebrates
 Pale Hecate's offerings, and wither'd murder,
 Alarum'd by his sentinel, the wolf,
 Whose howl's his watch, thus with his stealthy pace.
 With Tarquin's ravishing strides, towards his design
 Moves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth,
 Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear
 Thy very stones prate of my whereabout,
 And take the present horror from the time,
 Which now suits with it. Whiles I threat, he lives:
 Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.
                                    [a bell rings]
 I go, and it is done; the bell invites me.
 Hear it not, Duncan; for it is a knell
 That summons thee to heaven or to hell.





Speech:"The raven himself is hoarse
 

(from Macbeth, spoken by Lady Macbeth)
The raven himself is hoarse
That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan
Under my battlements. Come, you spirits
That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,
And fill me, from the crown to the toe, top-full
Of direst cruelty! Make thick my blood,
Stop up th' access and passage to remorse,
That no compunctious visitings of nature
Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between
The effect and it! Come to my woman's breasts,
And take my milk for gall, you murd'ring ministers,
Wherever in your sightless substances
You wait on nature's mischief! Come, thick night,
And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,
That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,
Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark,
To cry "Hold, hold!"





Speech:"Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more
 

(from Henry V, spoken by King Henry)
Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more;
 Or close the wall up with our English dead.
 In peace there's nothing so becomes a man
 As modest stillness and humility:
 But when the blast of war blows in our ears,
 Then imitate the action of the tiger;
 Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,
 Disguise fair nature with hard-favour'd rage;
 Then lend the eye a terrible aspect;
 Let pry through the portage of the head
 Like the brass cannon; let the brow o'erwhelm it
 As fearfully as doth a galled rock
 O'erhang and jutty his confounded base,
 Swill'd with the wild and wasteful ocean.
 Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide,
 Hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit
 To his full height. On, on, you noblest English.
 Whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof!
 Fathers that, like so many Alexanders,
 Have in these parts from morn till even fought
 And sheathed their swords for lack of argument:
 Dishonour not your mothers; now attest
 That those whom you call'd fathers did beget you.
 Be copy now to men of grosser blood,
 And teach them how to war. And you, good yeoman,
 Whose limbs were made in England, show us here
 The mettle of your pasture; let us swear
 That you are worth your breeding; which I doubt not;
 For there is none of you so mean and base,
 That hath not noble lustre in your eyes.
 I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,
 Straining upon the start. The game's afoot:
 Follow your spirit, and upon this charge
 Cry 'God for Harry, England, and Saint George!'





Speech:"Now is the winter of our discontent
 

(from Richard III, spoken by Gloucester)
Now is the winter of our discontent
 Made glorious summer by this sun of York;
 And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
 In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
 Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
 Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;
 Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,
 Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
 Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;
 And now, instead of mounting barded steeds
 To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
 He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
 To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
 But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,
 Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;
 I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty
 To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;
 I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,
 Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,
 Deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time
 Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,
 And that so lamely and unfashionable
 That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;
 Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,
 Have no delight to pass away the time,
 Unless to spy my shadow in the sun
 And descant on mine own deformity:
 And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,
 To entertain these fair well-spoken days,
 I am determined to prove a villain
 And hate the idle pleasures of these days.
 Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,
 By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,
 To set my brother Clarence and the king
 In deadly hate the one against the other:
 And if King Edward be as true and just
 As I am subtle, false and treacherous,
 This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up,
 About a prophecy, which says that 'G'
 Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.
 Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here
 Clarence comes.





Speech:"O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?
 

(from Romeo and Juliet, spoken by Juliet)
O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?
Deny thy father and refuse thy name.
Or if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love
And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
Tis but thy name that is my enemy:
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
What's Montague? It is nor hand nor foot
Nor arm nor face nor any other part
Belonging to a man. O be some other name.
What's in a name? That which we call a rose
By any other name would smell as sweet;
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
Retain that dear perfection which he owes
Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
And for that name, which is no part of thee,
Take all myself.





Winter
 

By photography's gospel, I thank you,
 think you back.

You fail far away from me,
 waving at pain.

A perfect song is loveless
 and here by your name.

Things will never be the same.
 Are they the same yet?





Almost As If Ive Been Given an Horizon
 

The giant world
is no damned genius

with its basket of latitude,
its schedule for wanting

to be touched.
 Now, slow asleep

I'm song
to break in on,

a strength less lost
than gone.

I borrow minute, hour,
 day, day.

The waves as cruel replacements pass
 for crutches.





A Question
 

The woman in the building across from me
hauls onto the fire escape a yucca plant
and squeezes it between a crate
of herbs and a sapling fern tree.
She looks a lot like me from twenty feet away.
A forelock lies sweaty against her cheek
as if she's forgotten to fix herself.
I put my thumbs and forefingers
to my eye and frame her. I am reminded
of those Chinese boxes made of red paper,
inside one is another holding another,
until at the center sits the tiniest mockery
and celebration of the cell itself.
She looks haggard but happy here, five flights
up, bending over a fat leaf as if admiring herself
in the waxy surface. Then she opens up
the jewel-case of her voice,
and I remember how once my sister asked
my mother which one of us sang better.
My mother paused from sewing as if adding
seventeen to seventy-five and said we sounded
the same. Good or bad, who knows.
Each of us now watches the empty,
open mouth of the other.





Between the House and the Hill
 

This boy lying face down
 in my sleep pushes around jars of jelly,
 waking me the night he is found

 so I can drag him from the wet ground
 and clean his blackened belly,
 this boy lying face down

 who is somehow bound
 to me, this hunted herdsman, refugee
 waking me the night he is found.

 Am I to dress him in an open gown,
 bless the holes in his chest with tea
 leaves? This boy lying face down,

 permeating even the simplest sound,
 with the crack in the door he slowly
 cries, waking me the night he is found,

 lips parted to my blue-black ground,
 whispering red vetch inside me,
 this slender boy lying down,
 waking me the night he is found.





The Only Thing I Imagine Luz Villa Admires about Her Husbands Gun
 

is the six-chambered cylinder,
the spinnable heart,
how it clicks into place,

lonely but strong by design.
She understands its negative worth,
how it holds in the dark

and withstands what is held,
how it burns and smells
of smoke when left and left and left.





The Lynching
 

His spirit is smoke ascended to high heaven.
His father, by the cruelest way of pain,
Had bidden him to his bosom once again;
The awful sin remained still unforgiven.
All night a bright and solitary star
(Perchance the one that ever guided him,
Yet gave him up at last to Fate's wild whim)
Hung pitifully o'er the swinging char.
Day dawned, and soon the mixed crowds came to view
The ghastly body swaying in the sun:
The women thronged to look, but never a one
Showed sorrow in her eyes of steely blue;
And little lads, lynchers that were to be,
Danced round the dreadful thing in fiendish glee.








The Trickle-Down Theory of Happiness
 

Out of heaven, to bless the high places,   
it falls on the penthouses, drizzling   
at first, then a pelting allegro, 
and Dick and Jane skip to the terrace   
and go boogieing through the azaleas,   
while mommy and daddy come running   
with pots and pans, glasses, and basins   
and try to hold all of it up there, 
but no use, it's too much, it keeps coming,   
and pours off the edges, down limestone 
to the pitchers and pails on the ground, where   
delirious residents catch it, 
and bucket brigades get it moving   
inside, until bathtubs are brimful,   
but still it keeps coming, that shower   
of silver in alleys and gutters, 
all pouring downhill to the sleazy   
red brick, and the barefoot people   
who romp in it, laughing, but never   
take thought for tomorrow, all spinning   
in a pleasure they catch for a moment;   
so when Providence turns off the spigot   
and the sky goes as dry as a prairie, 
then daddy looks down from the penthouse,   
down to the streets, to the gutters,   
and his heart goes out to his neighbors,   
to the little folk thirsty for laughter,   
and he prays in his boundless compassion:   
on behalf of the world and its people   
he demands of his God, give me more.

Hollands Nadir
 

Men around a submarine
moored in Sydney Harbour
close to the end of wartime

showed us below, down into 
their oily, mesh-lit gangway
of bunks atop machines.

In from the country, we
weren't to know our shillings
bought them cigars and thread

for what remained of Holland's Glory:
uniforms, odd, rescued aircraft,
and a clutch of undersea boats

patrolling from Fremantle. The men's
country was still captive, their great
Indies had seen them ousted,

their slaves from centuries back
were still black, and their queen
was in English exile.

The only ripostes still open
to them were torpedoes
and their throaty half-

American-sounding language.
Speaking a luckier one 
we set off home then. Home

and all that word would mean
in the age of rebirthing nations
which would be my time.





Vertigo
 

Last time I fell in a shower room
I bled like a tumbril dandy
and the hotel longed to be rid of me.
Taken to the town clinic, I
described how I tripped on a steel rim
and found my head in the wardrobe.
Scalp-sewn and knotted and flagged
I thanked the Frau Doktor and fled,
wishing the grab-bar of age might
be bolted to all civilization
and thinking of Rome's eighth hill
heaped up out of broken amphorae.

When, anytime after sixty,
or anytime before, you stumble
over two stairs and club your forehead
on rake or hoe, bricks or fuel-drums,
that's the time to call the purveyor
of steel pipe and indoor railings,
and soon you'll be grasping up landings
having left your balance in the car
from which please God you'll never
see the launchway of tires off a brink.
Later comes the sunny day when
street detail whitens blindly to mauve

and people hurry you, or wait, quiet.





My Sparrow
 

There is the torch and the only thing
That will prevent us from using it
Is whether or not we can allow 
Jellyfish in the otherwise
Crystalline surf. It would be easy
To dismiss this view as beautiful and walk away
Because it is buggy and we forgot
The spray, to cancel the conversation
Because its ease is perilous with conjunctions,
To not touch because the sky would 
Separate from the sky and the mothership
Would fall through with a banner
Waving in a language we wouldn't
Understand though the meaning is
As clear as these intercontinental
Contrails hatching mackerel sky
Saying we are full we are full 
Of sound and fury, we are signifying
Nothing. Damned universal law.
Damned categorical imperative
Elbowing its way between my hands
And your face. The sparrows again
Exploding against windows
As a circle of men sitting outside
The cafe while away their intentions
With invisible motor tics they can't
Even feel unless the right empire of light 
Covers every last inch of them
And brings to the surface the names--
Those loves they chose
To stable. And there it is:
The choice--if only the metaphor
Were more complex if I could only
Adverb away my existence
And say what a remarkable Sunday
This is a perfect Sunday 
And turn my breath to stone.
I've done it before, I spoke
The language of sweating cavern walls
And electric light. But I won't go there again.
We are all and only our distances
And when we touch that is what we touch.
Our messy shelves. Our sullen privations
And overabundance of lemons.
Our grief, our mountains and fields
And rivers of grief. Our dismissals
And the love we ignore when we don't run
After the sparrows because the sparrows
Will fly away. My sparrow, fly away if you have to
But know that I am coming.
I am low in the grass. I am burning
With patience. I am every song.
I know all the math in the shore
Says you shouldn't but my distance 
Is yours if you want it. And it is yours
If you don't. Dandelions and honeysuckle
Surround me, the world's ineluctable fire
Is looking right at me, and I am making my stand.





Compost
 

There is magic in decay.
A dance to be done
For the rotting, the maggot strewn
Piles of flesh which pile
Upon the dung-ridden earth
And the damp that gathers
And rusts and defiles. 
There is a bit of this
In even the most zoetic soul--
The dancing child's arms
Flailing to an old ska song
Conduct the day-old flies
Away to whatever rank
Native is closest. Just today
I was walking along the river
With my daughter in my backpack
And I opened my email 
On my phone and Duffie
Had sent me a poem 
Called "Compost. I read it
To my little girl and started
To explain before I was three
Words in Selma started
Yelling, Daddy, Daddy, snake!
In the path was a snake,
Belly up and still nerve-twitching
The ghost of some passing
Bicycle or horse. Pretty, Selma said.
Yes, I said. And underneath my yes
Another yes, the yes to my body,
Just beginning to show signs
Of slack, and another, my grasping
In the dark for affirming flesh
That in turn says yes, yes
Let's rot together but not until
We've drained what sap
Is left in these trees.
And I wake in the morning
And think of the coroner
Calling to ask what color
My father's eyes were,
And I asked, Why? Why can't
You just look--and the coroner,
Matter-of-factly says, Decay.
Do you want some eggs, my love?
I have a new way of preparing them.
And look, look outside, I think this weather
Has the chance of holding.





Bloody Mary
 

Note who's got to go
today, don't fuss
about the means,
just go ahead behead,
impale, starve, strappado,
the sheer assortment
of choices enough
to make a crown
crow. They never
loved me enough.
It must be said: They
were a disappointment.

When divine mother
love wears out, I just
reverse the robe
from blue to red.
I like a flat ground
to build the next town,
city, empire of disgust.
All the waste you see,
that's what I did,
none of that happened
to me. I did that.
I made that. I killed that. I.

Anger
 



I


When in a farmhouse kitchen that smelled
of old rinds and wet cigarette butts 
I hoisted the shotgun to my shoulder
and aimed but did not fire it at the man 
who had just taken my virginity like a snack, 
with my collusion, but still--

When I sat in a conference room 
in an inquisition
at the "newspaper of record,
across from the one slurping his pipe,
the one arching her eyebrow,
and I felt the heat like a wet brand in my chest,
repaid insult for insult and left their fancy job
like a squashed bug on the floor--

When I was twelve, too old, the last time my father 
spanked me, pants down, 
because I had "distressed my mother
and my vision went red-black and
I did not forgive--

When, during my travels along the Gulf Coast, 
the intruder returned in the night
and I did not call the cops again but stood
with a butcher knife facing the door, yelling, "Come in!
although this time it was just the wind flapping 
and banging the screen door--

When across a skating-rink-sized glistening table
I told the committee chair and her brooch I was a fan of Marx
and lost the fellowship--

When I threw a pot of hot coffee
and it just missed a man's head, and the black-brown spatter stains
were still there four years later long after he'd left me 
when I finally moved out of that East Village hole--



II


I would have had to be thinking
in order to have thought--loaded, not loaded?
--and I was not thinking, I was only dripping hot
and oh the pleasure, I can still feel its prickling,
crackle over the furnace of my rage,
to see his face go pale, his eyes widen,
his "put it down, put it down--and I
put it down and allowed my life as well as his
to go on.



III


I miss my anger. Decades go by
when all I can muster is absent-minded invective,
you know, directed at the news;
or a brief fantasy 
of shoving someone in front of a bus. Yesterday
I slammed my fist on my desk
and then apologized, to the desk.

Consider the tapestry of the seven deadly sins, at Saint-Denis:
Anger, wild-haired and half-dressed,
picked out in blue and silver thread bunched 
against the crimson,
rough against the fingertips, she
rides a black boar dappled with blood
and waves her double-headed axe--

Yes, I remember her.
I always lie when I always say
I didn't know the gun was loaded.

Vulnerability Study
 

your face turning from mine

8 strawberries in a wet blue bowl

baba holding his pants

a newlywed securing her updo

a wall cleared of nails

Saints Day Triolet: Saint Anthony
 

When no one else would listen, Saint Anthony
preached seaward, his words fishnet for the lost
souls of the heretics. Caught up in despair, we plea
to the one who will listen: Saint Anthony,
please return Ta's teeth or the misplaced key 
to our bolted hopes. Patron retriever of all we've tossed 
when no one else would. Listen, Saint Anthony,
teach us to steward this world, all our netted loss.





Saints Day Triolet: Saint Valentine
 

You're flush with hearts and I'm forced to fold 
this hand and swear off another luckless match.
How we've found ways to love each other, cajoled
our cindered hearts, flushed and forced to fold 
upon themselves like Saint Valentine ensouled
with seizure, skin a whirring bee swarm, a hatched 
flush of doves. My heart, how I'm forced to fold 
my hands in prayer for another struck match.





Ta Lucia Enters the Nursing Home
 

All morning my daughter pleading, outside
outside. By noon I kneel to button her
coat, tie the scarf to keep her hood in place.
This is her first snow so she strains against
the ritual, spooked silent then whining, 
restless under each buffeting layer,
uncertain how to settle into this
leashing. I manage at last to tunnel
her hands into mittens and she barks and
won't stop barking, her hands suddenly paws.
She is reduced to another being,
barking, barking all day in these restraints.
For days after, she howls into her hands,
the only way she tells me she wants out.





Cathedral of Salt
 

Beneath all this I'm carving a cathedral
of salt. I keep

the entrance hidden, no one seems to notice
the hours I'm missing...I'll

bring you one night, it's where
I go when I

hang up the phone...

                                      Neither you
nor your soul is waiting for me at

the end of this, I know that, the salt
nearly clear after I

chisel out the pews, the see-through
altar, the opaque

panes of glass that depict the stations of
our cross--Here is the day

we met, here is the day we remember we
met...The air down here

will kill us, some say, some wear paper
masks, some still imagine the air above the green

trees, thick with bees

building solitary nests out of petals. What's
the name for this? Ineffable? The endless

white will blind you, some say,
but what is there to see we haven't already

seen? Some say it's
like poking a stick into a river--you might as well

simply write about the stick.

Or the river.





Violet Swords
 

It was a matter of wearing gloves well
while lunching, while conquering Dubrovnik;
of, no one would care how, evading Hell.
Diverse employments made gentlemen tick:
Christmas turkeys; circulating trophies;
pedestal stacked upon pedestal. Today
silence has come to see what no one sees,
it's always grim at the start of the play.
Fellows, who wait  propos their intros
clawing at the panels, such shrill tigers,
thrive unthreading the hems of the heroes.
Friends of our late friend are minor-leaguers
never to be called up but good as types,
people who will hook bras to the flagpole,
bake chocolate for a gray stranger...She wipes
away red records of the stocks you stole...
Yesterday, books were thrown from the third floor,
out the window, they sank in pairs like shoes,
and I watch violet swords on a white shore,
blade-tip laid across blade-tip, where it snows.





Music Between Strangers
 

A sycamore grove, and in its limbs
the orchestra played M vlast, so I saw
boughs bouncing and tuxedo legs
swinging sap-spotted above the splayed
blades of the ground feathered black
in moss, in the sweat of the set sun,
and the players' faces where moths roosted,
where leaf-points drew water-stripes
on brows and eyelids, their hands
that stirred in pollen like a fog, were masked
by birds' nests and bows and flaking vines.

That you were last to climb down,
trumpet tied to your back with blue twine,
is the only thing I believe in,
and after you landed, drifting
through a stream, in a mat of orange needles,
you whistled to what light could float
through the leaves' screen and canopy, diffuse
like tracing tissue, a scrum of benday dots,
            and not much at that,
now that more than the concert has ended,
                            my musician.





Gilding the Lily
 

To keep anxiety at bay, my friend called chemo dragonfly love. Those insects--christened, in places, the devil's darning needles--hover as they contort their joined bodies into a heart, the male with pincers. Finger cutter, horse killer, ear stick, eye pisser. Look closely at the eyes of a female darner and you may well see dark puncture marks. As a slow drip through an IV. As a pill. Through a port into a vein. She called nausea erotica. Just the same, we name our storms to lessen them--not a tropical cyclone, but Arabella, with ballet shoes and bun. Tumors, too, were friends, waiting at the bus stop with backpacks in the morning. Cindy French braids Carrie's hair, yanking at the scalp to form the tight crisscross. Not hair loss, but deep conditioning. She gave us the new lexicon on stationery embossed with a red rose speckled by raindrops. The stem still had its thorns. Ring-around-the-rosy, red rover, red rover, send her right over. She called death the world of 10,000 things: the dragon courting its damsel, catheter tubing in the wastebin, video of a toddler biting his brother, pas de deux, full-sugar ice cream, Crimson Queen, Trumpeter, Red Knockout, Tuscany Superb...I knew her as Rose Shapiro. At the funeral I learned she was born Passalacqua: to cross the river, to pass a glass of water.






Victory, WI
 

All hail the crumbling stone monument 
to the Battle of Bad Axe, the wooden helve

long rotted and burned, the short walk to the river,
where we can bathe in its brown,

where a steamboat ghost huffs out 
a stream of bullets. We are invulnerable

to their spectral lead, descendants 
of fur traders (beaver, ermine,

skunk). Our lungs are clean and pink. Let's visit
the saw shop, the greenhouse with bluff views,

the pines and stacks of firewood,
the Blackhawk general store, named for

the warrior who waved a chalky,
misunderstood flag and eluded capture

for weeks. In winter, eagles
dive here, gathering lift when the wind

hits the bluffs: all hail the migrating
raptor, its piercing talon and yellow cere.





Anne Franks High Heels
 

Miep managed to snap them up for 27.50 guilders. Burgundy-colored suede and leather...                                             --Anne Frank, Tuesday, August 10, 1943
When Miep took us home with her
She held us up in the air,

Eye-level with those eyes
You may know, eyes spelling

Sorrow-girl, wait-for-me,
Happiness-around-a-corner-

One-day, hurry-back, don't-tell.
Two new hands took us in,

Skin cradling skin.
How empty we had been,

Only a little bit worn--
Not a penny, not a pebble

Dwelling within.
We became an altar,

An offering red as wine,
A wishing well.

She was made to carry us
Near and far,

We were made to bear
The pressure of her feet

In darkness, in light,
Their sweetness, their heat.

We were getting used to her.
Miep calls us a handsome pair.





In a Landscape: I
 

"Are you happy? That's a good place to start, or maybe,
"Do you think you're happy? with its more negative
tone. Sometimes you're walking, sometimes falling. That's part
of the problem too, but not all of the problem. Flowers out the window 
or on the windowsill, and so someone brought flowers.
We spend a long time interested in which way the car would
best go in the driveway. Is that the beginning of an answer?
Some way to say who we are?

Well, it brings us up to now, at any rate, as the limitations
of structure, which is the way we need for it to be. Invent some muses
and invoke them, or save them for the yard, some animus
to get us going. And what was it Michael said yesterday? That
the committee to do all these good things has an agenda to do all these
other things as well, that we decide are less good in our estimation,
so then we have this difficulty. It just gets to you sometimes. We have
a table of red apples and a table of green apples, and someone asks you
about apples, but that's too general, you think, as you've made
several distinctions to get to this place of two tables, two colors.
How can that be an answer to anything? Or we can play the forgetting game,
how, for twenty years, my mother would answer for her forgetfulness
by saying it was Old-Timer's Disease, until she forgot that too.

On the television, a truck passes left to right, in stereo. Outside,
a garbage truck passes right to left. They intersect. And so the world continues
around two corners. The table gets turned over, with several people
standing around seemingly not sure of what comes next. Look at them
politely as you can, they're beginners too. And they say the right question
is far more difficult to get to than the right answer. It sounds good,
anyway, in the way other people's lives are a form of distance, something
you can look at, like landscape, until your own starts to look that way 
as well. Looking back at the alternatives, we never had children
or we had more children. And what were their names? As the living room parts
into halls and ridges, where we spend the afternoon imagining a plant,
a filing cabinet or two...because some of these questions
you have with others, and some you have only with yourself.





In a Landscape: II
 

"Ghosts are people who think they're ghosts,
my daughter Natalie said, starting off the period
we will refer to later as A Little Bit Further Along. Since then
(which was last night, November 3rd, 2009), I've been thinking
about where I am more, as a kind of goal,
and somewhat less about where I'm not. It's a pleasure to be
where one is, given that someone
isn't somewhere lethal. This is Pleasure One.

And now this is Pleasure Two, thinking about it,
so that this place, which was Place One, and a pleasure,
as we were there where we were and it was not a lethal place,
but a place where we were, is now this place again
as we're here thinking about it, like America or a popsicle.
"Open the house and the house is empty, Natalie also said, meaning 
her dollhouse, as she's seven, but when she said it, I had this
vision of all of us suddenly disappearing, maybe thinking
ourselves ghosts, even, or getting somewhere, out
and around her bedroom and then down the hall and stairs.

I'll tell you how it happened. Natalie and I were looking out the window
at the backyard, and she asked me if I liked our house. It's a theme
with her. The other night she asked me if I liked life. I said, "Yeah,
a lot. And she looked at me a second and then said, "Me too.
You don't hear that every day, I think, until the accumulations
begin to remind me of every day: Carla, who donated a kidney
to her brother-in-law (Robin's uncle), has just been diagnosed
with cancer, two months later. She sends hopeful updates
from the hospital, on Facebook. Like fountains, the footnotes
go on. My footnote or yours. The big questions can't be decided
in this way. They demand coins or laws. And this is
much too important to be a big question.





In a Landscape: III
 

It appears that we're living (which isn't always the case), depending
on how one defines such things, in a "now you see it/
now you see it kind of way. We can say we're working on our age,
as well, listening to Bob Dylan songs where people can age
in whatever direction supports the theme. "Too bad life doesn't
get themes, Robin says, and yes, that's right, and then we can all go 
do whatever it was we were going to do anyway. "It's either that,
or pay off the kidnapper, as Neil Young had it, back in the mid-70s.
There's always an analogue, and someone to tell us about it,
how, no matter how fast you run, you can't run fast enough
to get away from yourself. You could even call it a theme.

For instance, I was the first one to an eighteen-wheeler accident
on the highway once, in the early 90s. I didn't know what
I was going to find. It was just tossed there on its side, across
both lanes. So I got out of the car and walked around to the front,
only to see the driver standing inside the cab that was resting
on the driver-side door. He was simply standing there behind the glass,
parallel with the dashboard, a little blood on his forehead, looking
as lost as I felt, looking back at him. All his things (magazines
and maps and cigarettes and pens and snacks) in a little pile at his feet.
When I left, a guy was hitting the windshield with a baseball bat.

You go to the room, and the place you like to sit
is missing. This is an opportunity to trust, I suppose, or perhaps
for blind panic, if one were to consider this a metaphor
for something. But say it's not, say there are no such things
as metaphors for a moment, and where does that get you?
Presently, it gets me to a row of green and yellow plastic chairs,
those 1950s-looking ones I imagine Kenton would like
to collect. They're joined together by shiny metal clasps, chrome,
and the whole thing is full of sunlight through the plate glass
window. It's the kind of scene I think of as lickable, how everything 
looks like cheerful candy, and I wonder if there might be a way
to be there or here without a beginning, or without an ending,
or if perhaps there might be a concept for no middle.





First Thing
 

Drown on all fours
Pennies from a box flood the frump market
Blasts of nacre, triage under weather's speckled pool

The ide fixe never happens yet can't be ignored
Still the moon is half full?
Speak for yourself with your hands up

The search is on
Search and destroy, if you will
Elimination starting with a lit fuse

Vacuumed anon
Your pleasure is the lee shore
Thunder smites the tundra's paw

This should be memorable
Legs whited out
The runners advance





Accounts Payable
 

...cantered light-heartedly downstream to their doom.                        --Patrick Leigh Fermor
Somebody down there hates us deeply,
Has planted a thorn where slightest woe may overrun.

Disorderly and youthful sorrow, many divots picked at since
Across the thrice-hounded comfort zone.

Can't cut it, sees permanent crones
Encroaching aside likely lanes of executive tar

All spread skyward.
You got the picture, Bub:

This world is ours no more,
And those other euphemisms for grimly twisting wrath,

A wire-mesh semblance bedecked
With twilight's steamy regard.

Look at the wind out here.
Delete imperative.

Hours where money rinses life like sex,
Whichever nowadays serves as its signifier.





Morning Scene
 

Opposite him at this table again
and through the windows the city glittering, surreal as a scale model, 

the city in miniature--only it moves in a real way, because it is real.
One of the windows is open, some construction down on the street

drones like a distant vacuum. It's warm for January.
Still, his apartment has that dreamlike quality

of feeling like home though I know it's not. Not mine anymore--
but how many people get to visit the past without hurting anything? 

To come back and drink the same coffee
from the same never-quite-clean cup?





Monogram
 

For Bernadette Mayer
Just one more vintage movie,
Batwings tonight at the Bal Masqu--
Another creature stuffed
By distinguished pedigree.

I get a lot of madcap ideas about sentience,
How knowing has you put down in the book 
Forbidden speech recognition--
Else why make such a face?

And now it's luck no longer mouth that moves
When fastidious rummage whispers
To divulge a surplus
A clue if not the key.

Prospect my question laps up for good--
I lean to it. Knowing you,
First-person dwindle.
Tweet-tweet. Prick.





Balcony Scene
 

Up--or out?--here:
a problem of preposition,

my uneasy relation
with the world. Whether I'm

above it or apart. On the other side
of the latched glass door, a man

loves me. Worries. Calls my name.

                      

Where--for art--thou-
sands of windows go dark

in slow succession. On Essex
and Ludlow and Orchard.

A thousand times goodnight.

                      

A boy throwing stones at a window.
Right window, wrong boy.

                      

Love goes toward love--

And the place death, down there

waving its white kerchief--





Tenderness
 

Yes, I was jealous when you threw the glass.

I wanted the shattering against the wood-paneled floor for myself,
to be the sudden diaspora of its pieces across the apartment--and last night

when we fought, I wanted you to hit me so badly I begged.
And the other day walking past Renewal-on-the-Bowery,

when one of the men smoking unsteadily outside
called me a faggot, I thought: Good. People get what they deserve.

Then I wished I were more like Jesus--capable of loving
all people and all things always, capable of nothing

but love. I waste half my wishes this way,

wishing to be virtuous. The rest, well,
I don't have to tell you, do I?





At the Repast
 

When we gathered at the house, while the men all looked at their shoes and the women whispered, baby, baby, baby, she sat down with a fist full of paper napkins and folded them into birds. When she filled her hands, she crossed the room to the hearth and threw a bird into the flames, then another, then another until she had destroyed all she created. Years later when I asked her what she meant, she couldn't remember. The worst has already happened, she said. What good is metaphor to us now?





Song of the Andoumboulou: 136
 


  A comped piano lifted the leaves in
    Low Forest, a blanket of shade pulled
up, a sheet of glass put in place, free
                                                                   pros-
    pect all around I thought. I wanted my
allegoric lapse, I wanted my whatsaid
  companions. Alone looking out under
                                                                        house
      arrest, I wanted them back, less myself
   than before, unbeset...An exquisite jewel
    it all was, no explanation, no equation,
                                                                            a
   time-lapse excursion it was. High John
    from High Point was on the box, the box
blown roofless, hacked wood scattered
                                                                        what
   light there was...A low trombone could
     be heard asking, "What have they done to
my beautiful boy? A tree limb cracked in
                                                                             the
       distance, the all-of-us the horns had be-
  come. All of us there to notice, all of us there
    to see, "Blue Train our wounded anthem,
hacked wood the woods we walked...I was
                                                                               im-

   a blur, train truck, wished-for congress come

    There was the sun's late equation, the moon's
ludic blush, truck equaling train equaling train
   equaling truck, soon's blue transport, soon
                                                                                  soon
come...It was the muse's blue lips the all-of-
     us the horns had become came thru, blue
  rebuked kiss, blue-blent reconnoiter. It was
                                                                                  the
      muse's gray canopy covered us, the we I'd
   otherwise be the trees fell free of, cries loud
     and low we'd have heard had we been there,
wood equaling would equaling we...I lay
                                                                           like
   Anuncio busted up contemplating the book
     of it, last leg's no-exit announcement no way
to run. I stood like Itamar, sat like Huff. A
                                                                              sweet
    smile captured my lips like Netsanet's, Zeno
                                                                                     and
  Zenette's re-
pair


                           


  Zeno and Zenette's last anything. Zeno and
     Zenette's last kiss. I saw them come back 
from afar, saw them bisect every step. Friend
                                                                                   and
    familiar, affine, foe, they walked in smelling 
       of salt, the reek of Lone Coast on their hair, 
   their skin, sand a kind of coat they wore...
                                                                                Some-
       thing I saw it seemed I dreamt I saw, some-
   thing seen exteriority reneged on, stand up wide 
     awake though I did. Did I see what I saw I
                                                                                  won-
      dered, the closer the coast was the less I felt
   located, water opening out onto everywhere,
    was what I saw what I saw I wanted to know...
A versionary recital it seemed or so I thought,
                                                                                    so
    abreast of it only the book of it remained, a
finger dipped in butterfly dust, a foot gone print- 
   less, what of it I glimpsed gone out on tiptoe,
                                                                                     wuh
      we'd have been whose escorts, wuh we, once
   there, drew thru the woods...So it was or so
     it went, going so, soon gone, a blip no screen
accounted for, blink, as I did, all I could. The
                                                                                  box
       had fallen away, sound itself an overt bed of
   scree, roughed underbody I fell and felt heir
     to, a chestnut sense were there any sense left, a
                                                                                            new
   scrub sense of my-
self

Unlays Late Promenade
 

--"mu one hundred sixteenth part--

    Again that closer walk, legless though
they'd be. Low Insofarian sun I cut my
   teeth on, theirs to be better to bite with,
                                                                            me
      theirs the closer we walked. They were
   insisting time seeds grievance, crooned it the
     closer I got, Zeno and Zenette moment's
                                                                               nurs-
es, Nunca Anuncia's net...Thus it was they
     were there again, thus they walked legless,
   noses thumbed at the sun. Unlay's avatar
                                                                               said
      to've become caricature, sacred clown of
   late's late awakening, laughed having thought
     it so...So it was I saw what I saw was too
much. So it was I sewed my mouth shut,
                                                                          they
     who'd have heard me gone again, what-
       say's entourage. "So it was were the
   words they'd gone away muttering, unlay's
                                                                                  non-
chalance...Everything was leaving itself, eve-
     ryone himself, herself, all of them, all of
   it, moving. It was as though they were each
                                                                                   an-
    other. Outmost urge met indrawn joust, pe-
yote-pod baritone tap. They were saying they'd
   gotten back from this or that place. Where
                                                                                 was
     the honey we'd heard about I wanted to know...
      In the realm of whatsay it all bore consequence.
They did a slack-legged shuffle, legless though
   they were, quick-switch imbroglio the cost of it,
                                                                                          rum-
ble in the house of who knew. It was my own most 
     inward step, my heart itself, closer than close
   could be. I had a go at it but fell, my legs were in 
                                                                                            the 
     way, no way could legless grace come again...I
thought about walking. I had to think about walk-
   ing, Nunca's pelvic sway. Though what I saw 
                                                                                     I 
     couldn't say, it made me say things, realm in
whose wood I hung in love with her hard look,
                                                                                     walk
  in whose wake 
I lay





             ________________

    I was whistling when my lips fell off. Lip- 
less was to legless in some way I couldn't 
  say, the closer walk words got in the way 
                                                                             of... 
      What it was lay on the tip of my tongue, 
  say to unlay already in some way, unsay's 
    day begun. We were of more than one mind 
                                                                                    Huff 
  had it. Sophia said the same... I wanted rele- 
    vance, trust, I whistled even so, wind in 
                                                                             the 
  gaps in my 
teeth


                          


  A new lady named Ahdja joined our group, 
    slight of limb, loose tomboy body, smile so 
broad we blushed. The Egyptian spring was 
                                                                                up 
      in smoke in back of us, we trudged on, far 
  from all that, even far from Lone Coast, a 
    former life stalked us it seemed... We took 
                                                                                  tiny 
steps, unsure what lay under us, unlay's realm 
    the sweet precinct we sought, unsure what 
  would get us there... To say we was too much 
                                                                                    my 
      head told me. Not so my second head said. To 
  say we was all I wanted my third head said, sec- 
    ond head said to've lost itself, third head always 
                                                                                            at 
      odds with itself, want wanting more of itself... 
  It was Ahdja's dream we were in, the we I went 
    on about, unlay's adumbration. When would 
                                                                                      its 
  day begin we wondered, the we I so insisted on, 
    the we we'd eventually be, when would lay's 
day be done. It was my dream of Ahdja we were 
                                                                                        in 
      said my third head, we the one risk I took, one 
  wish, flat rhapsodic stitch... I walked haunted 
    by the we she made us, Nunca's promenade be- 
hind us now. We'd seen Egypt in flames and we 
                                                                                        kept 
    walking. Huff said, "I told you so, and we kept 
walking, unlay's late promenade all there was 
  left... I dreamt a dream of moving on, I dreamt 
                                                                                        a 
dream of standing pat, first head and second head 
    and third head's agreement, a dream I let my true 
                                                                                                self

  Unlay was no simple stand, this or that mystic 
    hustle, this or that bodily rebuke. In the end 
it will have been all there was we grew to expect, 
                                                                                         no 
      soul's captivity some book had called Egypt, a 
  book we no longer read... In the realm of whatsay 
    we tramped along, there no matter spun by the 
                                                                                           swirl 
of it, there no matter where we were. Moment's 
    notice moment's gnosis, the moment brought bad 
  and good. Ahdja's ka was Layla, Itamar's Majnun, 
                                                                                              our 
     crew caught up in the old way, the old way's day 
  redone... "Madness be our name, we chimed in 
    unison, incensed, Majnun's dream of a just world 
just dreaming, Majnun's each and all we were. So 
                                                                                           it 
  was and so we sang, snuffed Egyptian spring an- 
    acrustic, uncuffed auspice there'd be. Thus it was, 
so it went, unlay unlike what it was we expected, 
                                                                                          sanc- 
    tified feet where voices met water, far from cause 
and consequence we stumped... We were relishing being 
  together for a time, something seen in a face peering 
                                                                                                  out 
      from inside we saw was what soul was. "This is how 
  it is, I was telling myself, some spectral aspect it had 
    somehow. "This is how it is, I said, "this is how it 
is, voice eaten at by the bay we stood in front of, cold 
                                                                                                   ad- 
    vent of water, cold commiseration, ythmic arrival, 
      salt... If not what wet our hems anointment was 
nothing, nothing if not what tugged our feet. "Froth be 
  what we'll be, we chimed, indignant, high falsetto 
                                                                                               in-

    was a core to be gotten to, cloth drawn aside or 
  gone under, frills fallen away at the water's edge... 
                                                                                              If

Song of the Andoumboulou: 138
 


  Anuncio drifted in a well of sound, unlay's
     ward, late orphan, a wry erotics had its 
way. He called himself Antonio now, Ahdja
                                                                                having
    joined our group...Dunelike hip and thigh
he stipulated, the desert he insisted we see. We
   understood there was occult stuff going on
                                                                                  un-
      derneath, telling ourselves get used to it,
   close to the bone so close it lay inside, the
     closer walk we all went on about...We
were in Port of Spain thinking about India,
                                                                               bored
    outside the Red House, shimmering side
street, pan exactitude bruited elsewhere, pan's
   light water, floating light. The light hung as
                                                                                   though 
it were buffed, embroidered, sound's amanuensis,
     griff...There they were at the well again, the
   we he'd been told would be there, whatsaid
                                                                                   en-
       semble the air disinterred, hit by affliction
   in each their own way, beset by some other
    where there might've been, beset by some other
when there might've been, beset by some nether
                                                                                         light...
   If not bodily light's late day there was nothing,
     the not-all-there there'd always been come into
its own. Wind affliction was all, all there was,
                                                                                   rent,
    a mere liplike wrinkle at least. "Back when we
were alive, it said...Literal sigil. Sage regret.
   A way of looking. Something we saw. "Sealed
                                                                                       lips
    wheeled in the air, we translated it. The point
                                                                                          was
  to look past it we
saw


                          


    He wanted Ahdja's poise, Antonio's aplomb, 
      namesake demur, name notwithstanding. So it 
was he blinked and his eyes bled, wry erotics' 
  haunched interstice bloodstruck, never again 
                                                                                     be- 
fit, Mr. In-Between... A kaiso chorale, we sang 
    "Namaste, a voice inside the voice inside the 
  box, tongue in cheek, box buried somewhere 
                                                                                    east... 
      It wasn't singing we were there for, chant 
  though we did sotto voce, an agonized aplomb of 
    some sort... An Ibibio go-head we each turned 
into, not meaning to... Go-heads one and all we 
                                                                                       were, 
    snide choir... To sing wasn't why we were there... 
What it was was names tore loose, took wing, what 
  world had been ours theirs now, sound itself, 
                                                                                      A- 
nuncio's well's regress... So that what we sought 
    was more tone, mock sonance, science an a- 
  malgam of huh, wuh, huh, knowing's new toll, 
                                                                                       wuh 
huh... We were where the songs had been beckon- 
    ing from. This was as it always was. This was 
  always it no matter what it was. All the things it 
                                                                                         was 
      lay nameless. Roots drew loose with no tonic, 
  it whether or not it was... An aroused incumbency 
    surrounded us, unlay's fallaway terrain's intan- 
gibility, Antonio's adjunct address. We were down 
                                                                                             to 
    the it of it it seemed... Was it the shimmer of last 
      things we wondered, queasiness come and gone 
  come again. There the very it so what it was our knees 
                                                                                                     gave, 
    so close we could taste it, nonce elixir, lapse, ellipse... 
All of which Ahdja made light of, unsure what of it 
  fit or if any of it fit. "You can't come on with all 
                                                                                        that 
    new-name talk, that no-name stuff. All that evac- 
uation stuff, she said, "gets old, got old, as Antonio 
  carried on, kept on, Anuncio to some of us, even 
                                                                                           so... 
    All as if the quality of standing there shifted, a new 
                                                                                                 cast 
  of soul come 
down


                          


  Some common body to adduce it would some- 
    day come to. We stood on the dock, white 
clouds, blue sky all around, spiked Antillean 
                                                                                  salt 
    in the air. Big ships loomed as we talked... 
Each of us with our well of sound, a sense of 
  quest and of brute inconsequence, Anuncio's 
                                                                                     mys- 
tic pretense. "Promises, promises, we said suck- 
    ing our teeth, said sucking wind thru the gaps 
  between our teeth, a taunt song serenading Mr. 
                                                                                         In- 
      Between... We stood looking out, disconsolate, 
  nothing if not words for recompense, what if not 
    words none of us knew. Words more whistle 
than words we admonished, Anuncio going on 
                                                                                      a- 
      bout Antonio and Ahdja, the he and she of 
  lore they'd have been had they been able, each 
    the other's butterfly twin... Each the other's 
                                                                                    but- 
  terfly friend if not all that, paperweight, open, 
    flown. Second-, third-, nth-hand innuendo all 
there was, word more whistle, mere whistle we 
                                                                                      let 
      loose, echo degree zero, choric sough... Black 
  wheeze, occult burr, we susurrated. "Este mundo 
    tan extrano, she intoned, we as well. Ahdja 
                                                                                    was 
      meat and bones on the spirit of place he con- 
  vinced us existed, an impromptu polity exhumed... 
    The feeling we were futureless went away. Wuh 
                                                                                           huh 
  went as 
well


                          


  An inwardly repeated tableau. We sat on the 
    dock, reluctant witnesses it seemed, more 
story to the story than we could see. What 
                                                                             we 
    thought real got a gossamer look, soon to 
      tear thru it seemed. Lytic remit what we'd 
been told was real, brute reconnoiter, non- 
  sonant lament it seemed... There we stood, 
                                                                                 toll- 
      ing bone in the air, no tone. Huff called it 
  skeletone. There we sat though we stood, 
    stood though we sat, stark Trinidadian light 
                                                                                     a 
  new life, shoal of an earlier life... I wanted 
      Anuncio's ythmic pivot, Ahdja's mystic sa- 
    shay, Antonio's pirate swag rolled into one 
                                                                                  but 
      no one was asking me. No one was noticing 
  anything, I thought, the difference Ahdja made 
    no matter, an order of self-containment ob- 
tained. So I thought or would've said I thought 
                                                                                      had 
    anyone asked. No one did, said or saw... An 
      illusion of place or an allusion to it, Mu was 
  all there was, unmoored abstract integument, 
                                                                                      im- 
    manent commemorative lament. Something 
known as la-la crowded my throat, clung to 
  the roof of my mouth. La-la meant I loved it, 
                                                                                    torn 
      but tucked away, the versionary company of 
  love I'd fallen in with, first unfallen fallen, unre- 
    formed... No time soon will I be done with it 
I thought. La-la mentored my disarray. No way 
                                                                                      can 
      I be done with it I thought, Ahdja and Antonio 
  Anuncio's boon constituency, each the other's 
    go-head eminence, each the other's glancing 
                                                                                      re- 
lay... Late that day we sat in a small boat on the 
    other side of the island. Scarlet ibises got their 
  color eating shrimp Ahdja pointed out. Anuncio, 
                                                                                           not 
      knowing what to say, said, "So my heart... Mu 
  was not knowing. Mu meant shutting up. Mu was 
    me and Ahdja, Mr. and Ms. In-Between. Mu 
meant no filler. "Promises, promises resounded 
                                                                                          all 
  day... Something we saw in Ahdja's face wanted 
    out it seemed. She was the one we had by not 
having lore had it, love's adamant outskirts, love's 
                                                                                           dog- 
    matic heart. I made untimeliness a foregone future, 
something-seen-in-a-face a new order to restore. I 
  saw gold where there maybe wasn't, beer cans lined 
                                                                                                 on 
    the rail we leaned against, aught if not imagined im- 
        pact, we the presumption of one... A long sus- 
      tention of hum it came down to, Om the Vedic nu 
                                                                                                 we 
    reminisced, Om the seed-syllabic gist and embel- 
      lishment, Om the intuitist Mu. "Greek to me, 
each of us admitted, thrum we were ambushed by, 
  glum subterranean drone strung under it, mosquito 
                                                                                                 buzz

    I dreamt I died and I went into an isolation

  Accompaniment called out to me in dreams

As If It Were "This Is Our Music
 

--"mu one hundred eighteenth part--

  Heaved our bags and headed out again. Again
      the ground that was to've been there wasn't.
Bits of ripcord crowded the box my head had
                                                                                   be-
    come, the sense we were a band was back, 
the sense we were a band or in a band...The 
   rotating gate time turned out to be creaked,
                                                                                   we 
    pulled away. Lord Invader's Reform School
       Band it was we were in, the Pseudo-Dionysian
Fife Corps, the Muvian Wind Xtet...The sense
   we were a band or were in a band had come
                                                                                   back,
    names' wicked sense we called timbre, num-
bers' crooked sense our bequest. Clasp it tee-
   tered near to, abstraction, band was what to
                                                                                    be
there was...Band was what it was to be there
     we shouted, band all we thought it would 
   be. Band was a chant, that we chanted, what
                                                                                    we 
    chanted, chant said it all would be alright...
A new band, our new name was the Abandoned
   Ones, no surprise. We dwelt in the well-being
                                                                                      that
       awaited us, never not sure we'd get there, what
   way we were yet to know. I stood pat, a rickety
     sixty-six, tapped out a scarecrow jig in waltz 
time, big toe blunt inside my shoe...Who was I to
                                                                                           so
    rhapsodize I chided myself, who to so mark my-
       self, chill teeth suddenly forming reforming,
   who to let my heart out so...To be at odds with
                                                                                         my- 
    self resounded, sound's own City the wall I hit 
      my head against, polis was to be and to be so hit... 
  We heard clamor, clash, blue consonance, noise's 
                                                                                             low

  We pumped our arms as though they were

Dreams of Avenging the Dogs
 

          
          You and I thigh deep in Suwannee River then in a bathtub. Spanish moss clogsthe drain and a man carrying a green towel interrupts. We send him away oncemore knowing he'll return to watch. We're photographers shooting on locationfor Sylvia Plath's upcoming book, Savage Beauty--wrong poet or wrong book,I know, depending on how you look at it--however, I'm the one who is whitethis time, you're darker, maybe Quechua Indian or Spanish, like actor AntonioBanderas, with very defined stomach muscles and a slick throb of a penis.Years later I write a book about our affair. They bring me on one of thosedaytime talk shows, and before being reunited, we are kept in separate rooms, thetelevision split screen, green-towel man in the audience. I'm still white, so are you,both of us middle-aged with freckles and strawberry-blonde hair. Later I'm theviewer at home thinking, Like hell they'll fall for each other.





Amening
 

Model prisoner or not, I won't.

Silver lash, hound's tooth,
meager sinful town's crook.

I am nervous again. I could kill
if you let me. But tonight, I'll be still
under this palm. Zeroed out,
the tea my toilet muck.

Licorice and almond
twisted beneath the sink,
I'm lovely again. Come on
with my dying.

Today the globe's underside
isn't pink, but rather,

I look ahead toward what
has happened.





Frightening Things
 

After wandering years
Basho returned
to gaze at his umbilical cord
pickled in a jar. Plopped
in brine years ago
like the frog in the pond
in his famous haiku.
Of course
fame meant nothing
to him. He stood
in the blazing rain
in his family graveyard
and as a crow squawked overhead
the stones proclaimed him
the last of his line. He
kept feeling inside his
straw raincoat for a missing
limb or the hole where
the wind and rain
flew in. I'll get drunk
tonight, he thought,
and his eyelashes glistened
as he trudged back
to his hermit's hut
to gaze again at the jar.







Aubade
 

A wound is a blossom
but only to the living.
A May night, birdsong

before the first light pierces,
chirps out of blackness:
My daughter's angry at me

and her mother as I
was once angry at mine.
It's a way of crossing over.

I'm so tired now.
And my core's
all water, flowing

somewhere where the sea
can't find her. And neither
can I. How much longer

till I finally lose her? Where 
is the first dawn wet blossom?
Who recalls how I touched

her mother once? Or many others?
How night is not always easy.
Nor are daughters. Nor are sons.

And how is it I've become a father
watching light sift slowly
into the daughterless dark.





[Dear Angry Mob,]
 

Dear Angry Mob,

Oak Wood Trail is closed to you. We 
feel it unnecessary to defend our position,
for we have always thought of ourselves
(and rightly, I venture) as a haven for
those seeking a quiet and solitary
contemplation. We are truly sorry
for the inconvenience.

Signed,

                                 Ranger Lil


PS            Ofttimes as the day ends
                      on a wet bed of yellow leaves
                            or the sky densens gray and dark
                 I am brought to imagine
                      the growing disquiet
                             in the hearts of my countrymen





[It was as if her love had become]
 

It was as if her love had become
a big eye or some historical logic or
a religious particle lodged in the brain.
In the most costly services of a great society
one may find the allure of a benign intelligence.
I have hoped, since I was a child, to be surrounded by
a group of articulate characters who might
with gracious friendship provide
some essential entertainment

                                                       as Aaron's
                                                               which was a cane
                                                  and then a snake
                                                     and then a cane again

     great clouds
              of smoke from the forest
Itsy bugs amarch my naked legs
        in my beard, to burn
                                as one might
                                         with one's eyes
I learned, but can no longer remember
with what dignity another's care imbues one.
You sit and pick the lice from my hair.
What sort of life is this.







[Dark mornings shown thy mask]
 

Dark mornings shown thy mask
made well thy visage and voice
rolling over and hearing some perfect
sweetness that one broad soul poured forth
again in happy countenance and ancient word


                                     my city cold
                                        for me, my nature
                                                lost

                                        come back

                               sallow soft and colorless
                         thy dreams repent

        as:

The whole family
each with his own

                                          kiss winter goodbye, and so too

Silver streamers dazzling winter
 

I let my body down slow which is
what they say to do, like a whale
with its breathing and floating
in the ocean.

Yesterday
was the half moon
and today was basically
the half moon too.

A glacier's blue
and water
in the middle of a lake 
is blue.

I only had one day
during which I could get myself
out into the middle of it
and I did,
                            kudos to me. 

And to the resilient goose
  who never feels cold
And to the talky crow
  who has so many friends
And to the inspiring stealthy ducks
  who fly together in clips above water.

It's a silly betrayal
of my own thoughts
to invent or remember,
so maybe I'll just close
with these tender lines
of Henry David Thoreau:

"An oak tree
   in Hubbard's Passage
stands absolutely
  motionless
and dark
against the sky.





[Ocean which I pushed up]
 

Ocean which I pushed up
with my fingers so I could touch
the orange sand below

and white mountain
which is not white but for getting
caught in the cold

Stay here where it is warm
and where the sun shines, for later
celestial garlands of dead light
will draw you into the cold for sure





Winged and Acid Dark
 

A sentence with "dappled shadow in it.
Something not sayable
spurting from the morning silence,
secret as a thrush.

The other man, the officer, who brought onions
and wine and sacks of flour,
the major with the swollen knee,
wanted intelligent conversation afterward.
Having no choice, she provided that, too.

Potsdamerplatz, May 1945.

When the first one was through he pried her mouth open.
Bash told Rensetsu to avoid sensational materials.
If the horror of the world were the truth of the world,
he said, there would be no one to say it
and no one to say it to.
I think he recommended describing the slightly frenzied
swarming of insects near a waterfall.

Pried her mouth open and spit in it.
We pass these things on,
probably, because we are what we can imagine.

Something not sayable in the morning silence.
The mind hungering after likenesses. "Tender sky, etc.,
curves the swallows trace in air.





The House on Moscow Street
 

It's the ragged source of memory,
a tarpaper-shingled bungalow
whose floors tilt toward the porch,
whose back yard ends abruptly
in a weedy ravine. Nothing special:
a chain of three bedrooms
and a long side porch turned parlor
where my great-grandfather, Pomp, smoked
every evening over the news,
a long sunny kitchen
where Annie, his wife,
measured cornmeal
dreaming through the window
across the ravine and up to Shelby Hill
where she had borne their spirited,
high-yellow brood.

In the middle bedroom's hard,
high antique double bed
the ghost of Aunt Jane,
the laundress
who bought the house in 1872,
though I call with all my voices,
does not appear.
Nor does Pomp's ghost,
with whom one of my cousins believes
she once had a long and intimate
unspoken midnight talk.
He told her, though they'd never met,
that he loved her; promised
her raw widowhood would heal
without leaving a scar.

The conveniences in an enclosed corner
of the slant-floored back side porch
were the first indoor plumbing in town.
Aunt Jane put them in,
incurring the wrath of the woman
who lived in the big house next door.
Aunt Jane left the house
to Annie, whose mother she had known
as a slave on the plantation,
so Annie and Pomp could move their children
into town, down off Shelby Hill.
My grandmother, her brother, and five sisters
watched their faces change slowly
in the oval mirror on the wall outside the door
into teachers' faces, golden with respect.
Here Geneva, the randy sister,
damned their colleges,
daubing her quicksilver breasts
with gifts of perfume.

As much as love,
as much as a visit
to the grave of a known ancestor,
the homeplace moves me not to silence
but to righteous, praise Jesus song:

Oh, catfish and turnip greens,
hot-water cornbread and grits.
Oh, musty, much-underlined Bibles;
generations lost to be found,
to be found.





Mama's Promise
 

I have no answer to the blank inequity
of a four-year-old dying of cancer.
I saw her on t.v. and wept
with my mouth full of meatloaf.

I constantly flash on disasters now;
red lights shout Warning. Danger.
everywhere I look.
I buckle him in, but what if a car
with a grille like a sharkbite
roared up out of the road?
I feed him square meals
but what if the fist of his heart
should simply fall open?
I carried him safely
as long as I could,
but now he's a runaway
on the dangerous highway.
Warning. Danger.
I've started to pray.

But the dangerous highway
curves through blue evenings
when I hold his yielding hand
and snip his miniscule nails
with my vicious-looking scissors.
I carry him around
likp an egg in a spoon,
and I remember a porcelain fawn,
a best friend's trust,
my broken faith in myself.
It's not my grace that keeps me erect
as the sidewalk clatters downhill
under my rollerskate wheels.

 Sometimes I lie awake
troubled by this thought:
It's not so simple to give a child birth;
you also have to give it death,
the jealous fairy's christening gift.

I've always pictured my own death
as a closed door,
a black room,
a breathless leap from the mountain top
with time to throw out my arms, lift my head,
and see, in the instant my heart stops,
a whole galaxy of blue.
I imagined I'd forget,
in the cessation of feeling,
while the guilt of my lifetime floated away
like a nylon nightgown,
and that I'd fall into clean, fresh forgiveness.

Ah, but the death I've given away
is more mine than the one I've kept:
from my hand the poisoned apple,
from my bow the mistletoe dart.

Then I think of Mama,
her bountiful breasts.
When I was a child, I really swear,
Mama's kisses could heal.
I remember her promise,
and whisper it over my sweet son's sleep:

    When you float to the bottom, child,
    like a mote down a sunbeam,
    you'll see me from a trillion miles away:
    my eyes looking up to you,
    my arms outstretched for you like night.





Family
 

My master/father sent me up from South
Carolina to Boston as a nine-year-old.
My mother's illiterate silence has been a death.
I wonder if she still labors in his fields.
His sister, dutiful but cold as snow,
gave me a little room in her house, below
the stairs with the Irish servants, who hated me
for the fatal flaw in my genealogy.
For the first time in my life I am at home
in this bevy of scholars, my first family.
Here, the wallpapers welcome me into every room,
and the mirrors see me, not my pedigree.
My sisters, Jerusha, Emilia, Elizabeth ...
But Mama's unlettered silence is a death.







Worth
 

For Ruben Ahoueya
Today in America people were bought and sold:
five hundred for a "likely Negro wench."
If someone at auction is worth her weight in gold,
how much would she be worth by pound? By ounce?
If I owned an unimaginable quantity of wealth,
could I buy an iota of myself?
How would I know which part belonged to me?
If I owned part, could I set my part free?
It must be worth something--maybe a lot--
that my great-grandfather, they say, killed a lion.
They say he was black, with muscles as hard as iron,
that he wore a necklace of the claws of the lion he'd fought.
How much do I hear, for his majesty in my blood?
I auction myself. And I make the highest bid.





For the Union Dead
 

The old South Boston Aquarium stands
in a Sahara of snow now. Its broken windows are boarded. 
The bronze weathervane cod has lost half its scales.
The airy tanks are dry.

Once my nose crawled like a snail on the glass;
my hand tingled
to burst the bubbles
drifting from the noses of the cowed, compliant fish.

My hand draws back. I often sigh still
for the dark downward and vegetating kingdom
of the fish and reptile. One morning last March,
I pressed against the new barbed and galvanized

fence on the Boston Common. Behind their cage,
yellow dinosaur steamshovels were grunting 
as they cropped up tons of mush and grass
to gouge their underworld garage.

Parking spaces luxuriate like civic
sandpiles in the heart of Boston.
A girdle of orange, Puritan-pumpkin colored girders
braces the tingling Statehouse,

shaking over the excavations, as it faces Colonel Shaw
and his bell-cheeked Negro infantry
on St. Gaudens' shaking Civil War relief,
propped by a plank splint against the garage's earthquake.

Two months after marching through Boston,
half the regiment was dead;
at the dedication,
William James could almost hear the bronze Negroes breathe.
 
Their monument sticks like a fishbone
in the city's throat.
Its Colonel is as lean
as a compass-needle.

He has an angry wrenlike vigilance,
a greyhound's gentle tautness;
he seems to wince at pleasure,
and suffocate for privacy.

He is out of bounds now. He rejoices in man's lovely,
peculiar power to choose life and die--
when he leads his black soldiers to death,
he cannot bend his back.

On a thousand small town New England greens,
the old white churches hold their air
of sparse, sincere rebellion; frayed flags
quilt the graveyards of the Grand Army of the Republic.

The stone statues of the abstract Union Soldier
grow slimmer and younger each year--
wasp-waisted, they doze over muskets
and muse through their sideburns . . .

Shaw's father wanted no monument
except the ditch,
where his son's body was thrown
and lost with his "niggers."

The ditch is nearer.
There are no statues for the last war here;
on Boylston Street, a commercial photograph 
shows Hiroshima boiling

over a Mosler Safe, the "Rock of Ages"
that survived the blast. Space is nearer.
When I crouch to my television set,
the drained faces of Negro school-children rise like balloons.

Colonel Shaw
is riding on his bubble,
he waits
for the blessd break.

The Aquarium is gone. Everywhere,
giant finned cars nose forward like fish;
a savage servility
slides by on grease.





From My Window
 

Spring: the first morning when that one true block of sweet, laminar,
               complex scent arrives
from somewhere west and I keep coming to lean on the sill, glorying in
               the end of the wretched winter.
The scabby-barked sycamores ringing the empty lot across the way are
               budded --I hadn't noticed --
and the thick spikes of the unlikely urban crocuses have already broken
              the gritty soil.
Up the street, some surveyors with tripods are waving each other left and
              right the way they do.
A girl in a gym suit jogged by a while ago, some kids passed, playing
              hooky, I imagine,
and now the paraplegic Vietnam vet who lives in a half-converted ware-
              house down the block
and the friend who stays with him and seems to help him out come
              weaving towards me,
their battered wheelchair lurching uncertainly from one edge of the
              sidewalk to the other.
I know where they're going--to the "Legion": once, when I was putting
              something out, they stopped,
both drunk that time, too, both reeking--it wasn't ten o'clock--and we
              chatted for a bit.
I don't know how they stay alive--on benefits most likely. I wonder if
              they're lovers? 
They don't look it. Right now, in fact, they look a wreck, careening hap-
              hazardly along,
contriving, as they reach beneath me, to dip a wheel from the curb so
              that the chair skewers, teeters,
tips, and they both tumble, the one slowly, almost gracefully sliding in
              stages from his seat,
his expression hardly marking it, the other staggering over him, spinning
              heavily down,
to lie on the asphalt, his mouth working, his feet shoving weakly and
              fruitlessly against the curb. 
In the storefront office on the corner, Reed and Son, Real Estate, have
              come to see the show.
Gazing through the golden letters of their name, they're not, at least,
              thank god, laughing.
Now the buddy, grabbing at a hydrant, gets himself erect and stands
              there for a moment, panting.
Now he has to lift the other, who lies utterly still, a forearm shielding his
              eyes from the sun.
He hauls him partly upright, then hefts him almost all the way into the
              chair, but a dangling foot
catches a support-plate, jerking everything around so that he has to put
              him down,
set the chair to rights, and hoist him again and as he does he jerks the
              grimy jeans right off him.
No drawers, shrunken, blotchy thighs: under the thick, white coils of
              belly blubber, 
he poor, blunt pud, tiny, terrified, retracted, is almost invisible in the
              sparse genital hair,
then his friend pulls his pants up, he slumps wholly back as though he
              were, at last, to be let be,
and the friend leans against the cyclone fence, suddenly staring up at me
              as though he'd known,
all along, that I was watching and I can't help wondering if he knows that
              in the winter, too,
I watched, the night he went out to the lot and walked, paced rather, 
              almost ran, for how many hours.
It was snowing, the city in that holy silence, the last we have, when the
              storm takes hold,
and he was making patterns that I thought at first were circles, then real-
              ized made a figure eight,
what must have been to him a perfect symmetry but which, from where
              I was, shivered, bent,
and lay on its side: a warped, unclear infinity, slowly, as the snow came
              faster, going out.
Over and over again, his head lowered to the task, he slogged the path
              he'd blazed,
but the race was lost, his prints were filling faster than he made them
              now and I looked away,
up across the skeletal trees to the tall center city buildings, some, though
              it was midnight,
with all their offices still gleaming, their scarlet warning beacons signal-
              ing erratically
against the thickening flakes, their smoldering auras softening portions of
              the dim, milky sky.
In the morning, nothing: every trace of him effaced, all the field pure
              white,
its surface glittering, the dawn, glancing from its glaze, oblique, relent-
              less, unadorned.







On the Move
 

The blue jay scuffling in the bushes follows
Some hidden purpose, and the gust of birds
That spurts across the field, the wheeling swallows,
Has nested in the trees and undergrowth.
Seeking their instinct, or their poise, or both,
One moves with an uncertain violence
Under the dust thrown by a baffled sense
Or the dull thunder of approximate words.

On motorcycles, up the road, they come:
Small, black, as flies hanging in heat, the Boys,
Until the distance throws them forth, their hum
Bulges to thunder held by calf and thigh.
In goggles, donned impersonality,
In gleaming jackets trophied with the dust,
They strap in doubt - by hiding it, robust -
And almost hear a meaning in their noise.

Exact conclusion of their hardiness
Has no shape yet, but from known whereabouts
They ride, direction where the tyres press.
They scare a flight of birds across the field:
Much that is natural, to the will must yield.
Men manufacture both machine and soul,
And use what they imperfectly control
To dare a future from the taken routes.

 It is a part solution, after all.
One is not necessarily discord
On earth; or damned because, half animal,
One lacks direct instinct, because one wakes
Afloat on movement that divides and breaks.
One joins the movement in a valueless world,
Choosing it, till, both hurler and the hurled,
One moves as well, always toward, toward.

A minute holds them, who have come to go:
The self-defined, astride the created will
They burst away; the towns they travel through
Are home for neither bird nor holiness,
For birds and saints complete their purposes.
At worst, one is in motion; and at best,
Reaching no absolute, in which to rest.
One is always nearer by not keeping still.





The Hug
 

It was your birthday, we had drunk and dined
    Half of the night with our old friend
        Who'd showed us in the end
    To a bed I reached in one drunk stride.
        Already I lay snug,
And drowsy with the wine dozed on one side.

I dozed, I slept. My sleep broke on a hug,
        Suddenly, from behind,
In which the full lengths of our bodies pressed:
         Your instep to my heel,
     My shoulder-blades against your chest.
     It was not sex, but I could feel
     The whole strength of your body set,
             Or braced, to mine,
         And locking me to you
     As if we were still twenty-two
     When our grand passion had not yet
         Become familial.
     My quick sleep had deleted all
     Of intervening time and place.
         I only knew
The stay of your secure firm dry embrace.





Duncan
 

1
When in his twenties a poetry's full strength
Burst into voice as an unstopping flood,
He let the divine prompting (come at length)
Rushingly bear him any way it would
And went on writing while the Ferry turned
From San Francisco, back from Berkeley too,
And back again, and back again. He learned
You add to, you don't cancel what you do.

Between the notebook-margins his pen travelled,
His own lines carrying him in a new mode
To ports in which past purposes unravelled.
So that, as on the Ferry Line he rode,
Whatever his first plans that night had been,
The energy that rose from their confusion
Became the changing passage lived within
While the pen wrote, and looked beyond conclusion.

2 
Forty years later, and both kidneys gone;
Every eight hours, home dialysis;
The habit of his restlessness stayed on
Exhausting him with his responsiveness.
After the circulations of one day
In which he taught a three-hour seminar
Then gave a reading clear across the Bay,
And while returning from it to the car

With plunging hovering tread tired and unsteady
Down Wheeler steps, he faltered and he fell 
--Fell he said later, as if I stood ready, 
"Into the strong arms of Thom Gunn."
                                                                        Well well,
The image comic, as I might have known, 
And generous, but it turned things round to myth:
He fell across the white steps there alone,
Though it was me indeed that he was with.

I hadn't caught him, hadn't seen in time,
And picked him up where he had softly dropped,
A pillow full of feathers. Was it a rime
He later sought, in which he might adopt
The role of H.D., broken-hipped and old,
Who, as she moved off from the reading-stand,
Had stumbled on the platform but was held
And steadied by another poet's hand?

He was now a posthumous poet, I have said 
(For since his illness he had not composed),
In sight of a conclusion, whose great dread
Was closure,
                       his life soon to be enclosed
Like the sparrow's flight above the feasting friends,
Briefly revealed where its breast caught their light,
Beneath the long roof, between open ends,
Themselves the margins of unchanging night.





In Trust
 

            You go from me
        In June for months on end
    To study equanimity
         Among high trees alone;
     I go out with a new boyfriend
And stay all summer in the city where
         Home mostly on my own
         I watch the sunflowers flare.

             You travel East
        To help your relatives.
   The rainy season's start, at least,
        Brings you from banishment:
    And from the hall a doorway gives
A glimpse of you, writing I don't know what,
         Through winter, with head bent
         In the lamp's yellow spot.

              To some fresh task
         Some improvising skill
     Your face is turned, of which I ask
         Nothing except the presence:
    Beneath white hair your clear eyes still
Are candid as the cat's fixed narrowing gaze
        --Its pale-biue incandescence
        In your room nowadays.

             Sociable cat:
         Without much noise or fuss
    We left the kitchen where he sat,
          And suddenly we find
     He happens still to be with us,
In this room now, though firmly faced away,
          Not to be left behind,
          Though all the night he'll stray.

              As you began
        You'll end the year with me.
   We'll hug each other while we can,
        Work or stray while we must.
    Nothing is, or will ever be,
Mine, I suppose. No one can hold a heart,
          But what we hold in trust
          We do hold, even apart.





Death of a Naturalist
 

All year the flax-dam festered in the heart
Of the townland; green and heavy headed
Flax had rotted there, weighted down by huge sods.
Daily it sweltered in the punishing sun.
Bubbles gargled delicately, bluebottles
Wove a strong gauze of sound around the smell.
There were dragonflies, spotted butterflies,
But best of all was the warm thick slobber
Of frogspawn that grew like clotted water
In the shade of the banks. Here, every spring
I would fill jampotfuls of the jellied
Specks to range on window sills at home,
On shelves at school, and wait and watch until
The fattening dots burst, into nimble
Swimming tadpoles. Miss Walls would tell us how
The daddy frog was called a bullfrog
And how he croaked and how the mammy frog
Laid hundreds of little eggs and this was
Frogspawn. You could tell the weather by frogs too
For they were yellow in the sun and brown
In rain.

    Then one hot day when fields were rank
With cowdung in the grass the angry frogs
Invaded the flax-dam; I ducked through hedges
To a coarse croaking that I had not heard
Before. The air was thick with a bass chorus.
Right down the dam gross bellied frogs were cocked
On sods; their loose necks pulsed like sails. Some hopped:
The slap and plop were obscene threats. Some sat
Poised like mud grenades, their blunt heads farting.
I sickened, turned, and ran. The great slime kings
Were gathered there for vengeance and I knew
That if I dipped my hand the spawn would clutch it.





Mid-Term Break
 

I sat all morning in the college sick bay
Counting bells knelling classes to a close.
At two o'clock our neighbours drove me home.

In the porch I met my father crying--
He had always taken funerals in his stride--
And Big Jim Evans saying it was a hard blow.

The baby cooed and laughed and rocked the pram
When I came in, and I was embarrassed
By old men standing up to shake my hand

And tell me they were 'sorry for my trouble'.
Whispers informed strangers I was the eldest,
Away at school, as my mother held my hand

In hers and coughed out angry tearless sighs.
At ten o'clock the ambulance arrived
With the corpse, stanched and bandaged by the nurses.

Next morning I went up into the room. Snowdrops
And candles soothed the bedside; I saw him
For the first time in six weeks. Paler now,

Wearing a poppy bruise on his left temple,
He lay in the four-foot box as in his cot.
No gaudy scars, the bumper knocked him clear.

A four-foot box, a foot for every year.





Clearances
 

In Memoriam M.K.H., 1911-1984
She taught me what her uncle once taught her:
How easily the biggest coal block split
If you got the grain and hammer angled right.

The sound of that relaxed alluring blow, 
Its co-opted and obliterated echo,
Taught me to hit, taught me to loosen,

Taught me between the hammer and the block
To face the music. Teach me now to listen,
To strike it rich behind the linear black.

                                             1
A cobble thrown a hundred years ago
Keeps coming at me, the first stone
Aimed at a great-grandmother's turncoat brow.
The pony jerks and the riot's on.
She's crouched low in the trap
Running the gauntlet that first Sunday
Down the brae to Mass at a panicked gallop.
He whips on through the town to cries of 'Lundy!'

Call her 'The Convert'. 'The Exogamous Bride'.
Anyhow, it is a genre piece
Inherited on my mother's side
And mine to dispose with now she's gone.
Instead of silver and Victorian lace,
The exonerating, exonerated stone.

                                             2
Polished linoleum shone there. Brass taps shone.
The china cups were very white and big--
An unchipped set with sugar bowl and jug.
The kettle whistled. Sandwich and tea scone
Were present and correct. In case it run,
The butter must be kept out of the sun.
And don't be dropping crumbs. Don't tilt your chair.
Don't reach. Don't point. Don't make noise when you stir.

It is Number 5, New Row, Land of the Dead,
Where grandfather is rising from his place
With spectacles pushed back on a clean bald head
To welcome a bewildered homing daughter
Before she even knocks. 'What's this? What's this?'
And they sit down in the shining room together.

                                              3
When all the others were away at Mass
I was all hers as we peeled potatoes.
They broke the silence, let fall one by one
Like solder weeping off the soldering iron:
Cold comforts set between us, things to share
Gleaming in a bucket of clean water.
And again let fall. Little pleasant splashes
From each other's work would bring us to our senses.

So while the parish priest at her bedside
Went hammer and tongs at the prayers for the dying
And some were responding and some crying
I remembered her head bent towards my head,
Her breath in mine, our fluent dipping knives--
Never closer the whole rest of our lives.

                                               4
Fear of affectation made her affect 
Inadequacy whenever it came to 
Pronouncing words 'beyond her'. Bertold Brek.
She'd manage something hampered and askew 
Every time, as if she might betray
The hampered and inadequate by too
Well-adjusted a vocabulary.
With more challenge than pride, she'd tell me, 'You
Know all them things.' So I governed my tongue
In front of her, a genuinely well-
Adjusted adequate betrayal
Of what I knew better. I'd naw and aye
And decently relapse into the wrong
Grammar which kept us allied and at bay.

                                                5
The cool that came off sheets just off the line
Made me think the damp must still be in them
But when I took my corners of the linen
And pulled against her, first straight down the hem
And then diagonally, then flapped and shook
The fabric like a sail in a cross-wind,
They made a dried-out undulating thwack.
So we'd stretch and fold and end up hand to hand
For a split second as if nothing had happened
For nothing had that had not always happened
Beforehand, day by day, just touch and go,
Coming close again by holding back
In moves where I was x and she was o
Inscribed in sheets she'd sewn from ripped-out flour sacks.

                                               6
In the first flush of the Easter holidays
The ceremonies during Holy Week
Were highpoints of our Sons and Lovers phase.
The midnight fire. The paschal candlestick.
Elbow to elbow, glad to be kneeling next
To each other up there near the front
Of the packed church, we would follow the text
And rubrics for the blessing of the font.
As the hind longs for the streams, so my soul. . .
Dippings. Towellings. The water breathed on.
The water mixed with chrism and with oil.
Cruet tinkle. Formal incensation
And the psalmist's outcry taken up with pride:
Day and night my tears have been my bread.

                                                7
In the last minutes he said more to her
Almost than in all their life together.
'You'll be in New Row on Monday night
And I'll come up for you and you'll be glad
When I walk in the door . . . Isn't that right?'
His head was bent down to her propped-up head.
She could not hear but we were overjoyed.
He called her good and girl. Then she was dead,
The searching for a pulsebeat was abandoned
And we all knew one thing by being there.
The space we stood around had been emptied
Into us to keep, it penetrated
Clearances that suddenly stood open.
High cries were felled and a pure change happened.

                                                8
I thought of walking round and round a space
Utterly empty, utterly a source
Where the decked chestnut tree had lost its place
In our front hedge above the wallflowers.
The white chips jumped and jumped and skited high.
I heard the hatchet's differentiated
Accurate cut, the crack, the sigh
And collapse of what luxuriated
Through the shocked tips and wreckage of it all.
Deep-planted and long gone, my coeval
Chestnut from a jam jar in a hole,
Its heft and hush become a bright nowhere,
A soul ramifying and forever
Silent, beyond silence listened for.





words under pressure bleed original sense
 

The trouble with paradise is you never want to be away from home.

I make what calls me out. 
All gone before you know it.

Words may drop passing color yet seeing you here now are born again, and again. 
Closing a word in the mouth feels the sound until the tongue can't stay still.

To unmask is to go silent.
Language makes no promise to communicate.

An articulated sound has it own dream in the ear.
Her presence in the room gives aroma to the syllables I voice.

Now she's ready to draw eros from foreign bodies.
It starts by focusing on the sounds beyond hearing, still felt.

By she I mean who speaking animate configures.
This is the time of alternative obscurities to see through.

Through thoroughly, as a word weighs.







The Grauballe Man
 

As if he had been poured
in tar, he lies
on a pillow of turf
and seems to weep

the black river of himself.
The grain of his wrists
is like bog oak,
the ball of his heel

like a basalt egg.
His instep has shrunk
cold as a swan's foot
or a wet swamp root.

His hips are the ridge
and purse of a mussel,
his spine an eel arrested
under a glisten of mud.

The head lifts,
the chin is a visor
raised above the vent
of his slashed throat

that has tanned and toughened.
The cured wound
opens inwards to a dark
elderberry place.

Who will say 'corpse'
to his vivid cast?
Who will say 'body'
to his opaque repose?

And his rusted hair,
a mat unlikely
as a foetus's.
I first saw his twisted face

in a photograph,
a head and shoulder
out of the peat,
bruised like a forceps baby,

but now he lies 
perfected in my memory,
down to the red horn
of his nails,

hung in the scales
with beauty and atrocity:
with the Dying Gaul
too strictly compassed

on his shield,
with the actual weight
of each hooded victim,
slashed and dumped.





from Squarings: Lightenings
 

         i
Shifting brilliancies. Then winter light
In a doorway, and on the stone doorstep
A beggar shivering in silhouette.

So the particular judgement might be set:
Bare wallstead and a cold hearth rained into--
Bright puddle where the soul-free cloud-life roams.

And after the commanded journey, what?
Nothing magnificent, nothing unknown.
A gazing out from far away, alone.

And it is not particular at all,
Just old truth dawning: there is no next-time-round.
Unroofed scope. Knowledge-freshening wind.

         ii
Roof it again. Batten down. Dig in.
Drink out of tin. Know the scullery cold,
A latch, a door-bar, forged tongs and a grate.

Touch the crossbeam, drive iron in a wall,
Hang a line to verify the plumb
From lintel, coping-stone and chimney-breast.

Relocate the bedrock in the threshold.
Take squarings from the recessed gable pane.
Make your study the unregarded floor.

Sink every impulse like a bolt. Secure
The bastion of sensation. Do not waver
Into language. Do not waver in it.

         iii
Squarings? In the game of marbles, squarings
Were all those anglings, aimings, feints and squints
You were allowed before you'd shoot, all those

Hunkerings, tensings, pressures of the thumb,
Test-outs and pull-backs, re-envisagings,
All the ways your arms kept hoping towards

Blind certainties that were going to prevail
Beyond the one-off moment of the pitch.
A million million accuracies passed

Between your muscles' outreach and that space
Marked with three round holes and a drawn line.
You squinted out from a skylight of the world.

         v
Three marble holes thumbed in the concrete road
Before the concrete hardened still remained
Three decades after the marble-player vanished

Into Australia. Three stops to play
The music of the arbitrary on.
Blow on them now and hear an undersong

Your levelled breath made once going over
The empty bottle. Improvise. Make free
Like old hay in its flimsy afterlife

High on a windblown hedge. Ocarina earth.
Three listening posts up on some hard-baked tier
Above the resonating amphorae.

         vi
Once, as a child, out in a field of sheep,
Thomas Hardy pretended to be dead
And lay down flat among their dainty shins.

In that sniffed-at, bleated-into, grassy space
He experimented with infinity.
His small cool brow was like an anvil waiting

For sky to make it sing the perfect pitch
Of his dumb being, and that stir he caused
In the fleece-hustle was the original

Of a ripple that would travel eighty years
Outward from there, to be the same ripple
Inside him at its last circumference.

         vii
(I misremembered. He went down on all fours,
Florence Emily says, crossing a ewe-leaze.
Hardy sought the creatures face to face,

Their witless eyes and liability
To panic made him feel less alone,
Made proleptic sorrow stand a moment

Over him, perfectly known and sure.
And then the flock's dismay went swimming on
Into the blinks and murmurs and deflections

He'd know at parties in renowned old age
When sometimes he imagined himself a ghost
And circulated with that new perspective.)

         viii
The annals say: when the monks of Clonmacnoise
Were all at prayers inside the oratory
A ship appeared above them in the air.

The anchor dragged along behind so deep
It hooked itself into the altar rails
And then, as the big hull rocked to a standstill,

A crewman shinned and grappled down the rope
And struggled to release it. But in vain.
'This man can't bear our life here and will drown,'

The abbot said, 'unless we help him.' So
They did, the freed ship sailed, and the man climbed back
Out of the marvellous as he had known it.

         ix 
A boat that did not rock or wobble once
Sat in long grass one Sunday afternoon
In nineteen forty-one or -two. The heat

Out on Lough Neagh and in where cattle stood
Jostling and skittering near the hedge
Grew redolent of the tweed skirt and tweed sleeve

I nursed on. I remember little treble
Timber-notes their smart heels struck from planks,
Me cradled in an elbow like a secret

Open now as the eye of heaven was then
Above three sisters talking, talking steady
In a boat the ground still falls and falls from under.

         x
Overhang of grass and seedling birch
On the quarry face. Rock-hob where you watched
All that cargoed brightness travelling

Above and beyond and sumptuously across
The water in its clear deep dangerous holes
On the quarry floor. Ultimate

Fathomableness, ultimate
Stony up-againstness: could you reconcile
What was diaphanous there with what was massive?

Were you equal to or were you opposite
To build-ups so promiscuous and weightless?
Shield your eyes, look up and face the music.

And lightening? One meaning of that
Beyond the usual sense of alleviation,
Illumination, and so on, is this:

A phenomenal instant when the spirit flares
With pure exhilaration before death--
The good thief in us harking to the promise!

So paint him on Christ's right hand, on a promontory
Scanning empty space, so body-racked he seems
Untranslatable into the bliss

Ached for at the moon-rim of his forehead,
By nail-craters on the dark side of his brain:
This day thou shall be with Me in Paradise.





makeup sculpts
 

I'm feeling by ear.

Consider them gods and not cruel but ecstatic.
They have trick tongues and can't talk straight but use us as waves to curve words.
In this moment we are here for their ride. Climb on under.
Transport poetics in the transtraditionals, revering rumors revved high.
We ask forgiveness for poem talk. I'm on her knees.

She makes me say these things because she is a middle way like no other.

The method is to wear me down to a base line vital pulse.
Next pour right through carefully following the barely perceptible impulse.
Almost dreams the state resists the name but go ahead and call it poetic that flares.
Poetics remains neutral on its name but takes care when it comes to hers.
There's a watch out on her names.

It makes me wait until I have nothing else to fight with and then sets me loose.

When I think what is being said I get a lump in the stomach.
No go on the intellectual gizmo.
Yes on any kind of lift, free run, no drift, too swift, the actual thing getting a lift.
It hits the beat like rock bottom.
The tongue gets hands on quick.

The hearback suddenly gets high in the sense of crossing right on over.





Being Partial
 

I was a man
and I was trying to save a woman in danger.

I picked her up in my arms
and flew.

Flying like a frog swimming in air
I ditched our nameless pursuer

and landed. There was a guy
waiting for us

who looked
like a king.

Caught.
Now I have to accept the punishment

for saving the woman.
First,

we have to take a shower.
The effect is to loosen
 
the skin from the muscle
until it peels off.

The woman
picks up the pieces of my skin and

holds them in her hands
and says: I will love each of these

as I loved you.
And I thought: This is what is called
 
Fetish. And suddenly it came to me that the origin
of the word is fe- as in female, soft, loving, silken --

plus -tissue. Like tissues flying.
Voicing particles waking in waves

over a living body
of water

loose at last





Little Exercise
 

for Thomas Edwards Wanning
Think of the storm roaming the sky uneasily 
like a dog looking for a place to sleep in, 
listen to it growling.

Think how they must look now, the mangrove keys
lying out there unresponsive to the lightning
in dark, coarse-fibred families,

where occasionally a heron may undo his head,
shake up his feathers, make an uncertain comment
when the surrounding water shines.

Think of the boulevard and the little palm trees
all stuck in rows, suddenly revealed
as fistfuls of limp fish-skeletons.

It is raining there. The boulevard
and its broken sidewalks with weeds in every crack
are relieved to be wet, the sea to be freshened.

Now the storm goes away again in a series
of small, badly lit battle-scenes,
each in "Another part of the field."

Think of someone sleeping in the bottom of a row-boat
tied to a mangrove root or the pile of a bridge;
think of him as uninjured, barely disturbed.





Chanson Philosophique
 

The nominalist in me invents 
A life devoid of precedents.
The realist takes a different view: 
He claims that all I feel and do 
Billions of others felt and did 
In history's Pre-me period.

Arguing thus, both voices speak 
A partial truth. I am unique, 
Yet the unceasing self-distress 
Of desire buffets me no less 
Than it has other sons of man
Who've come and gone since time began.

The meaning, then, of this dispute? 
My life's a nominal/real pursuit,
Which leaves identity clear and blurred, 
In which what happens has occurred 
Often and never--which is to say, 
Never to me, or quite this way.





The Armadillo
 

for Robert Lowell
This is the time of year
when almost every night
the frail, illegal fire balloons appear.
Climbing the mountain height,

rising toward a saint
still honored in these parts,
the paper chambers flush and fill with light
that comes and goes, like hearts.

Once up against the sky it's hard
to tell them from the stars--
planets, that is--the tinted ones:
Venus going down, or Mars,

or the pale green one. With a wind,
they flare and falter, wobble and toss;
but if it's still they steer between
the kite sticks of the Southern Cross,

receding, dwindling, solemnly
and steadily forsaking us,
or, in the downdraft from a peak,
suddenly turning dangerous.

Last night another big one fell.
It splattered like an egg of fire
against the cliff behind the house.
The flame ran down. We saw the pair

of owls who nest there flying up
and up, their whirling black-and-white
stained bright pink underneath, until
they shrieked up out of sight.

The ancient owls' nest must have burned.
Hastily, all alone,
a glistening armadillo left the scene,
rose-flecked, head down, tail down,

and then a baby rabbit jumped out,
short-eared, to our surprise.
So soft!--a handful of intangible ash
with fixed, ignited eyes.

Too pretty, dreamlike mimicry!
O falling fire and piercing cry 
and panic, and a weak mailed fist
clenched ignorant against the sky!





The Song of the Demented Priest
 

I put those things there.--See them burn.
The emerald the azure and the gold
Hiss and crack, the blues & greens of the world
As if I were tired. Someone interferes
Everywhere with me. The clouds, the clouds are torn
In ways I do not understand or love.

Licking my long lips, I looked upon God
And he flamed and he was friendlier
Than you were, and he was small. Showing me
Serpents and thin flowers; these were cold.
Dominion waved & glittered like the flare
From ice under a small sun. I wonder.

Afterward the violent and formal dancers
Came out, shaking their pithless heads.
I would instruct them but I cannot now,--
Because of the elements. They rise and move,
I nod a dance and they dance in the rain
In my red coat. I am the king of the dead.





Not to Live
 

(Jamestown 1957)
It kissed us, soft, to cut our throats, this coast,
like a malice of the lazy King. I hunt,
& hunt! but find here what to kill?--nothing is blunt,
but phantoming uneases I find. Ghost
on ghost precedes of all most scared us, most
we fled. Howls fail upon this secret, far air: grunt,
shaming for food; you must. I love the King
& it was not I who strangled at the toast
but a flux of a free & dying adjutant:
God be with him. He & God be with us all,
for we are not to live, I cannot wring,
like laundry, blue my soul--indecisive thing . .
From undergrowth & over odd birds call
and who would starv'd so survive? God save the King.





White Spine
 

Liar, I thought, kneeling with the others,
 how can He love me and hate what I am?
 The dome of St. Peter's shone yellowish
 gold, like butter and eggs. My God, I prayed
 anyhow, as if made in the image
 and likeness of Him. Nearby, a handsome
 priest looked at me like a stone; I looked back,
 not desiring to go it alone.
 The college of cardinals wore punitive red.
 The white spine waved to me from his white throne.
 Being in a place not my own, much less
 myself, I climbed out, a beast in a crib.
 Somewhere a terrorist rolled a cigarette.
 Reason, not faith, would change him.





The Ball Poem
 

What is the boy now, who has lost his ball.
What, what is he to do? I saw it go
Merrily bouncing, down the street, and then
Merrily over--there it is in the water!
No use to say 'O there are other balls':
An ultimate shaking grief fixes the boy
As he stands rigid, trembling, staring down
All his young days into the harbour where
His ball went. I would not intrude on him,
A dime, another ball, is worthless. Now
He senses first responsibility
In a world of possessions. People will take balls,
Balls will be lost always, little boy,
And no one buys a ball back. Money is external.
He is learning, well behind his desperate eyes,
The epistemology of loss, how to stand up
Knowing what every man must one day know
And most know many days, how to stand up
And gradually light returns to the street,
A whistle blows, the ball is out of sight.
Soon part of me will explore the deep and dark
Floor of the harbour . . I am everywhere,
I suffer and move, my mind and my heart move
With all that move me, under the water
Or whistling, I am not a little boy.





Dream Song 76 (Henry's Confession)
 

Nothin very bad happen to me lately.
How you explain that? --I explain that, Mr Bones,
terms o' your bafflin odd sobriety.
Sober as man can get, no girls, no telephones,
what could happen bad to Mr Bones?
--If life is a handkerchief sandwich,

in a modesty of death I join my father
who dared so long agone leave me.
A bullet on a concrete stoop
close by a smothering southern sea 
spreadeagled on an island, by my knee.
--You is from hunger, Mr Bones,

I offers you this handkerchief, now set 
your left foot by my right foot,
shoulder to shoulder, all that jazz,
arm in arm, by the beautiful sea
hum a little, Mr Bones.
--I saw nobody coming, so I went instead.





Sonnet 13
 

I lift--lift you five States away your glass,
Wide of this bar you never graced, where none
Ever I know came, where what work is done
Even by these men I know not, where a brass
Police-car sign peers in, wet strange cars pass,
Soiled hangs the rag of day out over this town,
A juke-box brains air where I drink alone,
The spruce barkeep sports a toupee alas--

My glass I lift at six o'clock, my darling,
As you plotted . . Chinese couples shift in bed,
We shared today not even filthy weather,
Beasts in the hills their tigerish love are snarling,
Suddenly they clash, I blow my short ash red,
Grey eyes light! and we have our drink together.





Don't Allow the Lucid Moment to Dissolve
 

Don't allow the lucid moment to dissolve
Let the radiant thought last in stillness
though the page is almost filled and the flame flickers
We haven't risen yet to the level of ourselves
Knowledge grows slowly like a wisdom tooth
The stature of a man is still notched
high up on a white door
From far off, the joyful voice of a trumpet
and of a song rolled up like a cat
What passes doesn't fall into a void
A stoker is still feeding coal into the fire
Don't allow the lucid moment to dissolve
On a hard dry substance
you have to engrave the truth







Mysticism for Beginners
 

The day was mild, the light was generous.
The German on the caf terrace
held a small book on his lap.
I caught sight of the title:
Mysticism for Beginners.
Suddenly I understood that the swallows
patrolling the streets of Montepulciano
with their shrill whistles,
and the hushed talk of timid travelers
from Eastern, so-called Central Europe,
and the white herons standing--yesterday? the day before?--
like nuns in fields of rice,
and the dusk, slow and systematic,
erasing the outlines of medieval houses,
and olive trees on little hills,
abandoned to the wind and heat,
and the head of the Unknown Princess
that I saw and admired in the Louvre,
and stained-glass windows like butterfly wings
sprinkled with pollen,
and the little nightingale practicing
its speech beside the highway,
and any journey, any kind of trip,
are only mysticism for beginners,
the elementary course, prelude
to a test that's been
postponed.







Impossible Friendships
 

For example, with someone who no longer is,
who exists only in yellowed letters.

Or long walks beside a stream,
whose depths hold hidden

porcelain cups--and the talks about philosophy
with a timid student or the postman.

A passerby with proud eyes
whom you'll never know.

Friendship with this world, ever more perfect
(if not for the salty smell of blood).

The old man sipping coffee
in St.-Lazare, who reminds you of someone.

Faces flashing by
in local trains--

the happy faces of travelers headed perhaps
for a splendid ball, or a beheading.

And friendship with yourself
--since after all you don't know who you are.





Reading Milosz
 

I read your poetry once more,
poems written by a rich man, knowing all,
and by a beggar, homeless,
an emigrant, alone.

You always wanted to go
beyond poetry, above it, soaring,
but also lower, to where our region
begins, modest and timid.

Sometimes your tone
transforms us for a moment,
we believe--truly-- 
that every day is sacred,

that poetry--how to put it? --
makes life rounder,
fuller, prouder, unashamed
of perfect formulation.

But evening arrives,
I lay my book aside,
and the city's ordinary din resumes--
somebody coughs, someone cries and curses.





En Route
 

1.  without baggage

    To travel without baggage, sleep in the train
    on a hard wooden bench,
    forget your native land,
    emerge from small stations
    when a gray sky rises
    and fishing boats head to sea.


2.  in belgium

    It was drizzling in Belgium
    and the river wound between hills.
    I thought, I'm so imperfect.
    The trees sat in the meadows
    like priests in green cassocks.
    October was hiding in the weeds.
    No, ma'am, I said,
    this is the nontalking compartment.


3.  a hawk circles above the highway

     It will be disappointed if it swoops down
    on sheet iron, on gas,
     on a tape of tawdry music,
    on our narrow hearts.


4.  mont blanc

    It shines from afar, white and cautious,
    like a lantern for shadows.


5.  segesta

    On the meadow a vast temple--
    a wild animal
    open to the sky.


6.  summer

    Summer was gigantic, triumphant--
    and our little car looked lost
    on the road going to Verdun.


7.  the station in bytom

    In the underground tunnel
    cigarette butts grow,
    not daisies.
    It stinks of loneliness.


8.  retired people on a field trip

    They're learning to walk
    on land.


9.  gulls

    Eternity doesn't travel,
    eternity waits.
    In a fishing port
    only the gulls are chatty.


10.  the theater in taormina

    From the theater in Taormina you spot
    the snow on Etna's peak 
    and the gleaming sea.
    Which is the better actor?


11.  a black cat

    A black cat comes out to greet us
    as if to say, look at me
    and not some old Romanesque church.
    I'm alive.


12.  a romanesque church

    At the bottom of the valley
    a Romanesque church at rest:
    there's wine in this cask.


13.  light

    Light on the walls of old houses,
    June.
    Passerby, open your eyes.


14.  at dawn

    The world's materiality at dawn--
    and the soul's frailty.





Try to Praise the Mutilated World
 

Try to praise the mutilated world.
Remember June's long days,
and wild strawberries, drops of ros wine.
The nettles that methodically overgrow
the abandoned homesteads of exiles.
You must praise the mutilated world.
You watched the stylish yachts and ships;
one of them had a long trip ahead of it,
while salty oblivion awaited others.
You've seen the refugees going nowhere,
you've heard the executioners sing joyfully.
You should praise the mutilated world.
Remember the moments when we were together
in a white room and the curtain fluttered.
Return in thought to the concert where music flared.
You gathered acorns in the park in autumn
and leaves eddied over the earth's scars.
Praise the mutilated world
and the gray feather a thrush lost,
and the gentle light that strays and vanishes
and returns.







The Heavenly Feast
 

Simone Weil, 1909-1943
Only the stones at first
Seem to have a part in this,
And the little height of the grass
As it gains a fraction-inch

By gripping the shallow soil
With all the shocking might
Of hunger and of thirst,
As if the soil itself

Were all that's left on earth.
I think the grass alone
Can hold within its grasp
What matters to it most,

And still it looks bereft,
And famished as the stones.
I watch a stream of moths
Proceeding on their ways,

They carve out tortuous paths
As if they were intent
On entering unseen
And ever-smaller doors.

So four years into the war,
And cut off from the ones
Whose circumstance you felt
And suffering as yours,

You carved yourself a path
Through ever-narrowing doors
Of hunger and of thirst,
And entered them day by day,

Refusing all at first
But that ration of food
Your people could obtain
Behind the lines in France,

And then refusing that,
From summer into fall
You cut your ration back
To send your part to them,

Your part diminishing
To rations cut in half
And cut in half again,
And then nothing at all

But water at the last
Sipped for the nurse's sake,
You finally lacked the strength
Even to lift your hands:

Father, I cannot stand
To think of them and eat.
Send it to them, it is theirs.
Send this food for them,

For my people still in France.
And turned your face away,
As famished as the grass.
Only the stones at first

Seem to have a part in this,
And the little height of the grass
As it gains a fraction-inch.
But hidden in the grass

As if the grass itself
Were giving out a cry,
I overhear the finch
Begin her native rhyme

And toil to paraphrase
Her version of your words.
It seems she tries and tries
Until the words come clear,

It is theirs, she seems to say,
Or that is what I hear,
And again: It is theirs, it is theirs.
And the plover joins in praise

With her fluttering, murmured prayers:
Send it to them, it is theirs.
And the blackbirds breaking wide
Take it up in their dialects

To sing you in their way,
I swear I can hear the words,
Send it to them, they say,
Send it to them, it is theirs,

Then all the birds of the air
Give thanks above your grave, 
As if they were your cause
And those you meant to save,

As if the birds were there
In attendance at the end,
And, seeing the sacrifice
Had borne your body up,

So wasted as it was,
To your chair in Paradise,
And saw, before they fled,
Your first breathtaking act

Before the heavenly feast,
The bread set at your place:
To refuse to eat till none
On earth has less than you,

Though God in pity take
Your hands and lift them toward
His table for your sake.
Father, they have no food,

Send it to them, it is theirs.
And the birds returning here
Give tongue to what they've heard,
They tell the grass and stones

And the stream of moths who carve
Their tortuous paths in the air.
But how in giving thanks
Can we calculate the worth

Of one who chose to starve?
You held within your grasp
Our hunger and our thirst.
And the little height of the grass

As it gains a fraction-inch
Seems to have a part in this.
It grips with a shocking might
What matters to the last,

As if the soil itself
Were all that's left on earth,
And all the earth were held
Within its famished grasp.





Advent Calendar
 

Bethlehem in Germany,
Glitter on the sloping roofs,
Breadcrumbs on the windowsills,
Candles in the Christmas trees,
Hearths with pairs of empty shoes:
Panels of Nativity
Open paper scenes where doors
Open into other scenes,
Some recounted, some foretold.
Blizzard-sprinkled flakes of gold
Gleam from small interiors,
Picture-boxes in the stars
Open up like cupboard doors
In a cabinet Jesus built.

Southern German villagers,
Peasants in the mica frost,
See the comet streaming down,
Heavenly faces, each alone,
Faces lifted, startled, lost,
As if lightning lit the town.

Sitting in an upstairs window
Patiently the village scholar
Raises his nearsighted face,
Interrupted by the star.
Left and right his hands lie stricken
Useless on his heavy book.
When I lift the paper door
In the ceiling of his study
One canary-angel glimmers,
Flitting in the candelabra,
Peers and quizzes him: Rabbi,
What are the spheres surmounted by?
But his lips are motionless.
Child, what are you asking for?
Look, he gazes past the roofs,
Gazes where the bitter North,
Stretched across the empty place,
Opens door by door by door.

This is childhood's shrunken door.
When I touch the glittering crumbs,
When I cry to be admitted,
No one answers, no one comes.

And the tailor's needle flashes
In midair with thread pulled tight,
Stitching a baptismal gown.
But the gown, the seventh door,
Turns up an interior
Hidden from the tailor's eyes:
Baby presents like the boxes
Angels hold on streets and stairways,
Wooden soldier, wooden sword,
Chocolate coins in crinkled gold,
Hints of something bought and sold,
Hints of murder in the stars.
Baby's gown is sown with glitter
Spread across the tailor's lap.
Up above his painted ceiling
Baby mouse's skeleton
Crumbles in the mouse's trap.

Leaning from the cliff of heaven,
Indicating whom he weeps for,
Joseph lifts his lamp above
The infant like a candle-crown.
Let my fingers touch the silence
Where the infant's father cries.
Give me entrance to the village
From my childhood where the doorways
Open pictures in the skies.
But when all the doors are open,
No one sees that I've returned.
When I cry to be admitted,
No one answers, no one comes.
Clinging to my fingers only
Pain, like glitter bits adhering,
When I touch the shining crumbs.





In Memory of Joe Brainard
 

the remnant of a vast, oceanic
bruise (wound delivered early and long ago)

was in you purity and 
sweetness self-gathered, CHOSEN

                                 

When I tried to find words for the moral sense that unifies
and sweetens the country voices in your collage The Friendly Way,

you said It's a code.

You were a code
I yearned to decipher.--

In the end, the plague that full swift runs by
took you, broke you;--

                                          in the end, could not
                                           take you, did not break you--

you had somehow erased within you not only
meanness, but anger, the desire to punish
the universe for everything

not achieved, not tasted, seen again, touched--;

. . . the undecipherable
code unbroken even as the soul

learns once again the body it loves and hates is
made of earth, and will betray it.








Amour 30: "Three sorts of serpents do resemble thee
 

Three sorts of serpents do resemble thee: 
 That dangerous eye-killing cockatrice, 
 The enchanting siren, which doth so entice, 
 The weeping crocodile--these vile pernicious three. 
 The basilisk his nature takes from thee, 
 Who for my life in secret wait dost lie, 
 And to my heart sendst poison from thine eye: 
 Thus do I feel the pain, the cause, yet cannot see. 
 Fair-maid no more, but Mer-maid be thy name, 
 Who with thy sweet alluring harmony 
 Hast played the thief, and stolen my heart from me, 
 And like a tyrant makst my grief thy game: 
   Thou crocodile, who when thou hast me slain, 
   Lamentst my death, with tears of thy disdain.





Delia 47:Read in my face a volume of despairs
 

Read in my face a volume of despairs,
The wailing Iliads of my tragic woe,
Drawn with my blood and printed with my cares
Wrought by her hand, that I have honor'd so.
Who, whilst I burn, she sings at my soul's wrack,
Looking aloft from turret of her pride;
There my soul's tyrant joys her in the sack
Of her own seat, whereof I made her guide.
There do these smokes that from affliction rise,
Serve as an incense to a cruel Dame;
A sacrifice thrice grateful to her eyes,
Because their power serve to exact the same.
***Thus ruins she, to satisfy her will,
***The Temple where her name was honor'd still.





Bitch
 

Now, when he and I meet, after all these years, 
I say to the bitch inside me, don't start growling.   
He isn't a trespasser anymore, 
Just an old acquaintance tipping his hat. 
My voice says, "Nice to see you, 
As the bitch starts to bark hysterically. 
He isn't an enemy now, 
Where are your manners, I say, as I say, 
"How are the children? They must be growing up.   
At a kind word from him, a look like the old days,   
The bitch changes her tone; she begins to whimper.   
She wants to snuggle up to him, to cringe. 
Down, girl! Keep your distance 
Or I'll give you a taste of the choke-chain. 
"Fine, I'm just fine, I tell him. 
She slobbers and grovels. 
After all, I am her mistress. She is basically loyal.   
It's just that she remembers how she came running   
Each evening, when she heard his step; 
How she lay at his feet and looked up adoringly   
Though he was absorbed in his paper; 
Or, bored with her devotion, ordered her to the kitchen   
Until he was ready to play. 
But the small careless kindnesses 
When he'd had a good day, or a couple of drinks, 
Come back to her now, seem more important 
Than the casual cruelties, the ultimate dismissal. 
"It's nice to know you are doing so well, I say. 
He couldn't have taken you with him; 
You were too demonstrative, too clumsy, 
Not like the well-groomed pets of his new friends.   
"Give my regards to your wife, I say. You gag 
As I drag you off by the scruff, 
Saying, "Goodbye! Goodbye! Nice to have seen you again.





Poor Angels
 

At this hour the soul floats weightlessly 
through the city streets, speechless and invisible, 
astonished by the smoky blend of grays and golds 
seeping out of the air, the dark half-tones 

of dusk suddenly filling the urban sky 
while the body sits listlessly by the window 
sullen and heavy, too exhausted to move, 
too weary to stand up or to lie down. 

At this hour the soul is like a yellow wing 
slipping through the treetops, a little ecstatic 
cloud hovering over the sidewalks, calling out 
to the approaching night, "Amaze me, amaze me, 

while the body sits glumly by the window 
listening to the clear summons of the dead 
transparent as glass, clairvoyant as crystal. 
Some nights it is almost ready to join them. 

Oh, this is a strange, unlikely tethering, 
a furious grafting of the quick and the slow: 
when the soul flies up, the body sinks down 
and all night--locked in the same cramped room-- 

they go on quarreling, stubbornly threatening 
to leave each other, wordlessly filling the air 
with the sound of a low internal burning. 
How long can this bewildering marriage last? 

At midnight the soul dreams of a small fire 
of stars flaming on the other side of the sky, 
but the body stares into an empty night sheen, 
a hollow-eyed darkness. Poor luckless angels, 

feverish old loves: don't separate yet. 
Let what rises live with what descends.





Larkinesque
 

Reading in the paper a summary 
of a five-year psychological study 
that shows those perceived as most beautiful   
are treated differently, 

I think they could have just asked me, 
remembering a kind of pudgy kid   
and late puberty, the bloody noses   
and wisecracks because I wore glasses, 

though we all know by now how awful it is   
for the busty starlet no one takes seriously,   
the loveliest women I've lunched with   
lamenting the opacity of the body, 

they can never trust a man's interest   
even when he seems not just out for sex   
(eyes focus on me above rim of wineglass),   
and who would want to live like this? 

And what does beauty do to a man?-- 
Don Juan, Casanova, Lord Byron-- 
those fiery eyes and steel jawlines   
can front a furnace of self-loathing, 

all those breathless women rushing to him   
while hubby's at the office or ball game,   
primed to be consumed by his beauty   
while he stands next to it, watching. 

So maybe the looks we're dealt are best.   
It's only common sense that happiness   
depends on some bearable deprivation   
or defect, and who knows what conflicts 

great beauty could have caused, 
what cruelties one might have suffered 
from those now friends, what unmanageable   
possibilities smiling at every small turn? 

So if I get up to draw a tumbler 
of ordinary tap water and think what if this were   
nectar dripping from delicious burning fingers,   
will all I've missed knock me senseless? 

No. Of course not. It won't.





Son of Fog
 

When the fog burns off and the air's pulverized   
diamonds and you can see beyond the islands   
of forever!--far too dramatic for me. It hurts   
something behind my eyes near the sphenoid,   
not good. I prefer fog with fog behind it,   
uninflammable fog. Then there's no competition   
for brightness, no Byron for your Shelley,   
no Juno eclisping your Athena, no big bridge   
statement about bringing unity to landmasses.   
All the thought balloons are blank. The marching   
band can't practice, even a bird's got to get   
within five feet before it can start an argument.   
Like dead flies on the sill of an abandoned   
nursery, we too are seeds in the rattle   
of mortality. A foglike baby god   
picks it up, shakes it, laughs insanely   
then goes back to playing with her feet.   
I have felt awful cold and lonely and fog   
has been blotting paper to my tears.   
My dog is fog and I don't have to scoop   
its poop with my hand in a plastic bag.   
There are sensations that begin in the world,   
the mind responding with ideas but then   
those ideas cause other sensations.   
What a mess. We stand at the edge   
of a drop that doesn't answer back,   
fog our only friend although it's hell   
on shrimpboats. There, there, says the fog.   
Where, where? You can't see a thing.





Man Dancing with a Baby
 

Before balance, before counting, before   
The record glistens and the needle slides,   
Grating, into the overture, there is the end   
Of weight, the leaning into nothing and then 

A caught breath, the record listens, the needle slides   
Over slowly, and all at once around us a woman's voice   
Stretches weightless, leaning into nothing. 
Like a clothesline, the taut chorus: oh, hilarious 

Oh baby, all around us, over slowly, a woman's voice   
Gathers above the pick me up, pick me up 
And the desperate put, put me down. First the tightrope,   
Then the light foot, and the taunting chorus 

Pick me up, pick me up. Oh, oh baby. 
The slippery floor shimmers and spins like a record while   
The light is swinging footloose on its rope 
Out of time. The shadows 

Slip, shimmering black, and spin across the floor, 
Then turn back and pick up again. Oh seedpod stuck for just   
One moment on the cattail, out of time, out of shadows,   
Downy cheek against a beard: oh scratches 

On the record, oh baby, oh measure   
Oh strange balance that grips us   
On this side of the world.





The Jungle Caf
 

We could wipe away a fly,
Drink, and order that yellow 
Thing behind the glass, peach 
Or sweet bread. Sunlight
Is catching on a fork,
Toothy wink from a star.
The fan is busy, the waiter is busy, 
And today, in this caf
Of two dollars and fifty
Cents, we're so important 
Dogs are shaking our hands. 
Welcome, turistas, they say, 
Or might say if they could 
Roll their Rs. Where we sit 
It's three o'clock, and
Across the room, where
Old men are playing dominos 
It's maybe later, it's maybe 
Peru under their hats.
There are toads in this place
--sullen guards by the door--
And the bartender is just another 
Uncle fooling with the radio. 
A little to the left,
I shout, and he dials left, 
Then right, until it's German 
Polkas, accordions by the sea. 
The toads move a little. 
An old man clicks a domino. 
Omar, my gypsy friend, puts in--
Love is chasing me up my sleeve.
I salute him, he salutes me, 
And together we're so drunk 
We're making sense. Little 
By little, with rum the color
Of a woman's arm, we're seeing things--
Of a dancer, no two,
Make that three with one chair. 
And that man--the old one 
Over there--is so blurry 
He thinks he's flying.





The Desk
 

Under the fire escape, crouched, one knee in cinders,   
I pulled the ball-peen hammer from my belt,   
cracked a square of window pane, 
the gummed latch, and swung the window, 
crawled through that stone hole into the boiler room   
of Canton Elementary School, once Canton High,   
where my father served three extra years   
as star halfback and sprinter. 
Behind a flashlight's 
cane of light, I climbed a staircase almost a ladder 
and found a door. On the second nudge of my shoulder, 
it broke into a hallway dark as history, 
at whose end lay the classroom I had studied   
over and over in the deep obsession of memory. 

I swept that room with my light--an empty blackboard, 
a metal table, a half-globe lying on the floor   
like a punctured basketball--then followed   
that beam across the rows of desks, 
the various catalogs of lovers, the lists 
of all those who would and would not do what,   
until it stopped on the corner desk of the back row,   
and I saw again, after many years the name 
of my father, my name, carved deep into the oak top. 

To gauge the depth I ran my finger across that scar,   
and wondered at the dreams he must have lived   
as his eyes ran back and forth 
from the cinder yard below the window 
to the empty practice field 
to the blade of his pocket knife etching carefully   
the long, angular lines of his name, 
the dreams he must have laid out one behind another   
like yard lines, in the dull, pre-practice afternoons   
of geography and civics, before he ever dreamed 
of Savo Sound or Guadalcanal. 
                                             In honor of dreams 
I sank to my knees on the smooth, oiled floor,   
and stood my flashlight on its end. 
Half the yellow circle lit the underedge of the desk,   
the other threw a half-moon on the ceiling,   
and in that split light I tapped the hammer 
easy up the overhang of the desk top. Nothing gave   
but the walls' sharp echo, so I swung again,   
and again harder, and harder still in half anger   
rising to anger at the stubborn joint, losing all fear   
of my first crime against the city, the county,   
the state, whatever government claimed dominion,   
until I had hammered up in the ringing dark   
a salvo of crossfire, and on a frantic recoil glanced   
the flashlight, the classroom spinning black   
as a coma. 
               I've often pictured the face of the teacher   
whose student first pointed to that topless desk,   
the shock of a slow hand rising from the back row,   
their eyes meeting over the question of absence. 
I've wondered too if some low authority of the system   
discovered that shattered window, 
and finding no typewriters, no business machines,   
no audiovisual gear missing, failed to account for it,   
so let it pass as minor vandalism. 
                                                               I've heard nothing. 
And rarely do I fret when I see that oak scar leaning   
against my basement wall, though I wonder what it means   
to own my father's name.





Flight
 

In the early stages of epilepsy there occurs a characteristic dream .... One is  somehow lifted free of one's own body;  looking back one sees oneself and feels a  sudden, maddening fear; another presence is  entering one's own person, and there is no  avenue of return. --George Steiner
Outside my window the wasps   
are making their slow circle,   
dizzy flights of forage and return,   
hovering among azaleas 
that bob in a sluggish breeze   
this humid, sun-torn morning. 

Yesterday my wife held me here 
as I thrashed and moaned, her hand   
in my foaming mouth, and my son   
saw what he was warned he might. 

Last night dreams stormed my brain   
in thick swirls of shame and fear. 
Behind a white garage a locked shed   
full of wide-eyed dolls burned, 
yellow smoke boiling up in huge clumps   
as I watched, feet nailed to the ground.   
In dining cars white table cloths 
unfolded wings and flew like gulls.   
An old German in a green Homburg   
sang lieder, Mein Herz ist mde. 
In a garden in Pasadena my father   
posed in Navy whites while overhead 
silver dirigibles moved like great whales.   
And in the narrowing tunnel   
of the dream's end I flew down   
onto the iron red road 
of my grandfather's farm. 
There was a white rail fence. 
In the green meadow beyond,   
a small boy walked toward me.   
His smile was the moon's rim.   
Across his egg-shell eyes 
ran scenes from my future life,   
and he embraced me like a son   
or father or my lost brother. 







The Fisherman
 

Although I can see him still-- 
The freckled man who goes 
To a gray place on a hill 
In gray Connemara clothes 
At dawn to cast his flies-- 
It's long since I began 
To call up to the eyes 
This wise and simple man.   
All day I'd looked in the face   
What I had hoped it would be   
To write for my own race   
And the reality:   
The living men that I hate,   
The dead man that I loved,   
The craven man in his seat,   
The insolent unreproved-- 
And no knave brought to book   
Who has won a drunken cheer-- 
The witty man and his joke   
Aimed at the commonest ear,   
The clever man who cries   
The catch cries of the clown,   
The beating down of the wise   
And great Art beaten down. 

Maybe a twelve-month since 
Suddenly I began, 
In scorn of this audience, 
Imagining a man, 
And his sun-freckled face 
And gray Connemara cloth, 
Climbing up to a place 
Where stone is dark with froth, 
And the down turn of his wrist 
When the flies drop in the stream-- 
A man who does not exist,   
A man who is but a dream;   
And cried, "Before I am old   
I shall have written him one   
Poem maybe as cold   
And passionate as the dawn.





Athena
 

Force of reason, who shut up the shrill
foul Furies in the dungeon of the Parthenon,
led whimpering to the cave they live in still,

beneath the rock your city foundered on:
who, equivocating, taught revenge to sing
(or seem to, or be about to) a kindlier tune:

mind that can make a scheme of anything--
a game, a grid, a system, a mere folder
in the universal file drawer: uncompromising

mediatrix, virgin married to the welfare
of the body politic: deific contradiction,
warbonnet-wearing olive-bearer, author

of the law's delays, you who as talisman
and totem still wear the aegis, baleful
with Medusa's scowl (though shrunken

and self-mummified, a Gorgon still): cool
guarantor of the averted look, the guide
of Perseus, who killed and could not kill

the thing he'd hounded to its source, the dread
thing-in-itself none can elude, whose counter-
feit we halfway hanker for: aware (gone mad

with clarity) we have invented all you stand for,
though we despise the artifice--a space to savor
horror, to pre-enact our own undoing in--
living, we stare into the mirror of the Gorgon.





Fierce Girl Playing Hopscotch
 

You sway like a crane to the tunes of tossed stones. 
I am what you made to live in 
from what you had: hair matted as kelp, bad schools. 

Oh, you will never know me. I wave and you go 
on playing in the clouds 
boys clap from erasers. I am the pebble 
you tossed on the chalked space and war- 
danced toward, one-leg two-leg, arms treading air. 

In this, your future, waves rechristen the sea 
after its tiny jeweled lives 
that hiss "Us Us to the shore all day. 
Where's the kid called Kateydid? the moonfaced 
Kewpiedoll? The excitable pouting 
Zookie? The somber O-Be-Joyful? 

Lost girl, playing hopscotch, I will do what you could. 
Name of father, son, ghost. Cross my heart and hope. 
While the sea's jewels build shells and shells 
change to chalk and chalk to loam and gold 
wheat grows where oceans teetered.





Trouble with Math in a One-Room Country School
 

The others bent their heads and started in.
Confused, I asked my neighbor
to explain--a sturdy, bright-cheeked girl
who brought raw milk to school from her family's
herd of Holsteins. Ann had a blue bookmark,
and on it Christ revealed his beating heart,
holding the flesh back with His wounded hand.
Ann understood division. . . .

Miss Moran sprang from her monumental desk
and led me roughly through the class
without a word. My shame was radical
as she propelled me past the cloakroom
to the furnace closet, where only the boys
were put, only the older ones at that.
The door swung briskly shut.

The warmth, the gloom, the smell 
of sweeping compound clinging to the broom
soothed me. I found a bucket, turned it
upside down, and sat, hugging my knees.
I hummed a theme from Haydn that I knew
from my piano lessons. . . .
and hardened my heart against authority.
And then I heard her steps, her fingers
on the latch. She led me, blinking
and changed, back to the class.





Northern Exposures
 

for Richard Hugo
You hear the roadhouse before you see it,   
Its four-beat country tunes 
Amplified like surf through the woods,   
Silencing bullfrog and red-tailed hawk,   
Setting beards of moss dancing 
On dim, indeterminate trees 
That border two-lane blacktop. 
Docked tonight, you reveal the badge 
Of the farmer, that blanched expanse of skin   
Where cap shades face, babyhood 
Pallor above the sun-blackened jaw   
Bulging uneasy with a concrete grin   
And some inevitable need to weep.   
Don't you think we live and breathe   
In the meantime, in lockstep 
With dawn, sunset, brawling dawn?   
Even now, you await secrets worse   
Than the few known ways a seized sky   
Will come to survive your pity. 
But on another far field, celebrated   
For its arrivals and evictions, you learn   
To be beautiful, never leading 
A sensible life, playing ball in the early dark,   
Fighting for a taste of the sweet spot,   
In this uncut land, this straight-edged air.   
Whadya want to know that isn't yet a mystery   
Somewhere, a confidential stumble, heat   
Lightning, a first-rate backseat turndown?   
So it is that later you track high above   
Familiar tamarack and ash, beginning   
The next inaccuracy alone, and again,   
Remembering that everything east of you 
Has already happened, on the same cold ground, 
In a swarm of time, finally spiked home   
To your surprise, nails flung to the air. 
And us all thumbs to the hot hammer-licks   
You hear from the roadhouse before you see it. 






Insect Life of Florida
 

In those days I thought their endless thrum 
   was the great wheel that turned the days, the nights. 
      In the throats of hibiscus and oleander 

I'd see them clustered yellow, blue, their shells 
   enameled hard as the sky before the rain. 
      All that summer, my second, from city 

to city my young father drove the black coupe 
   through humid mornings I'd wake to like fever 
      parceled between luggage and sample goods. 

Afternoons, showers drummed the roof, 
   my parents silent for hours. Even then I knew 
      something of love was cruel, was distant. 

Mother leaned over the seat to me, the orchid 
   Father'd pinned in her hair shriveled 
      to a purple fist. A necklace of shells 

coiled her throat, moving a little as she 
   murmured of alligators that float the rivers 
      able to swallow a child whole, of mosquitoes 

whose bite would make you sleep a thousand years. 
   And always the trance of blacktop shimmering 
      through swamps with names like incantations-- 

Okeefenokee, where Father held my hand 
   and pointed to an egret's flight unfolding 
      white above swamp reeds that sang with insects 

until I was lost, until I was part 
   of the singing, their thousand wings gauze 
      on my body, tattooing my skin. 

Father rocked me later by the water, 
   the motel balcony, singing calypso 
      with the Jamaican radio. The lyrics 

a net over the sea, its lesson 
   of desire and repetition. Lizards flashed 
      over his shoes, over the rail 

where the citronella burned merging our 
   shadows--Father's face floating over mine 
      in the black changing sound 

of night, the enormous Florida night, 
   metallic with cicadas, musical 
      and dangerous as the human heart.





Chinese New Year
 

The dragon is in the street dancing beneath windows 
   pasted with colored squares, past the man 
who leans into the phone booth's red pagoda, past 
   crates of doves and roosters veiled 

until dawn. Fireworks complicate the streets 
   with sulphur as people exchange gold 
and silver foil, money to appease ghosts 
   who linger, needy even in death. I am 

almost invisible. Hands could pass through me 
   effortlessly. This is how it is 
to be so alien that my name falls from me, grows 
   untranslatable as the shop signs, 

the odors of ginseng and black fungus that idle 
   in the stairwell, the corridor where 
the doors are blue months ajar. Hands 
   gesture in the smoke, the partial moon 

of a face. For hours the soft numeric 
   click of mah-jongg tiles drifts 
down the hallway where languid Mai trails 
   her musk of sex and narcotics. 

There is no grief in this, only the old year 
   consuming itself, the door knob blazing 
in my hand beneath the lightbulb's electric jewel. 
   Between voices and fireworks 

wind works bricks to dust--hush, hush-- 
   no language I want to learn. I can touch 
the sill worn by hands I'll never know 
   in this room with its low table 

where I brew chrysanthemum tea. The sign 
   for Jade Palace sheds green corollas 
on the floor. It's dangerous to stand here 
   in the chastening glow, darkening 

my eyes in the mirror with the gulf of the rest 
   of my life widening away from me, waiting 
for the man I married to pass beneath 
   the sign of the building, to climb 

the five flights and say his Chinese name for me. 
   He'll rise up out of the puzzling streets 
where men pass bottles of rice liquor, where 
   the new year is liquor, the black bottle 

the whole district is waiting for, like 
   some benevolent arrest--the moment 
when men and women turn to each other and dissolve 
   each bad bet, every sly mischance, 

the dalliance of hands. They turn in lamplight 
   the way I turn now. Wai Min is in the doorway. 
He brings fish. He brings lotus root. 
   He brings me ghost money.





In the Elementary School Choir
 

I had never seen a cornfield in my life, 
I had never been to Oklahoma, 
But I was singing as loud as anyone, 
"Oh what a beautiful morning. . . . The corn   
Is as high as an elephant's eye, 
Though I knew something about elephants, I thought,   
Coming from the same continent as they did,   
And they being more like camels than anything else. 

And when we sang from Meet Me in St. Louis,   
"Clang, clang, clang went the trolley, 
I remembered the ride from Ramleh Station 
In the heart of Alexandria 
All the way to Roushdy where my grandmother lived,   
The autos on the roadways vying 
With mule carts and bicycles, 
The Mediterranean half a mile off on the left,   
The air smelling sharply of diesel and salt. 

It was a problem which had dogged me 
For a few years, this confusion of places. 
And when in 5th grade geography I had pronounced   
"Des Moines as though it were a village in France,   
Mr. Kephart led me to the map on the front wall,   
And so I'd know where I was, 
Pressed my forehead squarely against Iowa. 
Des Moines, he'd said. Rhymes with coins. 

Now we were singing "zippidy-doo-dah, zippidy-ay,   
And every song we'd sung had in it 
Either sun or bluebirds, fair weather 
Or fancy fringe, O beautiful America! 
And one tier below me, 
There was Linda Deemer with her amber waves 
And lovely fruited plains, 
And she was part of America too 
Along with sun and spacious sky 
Though untouchable, and as distant 
As purple mountains of majesty. 

"This is my country, we sang, 
And a few years ago there would have been   
A scent of figs in the air, mangoes, 
And someone playing the oud along a clear stream. 

But now it was "My country 'tis of thee   
And I sang it out with all my heart   
And now with Linda Deemer in mind.   
"Land where my fathers died, I bellowed,   
And it was not too hard to imagine
 
A host of my great-uncles and -grandfathers   
Stunned from their graves in the Turkish interior   
And finding themselves suddenly   
On a rock among maize and poultry   
And Squanto shaking their hands. 

How could anyone not think America   
Was exotic when it had Massachusetts   
And the long tables of thanksgiving?   
And how could it not be home 
If it were the place where love first struck? 

We had finished singing. 
The sun was shining through large windows   
On the beatified faces of all 
Who had sung well and with feeling. 
We were ready to file out and march back 
To our room where Mr. Kephart was waiting.   
Already Linda Deemer had disappeared   
Into the high society of the hallway. 
One day I was going to tell her something.   
Des Moines, I was saying to myself, 
Baton Rouge. Terre Haute. Boise.





Listening
 

You wept in your mother's arms   
and I knew that from then on   
I was to forget myself. 

Listening to your sobs, 
I was resolved against my will   
to do well by us 
and so I said, without thinking,   
in great panic, To do wrong   
in one's own judgment, 
though others thrive by it, 
is the right road to blessedness.   
Not to submit to error 
is in itself wrong 
and pride. 

Standing beside you, 
I took an oath 
to make your life simpler   
by complicating mine 
and what I always thought   
would happen did: 
I was lifted up in joy. 






Sweetness
 

Just when it has seemed I couldn't bear   
   one more friend   
waking with a tumor, one more maniac   

with a perfect reason, often a sweetness   
   has come   
and changed nothing in the world   

except the way I stumbled through it,   
   for a while lost   
in the ignorance of loving   

someone or something, the world shrunk   
   to mouth-size,   
hand-size, and never seeming small.   

I acknowledge there is no sweetness   
   that doesn't leave a stain,   
no sweetness that's ever sufficiently sweet ....   

Tonight a friend called to say his lover   
   was killed in a car   
he was driving. His voice was low   

and guttural, he repeated what he needed   
   to repeat, and I repeated   
the one or two words we have for such grief   

until we were speaking only in tones.   
   Often a sweetness comes   
as if on loan, stays just long enough   

to make sense of what it means to be alive,   
   then returns to its dark   
source. As for me, I don't care   

where it's been, or what bitter road   
   it's traveled   
to come so far, to taste so good.





The Blue Bowl
 

Like primitives we buried the cat
with his bowl. Bare-handed
we scraped sand and gravel
back into the hole. It fell with a hiss
and thud on his side,
on his long red fur, the white feathers
that grew between his toes, and his
long, not to say aquiline, nose.
We stood and brushed each other off.
There are sorrows much keener than these.
Silent the rest of the day, we worked,
ate, stared, and slept. It stormed
all night; now it clears, and a robin
burbles from a dripping bush
like the neighbor who means well
but always says the wrong thing.





Bronzed
 

That dusty bubble gum, once ubiquitous as starlings,   
is no more, my love. Whistling dinosaurs now populate   
only animation studios, the furious actions of angels   
causing their breasts to flop out in mannerist   
frescos flake away as sleet holds us in its teeth.   
And the bus-station's old urinals go under   
the grindstone and the youthful spelunkers   
graduate into the wrinkle-causing sun. The sea   
seemingly a constant to the naked eye is one   
long goodbye, perpetually the tide recedes,   
beaches dotted with debris. Unto each is given   
a finite number of addresses, ditties to dart   
the heart to its moments of sorrow and swoon.   
The sword's hilt glints, the daffodils bow down,   
all is temporary as a perfect haircut, a kitten   
in the lap, yet sitting here with you, my darling,   
waiting for a tuna melt and side of slaw   
seems all eternity I'll ever need   
and all eternity needs of me.





Another Insane Devotion
 

This was gruesome--fighting over a ham sandwich                   
with one of the tiny cats of Rome, he leaped 
on my arm and half hung on to the food and half 
hung on to my shirt and coat. I tore it apart 
and let him have his portion, I think I lifted him 
down, sandwich and all, on the sidewalk and sat 
with my own sandwich beside him, maybe I petted 
his bony head and felt him shiver. I have 
told this story over and over; some things 
root in the mind; his boldness, of course, was frightening 
and unexpected--his stubbornness--though hunger 
drove him mad. It was the breaking of boundaries, 
the sudden invasion, but not only that it was 
the sharing of food and the sharing of space; he didn't 
run into an alley or into a cellar, 
he sat beside me, eating, and I didn't run 
into a trattoria, say, shaking, 
with food on my lips and blood on my cheek, sobbing; 
but not only that, I had gone there to eat 
and wait for someone. I had maybe an hour 
before she would come and I was full of hope 
and excitement. I have resisted for years 
interpreting this, but now I think I was given 
a clue, or I was giving myself a clue, 
across the street from the glass sandwich shop. 
That was my last night with her, the next day 
I would leave on the train for Paris and she would 
meet her husband. Thirty-five years ago 
I ate my sandwich and moaned in her arms, we were 
dying together; we never met again 
although she was pregnant when I left her--I have 
a daughter or son somewhere, darling grandchildren 
in Norwich, Connecticut, or Canton, Ohio. 
Every five years I think about her again 
and plan on looking her up. The last time 
I was sitting in New Brunswick, New Jersey, 
and heard that her husband was teaching at Princeton, 
if she was still married, or still alive, and tried 
calling. I went that far. We lived 
in Florence and Rome. We rowed in the bay of Naples 
and floated, naked, on the boards. I started 
to think of her again today. I still 
am horrified by the cat's hunger. I still 
am puzzled by the connection. This is another 
insane devotion, there must be hundreds, although 
it isn't just that, there is no pain, and the thought 
is fleeting and sweet. I think it's my own dumb boyhood, 
walking around with Slavic cheeks and burning 
stupid eyes. I think I gave the cat 
half of my sandwich to buy my life, I think 
I broke it in half as a decent sacrifice. 
It was this I bought, the red coleus, 
the split rocking chair, the silk lampshade. 
Happiness. I watched him with pleasure. 
I bought memory. I could have lost it. 
How crazy it sounds. His face twisted with cunning. 
The wind blowing through his hair. His jaw working.





Prayer for My Father
 

Your head is still 
restless, rolling 
east and west. 
That body in you 
insisting on living 
is the old hawk 
for whom the world 
darkens. 
If I am not 
with you when you die, 
that is just. 

It is all right. 
That part of you cleaned 
my bones more 
than once. But I 
will meet you 
in the young hawk 
whom I see 
inside both 
you and me; he 
will guide 
you to the Lord of Night, 
who will give you 
the tenderness 
you wanted here.





The Bearer
 

Like all his people he felt at home in the forest.   
The silence beneath great trees, the dimness there,   
The distant high rustling of foliage, the clumps 
Of fern like little green fountains, patches of sunlight,   
Patches of moss and lichen, the occasional   
Undergrowth of hazel and holly, was he aware   
Of all this? On the contrary his unawareness   
Was a kind of gratification, a sense of comfort   
And repose even in the strain of running day   
After day. He had been aware of the prairies.   
He had known he hated the sky so vast, the wind   
Roaring in the grasses, and the brightness that   
Hurt his eyes. Now he hated nothing; nor could he   
Feel anything but the urgency that compelled him   
Onward continually. "May I not forget, may I   
Not forget," he said to himself over and over.   
When he saw three ravens rise on their awkward   
Wings from the forest floor perhaps seventy-five   
Ells ahead of him, he said, "Three ravens,"   
And immediately forgot them. "May I not forget,"   
He said, and repeated again in his mind the exact   
Words he had memorized, the message that was   
Important and depressing, which made him feel   
Worry and happiness at the same time, a peculiar   
Elation. At last he came to his people far   
In the darkness. He smiled and spoke his words,   
And he looked intently into their eyes gleaming 
In firelight. He cried when they cried. No rest 
For his lungs. He flinched and lay down while they   
Began to kill him with clubs and heavy stones. 






Life of Sundays
 

Down the street, someone must be praying, and though I don't 
Go there anymore, I want to at times, to hear the diction 
And the tone, though the English pronoun for God is obsolete-- 

What goes on is devotion, which wouldn't change if I heard: 
The polished sermon, the upright's arpeggios of vacant notes. 
What else could unite widows, bankers, children, and ghosts? 

And those faces are so good as they tilt their smiles upward 
To the rostrum that represents law, and the minister who 
Represents God beams like the white palm of the good hand 

Of Christ raised behind the baptistry to signal the multitude, 
Which I am not among, though I feel the abundance of calm 
And know the beatitude so well I do not have to imagine it, 

Or the polite old ones who gather after the service to chat, 
Or the ritual linen of Sunday tables that are already set. 
More than any other days, Sundays stand in unvarying rows 

That beg attention: there is that studied verisimilitude 
Of sanctuary, so even mud and bitten weeds look dressed up 
For some eye in the distant past, some remote kingdom 

Where the pastures are crossed by thoroughly symbolic rivers. 
That is why the syntax of prayers is so often reversed, 
Aimed toward the dead who clearly have not gone ahead 

But returned to prior things, a vista of angels and sheep, 
A desert where men in robes and sandals gather by a tree. 
Hushed stores, all day that sense a bell is about to ring-- 

I recognized it, waking up, before I weighed the bulk of news 
Or saw Saturday night's cars parked randomly along the curb, 
And though I had no prayer, I wanted to offer something 

Or ask for something, perhaps out of habit, but as the past 
Must always be honored unconsciously, formally, and persists 
On this first and singular day, though I think of it as last.





Nurture
 

From a documentary on marsupials I learn 
that a pillowcase makes a fine 
substitute pouch for an orphaned kangaroo. 

I am drawn to such dramas of animal rescue. 
They are warm in the throat. I suffer, the critic proclaims, 
from an overabundance of maternal genes. 

Bring me your fallen fledgling, your bummer lamb, 

lead the abused, the starvelings, into my barn. 
Advise the hunted deer to leap into my corn. 

And had there been a wild child-- 
filthy and fierce as a ferret, he is called 
in one nineteenth-century account-- 

a wild child to love, it is safe to assume, 
given my fireside inked with paw prints, 
there would have been room. 

Think of the language we two, same and not-same, 
might have constructed from sign, 
scratch, grimace, grunt, vowel: 

Laughter our first noun, and our long verb, howl.





When I Am Asked
 

When I am asked   
how I began writing poems,   
I talk about the indifference of nature.   

It was soon after my mother died,   
a brilliant June day,   
everything blooming.   

I sat on a gray stone bench   
in a lovingly planted garden,   
but the day lilies were as deaf   
as the ears of drunken sleepers   
and the roses curved inward.   
Nothing was black or broken   
and not a leaf fell   
and the sun blared endless commercials   
for summer holidays.   

I sat on a gray stone bench   
ringed with the ingenue faces   
of pink and white impatiens   
and placed my grief   
in the mouth of language,   
the only thing that would grieve with me.

Magic
 

We passed old farmer Boothby in the field. 
Rugged and straight he stood; his body steeled 
With stubbornness and age. We met his eyes 
That never flinched or turned to compromise, 
And Luck, he cried, good luck!--and waved an arm,
Knotted and sailor-like, such as no farm 
In all of Maine could boast of; and away
He turned again to pitch his new-cut hay... 
We walked on leisurely until a bend
Showed him once more, now working toward the end
Of one great path; wearing his eighty years 
Like banners lifted in a wind of cheers.

Then we turned off abruptly--took the road 
Cutting the village, the one with the commanding
View of the river. And we strode
More briskly now to the long pier that showed 
Where the frail boats were kept at Indian Landing.
In the canoe we stepped; our paddles dipped 
Leisurely downwards, and the slim bark slipped
More on than in the water. Smoothly then 
We shot its nose against the rippling current, 
Feeling the rising river's half-deterrent 
Pull on the paddle as we turned the blade 
To keep from swerving round; while we delayed
To watch the curious wave-eaten locks;
Or pass, with lazy turns, the picnic-rocks....    
Blue eels flew under us, and fishes darted
A thousand ways; the once broad channel shrunk.
And over us the wise and noble-hearted 
Twilight leaned down; the sunset mists were parted,--
And we, with thoughts on tiptoe, slunk 
Down the green, twisting alleys of the Kennebunk,

Motionless in the meadows
   The trees, the rocks, the cows... 
And quiet dripped from the shadows 
   Like rain from heavy boughs.

The tree-toads started ringing
   Their ceaseless silver bells;
A land-locked breeze came swinging
   Its censer of earthy smells.

The river's tiny caon
   Stretched into dusky lands;
Like a dark and silent companion
   Evening held out her hands.

Hushed were the dawn's bravados;
   Loud noon was a silenced cry--
And quiet slipped from the shadows
   As stars slip out of the sky...

It must have been an hour more, or later, 
When, tramping homeward through the piney wood,
We felt the years fly back; the brotherhood 
Of forests took us--and we saw the satyr! 
There in a pool, up to his neck, he stood 
And grinned to see us stare, incredulous--
Too startled to remember fear or flight. 
Feeling the menace in the crafty night,
We turned to run--when lo, he called to us!
Using our very names he called. We drew 
With creaking courage down the avenue 
Of birches till we saw, with clearing sight, 
(No longer through a tricky, pale-green light) 
Familiar turns and shrubs, the friendly path,--
And Farmer Boothby in his woodland bath! 
The woods became his background; every tree 
Seemed part of him, and stood erect, and shared 
The beauty of that gnarled serenity;
The quiet vigor of age that smiled and squared 
Its shoulders against Time ... And even night
Flowed in and out of him, as though content 
With such a native element;
Happy to move about a spirit quite
As old, as placid and as confident...
Sideways we turned. Still glistening and unclad
He leaped up on the bank, light as a lad,
His body in the moonlight dripping stars...

We went on homeward, through the pasture-bars.





An Xmas Murder
 

He sits at the table, cloudlight of March
One tone with his hair, gray-silver on silver. 
Midday fare in Vermont is basic enough.
In West Newbury, eggs and toast will do-- 
Though our doctor's had his sips of wine as well. 
Just don't be fooled. They're not as nice as you 
Think they are. Live here a few more winters, 
You'll get to know them clearer, and vice-versa. 
Three years now, and we're still finding our way; 
Newcomers need a guide to show them the ropes, 
And he has been explaining township and county 
Almost from the sunstruck day we met him 
That very first July in this old house.
I'll cite an instance of community
Spirit at work, North Country justice--
A case I just happened to be involved in.
No, please--all right, if you are having one. 
He holds his glass aloft and then lets fall
A silence that has grown familiar to us
From other stories told on other days,
The will to recount building its head of steam. 
Well, now, you have to know about the victim. 
His name was Charlie Deudon, no doubt Canuck 
Stock some generations back, but he
Nor no one else could tell you--if they cared. 
Deudons had been dirt farmers here as long 
As anybody knew. They never starved
But never had a dime to spare, either.
Charlie resolved to change the Deudon luck. 
And that's just what he did. Or almost did. . . . 
He'd graduated two classes ahead of mine;
We knew each other, naturally, but not
On terms of friendship. Fact is, he had no friends, 
And only one girlfriend, whom he married 
Day after Commencement, June of 32. 
And then he set to work and never stopped 
Again, until they made him stop for good. 
A wisp of a smile, half irony, half
Bereavement plays about his guileless face-- 
Red cheeks, blue eyes, a beardless Santa Claus; 
Whose bag contains (apart from instruments 
Of healing) stories, parables and proverbs, 
Painkillers, too, for when all else fails.
What kind of work had all that hard work been? 
Oh, farming, like his elders, only better. 
All the modern improvements, fancy feed 
And fertilizers, plus machinery--
He was the first in these parts to milk 
His herd in any way but as twas done
Since Adam's boys first broke ground with a plow. 
And anything machines couldn't handle, 
Charlie did himself, from dawn to midnight. 
He never wasted a word or spilled a drop 
Of milk or drank a drop of beer or liquor. 
He was unnatural. And he made that farm 
Into a showplace, a kind of 4-H model. 
He made good money, yes, but not a dollar 
Would he spend unnecessarily.
Do you get the picture? They hated him,
The boys that hung around the package store. 
The most they ever got from tightfist Charlie 
Deudon was a nod out from under his cap.
(His trademark--a baseball cap striped white and red.) 
They envied him for getting his hay in first; 
And there was more. A boy that he had hired,
By the name of Carroll Giddens, was their buddy. 
Likeable fellow, regulation issue, 
The sort that knocks back a pint or a fifth 
In half a shake and tells off-color stories
Till he's got them choked to death with laughing. 
Course the wisecracks they loved best were those 
About poor Charlie and his gold-plated farm. . . . 
Just one more case of what's been often said 
By commentators on democracy-- 
How it helps everyone keep modest. 
Teasing mischief has crept into his voice. 
A self-taught anthropologist as well 
As teller of tales, he has other frames 
Of reference to place around events 
Local or international. He knows
That things can stand for more than what they are; 
Indeed, says standing for things is why we're here, 
And quotes chapter and verse to prove his point. 
Think of the worldwide scapegoat ritual. 
In halfway civilized societies
An animal's the one relieved from life 
Duty, am I right? A fellow tribesman
Will do in a pinch, if animals are lacking,
Or if communal fears get screwed too tight. . . . 
Anyhow, it was clear that something more 
Than common envy stirred up the lynch law.
Their own failure's what they wanted dead. 
Seconds pass in silence as he stares
At something--perhaps a knothole in the pine 
Floorboard. He looks up, eyebrows raised,
And twirls the glass stem between stubby fingers.
A coil of rope hung on the wall, we see,
Has made him pause and heave experienced sighs. 
Here. Have another. So: was Charlie punished?
I'm going to tell you--better me than others. 
You see, I was involved--no, no, no, 
Not in the deed, Lord, no, just as a witness.
It happened this way--hope you're not squeamish. 
Charlie had this boy to help with chores, 
The one named Carroll. Married, two kids, I think. 
Not too reliable. But so few are;
Nor could you call his wages generous.
His buddies must have stood him drinks, is all 
I can say. He'd a skinful half the time--
Was certainly drunk that Christmas Eve morning. 
No reason to doubt what Charlie told his wife. 
Charlie'd been up to help at six with the milking, 
And Carroll, drunk as a fiddler's bitch, was there 
Loading a pair of milk cans into the barrow. 
He took a slip and the whole business spilled. 
Wooden handle clipped him in the side, 
And he fell, too, right in the puddle of milk. 
And started laughing. Charlie, you can guess, 
Didn't join in; he told him to get on home. 
What about the milk?' Go home,' he said,
You're drunk.' But what about the milk?' asks Carroll. 
Comes out of next week's paycheck,' Charlie says. 
And then the trouble starts, with Carroll swearing 
And yelping, till Charlie gives him a little tap 
And goes indoors. By then Carroll could tell 
The barrow handle had cracked a rib or two. 
He drove into town to see his doctor--that 
Wasn't me--and word went out that Charlie 
Had roughed up his innocent assistant. 
That's all they needed, Carroll's friends. About 
Time that stuck-up bastard got his due,
He's gone too far this time, but we'll show him, 
Et cetera . . . . As it was Christmas Eve,
They had the leisure, the liquor, and the rope.
They hanged him? No, that's not our way up here. 
The honored custom's to dump them in the river. 
You see, the river's New Hampshire all the way 
Over to the Vermont side, and thus, 
If the victim's still alive when he hits the water, 
New Hampshire law enforcement and legal justice 
Steps in. It tends to confuse the issue, see? 
In wintertime, the river freezes over, 
And you can't hope to fish the bodies out 
Till the month of March at the earliest. 
By then, who knows which state the victim died in? 
A trick they've played a hundred years and more 
Up in Woodsville, where the bridge is. That's where 
The loggers used to go to spend their money 
On booze and hookers--who'd arrange for them 
To get knocked in the head at the right moment, 
And pitched off the bridge into the water. 
A famous local industry, but rather 
Fallen on hard days by the early fifties, 
Just like others more legitimate. . . . 
Well, our local rowdies knew the routine, 
And, when time came to follow up their threats, 
They laid their plans according to tradition. 
They knew that Charlie'd have to do the milking 
Christmas morning same as every day. 
And when he came into the barn to do it,
They'd be waiting for him. And that's what happened.

We strain forward to hear him tell the rest; 
The narrative spell is on him, and on us.
His voice weaves through fine-tuned nuances, 
With sudden leaps in volume and skittish phrases 
That somehow help flesh out what he describes.
We see the sprawling barn across the highway 
From the white-columned porch of the old house. 
See the barn closed up tight against the cold, 
And the blue-gray light of December dawn 
As Charlie crosses the road to do his chores. 
The roosters shriek their morning alarm, the big 
Doors creak open on the darkness--a darkness 
Slit with tight-strung wires of light knifing 
Through cracks between the boards of the east wall. 
Tufts of hay spill from cribs on both sides. 
The waiting cattle stir and low as daylight 
Breaks in on the darkness. Their master strides 
In past the parked pickup truck, his pail, 
A battered Rath Blackhawk lard can swinging 
At his side, a whistled Jingle Bells
His fight song for the working holiday.
He hears the verses harnessed to his whistling, 
The tune drawing its text along march tempo: 
. . . it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh-ay! 
And then all changes. Smash of the blackjack 
Against his skull, exploding carnival
Of fire-veined shock that flies to the far corners 
Of night. Four assailants leap from the back
Of the truck and lift him partly erect, the quicker 
To bind his arms behind and truss them to 
His half-bent legs, as you might rope a steer 
Or sheep you meant to brand or slaughter. 
They take him out to where the car is waiting 
And throw him in the trunk like a sack of feed. 
Another car drives past but doesn't slow. 
The bandits duck and climb inside their own. 
Tires screech, the driver slams onto the highway, 
A smile and wink all round as they drive north 
To Woodsville. The sun is coming up when they
Reach the bridge and stop the car. The lid
Of the trunk's sprung open, its cargo discharged. 
He is dragged to the railing, lifted, then heaved over. 
The body falls, seeming almost to pause
In air before it hits the water and slides
Below the surface of the floating ice. . . .
Five miles back along the highway, the dark 
Barn, the herd, a crushed tin pail, and signs 
Of struggle in the dirt wait for someone's
Startled face, back-lit in the doorway,
To see them, then whip aside with a shout of terror.

He wasn't found until spring thaw; he washed 
Ashore just south of Bradford, still tied up
And looking like they'd tarred and feathered him--
Partly decomposed, but not his clothes. 
First thing was an autopsy to test if he 
Had died by drowning or was dead before 
Going under. Conclusion was, he'd died 
On land, so as I said, his death belonged 
To the Green Mountain State's criminal justice. 
And what about the killers--were they caught? 
Several suspects found themselves in jail-- 
And that's where I come in: as star witness. 
It happened I was on the road that morning. 
Real early. See . . . I'd promised my house guest 
Of the night--young Marine on leave--I'd drive 
Him back to Lebanon to grab his bus. 
I always keep my word, especially 
When given in the night hours. Nice boy-- 
He's been a good friend ever since. We'd said 
Good-bye until the next three-day pass. 
Well, I was driving home like Merry Christmas. 
Into the headlights comes the Deudon farm:
And then I noticed the car. A two-toned Kaiser, 
Side of the road, beneath a maple tree. 
Didn't know whose it was or why it was there. 
I saw one face, Calvin Renfrew's, that's all. 
He didn't have wheels so far as I knew.
Occurred to me right then that something might 
Be fishy; but locals never meddle till--
Till it's too late, sometimes. I should have stopped. 
They might have banged me on the head, but then--. 
Well, even as it is they got revenge.
I'm still alive, however, and mean to stay so.
He laughs a low laugh that would chill the devil . . .
Then takes up the thread--how when he heard the news 
About Charlie's disappearance, he drove down 
To tell the state trooper what he'd seen. 
That was the very next day after Christmas. 
By nightfall Calvin Renfrew and Norbert Joiner, 
The owner of the car (the Kaiser), and two 
Associates were in custody. But not
For long. Someone bailed them out, someone 
Rich, it had to be, an enemy
Or rival of Charlie's. That's often our way, 
You know, to let others fix the person
We secretly hate, then give them secret help 
When they get their paws burned in the process. 
A lot of people coveted that farm,
However much disparaged it was in public. 
When Charlie's widow put it up for auction, 
Don't imagine nobody came to bid.
I still see things of his on others' farms.
What didn't surprise me either's how the town, 
Lord help me, the whole county took the side 
Of those arrested against the murdered man. 
They said old Charlie had it coming to him,
Treating his employee that way. Meanwhile, 
Carroll had quietly slipped across the border 
To Canada; no way to prove that he'd 
Hardly been hurt at all. So rumor flew.
If words could put you under ground, why Carroll 
Was dead and buried six times over, a martyr 
Hounded to his grave by a maniac
Who should have been taken care of years ago. 
These are churchgoing people, too, but they 
Figure they have a special insight as
To what the Boy Upstairs considers right. 
Man is born for sorrow, so we're told, 
And some try to make sure he gets a close 
Acquaintance with the sorrow that's his due. 
Meanwhile, if you can say the things people 
Want to hear, then you may lynch at will.
He folds his hands and brings them to his chin. 
The rest of the story you can figure out 
Yourself. Their lawyer asked the jury be 
Directed by the judge to return a verdict 
Of Not Guilty. Motion granted--as never 
Before for a capital offense in this state. 
They'd do it again, don't worry, if the case 
Was dear to their concerns. Sounds cynical,
I grant you. . . . But then, you see, they started next 
On me for fingering the guilty parties. 
State trooper drops by to ask some questions. 
Why was I on the highway that time of morning? 
Oh? And who exactly was this friend? 
Oh, really? Stayed the night, did he? I see. . . . 
A doubt or two'd been raised before already, 
Given that I had never married, and 
Was locally famous for my special hobby. 
I'm sure I've told you: I play a little pipe
Organ at church sometimes--I even travel 
To play it elsewhere. I know organists
All over New England, and the town gazette 
Used always to mention when I went to play 
At musicales in other towns and states. 
Nobody thought it mattered much beforehand, 
But once the tale about the serviceman 
Got out, my friends, well, you can just imagine. 
Overnight young Dr. Stephens was
As musical' as you can be and not
Get tarred and feathered. My patients, some of them, 
Began to melt away like ice cream. Stephens, 
A local name, respected in these parts,
Became a byword for things we don't discuss. 
I wondered whether I should move, of course; 
Some rowdy threw a can of paint at the house; 
I still get unsigned letters from time to time. 
Things must be better where you two come from. 
But this is where I've always lived, it's what 
I know. If I had had the sense to pitch
Someone unpopular from off a bridge
Instead of enjoying music, chances are 
I'd be a favorite son. In point of fact,
I've given up the organ, seldom play it
Nowadays. I've got a different hobby--
Your health, gentlemen! No more today, though. 
Another call to make this afternoon.
But listen, now: if you'll come up to me
Next week, I'll play some pump organ for you. 
I can still do a rousing Hornpipe'--the one 
By Handel. Tourist attraction hereabouts. 
I am fairly confident you won't
Ever have heard it played my way before. 
He stands to go, consenting to be ushered
Out under the black trees of late March, down 
To where his battered station wagon sits.
Thunder of engines takes him off. . . . But his words 
Stay lodged in us like arrows, arrows aimed 
As carefully as acupuncture and meant 
Somehow to warn or counsel. Not that warnings 
In the abstract often help stave off 
Particular misfortunes, inevitably 
The body of most stories drawn from life. 
Misfortunes are the hinges life turns on? 
Reprieves as well--along with persons, places, 
Passions. A fluent paradox, the realm 
Normally termed external, I mean its way 
Of overhearing thought and mustering 
Fresh evidence. . . . Today, for instance, how 
New green on branches and a liquid birdcall 
Suffice to announce the chaste approach of spring.





Ice
 

In the warming house, children lace their skates,   
bending, choked, over their thick jackets. 

A Franklin stove keeps the place so cozy 
it's hard to imagine why anyone would leave, 

clumping across the frozen beach to the river.   
December's always the same at Ware's Cove, 

the first sheer ice, black, then white 
and deep until the city sends trucks of men 

with wooden barriers to put up the boys'   
hockey rink. An hour of skating after school, 

of trying wobbly figure-8's, an hour 
of distances moved backwards without falling, 

then--twilight, the warming house steamy   
with girls pulling on boots, their chafed legs 

aching. Outside, the hockey players keep   
playing, slamming the round black puck 

until it's dark, until supper. At night, 
a shy girl comes to the cove with her father. 

Although there isn't music, they glide 
arm in arm onto the blurred surface together, 

braced like dancers. She thinks she'll never 
be so happy, for who else will find her graceful, 

find her perfect, skate with her 
in circles outside the emptied rink forever?





Days of '74
 

What was the future then but affirmation,   
The first yes between us 
Followed by the first lingering dawn? 
Waking below a window shaded by redwoods   
(Waking? We hadn't slept--), 
We found time saved, like sunlight in a tree. 

Still, the house was cold, and there were shadows.   
The couple in the next room 
Rapped the wall to quiet us, like them,   
Condescending from a bitter knowledge 
That, young as we all were, 
Love didn't last, but receded into silence. 

Wedging our pillows back of the headboard 
That clapped in time with us, 
We let them think we agreed. Then, holding on, 
We closed each other's mouths and felt that slowness   
That the best days begin with   
Turn into the speed with which they fly. 

Flight was that year's theme, all around us-- 
Flight of hunter and hunted, 
The President turning inward on one wing,   
And, on the patio, the emigration 
Of termites, a glittering fleet, 
Leaving that shadowed house a little lighter. 

Within it all, above it, or beyond, 
We thought we were the fixed point, 
And held still as the quail lit down beside us   
And waited for her plump mate to appear,   
His crest a quivering hook. 
The valley's reach of sunshine reeled them in. 

There was wilderness around us, don't forget.   
Behind the nets of fragrance 
Thrown across our path by the acacia   
Lurked the green man or the kidnapper.   
And there was the Pacific 
With its own passions taking place as rain. 

The sorrow of the couple in the next room   
Was a deep muteness nightly. 
That loneliness could come of loving was   
Like news of time cored out of the redwood.   
The house that we made shake, 
Or thought we did, was taking wing already. 

After we left, still it took us years 
Before we stopped comparing 
Every morning together to that first one   
And every place we lived to that first place   
And everything we said 
To that first word repeated all night long. 






Late at Night in Bed
 

My wife tells me she hears a beetle   
Scurrying across the kitchen floor.   
She says our daughter is dreaming   

Too loudly, just listen, her eyelids   
Are fluttering like butterflies. 

What about the thunder, I say, 
What about the dispatches from the police car   
Parked outside, or me rolling over like a whale? 

She tells me there's a leaf falling 
And grazing the downstairs window, 
Or it could be glass cutters, diamonds, 
Thieves working their hands toward the latch.   
She tells me our son is breathing too quickly,   
Is it pneumonia, is it the furnace 
Suddenly pumping monoxides through the house? 

So when my wife says sleep, she means   
A closing of the eyes, a tuning   
Of the ears to ultra frequencies. 

(It is what always happens 
When there are children, the bed   
Becoming at night a listening post,   
Each little ting forewarning disaster.) 

Downstairs there is the sound 
Of something brushing against something else   
And I try to listen as my wife might listen,   
Insects, I say, dust on a table top, 
Maybe a knife's edge against the palm. 

But she tells me it's only 
The African violet on the windowsill   
Putting out another flower, 
And falls luxuriously into a dream   
Of being awake and vigilant. 

So the house grows noisier, 
There are clicks in the woodwork,   
There are drips, raps, clunks, things   
To make sense of, make benign. 

My son and daughter are sleeping calmly,   
And the stairs, yes, are creaking, 
The wind, I think, or maybe two men,   
Where's the beaker of acid, 
The bowling ball, the war hoop 
I learned in second grade? 

So this is what it's like when there's 
No one left but you to love and defend. 

Outside there are cats in a fight 
And they remind me too much of babies crying.   
Then the bottle thrown against the stoop,   
The sound of something delicate shattered. 

My wife stirs, Be glad, she says, 
Sound doesn't carry far, that you don't hear   
The whole of it, cries in the night, 
Children in other cities, hurts, silences. 

And she's right, I can't hear the whole of it,   
Or else I hear too much and it's noise   
Or I make it noise because it's too much. 

So I begin homing in on something 
Around me, something distinct, my wife's   
Breathing, a window's rattle. Outside, 
Grass is lengthening in the dark, 
And sap running up the phloem of the maple, 
(Do I hear it? And how the stars must be wheeling!)   
And in the far room, my children's 
Hearts are keeping time, for them, for us 
Who have begun to listen in earnest. 






Machines
 

Dearest, note how these two are alike: 
This harpsicord pavane by Purcell 
And the racer's twelve-speed bike. 

The machinery of grace is always simple. 
This chrome trapezoid, one wheel connected 
To another of concentric gears, 
Which Ptolemy dreamt of and Schwinn perfected, 
Is gone. The cyclist, not the cycle, steers. 
And in the playing, Purcell's chords are played away. 

So this talk, or touch if I were there, 
Should work its effortless gadgetry of love, 
Like Dante's heaven, and melt into the air. 

If it doesn't, of course, I've fallen. So much is chance, 
So much agility, desire, and feverish care, 
As bicyclists and harpsicordists prove 

Who only by moving can balance, 
Only by balancing move.





Three Songs at the End of Summer
 

A second crop of hay lies cut   
and turned. Five gleaming crows   
search and peck between the rows. 
They make a low, companionable squawk,   
and like midwives and undertakers   
possess a weird authority. 

Crickets leap from the stubble,   
parting before me like the Red Sea.   
The garden sprawls and spoils. 

Across the lake the campers have learned   
to water ski. They have, or they haven't.   
Sounds of the instructor's megaphone   
suffuse the hazy air. "Relax! Relax! 

Cloud shadows rush over drying hay,   
fences, dusty lane, and railroad ravine.   
The first yellowing fronds of goldenrod   
brighten the margins of the woods. 

Schoolbooks, carpools, pleated skirts;   
water, silver-still, and a vee of geese. 

* 

The cicada's dry monotony breaks   
over me. The days are bright   
and free, bright and free. 

Then why did I cry today   
for an hour, with my whole   
body, the way babies cry? 

* 

A white, indifferent morning sky,   
and a crow, hectoring from its nest   
high in the hemlock, a nest as big   
as a laundry basket ... 
                                    In my childhood   
I stood under a dripping oak, 
while autumnal fog eddied around my feet,   
waiting for the school bus 
with a dread that took my breath away. 

The damp dirt road gave off   
this same complex organic scent. 

I had the new books--words, numbers,   
and operations with numbers I did not   
comprehend--and crayons, unspoiled   
by use, in a blue canvas satchel 
with red leather straps. 

Spruce, inadequate, and alien   
I stood at the side of the road.   
It was the only life I had.





Faberg's Egg
 

Switzerland, 1920
Dear Friend, "Called away from my country,   
I square the egg and put it in a letter   
that all may read, gilding each word a little   
so that touched, it yields to a secret   
stirring, a small gold bird on a spring   
suddenly appearing to sing a small song   
of regret, elation, that overspills all private   
bounds, although you ask, as I do, what now   
do we sing to, sing for? Before the Great War, 
I made a diamond-studded coach three inches high   
with rock crystal windows and platinum wheels 
to ceremoniously convey a speechless egg to Court.   
All for a bored Czarina! My version of history   
fantastic and revolutionary as I reduced the scale   
to the hand-held dimensions of a fairy tale,   
hiding tiny Imperial portraits and cameos   
in eggs of pearl and bone. Little bonbons, caskets!   
The old riddle of the chicken and the egg   
is answered thus: in the Belle Epoque   
of the imagination, the egg came first, containing, 
as it does, both history and uncertainty, my excesses   
inducing unrest among those too hungry to see   
the bitter joke of an egg one cannot eat.   
Oblique oddity, an egg is the most beautiful of all   
beautiful forms, a box without corners   
in which anything can be contained, anything   
except Time, that old jeweler who laughed   
when he set me ticking. Here, among the clocks   
and watches of a country precisely ordered   
and dying, I am not sorry, I do not apologize. 
Three times I kiss you in memory 
of that first Easter, that first white rising, 
and send this message as if it could save you:   
Even the present is dead. We must live now   
in the future. Yours, Faberg.





In Memory of Bryan Lathrop
 

Who bequeathed to Chicago a School of Music.
   So in Pieria, from the wedded bliss
Of Time and Memory, the Muses came
To be the means of rich oblivion,
And rest from cares.  And when the Thunderer
Took heaven, then the Titans warred on him
For pity of mankind. But the great law,
Which is the law of music, not of bread,
Set Atlas for a pillar, manacled
His brother to the rocks of the Scythia,
And under Aetna fixed the furious Typhon.
So should thought rule, not force. And Amphion,
Pursuing justice, entered Thebes and slew
His mother's spouse; but when he would make sure
And fortify the city, then he took
The lyre that Hermes gave, and played, and watched
The stones move and assemble, till a wall
Engirded Thebes and kept the citadel
Beyond the reach of arrows and of fire.
What other power but harmony can build
A city, and what gift so magical
As that by which a city lifts its walls?
So men, in years to come, shall feel the power
Of this man moving through the high-ranged thought
Which plans for beauty, builds for larger life.
The stones shall rise in towers to answer him.





Mrs. Calderas House of Things
 

You are sitting in Mrs. Caldera's kitchen,   
you are sipping a glass of lemonade 
and trying not to be too curious about 
the box of plastic hummingbirds behind you,   
the tray of tineless forks at your elbow. 

You have heard about the backroom   
where no one else has ever gone 
and whatever enters, remains, 
refrigerator doors, fused coils, 
mower blades, milk bottles, pistons, gears. 

"You never know, she says, rummaging   
through a cedar chest of recipes,   
"when something will come of use. 

There is a vase of pencil tips on the table,   
a bowl full of miniature wheels and axles. 

Upstairs, where her children slept,   
the doors will not close, 
the stacks of magazines are burgeoning,   
there are snow shoes and lampshades,   
bedsprings and picture tubes, 
and boxes and boxes of irreducibles! 

You imagine the headline in the Literalist Express: 
House Founders Under Weight Of Past. 

But Mrs Caldera is baking cookies, 
she is humming a song from childhood,   
her arms are heavy and strong, 
they have held babies, a husband,   
tractor parts and gas tanks, 
what have they not found a place for? 

It is getting dark, you have sat for a long time. 
If you move, you feel something will be disturbed, 
there is room enough only for your body.   
"Stay awhile, Mrs. Caldera says,   
and never have you felt so valuable. 






Edward Hopper's New York Movie
 

We can have our pick of seats. 
Though the movie's already moving, 
the theater's almost an empty shell. 
    All we can see on our side 
of the room is one man and one woman-- 
as neat, respectable, and distinct 
    as the empty chairs that come 
between them. But distinctions do not surprise, 
fresh as we are from sullen street and subway 
    where lonelinesses crowded 
about us like unquiet memories 
that may have loved us once or known our love. 
    Here we are an accidental 
fellowship, sheltering from the city's 
obscure bereavements to face a screened, 
    imaginary living, 
as if it were a destination 
we were moving toward. Leaning to our right 
    and suspended before us 
is a bored, smartly uniformed usherette. 
Staring beyond her lighted corner, she finds 
    a reverie that moves through 
and beyond the shine of the silver screening. 
But we can see what she will never see-- 
    that she's the star of Hopper's scene. 
For the artist she's a play of light, 
and a play of light is all about her. 
    Whether the future she is 
dreaming is the future she will have 
we have no way of knowing. Whatever 
    it will prove to be 
it has already been. The usherette 
Hopper saw might now be seventy, 
    hunched before a Hitachi 
in an old home or a home for the old. 
She might be dreaming now a New York movie, 
    Fred Astaire dancing and kissing 
Ginger Rogers, who high kicks across New York 
City skylines, raising possibilities 
    that time has served to lower. 
We are watching the usherette, and the subtle 
shadows her boredom makes across her not-quite- 
    impassive face beneath 
the three red-shaded lamps and beside 
the stairs that lead, somehow, to dark streets 
    that go on and on and on. 
But we are no safer here than she. 
Despite the semblance of luxury-- 
    gilt edges, red plush, 
and patterned carpet--this is no palace, 
and we do not reign here, except in dreams. 
    This picture tells us much 
about various textures of lighted air, 
but at the center Hopper has placed 
a slab of darkness and an empty chair.





Summer at North Farm
 

Finnish rural life, ca. 1910
Fires, always fires after midnight,
the sun depending in the purple birches

and gleaming like a copper kettle.
By the solstice they'd burned everything,

the bad-luck sleigh, a twisted rocker,
things possessed and not-quite-right.

The bonfire coils and lurches,
big as a house, and then it settles.

The dancers come, dressed like rainbows
(if rainbows could be spun),

and linking hands they turn
to the melancholy fiddles.

A red bird spreads its wings now
and in the darker days to come.





Nabokovs Blues
 

The wallful of quoted passages from his work,   
with the requisite specimens pinned next 
to their literary cameo appearances, was too good 

a temptation to resist, and if the curator couldn't,   
why should we? The prose dipped and shimmered   
and the "flies, as I heard a buff call them, stood 

at lurid attention on their pins. If you love to read   
and look, you could be happy a month in that small   
room. One of the Nabokov photos I'd never seen: 

he's writing (left-handed! why did I never trouble   
to find out?) at his stand-up desk in the hotel   
apartment in Montreux. The picture's mostly 

of his back and the small wedge of face that shows   
brims with indifference to anything not on the page.   
The window's shut. A tiny lamp trails a veil of light 

over the page, too far away for us to read.   
We also liked the chest of specimen drawers   
labeled, as if for apprentice Freudians, 

"Genitalia, wherein languished in phials 
the thousands he examined for his monograph   
on the Lycaenidae, the silver-studded Blues. 

And there in the center of the room a carillon 
of Blues rang mutely out. There must have been 
three hundred of them. Amanda's Blue was there, 

and the Chalk Hill Blue, the Karner Blue 
(Lycaeides melissa samuelis Nabokov),          
a Violet-Tinged Copper, the Mourning Cloak, 

an Echo Azure, the White-Lined Green Hairstreak, 
the Cretan Argus (known only from Mt. Ida: 
in the series Nabokov did on this beauty 

he noted for each specimen the altitude at which   
it had been taken), and as the ads and lovers say,   
"and much, much more. The stilled belle of the tower 

was a Lycaeides melissa melissa. No doubt 
it's an accident Melissa rhymes, sort of, with Lolita,          
The scant hour we could lavish on the Blues 

flew by, and we improvised a path through cars 
and slush and boot-high berms of mud-blurred snow   
to wherever we went next. I must have been mute, 

or whatever I said won from silence nothing   
it mourned to lose. I was back in that small   
room, vast by love of each flickering detail, 

each genital dusting to nothing, the turn,   
like a worm's or caterpillar's, of each phrase.   
I stood up to my ankles in sludge pooled 

over a stopped sewer grate and thought--   
wouldn't you know it--about love and art:   
you can be ruined ("rurnt, as we said in south- 

western Ohio) by a book or improved by   
a butterfly. You can dodder in the slop, 
septic with a rage not for order but for the love 

the senses bear for what they do, for detail 
that's never annexed, like a reluctant crumb 
to a vacuum cleaner, to a coherence. 

You can be bead after bead on perception's rosary. 
This is the sweet ache that hurts most, the way 
desire burns bluely at its phosphorescent core: 

just as you're having what you wanted most,   
you want it more and more until that's more   
than you, or it, or both of you, can bear. 







Onions
 

How easily happiness begins by   
dicing onions. A lump of sweet butter   
slithers and swirls across the floor   
of the saut pan, especially if its   
errant path crosses a tiny slick 
of olive oil. Then a tumble of onions. 

This could mean soup or risotto   
or chutney (from the Sanskrit 
chatni, to lick). Slowly the onions   
go limp and then nacreous 
and then what cookbooks call clear,   
though if they were eyes you could see 

clearly the cataracts in them. 
It's true it can make you weep 
to peel them, to unfurl and to tease   
from the taut ball first the brittle,   
caramel-colored and decrepit 
papery outside layer, the least 

recent the reticent onion 
wrapped around its growing body,   
for there's nothing to an onion 
but skin, and it's true you can go on   
weeping as you go on in, through   
the moist middle skins, the sweetest 

and thickest, and you can go on   
in to the core, to the bud-like,   
acrid, fibrous skins densely   
clustered there, stalky and in- 
complete, and these are the most   
pungent, like the nuggets of nightmare 

and rage and murmury animal   
comfort that infant humans secrete.   
This is the best domestic perfume.   
You sit down to eat with a rumor 
of onions still on your twice-washed   
hands and lift to your mouth a hint 

of a story about loam and usual   
endurance. It's there when you clean up   
and rinse the wine glasses and make   
a joke, and you leave the minutest   
whiff of it on the light switch, 
later, when you climb the stairs. 






Arroyo: Flash Flood
 

The canyon walls close in again,
 slant light a silver glare in brown water.
 The water is only knee deep, but when the boy reaches the
    boulders--
 purple dark, silvered by the smash of brute water--
 water will tear at his chest and arms.
 The walls of the canyon are brilliant in late light.
 They would have glared red and gold for his drowned camera:
 splashed blood to his left, to his right a wall of sun laddered
    with boulders.
  
 More than boulders.    Some stranger once fought down this 
    cliffside,
 his rope of twisted dry vines strung boulder to boulder,
 clifftop to arroyo.    Escape.    Escape maybe.    Maybe bones
    in the desert.
 I think of hands scuffed raw from the braiding.
  
 Almost.  Water froths over the boulders,
 tugs at the boy's footing.       Almost.
 The blood cliff to his left blinds him.    Blind nails scrape at
     two boulders,
 a torn vine whipping somewhere above him.
  
He wedges knees against polished rock, pressing up, clawing
     slick stone.
 Now.    Rope cutting his hand, he skids underwater:
 silver and froth, a film of bright blood staining his eyes.
 But he drags hand over hand up out of the water, climbing
     the sun
 hand over hand, the ancient vines holding,
 boulders for foothold, up out of that canyon.
  






The Death of Allegory
 

I am wondering what became of all those tall abstractions 

that used to pose, robed and statuesque, in paintings 

and parade about on the pages of the Renaissance 

displaying their capital letters like license plates.


Truth cantering on a powerful horse,

Chastity, eyes downcast, fluttering with veils.

Each one was marble come to life, a thought in a coat, 

Courtesy bowing with one hand always extended,


Villainy sharpening an instrument behind a wall,

Reason with her crown and Constancy alert behind a helm. 

They are all retired now, consigned to a Florida for tropes. 

Justice is there standing by an open refrigerator.


Valor lies in bed listening to the rain.

Even Death has nothing to do but mend his cloak and hood, 

and all their props are locked away in a warehouse, 

hourglasses, globes, blindfolds and shackles.


Even if you called them back, there are no places left 

for them to go, no Garden of Mirth or Bower of Bliss. 

The Valley of Forgiveness is lined with condominiums 

and chain saws are howling in the Forest of Despair.


Here on the table near the window is a vase of peonies 

and next to it black binoculars and a money clip, 

exactly the kind of thing we now prefer,

objects that sit quietly on a line in lower case,


themselves and nothing more, a wheelbarrow,

an empty mailbox, a razor blade resting in a glass ashtray. 

As for the others, the great ideas on horseback

and the long-haired virtues in embroidered gowns,


it looks as though they have traveled down

that road you see on the final page of storybooks,

the one that winds up a green hillside and disappears

into an unseen valley where everyone must be fast asleep.







Forgetfulness
 

The name of the author is the first to go 
followed obediently by the title, the plot, 
the heartbreaking conclusion, the entire novel 
which suddenly becomes one you have never read, never even heard of, 

as if, one by one, the memories you used to harbor 
decided to retire to the southern hemisphere of the brain, 
to a little fishing village where there are no phones. 

Long ago you kissed the names of the nine muses goodbye 
and watched the quadratic equation pack its bag, 
and even now as you memorize the order of the planets, 

something else is slipping away, a state flower perhaps, 
the address of an uncle, the capital of Paraguay. 

Whatever it is you are struggling to remember, 
it is not poised on the tip of your tongue 
or even lurking in some obscure corner of your spleen. 

It has floated away down a dark mythological river 
whose name begins with an L as far as you can recall 

well on your own way to oblivion where you will join those 
who have even forgotten how to swim and how to ride a bicycle. 

No wonder you rise in the middle of the night 
to look up the date of a famous battle in a book on war. 
No wonder the moon in the window seems to have drifted   
out of a love poem that you used to know by heart.





Mrs. Adam
 

I have lately come to the conclusion that I am Eve,
alias Mrs. Adam. You know, there is no account
of her death in the Bible, and why am I not Eve?
                    Emily Dickinson in a letter,
                            12 January, 1846
Wake up,
you'll need your wits about you.
This is not a dream,
but a woman who loves you, speaking.

She was there
when you cried out;
she brushed the terror away.
She knew
when it was time to sin.
You were wise
to let her handle it,
and leave that place.

We couldn't speak at first
for the bitter knowledge,
the sweet taste of memory
on our tongues.

Listen, it's time.
You were chosen too,
to put the world together.





The Death of Antinos
 

When the beautiful young man drowned-- 
accidentally, swimming at dawn 
in a current too swift for him, 
or obedient to some cult 
of total immersion that promised 
the bather would come up divine, 

mortality rinsed from him-- 
Hadrian placed his image everywhere, 
a marble Antinos staring across 
the public squares where a few dogs 
always scuffled, planted 
in every squalid little crossroads 

at the furthest corners of the Empire. 
What do we want in any body 
but the world? And if the lover's 
inimitable form was nowhere, 
then he would find it everywhere, 
though the boy became simply more dead 

as the sculptors embodied him. 
Wherever Hadrian might travel, 
the beloved figure would be there 
first: the turn of his shoulders, 
the exact marble nipples, 
the drowned face not really lost 

to the Nile--which has no appetite, 
merely takes in anything 
without judgment or expectation-- 
but lost into its own multiplication, 
an artifice rubbed with oils and acid 
so that the skin might shine. 

Which of these did I love? 
Here is his hair, here his hair 
again. Here the chiseled liquid waist 
I hold because I cannot hold it. 
If only one of you, he might have said 
to any of the thousand marble boys anywhere, 

would speak. Or the statues might have been enough, 
the drowned boy blurred as much by memory 
as by water, molded toward an essential, 
remote ideal. Longing, of course, 
become its own object, the way 
that desire can make anything into a god.





Etching of the Plague Years
 

In the valley of your art history book,   
the corpses stack in the back of a cart 
drawn by an ox whose rolling shoulder muscles   
show its considerable weight. 

He does this often. His velvet nostrils   
flare to indicate the stench. 

It's the smell you catch after class 
while descending a urine-soaked 
subway stair on a summer night 
in a neighborhood where cabs won't drive:   
the odor of dead flowers, fear 
multiplied a thousand times. 

The train door's hiss 
seals you inside with a frail boy   
swaying from a silver hoop. 
He coughs in your direction, his eyes   
are burn holes in his face. 

Back in the fourteenth-century print   
lying in your lap, a hand 
white as an orchid has sprouted   
from the pyramid of flesh. 
It claws the smoky air. 

Were it not for that, 
the cart might carry green cordwood   
(the human body knobby and unplaned). 

Wrap your fingers around your neck   
and feel the stony glands.   
Count the holes in your belt loop 
for lost weight. 

In the black unfurling glass, 
study the hard planes of your face. 

Compare it to the prom picture   
in your wallet, the orchid 
pinned to your chest like a spider. 

Think of the flames 
at your high school bonfire 
licking the black sky, ashes rising, 
innumerable stars. The fingers that wove   
with your fingers 
have somehow turned to bone. 

The subway shudders between dark and light.   
The ox plods across the page. 

Think of everyone 
you ever loved: the boy   
who gets off at your stop 
is a faint ideogram for each. 

Offer him your hand.   
Help him climb the stair.





Introit & Fugue
 

After death, my father   
practices meticulously   
until the Bach is seamless,   
spun glass in a dream,   
you can no longer tell   
where the modulations are,   
or the pedal shifts 
or the split fingerings . . . 

if he rests 
it's to wind the metronome   
or sip his cup of ice . . . 

but who is the other old man   
in the identical flannel gown,   
head cocked, listening 
ever more critically, 
deeper in the empty room?





First Grade Homework
 

The child's assignment:   
"What is a city? 
All dusk she sucks her pencil   
while cars swish by 
like ghosts, neighbors' radios   
forecast rain, high clouds,   
diminishing winds: at last 
she writes: "The city is everyone. 
       Now it's time 
for math, borrowing and exchanging,   
the long discipleship 
to zero, the stranger, 
the force that makes us 
what we study: father and child,   
writing in separate books,   
infinite and alone.





Marriage
 

Years later they find themselves talking   
about chances, moments when their lives   
might have swerved off 
for the smallest reason. 
                                     What if 
I hadn't phoned, he says, that morning?   
What if you'd been out, 
as you were when I tried three times   
the night before? 
                           Then she tells him a secret.   
She'd been there all evening, and she knew   
he was the one calling, which was why   
she hadn't answered. 
                               Because she felt-- 
because she was certain--her life would change   
if she picked up the phone, said hello,   
said, I was just thinking 
of you. 
            I was afraid, 
she tells him. And in the morning   
I also knew it was you, but I just   
answered the phone 
                            the way anyone 
answers a phone when it starts to ring,   
not thinking you have a choice.





An Arbor
 

The world's a world of trouble, your mother must   
                      have told you   
               that. Poison leaks into the basements 

and tedium into the schools. The oak   
                      is going the way 
               of the elm in the upper Midwest--my cousin 

earns a living by taking the dead ones   
                      down. 
               And Jason's alive yet, the fair- 

haired child, his metal crib next   
                      to my daughter's. 
             Jason is one but last saw light five months ago 

and won't see light again. 

                                                    

Leaf against leaf without malice   
                     or forethought, 
            the manifold species of murmuring 

harm. No harm intended, there never is.   
                     The new 
            inadequate software gets the reference librarian 

fired. The maintenance crew turns off power one            
                     weekend 
            and Monday the lab is a morgue: fifty-four 

rabbits and seventeen months of research.   
                     Ignorance loves   
          as ignorance does and always 

holds high office.   

                                                   

Jason had the misfortune to suffer misfortune   
                   the third 
          of July. July's the month of hospital ro- 

tations; on holiday weekends the venerable   
                   stay home. 
          So when Jason lay blue and inert on the table 

and couldn't be made to breathe for three-and-a- 
                  quarter hours,   
         the staff were too green to let him go. 

The household gods have abandoned us to the gods   
                  of juris- 
         prudence and suburban sprawl. The curve 

of new tarmac, the municipal pool,   
                  the sky at work 
         on the pock-marked river, fatuous sky, 

the park where idling cars, mere yards   
                  from the slide 
         and the swingset, deal beautiful oblivion in nickel 

bags: the admitting room and its stately drive,   
                  possessed   
         of the town's best view. 

                                                  

And what's to become of the three-year-old brother?   
                  When Jason was found   
         face down near the dogdish--it takes 

just a cupful of water to drown-- 
                   his brother stood still 
         in the corner and said he was hungry 

and said that it wasn't his fault.   
                  No fault. 
         The fault's in nature, who will 

without system or explanation   
                make permanent 
         havoc of little mistakes. A natural 

mistake, the transient ill-will we define   
                as the normal 
         and trust to be inconsequent, 

by nature's own abundance soon absorbed.   

                                                    

Oak wilt, it's called, the new disease.   
                Like any such 
         contagion--hypocrisy in the conference room, 

flattery in the halls--it works its mischief mostly   
                unremarked.   
         The men on the links haven't noticed 

yet. Their form is good. They're par.   
                The woman who's 
         prospered from hating ideas loves causes 

instead. A little shade, a little firewood.   
                I know 
         a stand of oak on which my father's 

earthly joy depends. We're slow   
                to cut our losses.





We Have Not Long To Love
 

We have not long to love. 
Light does not stay. 
The tender things are those 
we fold away. 
Coarse fabrics are the ones 
for common wear. 
In silence I have watched you 
comb your hair. 
Intimate the silence, 
dim and warm. 
I could but did not, reach 
to touch your arm. 
I could, but do not, break 
that which is still. 
(Almost the faintest whisper 
would be shrill.) 
So moments pass as though 
they wished to stay. 
We have not long to love. 
A night. A day.... 







The Cave Painters
 

Holding only a handful of rushlight 
they pressed deeper into the dark, at a crouch   
until the great rock chamber 
flowered around them and they stood 
in an enormous womb of 
flickering light and darklight, a place 
to make a start. Raised hands cast flapping shadows   
over the sleeker shapes of radiance. 

They've left the world of weather and panic 
behind them and gone on in, drawing the dark   
in their wake, pushing as one pulse 
to the core of stone. The pigments mixed in big shells   
are crushed ore, petals and pollens, berries 
and the binding juices oozed 
out of chosen barks. The beasts 

begin to take shape from hands and feather-tufts   
(soaked in ochre, manganese, madder, mallow white)   
stroking the live rock, letting slopes and contours   
mould those forms from chance, coaxing 
rigid dips and folds and bulges 
to lend themselves to necks, bellies, swelling haunches,   
a forehead or a twist of horn, tails and manes 
curling to a crazy gallop. 

Intent and human, they attach 
the mineral, vegetable, animal 
realms to themselves, inscribing 
the one unbroken line 
everything depends on, from that 
impenetrable centre 
to the outer intangibles of light and air, even   
the speed of the horse, the bison's fear, the arc 
of gentleness that this big-bellied cow   
arches over its spindling calf, or the lancing   
dance of death that 
bristles out of the buck's 
struck flank. On this one line they leave   
a beak-headed human figure of sticks   
and one small, chalky, human hand. 

We'll never know if they worked in silence   
like people praying--the way our monks   
illuminated their own dark ages   
in cross-hatched rocky cloisters,   
where they contrived a binding   
labyrinth of lit affinities 
to spell out in nature's lace and fable   
their mindful, blinding sixth sense 
of a god of shadows--or whether (like birds   
tracing their great bloodlines over the globe)   
they kept a constant gossip up 
of praise, encouragement, complaint. 

It doesn't matter: we know 
they went with guttering rushlight 
into the dark; came to terms 
with the given world; must have had 
--as their hands moved steadily 
by spiderlight--one desire 
we'd recognise: they would--before going on   
beyond this border zone, this nowhere   
that is now here--leave something 
upright and bright behind them in the dark. 






Break of Day in the Trenches
 

The darkness crumbles away.
It is the same old druid Time as ever, 
Only a live thing leaps my hand,
A queer sardonic rat,
As I pull the parapet's poppy
To stick behind my ear.
Droll rat, they would shoot you if they knew 
Your cosmopolitan sympathies.
Now you have touched this English hand 
You will do the same to a German 
Soon, no doubt, if it be your pleasure 
To cross the sleeping green between. 
It seems you inwardly grin as you pass 
Strong eyes, fine limbs, haughty athletes, 
Less chanced than you for life,
Bonds to the whims of murder,
Sprawled in the bowels of the earth, 
The torn fields of France.
What do you see in our eyes
At the shrieking iron and flame
Hurled through still heavens?
What quaver--what heart aghast?
Poppies whose roots are in man's veins
Drop, and are ever dropping; 
But mine in my ear is safe--
Just a little white with the dust.





Mingus at the Showplace
 

I was miserable, of course, for I was seventeen, 
and so I swung into action and wrote a poem, 

and it was miserable, for that was how I thought 
poetry worked: you digested experience and shat 

literature. It was 1960 at The Showplace, long since 
defunct, on West 4th St., and I sat at the bar, 

casting beer money from a thin reel of ones, 
the kid in the city, big ears like a puppy. 

And I knew Mingus was a genius. I knew two 
other things, but they were wrong, as it happened. 

So I made him look at the poem. 
"There's a lot of that going around, he said, 

and Sweet Baby Jesus he was right. He laughed 
amiably. He didn't look as if he thought 

bad poems were dangerous, the way some poets do. 
If they were baseball executives they'd plot 

to destroy sandlots everywhere so that the game 
could be saved from children.   Of course later 

that night he fired his pianist in mid-number 
and flurried him from the stand. 

"We've suffered a diminuendo in personnel, 
he explained, and the band played on.





To Bessie Drennan
 

Because she could find no one else to paint apicture of the old family place where she and hersisters lived . . . she attended an adult educationclass in Montpelier. In one evening Bessie Drennan learned everything she would need toaccomplish her goals . . .          The Vermont Folklife Center Newsletter

Bessie, you've made space dizzy
with your perfected technique for snow:
white spatters and a dry brush
feathering everything in the world

seem to make the firmament fly.
Four roads converge on the heart of town,
this knot of white and yellow houses
angling off kilter, their astigmatic windows

almost all in rows. Lucky the skater
threading the yellow tavern's quilt-sized pond,
the yellow dogs who punctuate the village
where our occupations are chasing

and being chaste, sleighing and sledding
and snowshoeing from house to house
in our conical, flamelike hats.
Even the barns are sliding in snow,

though the birches are all golden
and one maple blazes without being consumed.
Is it from a hill nearby we're watching,
or somewhere in the sky? Could we be flying

on slick runners down into the village?
Is that mare with the elegant legs
truly the size of a house,
and is this the store where everyone bought

those pointed hats, the snowshoes that angle
in contradictory directions?
Isn't that Rin Tin Tin, bigtongued
and bounding and in two places at once?

Down there in the world's corner two children
steal away onto the frozen pond,
carrying their toboggan. Even the weathervanes
--bounding fish, a sailing stag--look happy.

The houses are swaying, Bessie,
and nothing is grounded in shadow,
set loose by weather and art
from gravity's contraints.

And though I think this man is falling,
is it anything but joyous,
the arc his red scarf
transcribes in the air?





Stravinsky in L.A.
 

In white pleated trousers, peering through green 
sunshades, looking for the way the sun is red 
noise, how locusts hiss to replicate the sun. 
What is the visual equivalent 
of syncopation? Rows of seared palms wrinkle 
in the heat waves through green glass. Sprinklers 
tick, tick, tick. The Watts Towers aim to split 
the sky into chroma, spires tiled with rubble 
nothing less than aspiration. I've left 
minarets for sun and syncopation, 
sixty-seven shades of green which I have 
counted, beginning: palm leaves, front and back, 
luncheon pickle, bottle glass, etcetera. 
One day I will comprehend the different   
grades of red. On that day I will comprehend 
these people, rhythms, jazz, Simon Rodia, 
Watts, Los Angeles, aspiration.





Apollo
 

We pull off 
to a road shack 
in Massachusetts 
to watch men walk 

on the moon. We did   
the same thing 
for three two one 
blast off, and now 

we watch the same men   
bounce in and out 
of craters. I want 
a Coke and a hamburger. 

Because the men 
are walking on the moon   
which is now irrefutably   
not green, not cheese, 

not a shiny dime floating   
in a cold blue, 
the way I'd thought, 
the road shack people don't 

notice we are a black   
family not from there,   
the way it mostly goes.   
This talking through 

static, bounces in space- 
boots, tethered   
to cords is much   
stranger, stranger 

even than we are. 






The Shameful Profession
 

For years I tried to conceal from the villagers that I wrote poetry   
I didn't want them to know that I was an oddball 
I didn't want the young men with beards wearing baseball caps who come to the liquor store in their pickups to buy sixpacks to know that I was some kind of sissy 
I decided it was prudent to buy the Daily News instead of the Times at the drugstore 
I burned my poem drafts at home before I took the trash to the dump, kids scavenge around there and the old man who does the recycling is nosy 
I took every precaution 

But our town is not an easy place to keep secrets, everybody knows everybody and they gossip when they're getting their mail at the post office 
Things began to come apart 
A young man with long hair and a city accent showed up and asked in the stores where the poet Laughlin lived 
Then a pipe burst and the plumber told people that he saw thousands of books stacked in the cellar, some of them in foreign languages 
Next day the head of the Volunteer Fire Department came, pretending to check the wiring 
I began to get a bit paranoid; the town trooper is supposed to check each rural road once a week but he came up our road past our house three days in succession 
The ax fell when somehow a reporter for the county paper heard the rumors and there was a little item: local poet caught speeding twice on 272, Motor Vehicles may suspend license 
Much has changed in my life now 
Nobody has laughed at me in the street (I'm over six feet weight 245 and look pretty fit for my age) but they look at me in a funny way 

I don't go to Apple House our grocery store anymore because a little girl with her finger in her nose pointed me out to the checkout lady and asked her something; now I get my liquor and supplies in the next towns and order Honeybaked Hams from Virginia by mail 

My life is all different now that they know I write poems. 
But if they think they can shame me out of it they're very much mistaken. I'm not breaking any law 
I'll go on with it unless they have me declared a public nuisance and have me sent to the Institute 
I've heard there is a poor fellow in the Institute who claims he is Henry Wordsworth Longfellow. He'll understand and be my friend; we can recite to each other if they won't let us have paper and pencils.





Moths
 

Adrift in the liberating, late light
of August, delicate, frivolous,
they make their way to my front porch
and flutter near the glassed-in bulb,
translucent as a thought suddenly
wondered aloud, illumining the air
that's thick with honeysuckle and dusk.
You and I are doing our best
at conversation, keeping it light, steering clear
of what we'd like to say.
You leave, and the night becomes
cluttered with moths, some tattered,
their dumbly curious filaments
startling against my cheek. How quickly,
instinctively, I brush them away.
Dazed, they cling to the outer darkness
like pale reminders of ourselves.
Others seem to want so desperately
to get inside. Months later, I'll find
the woolens, snug in their resting places,
full of missing pieces.





The Snowmass Cycle
 

for Laure-Anne Bosselaar and Kurt Brown
1.   RETREAT 

The sailor dreamt of loss,
but it was I who dreamt the sailor. 
I was landlocked, sea-poor.
The sailor dreamt of a woman
who stared at the sea, then tired 
of it, advertised her freedom.
She said to her friend: I want
all the fire one can have
without being consumed by it. 
Clearly, I dreamt the woman too. 
I was surrounded by mountains 
suddenly green after a long winter,
a chosen uprootedness, soul shake-up, 
every day a lesson about the vastness 
between ecstasy and repose.
I drank coffee called Black Forest 
at the local cafe. I took long walks 
and tried to love the earth
and hate its desecrations.
All the Golden Retrievers wore red 
bandannas on those muttless streets. 
All the birches, I think, were aspens. 
I do not often remember my dreams, 
or dream of dreamers in them. 
To be without some of the things 
you want, a wise man said,
is an indispensable part of happiness.


2.   MOUNTAIN, SKY 

I've been paying attention 
to the sky again.
I've seen a ravine up there, 
and a narrow, black gorge.
Not to worry, I tell myself, 
about tricks the mind plays,
as long as you know they're tricks.

If the rich are casually cruel 
perhaps it's because
they can stare at the sky 
and never see an indictment 
in the shape of clouds.

The frown, for example, 
in a thunderhead. The fist.

That big mountain 
I've been looking at--
I love how it borrows purple
from the filtered light, 
sometimes red.

Like any of us
it's all of its appearances.

It's good that the rich
have to die,
a peasant saying goes,
otherwise they'd live forever.

Here in this rented house, 
high up, I understand. 
I'm one of the rich
for a while. The earth feels 
mine and the air I breathe 
is rarefied, if thin.

Dusk now is making its last claim. 
I love the confluence
of dark mountain, dark sky.
Soon I won't know the beginning 
from the end.


3.   HIM 

Those empty celebrations of the half-believer 
along for the ride.
Those secret words repeated in mirrors--
someone's personal fog.
A man's heart ransomed for comfort 
or a few extra bucks, his soul in rags.

I have been him and him and him.

Was it nobility or senility
when my old grandmother tried to drown 
artificial flowers in the bathtub?

Can only saints carry the load 
without talking about the burden?

I want to lean into life, 
catch the faintest perfume.

In every boy child an old man is dying. 
By middle age
he begins to stink, complain.

I want to have gifts for him 
when we finally meet.
I want him to go out like an ancient 
Egyptian, surrounded 
by what is his, desiring nothing.


4.   DELINEATION AT DUSK 

A lost hour, and that animal lassitude 
after a vanished afternoon. 
Outside: joggers, cyclists. 
Motion, the great purifier, is theirs.
If this were Europe someone in a tower 
might be ringing a bell.
People hearing it would know 
similar truths, might even know 
exactly who they are.
It's getting near drinking time. 
It's getting near getting near; 
a person alone conjures rules 
or can liquefy, fall apart.
That woman with the bouffant--
chewing gum, waiting for the bus--
someone thinks she's beautiful. 
It's beautiful someone does. 
The sky's murmuring, the storm 
that calls you up,
makes promises, never comes. 
Somewhere else, no doubt,
a happy man slicing a tomato, 
a woman with a measuring cup. 
Somewhere else: the foreclosure 
of a feeling or a promise,
followed by silence or shouts.
Here, the slow dance of contingency, 
an afternoon connected to an evening 
by a slender wish. Sometimes absence 
makes the heart grow sluggish
and desire only one person, or one thing. 
I am closing the curtains.
I am helping the night.


5.   SOLITUDE 

A few days ago I stopped looking
at the photographs
clustered on the wall, nudes,
which had become dull to me,
like a tourist's collection of smooth rocks.

I turned away from the view
and conjured a plague of starlings.
Oh how they darkened the landscape.

Surely such beauty had been waiting for its elegy. 
I felt like crushing a rhododendron.

Now and again I feel the astonishment 
of being alive like this, in this body,
the ventricles and the small bones
in the hand, the intricacies of digestion ....

When the radio said parents in California 
gave birth to another child
so that their older child might have 
a bone-marrow transplant and live,

I found myself weeping
for such complicated beauty. 
How wonderful the radio 
and its distant, human voices.

The rain now is quite without consequence 
coming down.

I suppose I've come to the limits
of my paltry resources, this hankering
for people and for massive disturbance, 
then high pressure,
the sequence that's been promised for days.

I will long to be alone 
when my friends arrive.


6.   THE BODY WIDENS 

The body widens, and people are welcomed 
into it, many at a time. This must be
what happens when we learn to be generous 
when we're not in love, or otherwise charmed. 
I've been examining yesterday's ashes. I've visited 
my own candleless altar. Little by little, 
the old selfish parts of me are loosening. 
I have a plan for becoming lean: to use 
all my fat in service of expansion. Have women 
always known this? Loveliness and fear 
when they open and let in and give away? 
The mountains here pierce the sky, 
and the sky, bountiful, closes in around them.


7.   A NEW MOUTH 

Give me a new mouth; I want to talk.
I've been watching the spider mend its web. 
I think I've learned something
about architecture from a swallow. 
Excuse me while I separate the nettles 
from the flowers, while I put my nose 
to the black moist smell of earth
and come up smiling. Somewhere in the world 
is the secret name
for God, many-lettered, unpronounceable. 
             There's a speakable grace
in the fields and even in the cities.
The grapes ripen, someone refuses to become 
a machine. And yet I want to talk
about the worn-out husks of men and women 
returning from the factories,
the venereal streets, the bruise history 
passes down to its forlorn children.
    I need a new mouth to acknowledge 
that piety will keep us small, imprisoned, 
that it's all right to be ridiculous
and sway first to the left, then to the right, 
in order to find our balance.
                                  I've been watching
an evening star quiver. I've been trying 
to identify the word before its utterance. 
Give me a new mouth and I'll be
a guardian against forgetfulness.
I've noticed the wind doesn't discriminate 
between sycamore and cypress.
I want to find the cool, precise language 
for how passion gives rise to passion.


8.   STRANGER 

The wind gone. I can hear my breathing. 
I can hear the lateness of the hour 
by what isn't moving.

Woodrun Slope. Snowmass Village. 
These are winter names, and it's summer. 
The water from the mountains
rushes down man-made gullies.

Serious phantoms with their black tears 
are out tonight.
I'm close--my other delusion goes--
to the heart of things.

A young man with a young man's itch 
would rise and go out prowling.

Tomorrow I'll choose a mountain 
that's a hill, take the slowest horse 
at the Lazy-7, slow and old,
sure to know its trail.

I knew a man who said he could dominate 
solitude. In other ways, too, 
he was a fool.

Once I wanted to be
one of those fabulous strangers 
who appear and disappear.
Now I arrive only by invitation, 
stay long enough to earn my fare.

Outside my window, clouds from the west 
erasing the stars.
A coyote howling its singular news.

At whatever pace,
isn't there an imperative to live?

Before a person dies he should experience 
the double fire,
of what he wants and shouldn't have.





Fox Sleep
 

On a road through the mountains with a friend many years ago

      I came to a curve on a slope where a clear stream 

flowed down flashing across dark rocks through its own

      echoes that could neither be caught nor forgotten 

it was the turning of autumn and already

      the mornings were cold with ragged clouds in the hollows

long after sunrise but the pasture sagging like a roof 

      the glassy water and flickering yellow leaves

in the few poplars and knotted plum trees were held up

      in a handful of sunlight that made the slates on the silent

mill by the stream glisten white above their ruin

      and a few relics of the life before had been arranged

in front of the open mill house to wait

      pale in the daylight out on the open mountain

after whatever they had been made for was over

      the dew was drying on them and there were few who took that road

who might buy one of them and take it away somewhere 

      to be unusual to be the only one

to become unknown a wooden bed stood there on rocks

      a cradle the color of dust a cracked oil jar iron pots 

wooden wheels iron wheels stone wheels the tall box of a clock

      and among them a ring of white stone the size of an 

embrace set into another of the same size

      an iron spike rising from the ring where the wooden

handle had fitted that turned it in its days as a hand mill 

      you could see if you looked closely that the top ring

that turned in the other had been carved long before in the form 

      of a fox lying nose in tail seeming to be

asleep the features worn almost away where it

      had gone around and around grinding grain and salt 

to go into the dark and to go on and remember


      * * *


What I thought I had left I kept finding again

      but when I went looking for what I thought I remembered

as anyone could have foretold it was not there

      when I went away looking for what I had to do 

I found that I was living where I was a stranger

      but when I retraced my steps the familiar vision

turned opaque and all surface and in the wrong places

      and the places where I had been a stranger appeared to me 

to be where I had been at home called by name and answering

      getting ready to go away and going away


      * * *


Every time they assembled and he spoke to them

      about waking there was an old man who stood listening 

and left before the others until one day the old man stayed

      and Who are you he asked the old man

and the old man answered I am not a man

      many lives ago I stood where you are standing

and they assembled in front of me and I spoke to them 

      about waking until one day one of them asked me

When someone has wakened to what is really there 

      is that person free of the chain of consequences

and I answered yes and with that I turned into a fox

      and I have been a fox for five hundred lives

and now I have come to ask you to say what will 

      free me from the body of a fox please tell me

when someone has wakened to what is really there 

      is that person free of the chain of consequences

and this time the answer was That person sees it as it is 

      then the old man said Thank you for waking me

you have set me free of the body of the fox

      which you will find on the other side of the mountain

I ask you to bury it please as one of your own 

      that evening he announced a funeral service

for one of them but they said nobody has died

      then he led them to the other side of the mountain

and a cave where they found a fox's body

      and he told them the story and they buried the fox 

as one of them but later one of them asked

      what if he had given the right answer every time


      * * *


Once again I was there and once again I was leaving 

      and again it seemed as though nothing had changed

even while it was all changing but this time

      was a time of ending this time the long marriage was over

the orbits were flying apart it was autumn again 

      sunlight tawny in the fields where the shadows

each day grew longer and the still afternoons

      ripened the distance until the sun went down

across the valley and the full moon rose out of the trees

      it was the time of year when I was born and that evening

I went to see friends for the last time and I came back 

      after midnight along the road white with the moon

I was crossing the bars of shadow and seeing ahead of me 

      the wide silent valley full of silver light

and there just at the corner of the land that I had

      come back to so many times and now was leaving 

at the foot of the wall built of pale stone I saw the body

      stretched in the grass and it was a fox a vixen 

just dead with no sign of how it had come to happen

      no blood the long fur warm in the dewy grass 

nothing broken or lost or torn or unfinished

      I carried her home to bury her in the garden

in the morning of the clear autumn that she had left 

      and to stand afterward in the turning daylight


      * * *


There are the yellow beads of the stonecrops and the twisted flags 

      of dried irises knuckled into the hollows

of moss and rubbly limestone on the waves of the low wall

      the ivy has climbed along them where the weasel ran 

the light has kindled to gold the late leaves of the cherry tree

      over the lane by the house chimney there is the roof 

and the window looking out over the garden

      summer and winter there is the field below the house

there is the broad valley far below them all with the curves 

      of the river a strand of sky threaded through it

and the notes of bells rising out of it faint as smoke

      and there beyond the valley above the rim of the wall

the line of mountains I recognize like a line of writing

      that has come back when I had thought it was forgotten





Breughel
 

The lump on his neck that no collar 
could hide, and the charity of his presence   
there in the neighborhood each fall, 
door-to-door, standing in the swept porches,   
waiting for the housewives to answer. 

The ugly, pitiable treeman, reddish and leathery   
from the sun. His baseball cap pulled tight   
over his head, the visor stiff as a beaver's tail. 
Year after year, the bowsaw with its wide   
teeth and the long-handled toppers were all 

that announced his trade. And standing on the porch   
he advised nothing, though he coughed and hacked, 
covering his mouth with his sap-blackened fist 
and waited for the infrequent yes that sent him 
up the trunk and into the solid lap of the branches, 

where he clipped and sawed the bony leafless rigging   
until the tree, all torso--lung and heart, ribs   
and hips and shoulders--, stood like a knotted   
goblet in the yard, a figure, as in allegory, 
of his own stunted self, rooted, alive. 

My mother tried hard to convince us we were all   
children of God and that the sick and maimed, the poor,   
were creatures born to special destinies so unique   
we could not understand. But who could understand   
pain's redemptiveness and how it rarely seemed 

to translate into grace. The poor were always poor,   
the sick, sick--just as the treeman's goiter 
did not respond to treatment, inscrutable, part 
of God's plan, part of the unlovely element of love:   
the humbling, the pity, the scar of violence-- 

a craving too frightening to name, or too tender, 
the way the treeman bundled the trimmings in twine   
and hauled them to the alley. And as if he counted it 
his real work, leaned against the fence and with his fingers   
picked the dogged sap from the blade and with a file sharpened the teeth.





Illuminated Page
 

A gold box of Latin words
rests in a dazzling, fanciful field
someone raised to life, lavishing
flowers with untraceable roots, histories
too distant to discern,
upon skin-pale, palm-sized vellum.
 
Imagine the one who did this, lost
in dwindling light, a trembling flame
and painstakingly lovely colors:
blood red, violet, heavy yellow
and fierce, unnatural green.
Framed like a window
 
to the artist's heart, the mother
and child, uncomprehending men
offering what they can: the infant
touches a tiny, gold-leaf casket.
All around him the dark, heraldic blue
of angel winds, night sky, her veil.
 
And below him, you can see
the word God printed
over infinitely
careful erasures.





The Surrealist Learns To Fly
 

Occasionally he wakes, finds
the cool cube of his room
delirious with colors: blaring
daffodils and rigid roses,
petals a soft, translucent red
 
like the inside of an eyelid.
By the window, a clock's
expressionless face near glossy skins
of magazines, a telephone
the color of frozen milk
 
or silence, the color of old.
He is melting, his bones
grown paper-light, they travel
over the bed's pale hills, the woman
who's come to wash him.
 
The ceiling is a landscape
bleeding white as he floats
through the muted winter sky,
a boundless symbol of nothing.
The woman draws the blind.





Passing the Frontier
 

The yellow line could be seen for as long a time
As the highway desired
And if you fell asleep at the wheel
It fulgurated in the dozing soul
Like a brutal revelation
That allows you not to feel
In the dream's snapshot
Your brain getting smashed
Against the milestone or the windshield   
 
It was an ideal line
Crowned with horizontal blue
That unwound day after day
Like a clothesline
Flags and scalps and washed-out roses
Our countries our combats our wars
Mingling lassitude with involuntary starts
A gymnastic in disorder
That sickened our hearts





Coming and Going
 

As long as you believe in miracles
You watch the sun fall into the sea
Every evening
Then you turn your back and sink
Among the ferns sparkling from a moon or from the other
Night up to your knees under the vault of cries.   
 
The pubescent monkeys, the adolescent pumas
Contemplate the slender crescent
Of the earth
In the eyes of a dead viper
That knots on the asphalt
The alpha of a future alphabet.   
 
It's the end of night the mosquitoes
Place themselves on your forehead and die with you
In the ruins of your dreams erected
By the distant suggestions of cities
Where you wish to find an empty
Bed to die in.   
 
The cathedrals the cinemas the soliloquies
The beggar's ear glued to the violin
Music
To be lovesick when the songs
All temple prostitutes all rotgut for two cents
Are going to end up in the pink slit of a jukebox.   
 
Hope is under the hand that weak flesh
Groped massaged turgescent with eyes shut
Comes and goes
Let's keep knotted kisses to ourselves for a long time
Until another day erases
The trace of each passing.





Wine
 

The flowers I planted along my road
Have lasted long despite winds and cold
Already fiery noons begin to burn
Slyly the secret of the roots
And I know that of my footsteps nothing will remain
But a trace a cluster a drop
To recall along the paths I've chosen
Those evening when the light sang
In eyes hands hearts and goblets.   
 
I love the sweet harshness on the tongue
Filling the palate with a promised saliva
Knocking the mute keyboard of the teeth
With raised draperies of which one might say
That memory retains a fleeting trail of them
Half-glimpsed we won't know how or else
The loud reminder of the single moment
All gravity banished the unconscious pleasure recaptured
Of being nothing but entirely animal.   
 
For our life closed on that iridescent sphere
--Color taste perfume at their extreme limits--invokes   
Some miracle independent of its origin
Produced by distilling air and earth--
Like the move toward technological planets
After a calculation made on the fingers of one hand--
Time contained flowing--continual autumn
This evening this wine that enters me to make
My head light my tongue loose my cock happy.





Elegy
 

Adieu near those fields that smoke disembowels                   
                 And that your arm pushes away
For a long time until the inevitable stratum of the                   
                 Adieus until the next                               
                             Adieu   
 
The door in a cliff has closed. I wanted
Daylight to enter here only through the arc-lamp of your eyes
That the limits of this place be defined only
By the carnal walls our bodies erected   
 
Opened wider on the recaptured past than the smallest
Pocket-watch and its visible trail ever were
Your mouth swallowed the hour and my teeth broke on it
When I entered you with kisses   
 
Under the full-blown palm of multiple hands
The rose you know, on the ground now,
Perfumed the silence and killed our secrets
Marking our garden with fear that was no longer fear   
 
Adieu    the songs are ended    the years disemboweled
                  And may your body distance itself
For a long time until the ineluctable regret of
                  Adieus until forever





Old Men Playing Basketball
 

The heavy bodies lunge, the broken language   
of fake and drive, glamorous jump shot   
slowed to a stutter. Their gestures, in love   
again with the pure geometry of curves, 

rise toward the ball, falter, and fall away.   
On the boards their hands and fingertips   
tremble in tense little prayers of reach   
and balance. Then, the grind of bone 

and socket, the caught breath, the sigh,   
the grunt of the body laboring to give   
birth to itself. In their toiling and grand   
sweeps, I wonder, do they still make love 

to their wives, kissing the undersides 
of their wrists, dancing the old soft-shoe   
of desire? And on the long walk home   
from the VFW, do they still sing 

to the drunken moon? Stands full, clock   
moving, the one in army fatigues 
and houseshoes says to himself, pick and roll,   
and the phrase sounds musical as ever, 

radio crooning songs of love after the game,   
the girl leaning back in the Chevy's front seat   
as her raven hair flames in the shuddering   
light of the outdoor movie, and now he drives, 

gliding toward the net. A glass wand 
of autumn light breaks over the backboard.   
Boys rise up in old men, wings begin to sprout 
at their backs. The ball turns in the darkening air. 







Equinox
 

Now is the time of year when bees are wild 
and eccentric. They fly fast and in cramped 
loop-de-loops, dive-bomb clusters of conversants 
in the bright, late-September out-of-doors. 
I have found their dried husks in my clothes. 

They are dervishes because they are dying, 
one last sting, a warm place to squeeze 
a drop of venom or of honey. 
After the stroke we thought would be her last 
my grandmother came back, reared back and slapped 

a nurse across the face. Then she stood up, 
walked outside, and lay down in the snow. 
Two years later there is no other way 
to say, we are waiting. She is silent, light 
as an empty hive, and she is breathing.





At the Beach
 

Looking at the photograph is somehow not 
unbearable: My friends, two dead, one low 
on T-cells, his white T-shirt an X-ray 
screen for the virus, which I imagine 
as a single, swimming paisley, a sardine 
with serrated fins and a neon spine. 

I'm on a train, thinking about my friends 
and watching two women talk in sign language. 
I feel the energy and heft their talk 
generates, the weight of their words in the air 
the same heft as your presence in this picture, 
boys, the volume of late summer air at the beach. 

Did you tea-dance that day? Write poems 
in the sunlight? Vamp with strangers? There is 
sun under your skin like the gold Sula 
found beneath Ajax's black. I calibrate 
the weight of your beautiful bones, the weight 
of your elbow, Melvin, 

                                  on Darrell's brown shoulder.





A Lover
 

If I could catch the green lantern of the firefly 
I could see to write you a letter. 






To a Husband
 

Brighter than fireflies upon the Uji River 
Are your words in the dark, Beloved. 






Ways of Talking
 

We used to like talking about grief
Our journals and letters were packed
with losses, complaints, and sorrows.
Even if there was no grief
we wouldn't stop lamenting
as though longing for the charm
of a distressed face.

Then we couldn't help expressing grief
So many things descended without warning:
labor wasted, loves lost, houses gone,
marriages broken, friends estranged,
ambitions worn away by immediate needs.
Words lined up in our throats
for a good whining.
Grief seemed like an endless river--
the only immortal flow of life.

After losing a land and then giving up a tongue,
we stopped talking of grief
Smiles began to brighten our faces.
We laugh a lot, at our own mess.
Things become beautiful,
even hailstones in the strawberry fields.





Happiness
 

There's just no accounting for happiness, 
or the way it turns up like a prodigal 
who comes back to the dust at your feet 
having squandered a fortune far away. 

And how can you not forgive? 
You make a feast in honor of what 
was lost, and take from its place the finest 
garment, which you saved for an occasion 
you could not imagine, and you weep night and day 
to know that you were not abandoned, 
that happiness saved its most extreme form 
for you alone. 

No, happiness is the uncle you never 
knew about, who flies a single-engine plane 
onto the grassy landing strip, hitchhikes 
into town, and inquires at every door 
until he finds you asleep midafternoon 
as you so often are during the unmerciful 
hours of your despair. 

It comes to the monk in his cell. 
It comes to the woman sweeping the street 
with a birch broom, to the child 
whose mother has passed out from drink. 
It comes to the lover, to the dog chewing 
a sock, to the pusher, to the basketmaker, 
and to the clerk stacking cans of carrots 
in the night. 
                     It even comes to the boulder 
in the perpetual shade of pine barrens, 
to rain falling on the open sea, 
to the wineglass, weary of holding wine.





Only Child
 

1 

I cradled my newborn daughter 
and felt the heartbeat   
pull me out of shock.   
She didn't know 
what her hands were: 
she folded them. I asked her 
was there a place 
where there was no world. 
She didn't know 
what a voice was: her lips   
were the shape of a nipple. 


2 

In the park the child says: 
watch me. It will not count 
unless you see. And she shows me 
the cartwheel, the skip, the tumble, 
the tricks performed at leisure in midair,   
each unknown until it is finished. 
At home she orders: 
see me eat. I watch her 
curl on herself, sleep; 
as I try to leave the dark room 
her dreaming voice commands me: watch. 


3 

Always we passed the seesaw   
on the way to the swings   
but tonight I remember   
the principle of the lever,   
I sit the child at one end,   
I sit near the center, 
the fulcrum, at once she has power 
to lift me off the earth   
and keep me suspended 
by her tiny weight, she laughing, 
I stunned at the power of the formula.





At the Vietnam Memorial
 

The last time I saw Paul Castle
it was printed in gold on the wall
above the showers in the boys'
locker room, next to the school
record for the mile. I don't recall
his time, but the year was 1968
and I can look across the infield
of memory to see him on the track,
legs flashing, body bending slightly
beyond the pack of runners at his back.

He couldn't spare a word for me,
two years younger, junior varsity,
and hardly worth the waste of breath.
He owned the hallways, a cool blonde
at his side, and aimed his interests
further down the line than we could guess.

Now, reading the name again,
I see us standing in the showers,
naked kids beneath his larger,
comprehensive force--the ones who trail
obscurely, in the wake of the swift,
like my shadow on this gleaming wall.





Mortal Sorrows
 

The tortures of lumbago consumed Aunt Madge, 
And Leah Vest, once resigned from schoolmarming, 
Could not be convinced to leave the house, 
And Mrs. Mary Hogan, after birthing her fifth son, 

Lay bedfast for the last fifty-two years of her life, 
Reporting shooting pains that would begin 
High in her back and shear downward to the feet, 
As though, she said, she had been glazed in lightning; 

And also, men, broken on bridges and mills, 
Shell-shocked veterans, religious alcoholics-- 
Leldon Kilpatrick, Johnson Suggs, Whitey Carlyle: 
They came and sat there too, leafing through 

Yellowing Pageants and Progressive Farmers; 
And, one by one, all entered in and talked 
While the good doctor gargled a dark chaff 
In his pipe and took down symptoms, 

Annotating them on his hidden chart-- 
Numbness, neuralgia, the knotted lymph, 
The clammy palms--and then he'd scratch 
His temple's meaningful patch of white 

And scrawl out his unfailing barbiturate prescription 
To be filled by his pharmacist brother-in-law 
Until half the county had gathered as in a lap-- 
The quantum ache, the mutiny in every house. 

How much pain, how many diseases 
Consigned to the mythological, the dropped 
Ovaries, the torn-up nerves, what women 
Said, what men wanted to believe? Part of it 

Laughable, I know. Still I want someone 
To see, now that they lie safe in graves 
Beyond the vacant stores, that someone 
Listened and, hearing the wrong at the heart, 

Named it something that sounded real, whatever 
They lived through and died of. I remember 
Mrs. Lyle who called it a thorn in the flesh, 
And Mr. Appleton, who had no roof in his mouth. 






The Victor Dog
 

for Elisabeth Bishop
Bix to Buxtehude to Boulez. 
The little white dog on the Victor label 
Listens long and hard as he is able. 
It's all in a day's work, whatever plays. 

From judgment, it would seem, he has refrained.   
He even listens earnestly to Bloch, 
Then builds a church upon our acid rock. 
He's man's--no--he's the Leiermann's best friend,   

Or would be if hearing and listening were the same.   
Does he hear? I fancy he rather smells 
Those lemon-gold arpeggios in Ravel's 
"Les jets d'eau du palais de ceux qui s'aiment. 

He ponders the Schumann Concerto's tall willow hit   
By lightning, and stays put. When he surmises   
Through one of Bach's eternal boxwood mazes   
The oboe pungent as a bitch in heat, 

Or when the calypso decants its raw bay rum 
Or the moon in Wozzeck reddens ripe for murder,   
He doesn't sneeze or howl; just listens harder.   
Adamant needles bear down on him from 

Whirling of outer space, too black, too near-- 
But he was taught as a puppy not to flinch,   
Much less to imitate his bte noire Blanche   
Who barked, fat foolish creature, at King Lear. 

Still others fought in the road's filth over Jezebel,   
Slavered on hearths of horned and pelted barons.   
His forebears lacked, to say the least, forbearance.   
Can nature change in him? Nothing's impossible. 

The last chord fades. The night is cold and fine. 
His master's voice rasps through the grooves' bare groves.   
Obediently, in silence like the grave's 
He sleeps there on the still-warm gramophone 

Only to dream he is at the premire of a Handel   
Opera long thought lost--Il Cane Minore. 
Its allegorical subject is his story! 
A little dog revolving round a spindle 

Gives rise to harmonies beyond belief, 
A cast of stars . . . Is there in Victor's heart   
No honey for the vanquished? Art is art.   
The life it asks of us is a dog's life.





Morning
 

Why do we bother with the rest of the day, 

the swale of the afternoon, 

the sudden dip into evening,


then night with his notorious perfumes, 

his many-pointed stars?


This is the best--

throwing off the light covers,

feet on the cold floor,

and buzzing around the house on espresso--


maybe a splash of water on the face, 

a palmful of vitamins--

but mostly buzzing around the house on espresso,


dictionary and atlas open on the rug,

the typewriter waiting for the key of the head, 

a cello on the radio,


and, if necessary, the windows--

trees fifty, a hundred years old 

out there,

heavy clouds on the way

and the lawn steaming like a horse 

in the early morning.







Same Sun, Same Moon, Same River
 

It is easy to imagine Heraclitus
walking stone streets witnessing
life in Athens with no permanence,
stopping strangers to explain about the river,
being laughed at as they moved
from point A to point B fearing Apollo
and Hades then at dusk drinking wine, 
waiting for the happy obliteration alcohol brings,
not realizing how lucky they were
to be stupid and so deep
in their bodies even the sun
and moon trading places over and over
meant nothing.





Tutto  Sciolto
 

A birdless heaven, sea-dusk and a star
Sad in the west;
And thou, poor heart, love's image, fond and far,
Rememberest:

Her silent eyes and her soft foam-white brow
And fragrant hair,
Falling as in the silence falleth now
Dusk from the air.

Ah, why wilt thou remember these, or why,
Poor heart, repine,
If the sweet love she yielded with a sigh
Was never thine?





The Obligation to Be Happy
 

It is more onerous 
than the rites of beauty 
or housework, harder than love. 
But you expect it of me casually, 
the way you expect the sun 
to come up, not in spite of rain 
or clouds but because of them. 

And so I smile, as if my own fidelity 
to sadness were a hidden vice-- 
that downward tug on my mouth, 
my old suspicion that health 
and love are brief irrelevancies, 
no more than laughter in the warm dark 
strangled at dawn. 

Happiness. I try to hoist it 
on my narrow shoulders again-- 
a knapsack heavy with gold coins. 
I stumble around the house,   
bump into things. 
Only Midas himself 
would understand.





Venetian Candy
 

How long will our bewildered heirs
marooned in possessions not theirs
puzzle at disposing of these three
cunning feignings of hard candy in glass--
the striped little pillowlike mock-sweets,
the flared end-twists as of transparent paper?

No clue will be attached, no trace 
of the sunny day of their purchase, 
at a glittering shop a few doors
up from Harry's Bar, a disappointing place 
for all its testaments from Hemingway. 
The Grand Canal was also aglitter 
while the lesser canals lay in the shade 
like snakes, flicking wet tongues 
and gliding to green rendezvous.

The immaculate salesgirl, in her aloof 
Italian succulence, sized us up,
a middle-aged American couple,
as unserious shoppers who,
still half jet-lagged, would cling to their lire 
in the face of any enchanted vase
or ethereal wineglass that might shatter 
in the luggage going home.

Yet we wanted something, something small .... 
This? No ... How much is ten thousand? Dizzy, 
at last we decided. She wrapped
the three glass candies, the cheapest
items in the shop, with a showy care
worthy of crown jewels--tissue,
tape, and tissue again sprang up
beneath her blood-red fingernails,
plus a jack-in-the-box-shaped paper bag
adorned with harlequin lozenges, sad
though she surely was, on her feet waiting
all day for a wild rich Arab, a compulsive Japanese.
Grazie, signor ... grazie, signora ... ciao. 

Nor will our thing-weary heirs decipher 
the little repair, the reattached triangle
of glass from the paper-imitating end-twist, 
its mending a labor of love in the cellar, 
by winter light, by the man of the house, 
mixing transparent epoxy and rigging 
a clever small clamp as if to keep
intact the time that we, alive,
had spent in the feathery bed
at the Europa e Regina.





Flight to Limbo
 

(At What Used to Be Called Idlewild)
The line didn't move, though there were not 
many people in it. In a half-hearted light
the lone agent dealt patiently, noiselessly, endlessly 
with a large dazed family ranging
from twin toddlers in strollers to an old lady 
in a bent wheelchair. Their baggage
was all in cardboard boxes. The plane was delayed, 
the rumor went through the line. We shrugged, 
in our hopeless overcoats. Aviation
had never seemed a very natural idea.

Bored children floated with faces drained of blood. 
The girls in the tax-free shops stood frozen 
amid promises of a beautiful life abroad.
Louis Armstrong sang in some upper corner, 
a trickle of ignored joy.
Outside, in an unintelligible darkness
that stretched to include the rubies of strip malls, 
winged behemoths prowled looking for the gates 
where they could bury their koala-bear noses 
and suck our dimming dynamos dry.

Boys in floppy sweatshirts and backward hats 
slapped their feet ostentatiously
while security attendants giggled
and the voice of a misplaced angel melodiously 
parroted FAA regulations. Women in saris
and kimonos dragged, as their penance, behind them
toddlers clutching Occidental teddy bears, 
and chair legs screeched in the food court 
while ill-paid wraiths mopped circles of night 
into the motionless floor.





Twelfth Birthday
 

As if because you lay 
(deeply embarrassing) inside 
my body, I could (inconceivable) 
follow your swift thoughts into their blue   
immersion even now, 
stilettoes flickering, or schools of fish 
maneuvering, first clear and then occluded, 
though now and then a piercing gleam cuts through; 

as if the snow reflections that glaze   
the winter afternoon to porcelain 
could penetrate the secrets of a skull 
that happens to have lodged (improbable) 
inside me once. Your liberation 
twelve years ago today is the occasion   
you and your friends are celebrating now   
behind a door that's firmly shut. 

The fantasy you've lately been devouring   
features an evil mage with hourglass eyes.   
Last week, when you were furious at me 
(I must have thrown some precious thing away),   
you swiftly slipped into your parents' room   
and turned the bedside clock an hour ahead.   
Discovered as the culprit, wickedly 
you smiled. You knew time was my enemy.





Elegy with a Chimneysweep Falling Inside It
 

Those twenty-six letters filling the blackboard   
Compose the dark, compose 
The illiterate summer sky & its stars as they appear   

One by one, above the schoolyard. 

If the soul had a written history, nothing would have happened:   
A bird would still be riding the back of a horse,   

And the horse would go on grazing in a field, & the gleaners, 

At one with the land, the wind, the sun examining   
Their faces, would go on working, 

Each moment forgotten in the swipe of a scythe.   

But the walls of the labyrinth have already acquired   
Their rose tint from the blood of slaves 
Crushed into the stone used to build them, & the windows   

Of stained glass are held in place by the shriek   

And sighing body of a falling chimneysweep through 
The baked & blackened air. This ash was once a village,   

That snowflake, time itself. 

But until the day it is permitted to curl up in a doorway,   
And try to sleep, the snow falling just beyond it,   

There's nothing for it to do: 

The soul rests its head in its hands & stares out 
From its desk at the trash-littered schoolyard, 

It stays where it was left. 
When the window fills with pain, the soul bears witness,   
But it doesn't write. Nor does it write home 

Having no need to, having no home.   
In this way, & in no other 

Was the soul gradually replaced by the tens of thousands   
Of things meant to represent it-- 

All of which proclaimed, or else lamented, its absence. 

Until, in the drone of auditoriums & lecture halls, it became   
No more than the scraping of a branch   
Against the side of a house, no more than the wincing 

Of a patient on a couch, or the pinched, nasal tenor   
Of the strung-out addict's voice, 

While this sound of scratching, this tapping all night,   
Enlarging the quiet instead of making a music within it, 

Is just a way of joining one thing to another, 

Myself to whoever it is--sitting there in the schoolroom, 

Sitting there while also being led through the schoolyard   
Where prisoners are exercising in the cold light-- 

A way of joining or trying to join one thing to another,   
So that the stillness of the clouds & the sky 

Opening beneath the blindfold of the prisoner, & the cop   
Who leads him toward it, toward the blank 

Sail of the sky at the end of the world, are bewildered 

So that everything, in this moment, bewilders 

Them: the odd gentleness each feels in the hand 
Of the other, & how they don't stop walking, not now 

Not for anything. 






At the Three Fountains
 

Here, where God lives among the trees,
   Where birds and monks the whole day sing
His praises in a pleasant ease,

O heart, might we not find a home
   Here, after all our wandering?
These gates are closed, even on Rome.

Souls of the twilight wander here ; 
   Here, in the garden of that death
Which was for love's sake, need we fear

How sharp with bitter joy might be
   Love's lingering, last, longed-for breath,
Shut in upon eternity?





The Wooden Toy
 

1 

The brightly-painted horse 
Had a boy's face, 
And four small wheels 
Under his feet, 

Plus a long string 
To pull him by this way and that 
Across the floor, 
Should you care to. 

A string in-waiting 
That slipped away 
In many wiles 
From each and every try. 


                      2 

Knock and they'll answer, 
Mother told me. 

So I climbed four flights of stairs 
And went in unannounced. 

And found a small wooden toy 
For the taking 

In the ensuing emptiness 
And the fading daylight 

That still gives me a shudder 
As if I held the key to mysteries in my hand. 


                      3 

Where's the Lost and Found Department, 
And the quiet entry, 
The undeveloped film 
Of the few clear moments 
Of our blurred lives? 

Where's the drop of blood 
And the teeny nail 
That pricked my finger 
As I bent down to touch the toy 

And caught its eye? 


                      4 

Evening light, 

Make me a Sunday 
Go-to meeting shadow 
For my toy. 

My dearest memories are 
Steep stair-wells 
In dusty buildings 
On dead-end streets, 

Where I talk to the walls 
And closed doors 
As if they understood me. 


                      5 

The wooden toy sitting pretty. 

No, quieter than that. 

Like the sound of eyebrows 
Raised by a villain 
In a silent movie. 

Psst, someone said behind my back.





Testimonial
 

Back when the earth was new 
and heaven just a whisper, 
back when the names of things 
hadn't had time to stick; 

back when the smallest breezes 
melted summer into autumn, 
when all the poplars quivered 
sweetly in rank and file . . . 

the world called, and I answered. 
Each glance ignited to a gaze. 
I caught my breath and called that life, 
swooned between spoonfuls of lemon sorbet. 

I was pirouette and flourish, 
I was filigree and flame. 
How could I count my blessings 
when I didn't know their names? 

Back when everything was still to come, 
luck leaked out everywhere. 
I gave my promise to the world, 
and the world followed me here.

Earthly Meditations
 

The Afterlife
1 

Spring, and the first full crop of dandelions gone
to smoke, the lawn lumpish with goldfinches,
hunched in their fluffs, fattened by seed,
alight in the wind-bared peduncular forest.
Little bells, they loop and dive, bend
the delicate birch branches down.
I would enter the sky through the soil
myself, sing up the snail bowers
and go on the lam with the roots.
Licked by filaments, I would lie,
a billion love-mouths to suckle and feed.

Where the river will be next week,
a puddle two trout go savagely dying in.
Notice the bland, Darwinian sand: bone wrack
and tree skin, the ground down moon bowls
of mussels, viral stones dividing like mold.
At twelve, I buried the frog because it was dead
and dug it up because I'd been dreaming--
a fish belly light, a lowly chirruped chorus
of amens. I thought my nights might smell of hell.

Bland, hum-drum, quotidian guilt--
if I've killed one frog, I've killed two.
Saint Rot and the sacraments of maggots:
knowing is humus and sustenance is sex.
It accrues and accrues, it stews
tumorous with delight. Tomorrow's
a shovelful, the spit of the cosmos, one day
the baby's breath is no longer a rose.






Salvation
 

 It's not that I harbor a weeping willow
Shadow's worth of longing for those cloaked
 Turns and straight-aways, or that swampy
South Mississippi was ever half as tragic
 As I dreamed it could be, but that I still cruise
From time to time in the dope-ripe
 Ford Fairlane of the mind where nothing
Has changed, where we remain hopelessly
 Stoned devotees of the TOWN OF LEAKESVILLE 
Emblazoned upon the graffitied water tower's
 Testimonies to love. We believed speed
Would save us, would take us fast
 And far away from the junkyard wrecks
Stacked in their mile-long convoy to nowhere.
 And though losing the way should
Have seemed the worst of divine betrayals,
 We took it as a minor fall from grace,
Tail-spun over the embankment rail, rocking
 That flung steel body down as if to play
A bar-chord on the barbed-wire fence.
 I'll never know what angelic overseer
Was bored and on duty that night, but we
 Rose up and climbed out of the warped last
Breath of that car, no one with so much
 As a scratch on his head, not a drop
Of beer spilt, and the radiator hissing
 Like a teapot in hell when someone yelled
She's gonna blow! and each of us standing
 There, starving for something more,
Something other than the black wheel
 Spinning that sudden dark, cricketed quiet.





The Odd Last Thing She Did
 

A car is idling on the cliff. 
Its top is down. Its headlights throw 
A faint, bright ghost-shadow glow 
On the pale air. On the shore, so far 
Below that the waves' push and drag 
Is dwindled to a hush--a kind 
Of oceanic idle--the sea 
Among the boulders plays a blind- 
Fold game of hide and seek, 
Or capture the flag. The flag 
Swells and sways. The car 
Is empty. A Friday, the first week 
Of June. Nineteen fifty-three. 

A car's idling on the cliff, 
But surely it won't be long before 
Somebody stops to investigate 
And things begin to happen fast: 
Men, troops of men will come, 
Arrive with blazing lights, a blast 
Of sirens, followed by still more 
Men. Though not a soul's in sight, 
The peace of the end of the late 
Afternoon--the sun down, but enough light 
Even so to bathe the heavens from 
Horizon to shore in a deep 
And delicate blue--will not keep. 

Confronted with such an overload 
Of questions (most beginning, Why would she... 
So gifted, bright, and only twenty-three), 
Attention will come to fix upon 
This odd last thing she did: leaving 
The car running, the headlights on. 
She stopped--it will transpire--to fill 
The tank a mere two miles down the road. 
(Just sixteen, the kid at the station will 
Quote her as saying, "What a pity 
You have to work today! It's not right... 
What weather! Goodness, what a night 
It'll be!" He'll add: "She sure was pretty.") 

Was there a change of plan? 
Why the stop for gas? Possibly 
She'd not yet made up her mind? Or 
Had made it up but not yet settled 
On a place? Or could it be she knew 
Where she was headed, what she would do-- 
And wanted to make sure the car ran 
For hours afterward? Might the car not be, 
Then, a sort of beacon, a lighthouse- 
In-reverse, meant to direct one not 
Away from but toward the shore 
And its broken boulders, there to spot 
The bobbing white flag of a blouse? 

Her brief note, which will appear 
In the local Leader, contains a phrase 
("She chanted snatches of old lands") 
That will muddle the town for three days, 
Until a Professor E. H. Wade 
Pins it to Ophelia--and reprimands 
The police, who, this but goes to show, 
Have not the barest knowledge of Shakespeare, 
Else would never have misread "lauds" 
As "lands." A Detective Gregg Messing 
Will answer, tersely, "Afraid 
It's not our bailiwick. Missing 
Persons, yes; missing poems, no." 

(What's truly tragic's never allowed 
To stand alone for long, of course. 
At each moment there's a crowd 
Of clowns pressing in: the booming ass 
At every wake who, angling a loud 
Necktie in the chip dip, 
Airs his problems with intestinal gas, 
Or the blow-dried bonehead out to sell 
Siding to the grieving mother . . . . Well, 
Wade sent the Leader another briefword: 
"Decades of service to the Bard now force 
Me to amend the girl's little slip. 
'Chaunted' not 'chanted' is the preferred . . .") 

Yet none of her unshakeable entourage 
--Pedants, pundits, cops without a clue, 
And a yearning young grease-monkey--are 
Alerted yet. Still the empty car 
Idles, idles on the cliff, and night 
Isn't falling so much as day 
Is floating out to sea . . . . Soon, whether 
She's found or not, her lights will draw 
Moths and tiny dark-winged things that might 
Be dirt-clumps, ashes. Come what may, 
The night will be lovely, as she foresaw, 
The first stars easing through the blue, 
Engine and ocean breathing together. 







For Grant Wood
 

                 "The trees are mended."
A shy man seeks perfection in his art:
 Across vast acres, color and shape of tidiness,
 Iowa's unruly grass submits, blade by blade.
 The blue of Mother's dishes tints the sky.

Across vast acres, color and shape of tidiness,
 sloping rows and rectangles piece a new land.
 The blue of Mother's dishes tints the sky.
 Like a black quilt tied with loops of green, 

sloping rows and rectangles piece the new land.
 The reassuring fields of corn unfold
 like black quilts tied with loops of green.
 Under the artist's alchemy, 

the reassuring fields of corn unfold.
 Sweet clouds hover like the hands of God.
 Under the artist's alchemy,
 even winter's leaden skies grow bright. 

Sweet clouds hover like the hands of God
 as the Thirties' skylines and bread lines disappear.
 Even winter's leaden skies grow bright.
 A yellow hill rises, like the belly of a woman ripe with child, 

as the skylines and bread lines disappear.
 Iowa's unruly grass submits, blade by blade,
 a yellow hill rises--
 and the shy man finds perfection in his art.





At the Poetry Reading
 

I can't keep my eyes off the poet's 
wife's legs--they're so much more 
beautiful than anything he might 
be saying, though I'm no longer 
in a position really to judge, 
having stopped listening some time ago. 
He's from the Iowa Writers Workshop 
and can therefore get along fine 
without my attention. He started in 
reading poems about his childhood-- 
barns, cornsnakes, gradeschool, flowers, 
that sort of stuff--the loss of 
innocence he keeps talking about 
between poems, which I can relate to, 
especially under these circumstances. 
Now he's on to science, a poem 
about hydrogen, I think, he's trying 
to imagine himself turning into hydrogen. 
Maybe he'll succeed. I'm imagining 
myself sliding up his wife's fluid, 
rhythmic, lusciously curved, black- 
stockinged legs, imagining them arched 
around my shoulders, wrapped around my back. 
My God, why doesn't he write poems about her! 
He will, no doubt, once she leaves him, 
leaves him for another poet, perhaps, 
the observant, uninnocent one, who knows 
a poem when it sits down in a room with him. 








For Allen Ginsberg
 

Ginsberg, Ginsberg, burning bright,   
Taunter of the ultra right,   
What blink of the Buddha's eye   
Chose the day for you to die? 

Queer pied piper, howling wild, 
Mantra-minded flower child,   
Queen of Maytime, misrule's lord   
Bawling, Drop out! All aboard! 

Finger-cymbaled, chanting Om, 
Foe of fascist, bane of bomb, 
Proper poets' thorn-in-side, 
Turner of a whole time's tide, 

Who can fill your sloppy shoes? 
What a catch for Death. We lose 
Glee and sweetness, freaky light, 
Ginsberg, Ginsberg, burning bright.





Smoke
 

Can you imagine the air filled with smoke?
 It was. The city was vanishing before noon
 or was it earlier than that? I can't say because
 the light came from nowhere and went nowhere. 

This was years ago, before you were born, before
 your parents met in a bus station downtown.
 She'd come on Friday after work all the way
 from Toledo, and he'd dressed in his only suit. 

Back then we called this a date, some times
 a blind date, though they'd written back and forth
 for weeks. What actually took place is now lost.
 It's become part of the mythology of a family, 

the stories told by children around the dinner table.
 No, they aren't dead, they're just treated that way,
 as objects turned one way and then another
 to catch the light, the light overflowing with smoke. 

Go back to the beginning, you insist. Why
 is the air filled with smoke? Simple. We had work.
 Work was something that thrived on fire, that without
 fire couldn't catch its breath or hang on for life. 

We came out into the morning air, Bernie, Stash,
 Williams, and I, it was late March, a new war
 was starting up in Asia or closer to home,
 one that meant to kill us, but for a moment 

the air held still in the gray poplars and elms
 undoing their branches. I understood the moon
 for the very first time, why it came and went, why
 it wasn't there that day to greet the four of us. 

Before the bus came a small black bird settled
 on the curb, fearless or hurt, and turned its beak up
 as though questioning the day. "A baby crow,"
 someone said. Your father knelt down on the wet cement, 

his lunchbox balanced on one knee and stared quietly
 for a long time. "A grackle far from home," he said.
 One of the four of us mentioned tenderness,
 a word I wasn't used to, so it wasn't me. 

The bus must have arrived. I'm not there today.
 The windows were soiled. We swayed this way and that
 over the railroad tracks, across Woodward Avenue,
 heading west, just like the sun, hidden in smoke.





One Possible Meaning
 

This afternoon the park is filled with brides. 
Among varieties of persuasion the big trees turn back toward the forest. 
Adventurers gather in side streets. 
The police are looking hard at the sky. 
Down at the bay, boys trapped in solitude fish. 
Girls hike their pants and stare at the wave line, 
remembering secrets they once held dear. 
The day offers a ridiculous variation as 
an excuse for not coming in on time. 
Wild imaginings take the place of religion. 
Someone who can't swim offers to cook. 
We've devised a means for the obstinate children 
to be fed, she says, but no one understands this. 
We crave affection, but give only advice. 
There are walls topped with broken bicycles. 
Someone makes an obscene offer and this 
is the best we get all day. Oh don't give in 
so easily she says, handing over the keys. 
We climb the blue fire escape. 
We would like to keep going, 
skyline climbers, old men remembering their childhood 
who devise a few illegal experiences no one wants to try. 
It gets to be more than the officers can take. 
The park is dusty, dark, yet the children, 
ignored all day, play on, convinced their dedication 
releases a magic that changes everything.





Overnight Guest
 

Waiting for your ride in front of the house 
where you spent the night,
where, as a third ear
during their endless intimate,
important, and kinky phone calls,
you pretended to rinse glassware;
you were a dog from the pound,
grateful, sniffing the upholstery.

Later, lying in the center of their 
king-sized bed, a giant wall-to-wall 
mirror, isolating you like a rabbit; 
it was also their exercise
room with torture equipment;
something in you twitched; 
flickering a bizarre video in your head.

It's morning now. You're standing
outside, with nightgown and toothbrush 
wrapped in your purse, waiting for a bus
to take you somewhere else. You're depressed. 
They're asleep of course. Their network wrapped 
around them. You keep wondering why you're 
missing something. Then you look back and see 
your pricked-up ears, your waggy self, stuck 
inside their picture window, where for years
it will wave at you--naive, apologetic, embarrassed.







American Future
 

In 1963 the morning probably seemed harmless enough to sign on the dotted line as the insurance man talked to my parents for over an hour around a coffee table about our future. This roof wasn't designed to withstand meteors he told my father, who back then had a brush haircut that made his ears stick out, his moods still full of passion, still willing to listen, my mother with her beehive hairdo, smiling back at him, all three of them wanting so much to make the fine print of the world work. They laughed and smoked, and after they led the man politely to the door, my parents returned to the living room and danced in the afternoon light, the phonograph playing Frank Sinatra, the green Buick's payments up to date, five-hundred dollars safely in the bank-- later that evening, his infallible common sense ready to protect us from a burst pipe or dry rot, my father waded up to his ankles in water, a V of sweat on the back of his shirt. Something loomed deeper than any basement on our block, larger than he was, a fear he could not admit was unsolvable with a monkey wrench or a handshake and a little money down.





My Father's Diary
 

I get into bed with it, and spring 
the scarab legs of its locks. Inside, 
the stacked, shy wealth of his print-- 
he could not write in script, so the pages 
are sturdy with the beamwork of printedness, 
WENT TO LOOK AT A CAR, DAD 
IN A GOOD MOOD AT DINNER, WENT 
TO TRY OUT SOME NEW TENNIS RACQUETS, 
LUNCH WITH MOM, life of ease-- 
except when he spun his father's DeSoto on the 
ice, and a young tree whirled up to the 
hood, throwing up her arms--until 
LOIS. PLAYED TENNIS, WITH LOIS, 
LUNCH WITH MOM AND LOIS, LOIS 
LIKED THE CAR, DRIVING WITH LOIS, 
LONG DRIVE WITH LOIS. And then, 
LOIS! I CAN'T BELIEVE IT! SHE IS SO 
GOOD, SO SWEET, SO GENEROUS, I HAVE 
NEVER, WHAT HAVE I EVER DONE 
TO DESERVE SUCH A GIRL? Between the dark 
legs of the capitals, moonlight, soft 
tines of the printed letter gentled 
apart, nectar drawn from serif, the 
self of the grown boy pouring 
out, the heart's charge, the fresh 
man kneeling in pine-needle weave, 
worshipping her. It was my father 
good, it was my father grateful, 
it was my father dead, who had left me 
these small structures of his young brain-- 
he wanted me to know him, he wanted 
someone to know him.





Fishing
 

The two of them stood in the middle water,
 The current slipping away, quick and cold,
 The sun slow at his zenith, sweating gold,
 Once, in some sullen summer of father and daughter.
 Maybe he regretted he had brought her--
 She'd rather have been elsewhere, her look told--
 Perhaps a year ago, but now too old.
 Still, she remembered lessons he had taught her:
 To cast towards shadows, where the sunlight fails
 And fishes shelter in the undergrowth.
 And when the unseen strikes, how all else pales
 Beside the bright-dark struggle, the rainbow wroth,
 Life and death weighed in the shining scales,
 The invisible line pulled taut that links them both.





Swifts
 

Bing Crosby died in Spain
 while playing golf with Franco
 but who could care less, and at this
 writing only a few of
 my dear ones are gone--ah I
 could make a sad list--the swifts,
 as if to prove a point,
 fly into the light and make
 a mockery out of our darkness.
 They scream for food but in
 the world of shadows they only
 make a quick motion; I have
 studied them--the whiter
 the wall is--the barer the bulb--
 the more they scream, the more
 they dip down. I have made
 my two hands into a shape
 and I have darkened the wall
 to see what it looks like--I have
 shortened my two broken fingers
 to make the small tail and twisted
 the knuckles sideways so when
 they come in to eat one shadow
 overtakes the other, that way
 I can live in the darkness
 with Franco's poisonous head
 and Crosby's ears, who fainted,
 a thousand to one, behind a
 number two club, though no swift
 died for him, well, for them,
 digging for clubs. I watch the
 birds every night; they fly
 in a great circle, much larger
 than what I can see, their dipping
 is what I dreaded in front of
 my plain white wall--I say it
 for the nine hundred Americans
 who died in Spain. I thought
 I'd have to wait forever
 to do them a tiny justice
 and listen to their songs
 and die a little from the foolhardy
 mournful words, flying down
 one air current or another
 and doing the sides of buildings
 and tops of trees, the low-lying
 straggling dogwood, the full-bodied
 huge red maple, my dear ones.





The Double Leash
 

Blizzard to lilac. Dandelion
to leaf. Endless
variation of seasons I note

in passing, smells
I cannot smell: rotting
gardens, feces, musk of cat. 
                                              These two       

run in front of me, golden
shoulder to patchwork, heads
lifted or lowered into

scent, tongues lolling. Ears
damp with their own
spittle and each other's

tell me, tethered a pace behind,
their journey's epic: tipping
forward to the familiar or
stranger's distant yap; angling

to my breathing, whispered
praise, my slightest
suggestion.

                                              Ignored. 
                                                          The shepherd 
throws herself into

any whirring wheel, to herd
the neighbor's tractor mower or
the UPS truck's packets
home; pulling her back,

the golden's oblivious
ballast, instinct heading
always for the gutter's

deepest puddle, her own way
within the forked leash's
one-foot range. As we pass,

the clans set up
their barking, as if we
were news, gathering center

of a congenial warning
din--mine answer with
disturbances of pace, an extra pull
or lollop, grins thrown

slant-eyed over shoulders
until one hears a call
she can't ignore, surrenders

to baying's ferocious
joy moving through
muscle and bone. Moving
storm, storm's eye: happy

universes whirl in their skins
as I do in mine. Unknowable,
their fate. Mediums between
foreign principalities, they're tied

to me, to each other, by my will,
by love; to that other realm
by song, and tooth, and blood.





Madmen
 

They say you can jinx a poem 
if you talk about it before it is done. 
If you let it out too early, they warn, 
your poem will fly away, 
and this time they are absolutely right. 

Take the night I mentioned to you 
I wanted to write about the madmen, 
as the newspapers so blithely call them, 
who attack art, not in reviews, 
but with breadknives and hammers 
in the quiet museums of Prague and Amsterdam. 

   Actually, they are the real artists, 
you said, spinning the ice in your glass. 
The screwdriver is their brush. 
The real vandals are the restorers, 
you went on, slowly turning me upside-down, 
the ones in the white doctor's smocks 
who close the wound in the landscape, 
and thus ruin the true art of the mad. 

I watched my poem fly down to the front 
of the bar and hover there 
until the next customer walked in-- 
then I watched it fly out the open door into the night 
and sail away, I could only imagine, 
over the dark tenements of the city. 

All I had wished to say 
was that art was also short, 
as a razor can teach with a slash or two, 
that it only seems long compared to life, 
but that night, I drove home alone 
with nothing swinging in the cage of my heart 
except the faint hope that I might 
catch a glimpse of the thing 
in the fan of my headlights, 
maybe perched on a road sign or a street lamp, 
poor unwritten bird, its wings folded, 
staring down at me with tiny illuminated eyes.





Taking the Thought for the Dog
 

I plan to be the world authority on peafowl. Believe I'll be offered a chair someday at the chicken college. --Flannery O'Connor
Certainly are nice
to want to give me that dog.
I raise peacocks--

you can't keep dogs
and them on the same place.
People come here

have to leave the dog in the car else the peachickens take to the trees

with nervous prostrations.
I have twenty-seven. Place
sounds like a jungle

at night. They yell
and scream at the least
atmospheric disturbance

or mechanical noise.
Sitting on the back steps, I spend
days studying how

they could decorate
the lawn to advantage. They prefer
to sit on the tractors,

the top of the chicken
house or garbage can lid. I adjust
to their taste, which

is anti-dog. Thanks
but I'll take the thought for
the dog. Appreciate

you wanting to give it.
Come visit. Nothing to do here
but sit, walk,

collect red bug bites,
show you a peacock before
his tail gets ratty.





Drizzle
 

Baudelaire: "The dead, the poor dead, have their bad hours." 
But the dead have no watches, no grief and no hours. 

At first not smoking took all my time: I did it 
a little by little and hour by hour. 

   Per diem. Pro bono. Cui bono? Pro rata. 
But the poor use English. Off and on. By the hour. 

   "I'm sorry but we'll have to stop now." There tick but 
fifty minutes in the psychoanalytic hour. 

Vengeance is mine, yours, his or hers, ours, yours again 
(you-all's this time), and then (yikes!) theirs. I prefer ours. 

Twenty minutes fleeing phantoms at full tilt and then 
the cat coils herself like a quoit and sleeps for hours.





Carlos
 

My first day leading the prison writing workshop: Carlos
complimented my choosing the chair nearest the door.

I read a poem by Whitman that once sent me hitchhiking
and Carlos stood up, asked to read a section from his four hundred-page work-in-progress,

a poem that turns on his first finding Neruda's "One Year Walk";
he said it lit up the night like a perfect crime, so I left everything--

I had no choice--walked three thousand miles to the Pacific.
From memory he recited a passage in which his father left the family

a small fortune, all counterfeit: though I doubted the facts, I can still see
that worn briefcase, almost-perfect hundreds stacked neatly in shrink-wrapped packs.

I was young, it took me two weeks to accept that I could teach this lifer
nothing. World of concrete floors and everlasting light:

he was grateful to God who gave him a blazing mind not granted to anyone living or dead,
and wouldn't have changed a word anyway.





Paths
 

We had two gardens. 

A real flower garden 
overhanging the road 
(our miniature Babylon). 
Paths which I helped 
to lay with Aunt Winifred, 
riprapped with pebbles; 
shards of painted delph; 
an old potato boiler; 
a blackened metal pot, 
now bright with petals. 

Hedges of laurel, palm. 
A hovering scent of boxwood. 
Crouched in the flowering 
lilac, I could oversee 
the main road, old Lynch 
march to the wellspring 
with his bucket, whistling, 
his carrotty sons herding 
in and out their milch cows: 
a growing whine of cars. 

Then, the vegetable garden 
behind, rows of broad beans 
plumping their cushions, 
the furled freshness of 
tight little lettuce heads, 
slim green pea pods above 
early flowering potatoes, 
gross clumps of carrots, 
parsnips, a frailty of parsley, 
a cool fragrance of mint. 

Sealed off by sweetpea 
clambering up its wired fence, 
the tarred goats' shack 
which stank in summer, 
in its fallow, stone-heaped corner. 

With, on the grassy margin, 
a well-wired chicken run, 
cheeping balls of fluff 
brought one by one into the sun 
from their metallic mother 
--the oil-fed incubator-- 
always in danger from 
the marauding cat, or 
the stealthy, hungry vixen: 
I, their small guardian. 

Two gardens, the front 
for beauty, the back 
for use. Sleepless now, 
I wander through both 
and it is summer again, 
the long summers of youth 
as I trace small paths 
in a trance of growth: 
flowers pluck at my coat 
as I bend down to help, 
or speak to my aunt, 
whose calloused hands 
caressing the plants 
are tender as a girl's.





Roots
 

Mendota, Illinois
It's easy to believe you can go back
Whenever you desire, jump in the car
And drive, arrive at dusk--the hour

You recall most vividly--and walk
Among the buildings spread across the farm,
Out toward the pastures, woods, and fields.

There is music in the leaves, in the dense
Columns of green corn. The wind lays down
The tune. You can play it, too, simply

By walking with eyes closed, arms
Stretched out, lightly striking the stalks.
Who wouldn't desire, like the children

Lost in so many similar fields,
To sit down on the turned earth and drift
Away on the rhythms of his own

First possible death? Rescuing
Voices come closer, veer off. Flashlight beams
Strobe over your head. You do not care.

Each building you remember--hen house,
Sheep shed, corn crib, barn--caved in upon itself,
The walls and roofs collapsing with a final

Percussive clap, since you last walked those fields.
No one you will ever know works that land now.
It is as green as Eden. Life rises in the roots, in the leaves.





Sometimes Never
 

Talking, we begin to find the way into 
our hearts, we who knew no words, 
words being a rare commodity 
in those countries we left behind. 

Both refugees and similarly deprived, 
we marvel at the many things there 
are to say: so many variations 
and colors of the same thought, so 

many different lengths in the words 
that line up together on our tongues. 
No scarcity, no rationing, no 
waiting in line in order to buy 

the same answer we heard each time 
we asked, that one word, owned by 
the state, manufactured by the state, 
serving all purposes equally alike: 
No, No, No, and sometimes Never.





Doppelte Nationalttsmoral/Dual Nationality: A Moral Tale
 

The socks
   red with a white star in a crescent moon
   the shoes black red gold
   are to many
   like a warm foot
   in cold shoe leather
   to others
   a double knot
   in
   a life only as long as a shoelace
   but for all that
   on hot coals

 Translated by Oliver Pauley 


 Die Socken
   rot mit weiem Stern in Sichelmond
   die Schuhe schwarz rot gold
   fr viele ist es
   wie ein warmer Fu
   im kalten Schuhwerk
   fr andere
   ein Doppelknoten
   in einem
   nur schnrsenkellangen Leben
   aber das
   auf heiem Boden





Die Verschwundenen/The Vanished
 

For Nelly Sachs
It wasn't the earth that swallowed them. Was it the air? 
Numerous as the sand, they did not become 
sand, but came to naught instead. They've been forgotten 
in droves. Often, and hand in hand, 
       
like minutes. More than us, 
but without memorials. Not registered, 
not cipherable from dust, but vanished-- 
their names, spoons, and footsoles. 
       
They don't make us sorry. Nobody 
can remember them: Were they born, 
did they flee, have they died? They were 
not missed. The world is airtight 
yet held together 
by what it does not house, 
by the vanished. They are everywhere. 
       
Without the absent ones, there would be nothing. 
Without the fugitives, nothing is firm. 
Without the forgotten, nothing for certain. 
       
The vanished are just. 
That's how we'll fade, too.

Fr Nelly Sachs 

Nicht die Erde hat sie verschluckt. War es die Luft? 
Wie der Sand sind sie zahireich, doch nicht zu Sand 
sind sie geworden, sondern zu nichte. In Scharen 
sind sie vergessen. Hufig und Hand in Hand, 
       
wie die Minuten. Mehr als wir, 
doch ohne Andenken. Nicht verzeichnet, 
nicht abzulesen im Staub, sondern verschwunden 
sind ihre Namen, Lffel und Sohlen. 
       
Sie reuen uns nicht. Es kann sich niemand 
auf sie besinnen: Sind sie geboren, 
geflohen, gestorben? Vermit 
sind sie nicht worden. Lckenlos 
ist die Welt, doch zusammengehalten 
von dem was sie nicht behaust, 
von den Verschwundenen. Sie sind berall. 
       
Ohne die Abwesenden wre nichts da. 
Ohne die Flchtigen wre nichts fest. 
Ohne die Vergessenen nichts gewi. 
       
Die Verschwundenen sind gerecht. 
So verschallen wir auch.





Ach/Last Call
 

Right up to my final hour 
I'll be obliging and polite. 
Should I hear death firmly knocking, 
I'll blithely shout: Come in all right! 
       
What's on the schedule? Dying, is it? 
Well, that's something rather new. 
But I'm sure that we can swing it, 
showing them a thing or two. 
       
What is this? Your hourglass? 
Interesting! And good to grasp. 
And the scythe is for grim reaping, 
did you say? I thought I'd ask. 
       
Which way should I turn from here? 
To the left? From where you stand? 
Well, all right then. To the graveyard? 
Where I take my final hand? 
       
Yes, the glass is out of sand now. 
Oh, I see, you want it back. 
May I ask you where you got it? 
So unusual, all in black. 
       
Is it antique? Oh well, whatever. 
I only meant to ask, old chap-- 
What? No questions? No more talking? 
That's fine by me. I'll shut my--
