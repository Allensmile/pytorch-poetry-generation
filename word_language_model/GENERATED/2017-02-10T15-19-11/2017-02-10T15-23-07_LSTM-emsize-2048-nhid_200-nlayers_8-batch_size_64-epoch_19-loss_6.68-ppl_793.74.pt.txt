A BOY 

 who i didn't know, north-northeast, 
 explaining on that, my hair 
 in the gasp of night 
 
 still this woman 
 seemed never quarks. 
 i'm snowing 
 
 and asked it 
 that wasn't red-rusted 
 it's lak 
 to my own brother. 
 no traffic so worse 
 than things of a poet. 
 
 
 
 
 . urine 
 
 corinna, mornings, bolivia. inside my lord. i do 
 hold dust from the apple and she is very older,
