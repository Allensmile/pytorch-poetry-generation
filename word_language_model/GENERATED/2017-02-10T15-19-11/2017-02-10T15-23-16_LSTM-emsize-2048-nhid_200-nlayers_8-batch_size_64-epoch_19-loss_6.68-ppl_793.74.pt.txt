. IS THE BLACK 

 land on the costume of spatial summers, he was 
 alive in doll and the slaps circumambient 
 
 stilted already maples' the 
 little cosmos and the very 
 man's northern grief, a defective apron 
 which pushes air through the 
 house of sugar bark. 
 punish me real enough, then, here during 
 all 
 cloud and ropes 
 are ready not 
 
 stumbling 
 and 
 
 would not say 
 but is you 
 getting past
