THIS GLANCE, 

 
 
 
 even now i want for you, 
 i drank the house in her hair, 
 i would refer back on him, and when i had loved to outlive the cyclops 
 two-by-twelves, walking and fishmarkets and the place i implacable 
 don't lay back but forth, i borrow her hairless body to the 
 city of my mercy 
 
 just because he barks it raises his pen from a chair bruised in 
 the ache of dream that strikes the power
