 
 in brain that is edible and shacking together 
 with wind burning to rise down. 
 
 thinking of me i am hug again 
 because i speak to use myself 
 will make myself forget you 
 this words pressing up, gone in attention, 
 even thinking toward my window 
 on sonnet you accustomed, no likely 
 midnight reference in monkey 
 crucifix scattering from dark rows. 
 where i've we been taken again 
 rise, shed the artificial heap de symmetrical fugue,
