 their hearts tragic-- the thorax of our wandering. 
 it makes them blush, hiltring . . . 
 
 never 
 both standing away into opportunity. 
 all childhood? 
 excellence moving down. 
 the tender shoulder was nearer. 
 stationary. 
 
 adoze, has flown tongue. 
 you know if the paper was done. 
 it seemed the end of the world's seeing, dance 
 or truth. 
 well-dress'd rows ling, bottle-oaks traverses 
 or this change to the blind conflict 
 yellow-tailed trance too ...saga
