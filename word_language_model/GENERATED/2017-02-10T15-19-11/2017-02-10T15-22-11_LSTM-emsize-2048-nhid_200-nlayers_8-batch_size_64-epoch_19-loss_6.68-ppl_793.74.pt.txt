 a man drags --'tis of glass, prompt 
 of something not yet. 
 
 do he want him book, but 
 another guy is never 
 
 since i was there, high-cut berrigan 
 hey and inspiration to see that means 
 
 whenever all things knew it. 
 more here than a boot awake 
 
 until the oxen sometimes was easy 
 with his bed on his lap, 
 
 and bound my soft eyes, climbs his lips away 
 into the first
