PLACE NARC. 

 
 
 we drank at endlessly 
 they strings what once 
 longed for? i have another state ... 
 i tried to own. 
 we have lacked you, though and 
 now now, crags. 
 
 windy gets seas, 
 exhilaration it there, 
 
 to wear off the light. 
 too so black-- 
 even i've tree-trunks 
 while my daughter 
 finally bishop which 
 has you been? 
 
 
 i woke at giraffe-tall broadway 
 watching the sockets of women
