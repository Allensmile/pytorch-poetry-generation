 minds i crudely, what goes 
 riches is born 
 or looks among what 
 miserable grade machines 
 unlocked all day, with one light i 
 like a scamander. you 
 came to the belly--coral, mackinaw, 
 â€œOrganic main-sledge, 
 listen to the orange 
 we didn't share 
 the missing which 
 our bantling, 
 tell what it took weeping 
 at school. a cramped 
 log blue 
 
 as island can be 
 serious so high, 
 
 
 seeing blackouts bulluc
