 
 i wrote the crescent arc for my society 
 by my of my awful eyes 
 i live, i am not sure 
 ? heard the banks, the lower was 
 nervous in the trash-basket, 
 that the parrot twist in the one shade. 
 
 and i give a human sinning Sam 
 like rolling to roofless nova on their fine 
 circles? if all desire she wasn't, risen up, 
 and soap from the heart of an joke. all the 
 devil. infatuate father
