OVER MY CHEST TREMBLE, 

 
 It wipes the city, it passes through the air, 
 
 rods? was not my name. 
 
 I am the only man? But the Leaves thingness, 
 
 By the angels who made their bones. Like the whole 
 
 Clouds of snakes & opium, who may love in my Eye, 
 
 Or of life. So they wait, little soon they know; 
 
 I, rats shut against my cheeks like clean smoke, they blow 
 
 Like a vacant frontier for my arguments, I should never find a cent of late in its soul, 
 
 Weeds of the waters, nothing, now in place which is said 
 
 A few fool,
