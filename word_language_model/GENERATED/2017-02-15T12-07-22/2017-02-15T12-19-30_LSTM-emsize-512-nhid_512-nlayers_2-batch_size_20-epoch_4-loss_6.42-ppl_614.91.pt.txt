 
 Smoke blue of evening gleams 
 
 wafting a bud to the ocean, far too low 
 
 Into too thin formulate 
 
 But the faint joy of the . "three-inch 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 When I Hear The List 
 
 
 No child hath swept these hands for my lips on my downward ear. 
 The greenwood leaves of my skull is no song, 
 That too may mean say more than a woman 
 Making her for inviting it; in some dull embrace 
 You are as usual as you never; 
 
 Would you learn how doesn't even be did you there? 
 Take the melancholy dissolving, come and sing,
