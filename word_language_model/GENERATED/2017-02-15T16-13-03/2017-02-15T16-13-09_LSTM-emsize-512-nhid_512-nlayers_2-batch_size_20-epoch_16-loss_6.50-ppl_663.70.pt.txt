MAY VALUE 

 The fashion else I show'd. 
 
 It is to overflow its own 
 And wealth first, as a race shall make, 
 Why exchange me; God lets all the day 
 Almost the same dust, or Adios!' to, 
 For part of what resembled a chain 
 To place some time? So, to feel this, 
 Unless I left it, boldly 
 Or you or I were done or doing, 
 A moment's shipyard ban 
 An important emissary Faustine. 
 
 The chaplain
