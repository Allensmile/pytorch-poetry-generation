ANTIQUITY 

 Who made me already, and saying that hair 
 Was arrows of themselves, and she was given 
 Her breast still; the pure and loude. 
 
 The sea's arms were brown her lids so white 
 Were pink and ocean, longing to be seen, 
 Some sustenance in that still one note blood more 
 And there above these heads as yet she were born 
 As many as kinds of tiny voices, 
 As who like these, like paper or stains upon the lake.
