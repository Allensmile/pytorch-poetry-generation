CAME ON 

 
 In a family in prayer, when we 
 Was our chance among our brother: 
 Prais'd be the woods with sandy borders 
 Garlands, round and thin white hands; 
 O'er every encircle! ray lasting. 
 
 All night we heard that sea contains 
 Her thighs broke out of water, like 
 The blue lilies 
 A Lawyers' eye, 
 The first and fresh in the stilly dark, 
 The moon that danced it; sipping, Embrace 
 Of oppression and Bacon's folds.
