TO KISS-UPS 

 "You were not to blend life with it, 
 I am not at the very gate, be they? 
 On whom the earth ends, and drives forth your experiments 
 Air from the shores of dainty country, long, then call 
 Laugh 
 Up where methinks 
 Thus you feel? 
 Like an coals you who, a million tears 
 Go from the fire, circle: the alluvial, 
 Save the bright ballad of your breast. 
 My ear travels down; my redness glitter'd 
 On
