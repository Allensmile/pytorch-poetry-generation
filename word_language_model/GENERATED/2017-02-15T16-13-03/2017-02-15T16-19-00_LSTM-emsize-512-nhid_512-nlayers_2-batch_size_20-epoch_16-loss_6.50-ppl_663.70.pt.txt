 circumstances. with all and say) 
 My deserving blue round the briny lark, 
 Who measures separately 
 As had been "Guarded 
 Under the faces of the dawn 
 Where they must be, without much held high 
 Out of their chains so high till still

 And schools and pebbles decay, 
 One comes, a lull round my hands, mine a grief, 
 Far, far
