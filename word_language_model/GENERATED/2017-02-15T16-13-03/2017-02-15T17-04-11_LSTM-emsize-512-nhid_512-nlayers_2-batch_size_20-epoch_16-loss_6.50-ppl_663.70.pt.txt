SAT IN THEM FOREIGN-BORN DECORUM, 

 They think they both will call him, the dying. 
 
 The days like ships spread round it undiminished rage, 
 Another larger and Born after kings, 
 Like the most intense alien dream. 
 From every far coast. Where is the moment's feet, 
 Not earnest for the ages that their fathers live, 
 If they be glad in regret, whether they combing, 
 (Shoal! new mourners may in seventy use, 
 Such as you curtsey hath fail with you
