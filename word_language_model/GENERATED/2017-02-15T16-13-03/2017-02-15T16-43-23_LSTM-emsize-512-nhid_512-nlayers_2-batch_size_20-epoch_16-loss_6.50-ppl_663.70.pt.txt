IN MILD MEN'S EYES 

 The children of my mother would take him for him 
 As one eats the last, Vertues, lust, 
 And Deliberately it comes Fire; 
 And the same, who loves him to die "probe," 
 Has he gulf, and still have fall or Willow 
 Takes people's communion. 
 
 . . . 
 
 Now the old light leaves down in the east, 
 
 Let the winged sleeper's woman's go, 
 THEREFORE, native world, and henceforth Luvah 
 Is Elanor still,
