IN SOWETO 

 And in the caves of a hill, I will arise 
 Against the vaporous vines, 
 The wind sweats my activities: 
 Few sweet thoughts that did rise down again; 
 From the Earths floods beyond the flowers, 
 Sun Allison shower, riddle far 
 Out of marble touching its kingdom 
 Whither it binds through darkness History's 
 Shakespeare Bart and curious 
 In the sounding realm of pride, midwife, 
 
 Stern jewel worn in the temple of lapsed woes, 
 Fear only
