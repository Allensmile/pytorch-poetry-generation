LIE AFRAID, 

 and serious. 
 Wang claws. beard he awoke 
 with an unimaginable eye. 
 
 
 
 
 
 I Will Not Peoples but begin 
 
 
 You don't think of an old young man 
 who pours ash, photographs or chicken in his fortune 
 died after your name Gia 
 Lost You part; write it, 
 
 your father's Homework 
 makes you sense 
 the way you look out at cups 
 I can't even forget, 
 another movie you've come
