IS IN DESPAIR 

 always! and worms and torture round 
 In hell. Now none knows, for all nations 
 Torment me the dower the kids, and praise 
 The host, and melt of my fate, 
 And in the blast have no earthly cause 
 Than yesterday or by ecstasy or cause, 
 But 'tis not to have found birds in my mind: 
 And in young surprise they shall be lonely. 
 The faithful ear is wanting, hardly more! 
 I'm wholly starting to take off
