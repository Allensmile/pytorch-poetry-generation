IS NOW PAINTING WITH WATER. 

 Maybe one feels possibly to melodyI 
 The body of another life. 
 
 
 We make it holy 
 Who can sit on the night or die! is the rain 
 Who knows how Dean. No flowers, but not until nothing 
 Is now to touch. Having it right, will play like a man 
 Some desire you'll wince in the widow's agony, 
 Though it doesn't matter being perfect. 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Pilgrim of Love
