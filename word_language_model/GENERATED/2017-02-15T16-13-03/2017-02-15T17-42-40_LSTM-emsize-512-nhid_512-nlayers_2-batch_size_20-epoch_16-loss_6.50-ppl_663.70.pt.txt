 
 The posting Hope, a poet blessed 
 At his day's cellar as I clinging, 
 I behold, I think a thousand heavy Assel 
 You remember of your children whom we list 
 To see rockmud better than sick Die 
 A great goddess grumble to the end, 
 Where the Echo is a foure and not bait 
 With wanton braille to judges, 
 As the carpet, structure the lights 
 Of the properly candlelit infinitesimal 
 ... We can attempt to admit a grief
