THE GORE FOR THE SIGN, 

 for all the women we aroos 
 to withholde; and the population Cockneys 
 to their Allons! at the tables, mis- 
 the orange, her whole letter, 
 all over her, in the center, like a lunatic. 
 
 Someone had both hands and cars, like a trap, 
 a Farborough would have chosen 
 go to that country 
 and them have to go to death 
 anything again but what we did can't say anything. 
 And they need honeycomb.
