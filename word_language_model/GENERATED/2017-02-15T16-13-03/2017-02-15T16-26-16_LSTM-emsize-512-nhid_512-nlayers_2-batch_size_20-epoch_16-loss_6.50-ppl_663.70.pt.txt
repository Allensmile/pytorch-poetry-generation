IN ORDER TO SPEAK, 

 and heavy sounds and in cynna 
 awaking, shoulders of the great 
 camps that lie on their own busier 
 while the books of mankind to bone, 
 All over a state of Spades 
 filling up the seasonal fields 
 and listen to the fight of their lives. 
 
 Where has kept colors from the #31 
 brown hoofs of substantial temples, 
 Thompson green roads, bilge. 
 Weir-- And the mailboxes, 
 the knuckles, the limbless hieroglyphics, 
 juice
