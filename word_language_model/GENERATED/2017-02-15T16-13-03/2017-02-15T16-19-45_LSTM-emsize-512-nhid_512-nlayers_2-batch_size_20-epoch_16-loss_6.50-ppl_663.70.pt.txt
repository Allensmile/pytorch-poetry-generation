WAR, AS FAR AS LIFE, 

 And how much mourners have to die? 
 
 Sighs but a little space where the mind meant 
 To the spirit that comes down now. 
 The violins at last are drunk in the cold, 
 Longer than a leaf or a death, 
 Could you gain--or my whining page misery!' 
 brains; itself quiet? 
 I'se I Arts, wear your koi observations 
 Body slaves full blazing beaver familiarity, 
 blackest cobwebs hurry into 'sperunce 
 Wi' a drunken Gasping
