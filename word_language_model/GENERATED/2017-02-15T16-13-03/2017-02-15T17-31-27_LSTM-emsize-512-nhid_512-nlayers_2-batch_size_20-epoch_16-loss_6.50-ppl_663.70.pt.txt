OF THE BEGINNING 

 Made for weeks before. 
 
 All right, I will dance to an Kierra bowl and 
 new smell of water-- blazing action; 
 yet calm weather too soon, 
 so small it is alive, 
 knowing it is perfect. 
 There are terror 
 of things in which 
 there is nothing to be tearing 
 It's free. Instead of someone else 
 I am an Defend 
 I am a few old fellow who loved me 
 was this time I was
