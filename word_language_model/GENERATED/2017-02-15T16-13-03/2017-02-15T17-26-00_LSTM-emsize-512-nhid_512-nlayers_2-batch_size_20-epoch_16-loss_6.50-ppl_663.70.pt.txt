 guess the fly is level when is plain 
 and I am not altogether free 
 or ritual, though long since the heart 
 that climbs high to command, 
 a sky springs, some waiting, just warm and dry, 
 both fires to their lips beside the grass, 
 and rise into the house. 
 
 
 Imputed will I stay home 
 in 'bout? 
 I have wandered 
 with a jackal mills 
 and a leaf tick-pulsed, 
 Hear me, and you and I three-room
