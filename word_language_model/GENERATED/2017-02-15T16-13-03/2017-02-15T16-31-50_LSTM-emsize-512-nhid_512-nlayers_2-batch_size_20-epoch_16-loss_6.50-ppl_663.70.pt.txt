CHERUBE, 

 And let the spill pass, and then come, 
 As if in silence it were his name. 
 
 And now he did not coming, his hands were shut. 
 Whenever he turned his brother to those black feet shone, 
 Which when his strength did find their gentle form 
 He would not weep. 
 
 But our guns were lovely, on the hill, 
 Beautiful as rain goes down to sleep; 
 The youngest ever was blown, 
 Or the smoke, but the pains
