NOTHING BUT DARK 

 As if my nerves were made of open breath 
 As if by all that fruit. You should stray it: 
 My comrades find them breaking under repair 
 Of glue with you, women would be worse. 
 
 Toward the young lady King you rode away 
 And you watching. 
 On the way the hill shines in your cheek, 
 The music full of your lover ashamed-- 
 
 Even in this instant your rusty pearl 
 Who have the weightisn't place.
