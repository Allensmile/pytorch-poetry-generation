LAST AUGUST 

 butterfly has lifted that, a hole 
 Factioning honey on the line; the body fashioned 
 By a sense of pain near war-lord 
 
 Like earlier water water sounds the ghost 
 Of sweetness vertically running into an echo 
 Of color, paths borrowed with soda. I hammer 
 Some will show the falsification bed 
 I hold the deer on. I think of you, 
 "Once well I know. I keep Dad.
