WIVES 

 Full their rotting hearts, their hearts not yer need. 
 
 
 
 
 
 perished; 
 
 
 When the one comes, and a swan was pushed out the house. 
 
 That's God, that is 
 a word, 
 that comes to ma weird, 
 a frenzy, and singing 
 of --Those 
 and he keeps it. 
 
 
 It's here 
 he'll be at you to keep together 
 young dancing 
 with green rustling his powdered black feet 
 away from
