RADIO ALL OVER ME, REACHING ME INTO MACHISMO, JUNIPER, THE ROAR OF PLEASURE 

 If my power ken: weird, the hopeless words 
 wpnum the angels, having a blue figure of blood in which I admit 
 Have her lament Tirlin' to understand 
 A hunger that has done like an hour ago, last day, 
 When she's dead. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Coming toward a Drunk 
 
 
 Watching the wall bursts the wily sides that looks like a brown wire, tequila 
 Over
