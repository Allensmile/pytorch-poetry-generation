 Nature came by sleep, and forests came 
 With eggs aloud, with lucid heat; 
 Far, far behind the dawn, they blew 
 The little silver sobs to see 
 Have passed, and on their thrones and tears 
 That floats above her as in any sphere. 
 
 Sure, through what care it feels for me? 
 The forest leaves were white with fortunes and Severely 
 Sick in the panting wail and multiform 
 --its passing whistling." 
 hail! In rhymes is twenty-eighth sunny stones,
