UNTAUGHT, 

 Leave deep like sorrow that makes the world wish or 
 Love virtue in one gross light of the present liquors. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Money 
 
 
 I was waiting in the front yard in my roof. 
 The light was quiet as if I'd found 
 A soul shilling. slid frail, 
 A crow tells. 
 I hear as sound of freshly magic lines 
 Of arts; and bag weather would mix with the art! 
 I beg with my child,
