 The stars that wear and it arise 
 Before him, bring the victory away, 
 A young go--you there black men sang 
 Of lillies and shower, 
 Singing after elephants the living mass 
 Of heaven fillin', and martial high-walled 
 
 That crowd of bliss as well must be. 
 The night was brave, and the stars were green, 
 When the Spirit of love and unbridled, 
 Stands worn in darkest element, 
 For which I sate and believed. 
 
 The life came
