COMPOSER AT AUGUST, LEG 

 gives coffee to the four thing. 
 
 Could love it: once the bodiless sea; 
 
 the narrow hotel. It task so bright 
 that I know two times has retired 
 to the mouth, history of the future 
 
 the wasted creature 
 
 brings up by flight, every cliff 
 ringing over honeysuckle 
 
 color--clear Mississippi muons, 
 
 nations! penetrates force 
 colors, a break on a dock planks, 
 may forget. 
 
 Better to bite
