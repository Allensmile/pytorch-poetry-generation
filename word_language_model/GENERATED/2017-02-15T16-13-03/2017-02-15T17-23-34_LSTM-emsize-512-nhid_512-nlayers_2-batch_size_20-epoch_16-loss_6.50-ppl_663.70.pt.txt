 In windy perspective written 
 By a strange punks 
 With humiliation and luminescence with age; 
 
 Through the holes that shine 
 And genesis of the evening, 
 axletrees. Go, remember me 
 If I lived a poem, I forgot last night, 
 And I knew I was kind. 
 
 III. The chatters; 
 Deserted, spaces in its sleep. 
 We recall that dream but 
 For the garment of it licodon, 
 Like the owne: 
 With funk, 
 This is carbuncle.
