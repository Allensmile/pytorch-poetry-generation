 peace) my youth dreams rises, I think, 
 Pizza and new my heart? 
 
 Take your truth? How will you turn 
 The gleanings of your air? 
 So you are strange mamas, 
 Come back, look fat at your peeling, daringly 
 
 Choose you s dirty store so hinc 
 What, Walt, you'll be, posting your verse away. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Light Begins 
 
 
 Look! THE ol' December Born!" We will be alone 
 Deep in the vocabulary
