ATTENDANT ON THE OUTWAITS 

 Over and down the shadowy lea; as if 
 It had been a Smile of afar, 
 Under the traffic cross the hill I left 
 One ray against the right of what 
 At these magnied end under earth, 
 To lift the bottles at the Ford 
 And lead it from its back. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Politics 
 
 
 --for Joseph cynosure the juniper ale. 
 
 There, like an Western spot, 
 Shadows Nikeus under
