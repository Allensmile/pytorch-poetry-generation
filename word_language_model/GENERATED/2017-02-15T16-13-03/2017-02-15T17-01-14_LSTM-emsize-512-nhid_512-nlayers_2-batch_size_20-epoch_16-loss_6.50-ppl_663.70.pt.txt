UP AT DAWN 

 Through the torn and worn black panther 
 
 Street covered with ragged ash 
 I woke to the surface 
 of the old ones, who last morning. 
 
 The dogs, both waters said, 
 patio fists of wood, 
 and sweet, one of them, 
 remediless, 
 caustic hats, full 
 of water upside down to ring 
 now the dinghy, pardon. 
 
 And Dazzling in seems 
 under a low wave, high, 
 meat a yellow seat on memory
