 Where the room by night in the ocean 
 a full lens and watched a generation 
 Nursing the torrent 
 wink-wink merganser's 
 disappears into the rocks 
 Full of horror. 
 
 Blue knotty rage 
 waters, pink garden 
 To the old palls 
 Of chemical fethers, 
 heard the still warm changes come long. 
 
 When they roll the rugged'st guard 
 The small stepfather's way. 
 
 Such ice is the surge of hell 
 The old bat
