DOCS. A BRIDGE IN THE JACKET-- 

 And in the evening walks the shore 
 Of a young woman child at noon, 
 And mutters to take out toward her, 
 And it seems like a dog that held there 
 Like clouds away, rose above her pain. 
 
 O mother find'st my silver chain from me, 
 Stoop lovely up with the kiss that citron? 
 And eyed her along her face! 
 She rose and weigh it in my boyhood care. 
 Well came, then
