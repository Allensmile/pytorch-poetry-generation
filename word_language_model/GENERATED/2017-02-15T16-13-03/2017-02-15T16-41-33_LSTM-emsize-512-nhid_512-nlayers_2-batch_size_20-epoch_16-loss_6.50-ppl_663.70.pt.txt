TO WALK AND TAKE 

 The skull inside her eyes and make no sound. 
 
 12 
 The clouds of men are large, and all 
 They insist with the roar that hum them through 
 And bathed at their Kew in the caves 
 Of the pond raindrops pulsing like the forest, 
 brainwaves. neighborhoods. Kansas, 
 And they are house for currants 
 
 Like the sun through rushing rivers 
 Like underfoot. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Foul saintly,
