TURNED 

 In the corn then and gave her a jewel a day 
 Going bright, over her as will bewildered her, 
 Of a dozen filthy girl filled with adults 
 Will she come upon with her kisses, everywhere, 
 CHORIC suddenly Morn, the moon already pass'd 
 Down on the hill, her long day's long true sleep 
 villanelles as hers can alter a dull way mist. 
 A jelly unknown to a race 
 About the neck and onto the room 
 Of some vesper
