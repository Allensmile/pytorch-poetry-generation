LOY, 

 
 I answer in my pocket-- perhaps thou hast no part, 
 So I drew my tie, like a silver feast of flowers, 
 And I saw should'st contemplate sleep first in side for death; 
 There was no end to remark it could have been we-- 
 That people could do or better, who shall lie then, 
 And will not deal and return why Pernicious 
 Thou prayeth human lamentations 
 On the wreckages and the bellowing shaken. 
 
 
 
 V.
