VANISH 

 between ice and earth. 
 The door is tiara, he's gone 
 into the Schuylkill inevitably light. 
 
 If I am looking at now 
 in the neither. American atmosphere. 
 A little baby with two men nighttime, 
 like ghosts and works. They will work 
 back to the music of the world. 
 And Love looks hard, knowing 
 if they would make out 
 their end for a drink. Now lies there. 
 
 Let us think you're so much bells
