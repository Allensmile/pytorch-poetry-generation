 And heard and played it with smooth hair 
 And wearing a drift, 
 And in one tumultuous room, not really quite fast. 
 I offered a way that I settled on one day 
 As a man for my walk, corrupt a child like a manic stool 
 Like a Man in a lattice sketch of the wind 
 Gray of his young interpreter. All it was tender, 
 With his brother. Then she came and said, 
 Her face could drive on. bawd, Emily,
