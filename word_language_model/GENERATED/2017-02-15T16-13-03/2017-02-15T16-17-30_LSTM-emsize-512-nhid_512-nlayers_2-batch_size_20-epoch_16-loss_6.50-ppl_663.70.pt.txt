GLASSES 

 
 from the parking sense, 
 dealer, splattering a Sholes, 
 
 What seems frely in a bust of plainly: 
 maybe, here's an inch. 
 How survives 
 a journey as more than grass, routine 
 
 of silver-suited fingers 
 in this world 
 the prospect 
 
 of finding itself 
 inside the world 
 grew like a snake a cell 
 
 Sound, amidst the instant 
 of the broken 
 steel and the 
 
 earth-- a cup; its eggs rush
