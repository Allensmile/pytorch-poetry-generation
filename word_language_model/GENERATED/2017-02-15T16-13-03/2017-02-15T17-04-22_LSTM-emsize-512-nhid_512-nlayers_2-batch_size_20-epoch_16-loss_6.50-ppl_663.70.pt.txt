 In my America, found and disappear, 
 For it stirs here, like shrined of name, 
 Something luster or never yours 
 In your whole sense I'm sure 
 Of right Size, so picked out 
 I see a saint. ohi 
 endangered clay-sucked clinging its passport ...

 Your body has grown vultures 
 exposed by 
 Atlanta, gone lingering 
 
 
 An conception loveliness 
 To dwell,
