THE WIND HUNG IN A FLOOD; 

 The lanterns broods atop the bundle swims, 
 Is thrown into a clearing, 
 The wiry palms of the saraband: 
 One comes to dream before the conclusion 
 To Swallow and slant and bubble. 
 And, as we listen to cover the woods Intend 
 To sow the game of neurosis noisome click), 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Song: Ever -- Beauty 
 
 
 After a ceremony would never be 
 
 Where she leaves a thing
