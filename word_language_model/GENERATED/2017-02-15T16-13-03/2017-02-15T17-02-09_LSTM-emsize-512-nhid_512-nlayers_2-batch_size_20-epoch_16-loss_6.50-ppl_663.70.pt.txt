THE DUSK 

 is the one of those who hope to remember the city's field 
 through the steel-blue flats and their barren towers, 
 coughs by electric rhythm but perhaps except if 
 at home or when we marry arrive 
 at the Storm open anchor toward the thin toilet, 
 overhead, sun, all rustling dwells? even as white 
 as the crab before the gushing leftover 
 Shepherds, golden pleasures. The stranger's wonder. 
 What doesn't drink its sins that is, 
 the way it may
