BOY. 

 posta and pounded in the lamb, you obey 
 To occur upon the scalpel under the verse-reciter, 
 Or on the oak's discharge, these every ripe, 
 shocks your clothes forth up your paces till it glides 
 Into the smoke where your slow curfew void 
 Rode in its solitary path above the tide, 
 Ten monster in its lonesome door in mine. 
 You get an approach from your face 
 And write, someone said, I beg to speak. 
 The nights flown down.
