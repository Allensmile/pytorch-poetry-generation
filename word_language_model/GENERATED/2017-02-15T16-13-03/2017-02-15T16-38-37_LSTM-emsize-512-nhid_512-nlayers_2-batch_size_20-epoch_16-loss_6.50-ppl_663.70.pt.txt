LOIS! 

 With at the close fern's confines his throat 
 With dewy banners on the Land-mark sign 
 Till 'neath her throat to Ireland 
 No compound's tide. 
 And no loss of food nor care 
 Full of weakness, she has pow'r in Heav'n: 
 Or of come will have to come again, 
 But send no breathing to its parent violence, 
 But back there beats black leaves for Christ to run. 
 
 
 
 
 
 One Above the Funeral
