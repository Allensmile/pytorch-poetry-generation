ROGUISH IN THE PUPAE 

 making the memoirs call for 
 Destinies! Everything was like a bird in a jail in hell 
 In one of instance, 
 Or God, with forgotten love, not to make it more 
 But I child; within this tomb 
 diseased by one's life in convicts small. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Introduction to Divine 
 
 
 At the worlds of Love 
 A little, among by summer drifts 
 Old men awake through Caresses, 
 through walks warm
