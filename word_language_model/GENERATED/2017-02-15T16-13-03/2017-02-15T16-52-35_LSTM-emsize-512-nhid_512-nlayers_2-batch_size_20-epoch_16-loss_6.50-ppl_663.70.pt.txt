DAWN. . . . 

 
 And our boiled Tampico, when the flawless guns 
 wails like miles off the Russian lane 
 Into the mountainside. like another angle 
 Between two unseen jawed hands 
 The bodies of the ribald bear, 
 Making the chief and wisest in our Philosophies 
 The clinch hugged by bone kidded, 
 --Curious Who grew Shrivelling on the scalloped freeway 
 In British grimace; and caves in redoubl'd or glade, 
 (Shoal! head-- shoal!) Not I! 
 
 Virtually and stye,
