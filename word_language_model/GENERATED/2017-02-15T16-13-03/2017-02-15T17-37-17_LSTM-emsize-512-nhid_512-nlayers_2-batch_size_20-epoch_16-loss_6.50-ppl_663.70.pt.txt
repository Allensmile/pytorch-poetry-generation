HOUSES 

 imminence in the spring with stone 
 And hands my ears away 
 
 (A hundred couple stood 
 Wept as I stood 
 at the bottom of the beach 
 through the scalpel of heaven. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Amorist 
 
 
 Everything is in repetition for? 
 
 II. 
 So how we come back at last, 
 aye, breath, 
 whatever you joke, or 
 silence 
 
 and forget how 
 Grand garment 
 might admit you
