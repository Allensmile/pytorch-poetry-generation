TO THE WORLD MIDDLE DOORS. 

 
 XVII 
 Subway fruit long Evil, days divan. old 
 and six shades covered from the pumps, 
 Warming goodbye's Songs Santana's Marconi, 
 
 "well, crispening suffering and powder and blues does swift-chasing 
 Breathe our pillars done again with hopes and place her home. 
 
 Boa 
 
 And Gods are mornings Embalmed or, when 
 blossoms. We stare at Phbus become 
 eclipsing breath of making fine curls, 
 Composed of marsh's lash on its candlestick
