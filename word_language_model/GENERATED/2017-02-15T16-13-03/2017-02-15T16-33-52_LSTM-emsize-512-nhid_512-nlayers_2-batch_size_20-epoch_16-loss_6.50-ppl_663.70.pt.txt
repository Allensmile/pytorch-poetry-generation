LEAVE 

 on the back of earth. 
 I want a clearing Mesquite 
 because there is a secret distance 
 
 for all I tell about and asked, and so 
 
 I'm too. I don't like this because is? 
 
 The crows will not selfishness, 
 
 The blue hunters swam by their tight rings 
 
 every granite deer, material & act 
 inside running & their scars 
 
 bulging with pants. The sand flaps 
 like a uncarved, under a flute,
