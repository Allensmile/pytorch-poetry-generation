REMINDS AMOROUS 

 Let me stop as she passes in; 
 Open with my heart for a lover. 
 
 Chief, her tricks with hands, make her 
 Troubles 
 Devil, 
 Will she delight 
 Good pleasures soon 
 
 
 
 
 
 Meditation morrows Bus 
 
 
 Go-whe-lv-i: press your loom, turn away hat, I lift bare hands open, not." sow with your hips, crumble lips, eyes stabbed the long into my eyes, records of years upon scarred, lived. Tell me about this others.
