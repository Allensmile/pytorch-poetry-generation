FROMUM BY TWO 

 Who wile. impossible 
 Something in the simplest of Miriam's Browning 
 Who Meadows maun seize the liner in the reopening 
 And dull shadow! Village 
 Nearly the holy iron-shouldered the coming wide; 
 The man in his eye-- 
 
 Old Zodiac do'. Wenlock knits-- 
 The unicorn covering dead new prize. 
 
 Mild he knows that, like a falcon 
 Or lost comes out on sauna, one fits 
 Before some alliterative something nothing 
 Drinking out the saints.
