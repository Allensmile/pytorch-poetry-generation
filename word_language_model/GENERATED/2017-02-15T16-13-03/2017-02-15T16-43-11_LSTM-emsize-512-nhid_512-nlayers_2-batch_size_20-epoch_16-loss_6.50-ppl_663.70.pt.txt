LIQUOR AND SLIPPERY VANISHING 

 White noisy! There, by the sea, by behind the Mister Lake borders 
 
 hollows. 
 Oh blonde, applaudin' grasses and seeping breasts Accordingly 
 The last dray of a Nation, is carried into a string. 
 "It's drunk, telling me this if I meant to see it all. 
 Now I can do something, something about the blacktop 
 Sea correction. dusting the walls of his room and fill my skin, 
 Up which got spring, behind; glitter above. 
 
 Sick
