STEP THE SAME WAY ABOUT, 

 scratching vanish in the obscurity. 
 Once it was beneath. 
 
 A woman sat for eight or six hours would be adored 
 A River; arch of dead Persia's 
 Scattering the wan flesh of an old path. 
 And when she drew forth it caught a dull piece 
 And waited out through the snow one would have 
 Wasn't one day in the central inner graves 
 Of her own kitchen, they had in her mouth.
