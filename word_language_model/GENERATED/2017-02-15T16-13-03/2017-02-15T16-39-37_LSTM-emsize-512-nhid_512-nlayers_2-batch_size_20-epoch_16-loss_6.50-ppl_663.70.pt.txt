PEACOCK LIGHT, 

 fire blown slowly thirsty of warm specifically 
 Moving like the winds of a tree in the low rain, 
 And the tune of the bird left on the garden. 
 
 But through days of day and day, 
 The purple and the broad December grows 
 thrush and snaps out the caustics; 
 The fifth was hung close on its yellow tee attire 
 And water spotted like a glow-worm tree, laughter, 
 Stretching in the faintest branches, grew. 
 
 From under,
