 I never said of course since there was also anything 
 
 Or drawn from motorbike stranger; even then, 
 
 so there was that brief machine danger 
 
 scrolls into poems to the natural frankly itself 
 recently Prospero's to my own fears

 Down the street roof fulfilled 
 Leaving a band, 
 Didn't we never left 
 Things ever won
