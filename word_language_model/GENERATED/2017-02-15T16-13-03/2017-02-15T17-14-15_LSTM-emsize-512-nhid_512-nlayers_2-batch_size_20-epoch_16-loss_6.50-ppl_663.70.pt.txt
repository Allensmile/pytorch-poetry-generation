IN THE CHAOS OF CHANGE, IT IS DEAD IN THE STREET, 

 that none shall ever be young. 
 
 A night in moonlight. It was an April 
 invest by bees. 
 
 To find exactly only a car 
 on themc) branch, roofs over fine; 
 is a final way that dies 
 from remembering goes 
 all over, all household, dying 
 36 argument from flesh 
 of death, sinking loose 
 on leaves haven't given itself back 
 where our little lives come away
