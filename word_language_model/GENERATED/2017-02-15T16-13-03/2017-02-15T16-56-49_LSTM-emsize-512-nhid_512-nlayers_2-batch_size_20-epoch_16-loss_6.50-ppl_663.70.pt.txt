THE SKY, 

 ting-a-lings of its torn fruit, by which 
 skinny student mistake its strength; 
 So wildly revise. 
 
 Yet again, upon the fans, 
 The furrow darken 
 Were hushed through the gross streets, 
 And then makes the love of an orphan singing for you 
 We quarrel with feet to snap it upward 
 
 And then go round. Stop sheepskin undo ... 
 
 America if it draws us tightly into the sea; 
 We will bathe a greater way.
