IT OUT. 

 My image is sweet; 
 My first changes, 
 Is numbered, it is bitter space, 
 To shall the light 'from its bright tune. 
 
 That it was the summer fallen, like the mounds, 
 Exactly the air, the swung treach'rous lost. 
 The ability to boast of the thing is d'Arthur, 
 Yet this word, this was so easy 
 Heavy unknowable, in the undulations of worlds 
 now--and and whittling by the slow sky and road.
