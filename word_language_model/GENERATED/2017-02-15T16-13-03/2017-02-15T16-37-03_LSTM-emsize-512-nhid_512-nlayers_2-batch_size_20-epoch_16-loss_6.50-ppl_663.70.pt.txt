 Went us into the burning foam 
 Of such directions. 
 How vast 
 is not to claim the brain. 
 
 A wild pole sits next to lines 
 Like smoke from clouds where river climbs away; 
 At the window at dusk heart riding still; 
 
 The wind wails a hill seal-- 
 The spike is hushed 
 Where the sea wears the brook in all the flowers 
 Neither sleep nor sound 
 And life in a wild sleep not beyond us.
