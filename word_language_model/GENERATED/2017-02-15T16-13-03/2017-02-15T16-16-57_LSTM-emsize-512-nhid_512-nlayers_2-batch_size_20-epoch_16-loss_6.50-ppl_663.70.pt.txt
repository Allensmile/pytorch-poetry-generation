 Fair in the caverns of thine high eyes, 
 Thy slips on the clothes of God, 
 Thou, cheeks and shifting poison, interpreters 
 That yet thy charms and cares, be with thee, 
 On whom a star has taken off peninsula, 
 And 'twas past birth? 
 Let me and wake again, 
 O demolishing red-and-gold tell thee thus, 
 Keep ev'ry fire, as I go, 
 Refus'd thy voice, 'mid quiet pains 
 And don't,
