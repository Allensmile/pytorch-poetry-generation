 Nothing 
 Yield one's mind Amalthea's by by best, 
 nor missions, stealing fins 
 Francisco is itself but time. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Sole Snow 
 
 
 From an old gas walk through the desert a sky 
 takes on the pantry wall, the hammer all out, 
 vegetation to deliver whether to pray. 
 I turned my life with a buried cloth like snow. 
 
 I hear the dead sky's roll back, the flames 
 Far back on the pavements stack
