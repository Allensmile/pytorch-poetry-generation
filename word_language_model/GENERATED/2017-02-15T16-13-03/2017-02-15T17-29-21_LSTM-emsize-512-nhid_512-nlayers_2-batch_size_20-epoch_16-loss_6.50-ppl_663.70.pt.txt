ROADS AGAINST THE RIM OF THE SKY 

 Wave staying and bathed on. 
 
 These seem tilted upside down 
 on the topmost windows. 
 They dammed every casual lot; 
 againgo in dark velvet, wringing 
 the afterlife. 
 
 There are Cavalli 
 waited along the familiar rim, 
 the sun flares and row 
 at the surface of the asylum 
 and I go said.The to eye his name 
 for refusing to ride, 
 held food in joy up for ours.
