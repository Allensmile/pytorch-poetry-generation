AVERSIONS, ON THE AVOIDED EVENING. 

 
 A rented painting lime; A boat 
 Tells it for a Opera daylong dismounting, 
 
 
 7 reeling, 
 
 Hot from the far bulls time 
 I visited a moss. It was 
 The injustice of sun and autumn, 
 And then fell down here but I knew 
 The heart was lonely president, 
 The pleasure-dome made of woe! 
 
 From the streets, or forests 
 To bite their brush, and 
 They could not die speaking.
