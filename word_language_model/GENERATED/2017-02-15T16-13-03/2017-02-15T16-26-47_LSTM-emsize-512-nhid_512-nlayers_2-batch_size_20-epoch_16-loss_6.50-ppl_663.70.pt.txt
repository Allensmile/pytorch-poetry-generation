BLUFFS, JACK CHECK THE SEED, 

 Who moves us down in loathliest spring; 
 And wherein she may be: 
 'Gets no other mistress, adamantly art, 
 Who flee your vaulted sail; 
 
 For shoots, 
 To gilded old. 
 
 Your shadow ever dayerye, 
 Lost but a leaf 
 Weak eyelids lean aside 
 On the earth's Indian shore 
 The dark transparent reeds 
 On the Table ranted about 
 The finest and xcUse surprises. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 flame-tree.
