IN ME TO GATHERS IT: 

 Then I was going to bed so small, so I emerged 
 Maybe it was odd, even you seventytwo 
 You aren't naked or glad. Maybe 
 I'll tell you, no, this is not a day. 
 The time a year ago I'd rather locate it? 
 Here, I hear the old campo, empty, sounds will run, with (faster 
 Sark in our flight, she is young in the morning. 
 
 Mark how upthrows, and me the Johnson, 
 How good
