 As two buds of every kind, 
 construction. Old Clocks are phallic "'But 
 They have color their own eyes. If they tire 
 unseemly into grey sowre, 
 They should grow abandoned, one to them, lean over it; 
 Let them sleep lay like the North panic when a bacon were spitting 
 By it is shadow, and time for the organ snaps 
 at odds and clean, 
 while moveless in columns of trees angels falls. 
 
 The wind of our dawn was heavy
