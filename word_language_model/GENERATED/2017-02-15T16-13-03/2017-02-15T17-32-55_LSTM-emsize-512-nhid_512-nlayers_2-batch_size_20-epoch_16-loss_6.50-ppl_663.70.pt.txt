UPON THIS 

 Which fills our argument with lice and eyes. 
 
 To you at stretched! playing dancing lights. 
 This is your body? That changes not 
 On the grave of making good; I should see our style 
 Than friend may have such phantoms to be weak 
 For nature and singing weakly but of necessity, 
 Who sell the friendship from time's hundred care: 
 The soul in loss will never teach, 
 But it will scorn the whole world's life in Love.
