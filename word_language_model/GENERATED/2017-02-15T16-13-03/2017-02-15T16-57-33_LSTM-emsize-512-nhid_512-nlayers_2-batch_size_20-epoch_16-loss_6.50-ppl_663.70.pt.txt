TOMORROW IS EVEN THAT LOW SMOOTH CLOUD 

 shadows drown within the narrow forest sky, 
 dissolving and wider 
 Only the lost grass herself, but in this place 
 Were the beetle's God, zebras gone 
 To their great chins a most likeness. 
 
 Then, beat slow open, half stretched away 
 In passion to be dumb, [Kabbalah], 
 The place of faith will not believe us. 
 
 Our Saturn?" No use to stain our sex 
 When it or end, day out, and day;
