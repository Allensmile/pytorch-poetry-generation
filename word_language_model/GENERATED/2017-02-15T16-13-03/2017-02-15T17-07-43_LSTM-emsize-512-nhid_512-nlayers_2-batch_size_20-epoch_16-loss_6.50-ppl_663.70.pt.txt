 Blind clothes clasped Chickadee 
 On the fecund throne; 
 As night before you were pure. 
 
 Engin by a thread in the place, 
 Swung awhile within his turn, 
 One sate in deep and cool 
 Upon the living track, 
 Bored, the peaks around 
 Some opposite, the leader 
 Shook out that people's glee. 
 
 As we searched in the high 
 train or water ahead. 
 
 Then the white rose mother 
 
 patterns, a petal of axes
