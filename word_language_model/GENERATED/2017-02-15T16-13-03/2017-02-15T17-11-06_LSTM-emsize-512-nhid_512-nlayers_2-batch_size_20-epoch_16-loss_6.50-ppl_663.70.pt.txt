 smelling wash the margin wall, the horse is holding 
 the word of cutting hair, hunt by the drains and curves 
 of delay. the comforts and marchers that separated 
 the fountains of nations from windows grind

 elsewhere. 
 
 The day is always 
 and the stars have been gone. 
 
 This is the shining sea of U.S. Day 
 this morning of sunlight; faraway
