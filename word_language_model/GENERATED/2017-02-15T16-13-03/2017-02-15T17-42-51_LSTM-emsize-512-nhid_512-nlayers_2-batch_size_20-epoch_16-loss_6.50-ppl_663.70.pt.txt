SWEPT AND CHEERFUL 

 Out free. HALL. 
 HANLEY 
 
 Oh for invisible centuries touch me, 
 Of that which all you know, from what pow, 
 But what one have been doing .... 
 Let me say up some months I must be, or maybe 
 Just as much as they have been different. 
 
 Already when you are lonely -- 
 The early low, you are a speaker, 
 Trying to make you trust the race; 
 Why, do you not, you may ascend,
