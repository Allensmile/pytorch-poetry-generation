MERGE, 

 Suddenly the ghost let it go. 
 dignity--as I fought it all at my side, 
 Pantables sweet, ate glass, a bit of pint 
 When Winners pipes had drunken waves! 
 I watched the notes, and pushing to the current, 
 And headed the passions of that Duke. 
 
 The pattern hiss, the castle crest, 
 
 The coral tightens its bellowing wall, 
 
 The sheen of the withered tides, 
 
 The wintry beach the moonlight shepherd's wedge 
 
 The halcyons,
