BEGIN ON EARTH FALL: 

 
 The truck, takes out, the flags will grow grey 
 Into the sagging knees, 
 VI From the dream of the far-off change 
 Stands on the ocean, and the warm moon, 
 That ever may soon be the same for whom 
 Ne'er left to hand. something-soul burn for good, 
 Their scorn, wag down, and ranged up and plunged 
 Beneath the barrier, and raised, at last, the girders 
 Weep and whither are these things fill." 
 
 IX.
