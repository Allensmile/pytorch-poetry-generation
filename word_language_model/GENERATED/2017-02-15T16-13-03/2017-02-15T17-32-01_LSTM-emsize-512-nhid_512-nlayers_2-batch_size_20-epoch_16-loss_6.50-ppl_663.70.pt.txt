LESSON THAT HIDES YOUR LIFE #8 

 Why the last, no shame whizzing in your way. 
 As if this were your utmost name 
 To have a joy or name or deny 
 Some household wails for, be drunk 
 To that, or parcel this winter; 
 For age are for semisustained -- 
 "Ah! can you find good friends in whom 
 Are you not what I hate or not do wrong, 
 But reason, sleeping, far on things, 
 Find reluctant, and hear and fail.
