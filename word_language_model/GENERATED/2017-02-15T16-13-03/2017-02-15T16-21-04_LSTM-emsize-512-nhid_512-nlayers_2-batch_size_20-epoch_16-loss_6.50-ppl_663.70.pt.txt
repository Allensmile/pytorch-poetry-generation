BODY IS THAT I HAVE BEEN ONCE 

 Papa's mother who never really took it out. 
 Here she comes to, 
 the order of night 
 is a little girl and a man 
 wouldn't me. 
 
 
 
 The wooden Sternhold 
 Face to the window 
 again of its own 
 
 home by a Roach 
 love 
 love Hat, like 
 the future 
 heaven like ever 
 a darkness 
 dark inside 
 the heart is 
 the clutter of nerves
