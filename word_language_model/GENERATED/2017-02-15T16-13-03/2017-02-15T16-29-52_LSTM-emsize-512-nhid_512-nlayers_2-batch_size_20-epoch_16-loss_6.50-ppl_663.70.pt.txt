CLOSES, IN THE EYES, 

 pretty--hello, blood to the ground, CCC 
 Down-droop'd, with open eyes and cheeks 
 pinched up in a hand. The tree 
 Made no quiet life ... 
 One died when we began to, or finally 
 On the beach, something stepladder 
 One turned streetcars, at the scalloped 
 self-tormenting lightning in the telescope 
 Renaissance; designs descendant or blindly 
 starry: the mule and Non-Action 
 Tufts of scarlet and maggoted kind 
 Of miles seemingly a broken band, 
 Talk
