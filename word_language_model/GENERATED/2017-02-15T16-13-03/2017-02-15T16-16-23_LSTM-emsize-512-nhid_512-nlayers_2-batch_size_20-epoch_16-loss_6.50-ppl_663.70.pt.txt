THE STARRY 

 light flowed of the living chanukiya. 
 
 And how, as far as dawn moves 
 Was ever aware of the idiot Man 
 A dog of yellow and lecheries mosaic 
 
 seke? 
 
 Line by roomy lakes their mealy ] 
 Walkest mirth, which wander oft, 
 Huge veils of grass. 
 With full alleys and trumpets blow 
 The stretching humming of the troubled flesh, 
 During the thicket 
 Of heart some tree gone out to trace 
 Our eyes
