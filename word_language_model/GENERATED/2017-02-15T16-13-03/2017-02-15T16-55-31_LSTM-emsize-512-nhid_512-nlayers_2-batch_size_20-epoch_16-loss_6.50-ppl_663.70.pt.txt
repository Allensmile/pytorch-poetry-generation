 On his desk changed 
 That I still loved my death, 
 Save a young woman. I said 
 I never saw a woman so loved 
 Until that rosemary always rocked 
 And seek outward nothingness and name 
 Sent by me the last of them Joy's hauling 
 
 Such as the whole communion 
 Had hoped in the affairs of the womb. 
 
 To-day I alone, tell where the Lamb 
 When I acted sleeping in the valley 
 Of another dream.
