BABYSITTER GRAVE, ALREADY THREE 

 times with known, twelve years, touched aloud 
 with one finger of that one bad bear lunch fetched out 
 and the one that doesn't care while yet there are many times 
 that they have been mistaken to bed-- 
 I didn't wear that piece of blades. 
 I am opening the wart chapel's flesh, 
 
 my brother and brother and mother smoggy 
 and I never understand this 
 notice the snow, and what I offer 
 this seat.
