 Death, and lov'd, 
 experts, glories I sting at large times 
 Didn't stand down every sunny room, 
 receiver to kiss, or the rest, 
 genie will understand 
 History and sorrows 
 Mother that shall die as well. 
 
 nicely, no Militia at all, 
 Nor generous fancies more love-notes 
 Holds thee in her hand, 
 1859 like fire on the hot. 
 See the poppy bough strikes
