WAFTING AT LAST TO BURY IT. 

 
 
 
 
 
 Vandergast 
 
 
 For pretty building waters, 
 Stars and mountain motion 
 to backward 
 things around us 
 they will go back 
 run cellophane 
 under stone trees so high 
 that the rain raised there. 
 No one comes, no birds 
 still carry doors 
 like fields of waiting excellence; 
 and I on myself. 
 
 And now I will sit with 
 The words 
 
 and love
