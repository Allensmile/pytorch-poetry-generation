SIMILAR WHITENESS, 

 deface. the death, & blue for things 
 waiting for another fishcakes, that holds 
 all day for each other. 
 So that's 
 just a Invisible little different boots 
 in one more coevals 
 than I'm reading to reading 
 the whole weather 
 of all that I sang 
 would long itself but last time 
 with you that once you were. 
 
 In vain 
 there were no nothing 
 but meant in quotidian or Sancta 
 Such not:--No, too
