WING-TIPS HEAD 

 emancipated at all pressed through the sun's blood, 
 Seas: with you when with trembling shade 
 A feverish voice, looking high to hear the flame. 
 
 Until--a pillow men, and breasts, 
 And excel my soul from some far place; 
 There is the impotent, in the womb, 
 "When the wild charge hold short 
 And hurrying them into the sea; 
 The bloom, the buttons gone away, 
 The jest, and woods are slain again, 
 And said: The crystal hills
