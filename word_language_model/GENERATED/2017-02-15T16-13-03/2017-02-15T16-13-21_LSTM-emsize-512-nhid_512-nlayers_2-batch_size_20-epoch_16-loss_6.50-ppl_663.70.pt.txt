 The nurses' stream around my throat. 
 Again we warnings it too 
 history's their faces; 
 
 And we stand in fine ditch, 
 Other parts, caught in dusty eyes, 
 The whiskey of Reincarnation 
 The shapeless Laurel Box? 
 
 Afterwards, like girls 
 garbage. Manitoba Elephant 
 Report forgetfulness 
 
 . . . 
 
 
 Part weary 
 debris of riot and balls, 
 rots, clitoris 
 incorrigibly 
 Of those Clear heart inside tinted 
 lords, the scent of air
