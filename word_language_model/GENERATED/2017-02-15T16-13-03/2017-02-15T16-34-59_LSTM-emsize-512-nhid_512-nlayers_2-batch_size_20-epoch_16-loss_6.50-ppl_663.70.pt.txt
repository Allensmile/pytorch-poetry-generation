TO WHERE YOU GO, 

 corruptible, hours carved in clean weather 
 himhimhimhimhimhimhimhimhimhimhimhimhimhimhimhimhimhimh caught in staying the clear water, 
 pretending there woke in the essence 
 Of cities I chased you in wealth 
 and dreamed our best flames. 
 Collecting hermit rummaging 
 the leather, shells held past thee, 
 beaming into the roots of crushed grass 
 and moss colored immigrant bodies 
 etched into snow. Only 
 by sea drinking elms 
 and creatures sing the clear windows 
 in within reflected skimrack, circus
