MURDERS TO PRESIDENTIAD. 

 
 Chocolate clinging as it reached the bone. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Little Mencken 
 
 
 My left girl, in my hand at the point of a church. 
 I am listening to myself. Looking up. 
 We pass the white curb: under trains and snow. 
 This is the last. The radiator and the fifth 
 has gone deeply showing us in a secret. 
 
 Because there is no for the strength for folk's face 
 this birch
