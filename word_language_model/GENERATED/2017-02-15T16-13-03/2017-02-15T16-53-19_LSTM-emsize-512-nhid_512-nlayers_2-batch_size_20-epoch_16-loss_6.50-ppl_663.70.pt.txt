I DID NOT KNOW THAT PERFECT JOY 

 
 Did one day sing and not when made creation, be fallen, 
 But in my valley the deluge and the Snark's 
 The week ends, the woman who kept good days 
 migrating with death saying what she can tell, 
 And how the old poet, was black and fair, 
 And it must be here astringency. things on this doors 
 In their month and day, and the best look down to their feet, 
 And Jolimont masts
