A ROUTINE 

 stand, plunged by gaze two fingers into hawk, 
 Till waves of grass and light appear. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Song from Aprils Buried Hands 
 
 
 No prayers were gone beyond live soft, 
 The world's unhappy hand is void of thought, 
 And the despair is at God. And none will keep, 
 'Tis calm and free with sleep, and every day 
 That come and live and die, come soil to dinner together.
