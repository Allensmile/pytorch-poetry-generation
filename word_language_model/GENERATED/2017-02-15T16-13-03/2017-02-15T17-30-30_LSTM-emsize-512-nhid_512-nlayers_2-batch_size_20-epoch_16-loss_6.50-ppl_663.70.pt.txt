 
 The day was past and as she man's-help, 
 And waited more by once to hear; 
 But when she lay his shadow wine alone, 
 And shook her head, and she laid down 
 Like diamonds in the ultimate flame. 
 
 He saw the donkey batoco, sing; 
 Scattering the empty empty fields 
 Her Morsel timid 
 On her fluted tower'd years! 
 
 Her face, her skinny face pressed 
 
 Upon him looped his window-paths: length 
 desolate!) over her head
