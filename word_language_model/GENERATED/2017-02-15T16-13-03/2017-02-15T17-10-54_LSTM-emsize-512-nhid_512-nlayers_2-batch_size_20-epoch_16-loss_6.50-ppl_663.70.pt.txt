SAD SPRINGS 

 I walk again in Mechlin classified 
 All leanness rest in the tuneful will. 
 
 I hold my pain out: I've been 
 shocking brimstone. and yet needs. 
 I love not for birds, even if you pitied me? 
 Here are you, and your greedy abundance: 
 Clinging to yourself, O quietness 
 Of precepts et lords. 
 His proper body's name his head, 
 and Yellow balls fruit unto them. 
 And yet you aren't really true. 
 Well you have come
