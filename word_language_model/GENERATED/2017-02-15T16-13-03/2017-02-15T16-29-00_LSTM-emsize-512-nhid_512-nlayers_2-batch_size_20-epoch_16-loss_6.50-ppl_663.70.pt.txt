BY THE WAVES, 

 And sterile and fallen, near-bitten 
 Of challenge in adjectives, 
 We'll make and preach with a railway-share; 
 The moment--I watches her gang? 
 O Name? 
 Thou, whose head is holes! slough 
 Whose cloak has last-chance Wrongs, 
 Mynstrells Munere freckled, wre, 
 Gon to Clootie! 
 Or Conqueror bordwudu 
 Doubl'd, gives elevation, Stoics steede, 
 Remembrance and bugles! wythe use and wit. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Vietnam the Gullets 
 
 
 As you remember each lecture-rooms,
