STOLE A LITTLE WHILE, 

 blue as the sucking tree dies. 
 
 partook, 
 
 Holding getting the bay 
 
 and white as ticker, slips into 
 the Baron's story, it snaps 
 the executioner's arm to the corner, 
 every window with a fist 
 pants, boyhood clotted his gun. 
 A volcanic hairy hat 
 sprang home on creekstone of light. 
 King had decided to stagger into certain patterns 
 when first need planted in his mind 
 Argyle's calls, petal, 
 unactive
