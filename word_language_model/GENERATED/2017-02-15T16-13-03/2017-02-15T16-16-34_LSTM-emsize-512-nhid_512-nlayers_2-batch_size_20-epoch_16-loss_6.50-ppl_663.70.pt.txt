UNIFORMS 

 sin-eater, pulsing as the warriors blow 
 At their right from the allotted end. 
 
 The law), dishonesty in the Scales, like leaves. 
 Lying back; busy and deserted eyes. 
 He Bolivia as shades as the wind. 
 
 He enters and calls his partners well 
 And sat confused in the hot smooth. 
 He sent the green clock Pasternak 
 Burnt in the aisles he used to spin 
 Down the deep Sierra shadow shade like sun 
 From ear to pole
