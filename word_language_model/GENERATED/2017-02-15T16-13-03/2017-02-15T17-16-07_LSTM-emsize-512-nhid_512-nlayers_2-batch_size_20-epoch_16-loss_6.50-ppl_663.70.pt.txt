DANCE?' 

 
 Then the gnawing and strangely bloom 
 Turned without fear. 
 
 The Gilfillan and the radio's the Bonnie east. 
 The spirit that is late for done is free. 
 Then are we to be killed. 
 
 We stay there, rattling under the city, 
 But scraped down our eyes and say 
 It was a pinch of silhouette upon your breast. 
 
 I am writing a night beside you, 
 Have it not lovely lov'd, waited 
 For your own communion
