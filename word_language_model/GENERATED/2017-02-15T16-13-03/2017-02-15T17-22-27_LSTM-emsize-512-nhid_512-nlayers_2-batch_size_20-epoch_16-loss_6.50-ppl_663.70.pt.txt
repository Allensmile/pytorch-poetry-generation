OVER! IS LIE: MCDONALDS 

 You whispering bright and sun has in your mouths 
 Upon the leaves! Turning along; a man's D'Adda 
 gear glitters from a breath that lifts you and rained with the blood, 
 Life's hot hairs as if she will, you have seen small mountains 
 At home to your shepherd, where is time to say. 
 There's a kind of weather -- amid beran/, 
 A winnowing myriads of tears.
