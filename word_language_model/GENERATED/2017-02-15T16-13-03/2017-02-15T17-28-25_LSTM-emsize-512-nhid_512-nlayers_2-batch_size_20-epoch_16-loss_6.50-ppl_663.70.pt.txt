ON HILL. 

 
 Black words bang on the precincts of sweet beg, 
 In compost that have come back to men, 
 Or paid me back to the chaos of me; 
 A hundred fame-- and a caress-- 
 They shout with their fiery songs on trees. 
 A kiss, a man of busy complaints 
 Rose upon their flight to go to each other, soon 
 And as to gave; that death by him can become 
 A desperate fashion the same at last huge
