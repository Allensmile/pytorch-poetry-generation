 Of my identity my little necessity, 
 And I dig only pages hung in 
 The final maiden with my leafy gift. 
 Perhaps the bird is too eas'd, 
 And is gone far. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Memories of Funeral 
 
 
 1. 
 As Thirteen miles past the gusty fro. 
 Somewhere the tents hung in your trance; 
 In the ditch, staring four and beautiful 
 Was with a golden eye of blithe train. 
 hurled. scattering the deuce Scarecrow
