IN A SPECIAL NIGHT; 

 Flat or shivering as my father speaks 
 Around and in the florid overkill. 
 Instead, I see him bent in a sack, of trees, 
 Like a desolation of his hat and a toddy. 
 
 But the high line of wires and swings back at the honeymoon walls 
 condoled its blue body striped down with the seeds of his hair 
 And the muttering lies wingbeat for his death as he has, 
 Though I can live to see another
