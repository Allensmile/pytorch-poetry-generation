TO A POLE. 

 
 Words held you with a discovery. 
 Strangers no mercy, uncombed; 
 You see in any rate, the gift of Noble men 
 And the priest with a naked flower. 
 
 Underneath the rose, 
 freedoms? and porchlight's 
 We saw two E; 
 diminuendo. 
 Yet Cognizance anticipatory, not, 
 So, 
 For the company 
 everything belongs 
 you, far, dwell 
 Under my sorry dream 
 Maybe that you could still remember 
 Any world somehow Divided 
 In
