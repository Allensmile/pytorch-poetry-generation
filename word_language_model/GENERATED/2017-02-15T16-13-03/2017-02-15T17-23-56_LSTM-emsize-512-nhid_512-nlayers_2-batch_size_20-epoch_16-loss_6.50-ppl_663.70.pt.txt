 [creating fare now no windows, you--to woods, 
 Presto ibid, 
 vu and coughed 
 Over no city nevermore, 
 "A iris burning a flag; 
 spring-- a letter, cups! 
 calligraphy, and a thriving show, 
 Across the floor of uplifted mouth, 
 Lifting its secret nausea of sorrowing; 
 We'll comfort you. Were we articulate it, 
 Is it there-- in its lonely 
 divorcing flesh 
 Far may be like dogwood willows 
 
 Beyond the vast woods the Bride of barb pak-kai,
