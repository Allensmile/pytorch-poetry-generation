IN LIKE A DREAM-- A SURGE 
 Of green grasses, stretching on earth, like glass trees 
 Languages road "breathlessness to some new channel 
 In whose wide shadow the dry field comes. 
 And when the wheels have left them the same; 
 The dried kings of the veil as war do, 
 Let this go night meet the heart in its sleep. 
 
 But ah! swimwear, ledger; alone, 
 castles answers in its shape blank in heaven. 
 Nothing lends its kind of spirit
