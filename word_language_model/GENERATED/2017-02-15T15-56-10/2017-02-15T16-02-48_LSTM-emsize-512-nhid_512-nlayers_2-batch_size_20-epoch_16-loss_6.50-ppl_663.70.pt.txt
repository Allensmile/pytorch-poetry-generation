 Low naked as the sun to Yevtushenko's 
 It is headlong sweet and sere-- 
 Crying and lie ; 
 And over to the little one, thee? 
 But, while I see the song 
 Gives way to waters some run out, 
 And what passes about. 
 piping, bit on escript land, 
 Let us sojourn for a walk and be called 
 Flesh after night: and ideological Hawkers 
 Of courtyard throw something from round its dead.
