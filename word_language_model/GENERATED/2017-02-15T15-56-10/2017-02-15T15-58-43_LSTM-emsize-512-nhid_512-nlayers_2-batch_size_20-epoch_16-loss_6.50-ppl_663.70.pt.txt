AND A BLIND THRUSH 
 Do I give you my eyes for hands, 
 And I'd ne'er have died in the brain along 
 With the antique, to confound the best 
 Makes it with love; and "them" to say: 
 knell an' made true creature. 
 We need that shadow unto us then. 
 Then will we go; it is all too late, 
 It will close us colder be: 
 And dwell for gusts or Soul. 
 No, no, no, no, my dear, let be.
