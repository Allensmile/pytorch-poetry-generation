RUFFLING PULSES 
 And the badness tips it in the eyes. 
 And the debris stagger up and down time's pathway waves 
 That laugh where my lashes lived, and pure crucial miraculous wonder 
 My nummed ye remove your dirty bell, 
 Great terrible desires less I love you, 
 You that crowd music in your hands? 
 
 Your red Appy lip-read see my cloudes come fast before. 
 Or you drive a Paracelsus on the front road where you walk 
 Pellet on Lilacs, obliterate,
