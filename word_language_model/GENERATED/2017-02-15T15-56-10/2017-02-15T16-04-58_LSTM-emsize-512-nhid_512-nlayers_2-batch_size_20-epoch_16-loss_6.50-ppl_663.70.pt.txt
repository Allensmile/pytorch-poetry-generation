IT WEREN'T THE ONE AND YOU 
 
 had been budding in your way confession in your purse 
 and slip the lightning a wooden step to the bride of sleep 
 coming back, salt your hair 
 
 I remember when men sag looking up 
 I know the road is far out, 
 and I shall go the place where 
 you speak of yourself, 
 they want what you deserve 
 
 this too much, or that it was on 
 
 the sun isn't
