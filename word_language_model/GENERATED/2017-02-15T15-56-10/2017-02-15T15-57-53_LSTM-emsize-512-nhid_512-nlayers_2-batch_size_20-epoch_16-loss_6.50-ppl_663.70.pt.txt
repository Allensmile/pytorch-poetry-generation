PRETTY. 
 We share the sea that takes in fire 
 As of moonlight upon the trees, 
 With power Bushes, his miracles to supply, 
 But God makes signs of this high world as does a moan 
 Right in unshaken silence that we wait 
 For the least land we are asleep. 
 
 The nut in his story; a little magpie 
 Mix'd with his Biddy, he Gilbert lore us soon, 
 Lying on the adobe Ball garden, the stone steam 
 behind our phone,
