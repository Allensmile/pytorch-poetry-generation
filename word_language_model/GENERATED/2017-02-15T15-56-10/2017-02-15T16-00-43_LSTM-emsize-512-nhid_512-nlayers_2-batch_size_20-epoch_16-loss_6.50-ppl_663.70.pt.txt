AND GLITTERED 
 Long leaves and eyes of red; 
 "Well, I wouldn't know what to come? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Birthday 
 
 
 Even mothers 
 Sit a little 
 For patience after 
 Because water singing, and dream 
 Of heedless of rain, and caves of the chimney 
 Where I may take myself here 
 As instead: 
 Of men I will show them no more of age, 
 me met. 
 
 But from my own pen this self
