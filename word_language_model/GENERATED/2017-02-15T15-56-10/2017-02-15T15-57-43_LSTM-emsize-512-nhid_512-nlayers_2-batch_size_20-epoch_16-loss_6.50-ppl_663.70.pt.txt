 which is clear and warm in the sky 
 Crine. bright and gray, 
 the foxes crown 
 and dip it as they fall.

 a column of rye along

 set, through wind the world stands, 
 & in the desert of light 
 the deer of giant teeth sweep 
 against my feet, 
 feed its exciting light. 
 
 I felt fresh as cold,
