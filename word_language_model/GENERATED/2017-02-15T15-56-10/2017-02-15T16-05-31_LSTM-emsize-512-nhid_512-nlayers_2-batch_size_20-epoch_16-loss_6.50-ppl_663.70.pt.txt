 
 So I look under the maternity bay? 
 
 
 We passed in the soil. 
 
 One flower increase about the earth 
 
 Out on the path I retrace a chair 
 
 And not by it I take one look, 
 
 Or somewhere tonight gates a letter for shoes: 
 
 Let none come and be black. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 16 
 
 
 Death, surely those three years and yet are different, 
 girlfriends at sunset
