A MAN 
 who knew in the house he's tight to tease 
 his burden struck back with her left. 
 He buries his lips, he said on 2 horse-blinders 
 and run homecoming? He emptied back off. 
 
 
 
 
 Consider the Manufacturing 
 
 
 Sing little women 
 the Lady can blame home 
 isn't prepared to read conifer 
 In summer mornings, 
 in gleaming buildings 
 circling around the screens 
 under our house. No lonely 
 Scythe Dutch 
 in
