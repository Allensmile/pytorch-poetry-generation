 The brow of me, the agony shrivels, 
 pleasure--right, themselves in little graves. 
 
 
 As a Cloud before a horse does lift 
 The drops of clipped along the bone. 
 
 There's a lesson in the similar room 
 Which has been? The lazy wail 
 
 Of unstable 
 To every dour Hills every multitude 
 Of my hunger 
 
 I smell it all around 
 My flesh a small bed for you. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Today Im bladder.
