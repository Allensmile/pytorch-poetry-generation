 At the far end of the fretful Universe 
 cheet, clouds behind the houses born-again 
 
 Those were animals, even the land 
 Half wheels and pop shrill, and flecked with wine; 
 And so that it was nothing to stay. 
 
 We sat upon ointment rings the same. 
 
 Everything over, but it seems to be gained 
 Its back is not much less than it, in the grace 
 Of our pure mountains of emptiness 
 terry every living ghost.
