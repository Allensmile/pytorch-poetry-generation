OF PRETTY WATER. 
 I do not know this, and whoever I never married was what tasted good 
 it was that I could call it good-for-nothings, 
 deprivation rez 
 Yet dare this be nostalgia 
 in one poem of & gone from another Begummed, 
 
 
 4 
 I would have been almost used on and read the silenced flute 
 that in us must never forget to, still under our unlocked paths, 
 It mongrel worlds with nature; no good. 
 As Ripping typing--
