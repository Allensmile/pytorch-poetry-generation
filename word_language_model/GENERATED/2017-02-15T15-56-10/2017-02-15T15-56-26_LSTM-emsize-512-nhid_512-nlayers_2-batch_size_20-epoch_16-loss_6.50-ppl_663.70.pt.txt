 An idle Robin Girl 
 Ere he upon his banks appears, 
 I heard the poor man cry in the field, 
 Levis. hum; Suppose you change at lantern-show 
 (1) 
 Hope knows not ill: 
 I'm not saying you really day, 
 And 'sme! shall melt 
 Out of thine cruelty. 
 To our early remove. 
 Nor shall I talk more, 
 But change
