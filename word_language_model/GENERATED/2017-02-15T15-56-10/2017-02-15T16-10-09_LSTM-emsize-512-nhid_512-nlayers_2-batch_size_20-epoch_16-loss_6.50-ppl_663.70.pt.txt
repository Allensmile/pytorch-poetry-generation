AT A BITE OF MEADOW, 
 we see what a word grows good or lovely, 
 
 That the blocks curled 
 
 The red blade jade with the sea, 
 The mother and her theme; 
 Her father home, and her father 
 Move herself in his little like a dancer, 
 The first time closing, the boy 
 Was tied, and she went to stream 
 In that room of that hidden afternoon 
 While varying march, dog's little spare 
 An innocence now to take
