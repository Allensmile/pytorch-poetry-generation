EMERALDS 
 Sweet to my Heart, mine ears to pour more we! 
 Somewhere a common maiden-furled be sleeping, 
 Upon my childhood afire 
 This must be well for peace to hear, 
 And trust to find the feast and dry; 
 Even a laugh of fiction may not draw, 
 And the bright lips feed out before the rest 
 And the world grows governed with the dew 
 Of apples! But the shadows shall all, 
 All for whose great crowds and their spoils
