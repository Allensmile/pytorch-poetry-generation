DONE. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Sonnet 
 
 
 You waste your Sun-flower once a male bird, 
 his friend is (all or afraid. The soldier 
 continues to happen, the Angelical is the shit. 
 One more will ever have to go through the potter 
 and wait where must get the job hatefull head 
 over anything but dictionary Tsa milk or loud, 
 some immigrants no longer have a solution 
 on these in a world that falls in like magic.
