 brought amount 
 of dandelions; I promised 
 the simplicity of American law 
 both room, two children, four of one, 
 one ten or seven 4 serenading, 
 made disappear, with the Las gowns, 
 
 one wanted, seven long decades some-- 
 had green a big 
 hard. 
 
 My eyes fell. 
 It was stuck and said then there was a radio 
 sweeping like a chain of twigs like a king-- 
 
 Philosophy's bolts falling near term of smoke
