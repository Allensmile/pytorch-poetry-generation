In, 

 but broken is the amount? 
 
 the coils and fear 
 
 where busted seem, 
 and find the block 
 that arrive at hand in it, 
 
 and unafraid, the vivid scenes, or consequence? 
 
 O that chaste pool of Curled 
 
 falling against the dying oak trees. 
 
 I dream 
 
 are you going to be the dream of mills 
 
 like everybody else. 
 
 You have what you want to do is beautiful.
