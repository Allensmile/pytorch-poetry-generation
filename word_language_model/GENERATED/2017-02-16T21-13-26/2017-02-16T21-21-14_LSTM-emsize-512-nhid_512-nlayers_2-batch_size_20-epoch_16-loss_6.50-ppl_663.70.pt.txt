To See The Seventy Dogs 

 
 death's sweeping pipe and eyelids leaning over the blue 
 crestfallen lark where timber start an abyss 
 and backed by memory and suddenly payde 
 a side of the candles, a breasts...curious...hungry 
 trying to make it beat until 
 it is rulers, the simple ocean body, 
 blows out like air the nightmare climbs 
 the streets, and climb off and see 
 over the hill the die--but drum 
 on the outermost ritual tree, existing in that far
