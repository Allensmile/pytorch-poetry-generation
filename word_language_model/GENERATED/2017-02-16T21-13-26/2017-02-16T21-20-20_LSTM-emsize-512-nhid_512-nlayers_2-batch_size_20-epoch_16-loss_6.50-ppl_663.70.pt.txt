 So swift and maidenhead" Let the world survive, 
 That heav'nly Neptune eyed the minister 
 Of orbits from her feet; for history, 
 In one another's eye of one fire. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Water-fall 
 
 
 sweetly, red girl, leans on the windowsill, 
 Enforce the leaves with his double, head 
 And heard a water sheet his crocus wings. 
 Next, are you, too, you never were. 
 Think you to care of me. Mine is no end.
