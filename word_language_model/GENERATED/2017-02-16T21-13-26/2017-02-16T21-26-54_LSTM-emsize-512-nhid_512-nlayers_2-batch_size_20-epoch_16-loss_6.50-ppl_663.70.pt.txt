Chairs On The Roads Of The Sidewalks 

 Mocking its movements and wastes 
 Where every harsh river guard its ground 
 Goes playing, moving knees enroute 
 To make sudden heart singing in manner orphanage, 
 This song of death that's likewise much and great. 
 
 More heaven is, that we all cannot hide not so. 
 
 Ask and be surprised of the lame and beautiful is the wind, 
 Our hearts fur pockets open, Critic, one coast, 
 Not the remnants of the compass,
