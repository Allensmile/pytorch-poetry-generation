 Bitter and ready, glad I Cheesecakes, 
 Upon the wavering waves of mercy elder, below, 
 quaver--what growing Stone in their cave.

 And wonder, see, helpless asleep and rears 
 ... Everything across all the brilliant seasons 
 The agony of hope, of all her means, full of grey; 
 I fixed momentary and skip." 
 Oh well, you know, Walt Lady, do this.
