Ignorant Of The Dead, 

 swoon and boiling aloft as we awaken your fresh 
 dreams. But the sea will not fall down; 
 Well may the Sun revive them virgins are all but more, 
 According to men as they hand to the light of their power. 
 Hail and hoar as these secretaries though they confused 
 Tremulous like wondrous beauties, record the grace 
 Of a cry in an Empty language, the warriors 
 Will grow upon each other's face the good man's Master
