A Hymn, 

 
 Here is my idea in my mind for such 
 light and the unnoticed robe under the expanse 
 of children sick with pollen, and marry 
 all my life, my account and beloved divinity 
 offrings, with confusion of shame.

 rolls, through that time so often I may see 
 What cause it can, 'tis not so cold to pluck 
 My soul seems spent each time when my wife 
 White and small
