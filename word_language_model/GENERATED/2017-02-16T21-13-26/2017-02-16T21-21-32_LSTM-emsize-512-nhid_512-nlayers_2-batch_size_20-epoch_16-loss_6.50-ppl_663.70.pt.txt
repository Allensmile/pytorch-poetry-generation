It Hands On And The Clean Sway 

 
 Keeping its keys with his ears holding it stirred 
 
 Alone and again down again. Consort and Sussex 
 
 Has a dry torrent of flower and rain 
 
 In the ninth room when men caught a hnahran 
 
 But only a intimacy was swallowed off the jug 
 
 Like a fold, 
 
 Who comes, there, before the sun is founts, 
 
 The weight of the spider now went out 
 
 Bitter
