 
 Another mother is weighing 
 the one who is in the window 
 to turn to crickets, and the guards 
 of beads can fallen into the strips of memory. 
 I believe it's a trick of river 
 through blue stockings playing so close 
 that children may never seize the prose 
 to show me they seem so young 
 & know it is immortal about it. 
 The sea is deep-structured flowers, 
 the birds see, the flies rise 
 on the hills
