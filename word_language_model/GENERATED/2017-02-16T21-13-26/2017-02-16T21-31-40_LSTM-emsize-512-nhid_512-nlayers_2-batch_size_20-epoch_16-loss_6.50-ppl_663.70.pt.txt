Ease, 

 I tread the glittering linen into the Grotto 
 Tall with bitter wine lights hissing over the mountains. 
 
 Deep by daylight on through glass the market car 
 They ripple from the distance--who a breeze 
 Startled to the throat, the flushed lands in the sun; 
 The press of the bushes and the hurricane, 
 And drops the oynement and running undaunted companion 
 With different potatoes and dream hut, instances quando 
 For a god is watching me in the greasy pretense!
