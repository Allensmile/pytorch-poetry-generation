 In a steady deepest circle of clouds, 
 rril--the 1935 Pallas 
 Marinetti crystal marshes 
 Grief; and stays. 
 
 tigerlilies incendiary, 
 Gripped the heart of the shape of it: deave up me, 
 Its atom-eating season 
 Wild suicide a covering of innocence. 
 
 Here is flapping on me. 
 
 And when nothing happens. 
 My face is falling gin 
 And a poet struck me close 
 To running, calling me to play. 
 
 I would not know that boy.
