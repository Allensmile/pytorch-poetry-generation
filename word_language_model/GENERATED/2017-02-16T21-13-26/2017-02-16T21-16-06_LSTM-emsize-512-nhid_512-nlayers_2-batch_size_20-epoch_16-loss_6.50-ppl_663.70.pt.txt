 East by the earth; in phoniness, 
 s'en seen choose? and reduced to 
 Cousin fro a vacant stone? 
 Beer egotist. assise, 1992 
 A scratch miles--here's overhead 
 Myself to justify my occult double Selborne's 
 
 Not separate, small-arms too iris-blue too small 
 As this: and ever I was old; 
 There the sea had paced in hand, 
 And dropped it far and farther corners; 
 Tomorrow through my covertness in splendor sun 
 I found the Camelot sinking from the reach
