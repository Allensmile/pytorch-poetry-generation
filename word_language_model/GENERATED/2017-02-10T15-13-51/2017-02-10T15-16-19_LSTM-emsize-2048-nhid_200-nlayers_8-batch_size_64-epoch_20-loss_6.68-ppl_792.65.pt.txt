 not as the windows and the sailors drift 
 that once holds 
 entrances 
 as the motherfucker 
 arrives invisibly there, fetish 
 over prayer-shawls of brown silvered through ashes 
 the place of the sparrow, how we quit ourselves 
 we discovered who i would be. 
 
 only a verse ask me or does not utter her will 
 his daughter in beauty about. 
 i get a little women. 
 you blink the rust spun in my purple tongue 
 you laugh through
