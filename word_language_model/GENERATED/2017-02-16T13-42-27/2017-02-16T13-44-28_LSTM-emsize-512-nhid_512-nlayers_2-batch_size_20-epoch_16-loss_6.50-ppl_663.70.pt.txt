Tapestries As With A Vexed Breadth 

 Of a sea God now had reach'd off in his lap, 
 Trees of feathers in the moon ingenue. 
 drear, the new harvest from his lovely smile, 
 Down the dark, nights, the same-- 
 He saw, his hard nails took a blade, 
 And his dazd, told us how his train 
 slower at once did all this world, there journeyed 
 After the swinging television at the shores of fate, 
 In that we cannot dash or play
