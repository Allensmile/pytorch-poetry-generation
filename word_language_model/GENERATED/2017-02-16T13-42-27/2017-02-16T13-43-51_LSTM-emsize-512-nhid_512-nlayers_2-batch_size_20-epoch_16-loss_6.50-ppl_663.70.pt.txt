 (When one side sick; parts of them offence, 
 never-quite-clean in pity and despair, 
 And having loved the dead and vexing 
 
 The angel stared at him at the Granny! 
 And not his long tribute was dusty,

 And found for his own fright for what else, 
 And did not have been caught, 
 But he held more than he wel what-is-life-without-you-here 
 He bade trying to talk he could
