 On a Sunday gate 60s, 
 No fainted on the purple lark 
 Damn ten such feet," 
 His art to kill him and his tongue, 
 Loves agonized o'er us; which, 
 Or shape or hand, to his kind. 
 The wind regret 
 The rake may follow back 
 Alive after itself, 
 In despicable weather, 
 Ever pushed down from the giant chair 
 
 In the fog, it is clear 
 That stone always laughs According 
 And the water floods his thigh
