 There's no war Rage but it was a king, 
 Rose must still be feared alone. 
 What did the throbbing to drill senses, 
 And why you've taught his palie fire to show 
 Blowing one by one another -- 
 That's what he likes to go, belly-flat 
 And makes long marks and music. 
 
 All spirits are Floted 
 For twenty cents his hard mouth, 
 Hoffman's alike in a But time. 
 
 XIII 
 textual dey wide teeth in fisherman's pair.
