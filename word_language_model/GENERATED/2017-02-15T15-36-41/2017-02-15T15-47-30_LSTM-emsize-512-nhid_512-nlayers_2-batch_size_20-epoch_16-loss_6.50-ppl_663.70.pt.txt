 Lit up in least, stays to come, dead thought. 
 Should they be Branch. And yet, there are we also breathe. 
 
 I've heard my scythe of the bathroom and face of a big drink, 
 Teach me -- if I'm thinking of us, but I say nothing. 
 But the song wormfolk, in your very early night: 
 When you are forgotten and I shall always bear.
