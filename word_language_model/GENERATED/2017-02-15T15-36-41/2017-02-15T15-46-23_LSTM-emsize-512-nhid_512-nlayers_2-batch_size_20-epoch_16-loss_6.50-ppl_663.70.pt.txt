 
 With a fine morbid sweet eye 
 
 That serves no beauty from the soil 
 The fingers reach out the navel, 
 
 In heaven at fifteen Seamus? 
 And speak and storming in time 
 By exile as they look are out, 
 In wisdom to earth's generation 
 And full of them travellin 
 More desirable lords 
 
 Like that first Berlin? flame 
 --The shifts of flesh aftershock 
 Whose names are still wary 
 And toilsom, said nothing 
 today's
