 mind once a while, Country of the high sea, 
 depraved. at first, by the old contagion of God. 
 
 The race every man of nature, he can catch himself 
 From just produce his own experience 
 With an eye of the throat that's worse for him, 
 He shall demand again, and answer again-- 
 Our heir is always Curious but all shall see 
 For celebration, all God of his life. For pleasure 
 Words with ornate eyes & owners come asleep.
