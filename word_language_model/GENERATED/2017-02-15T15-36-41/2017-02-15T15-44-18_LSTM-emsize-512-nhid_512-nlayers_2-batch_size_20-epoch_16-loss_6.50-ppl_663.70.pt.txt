I could 
 relate 
 myself what I saw 
 Was a meaningful crowd. 
 Many alone. 
 Saw lines of one-way robes, handsome squires, 
 Couldn't reach'd it, sugary amber laws. 
 I knew that the instant went quickly by. 
 But the law walked breaded from the shore; 
 And drove away a pious stamp 
 Return to me. All troopers found out 
 The fear of glow upon the weight 
 Of HANUKKAH) 
 The silence that teased me and its ghost 
 Grew bold
