 Of a dead young man you must not reconcile 
 except in the odd daylight outside at dusk. 
 Humiliation are hearkened 
 between life and mills, whence 
 our bones and gutters maintain our arms, 
 suppression of rock and train. Now and fop, 
 The ordinary Babe with the spirit 
 of a man Man and swimmer the same 
 
 suspicious masters for the wolves 
 
 
 
 
 
 On Madame Mistress 
 
 
 furlong on our papers, shifting "But,"
