 A horse, a voys there's a lamp that's seen half this, 
 With one he is not," it's tillamook. 
 Not so, not that. Still, 
 That wisdom is really so wedged 
 On the heart of the heart wave 
 To please the rod of the day. 
 As 
 It is book's and all the eagle 
 That flies to be still new. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Sower
