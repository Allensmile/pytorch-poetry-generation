of a happy night 
 In battle or by loss or of remorse. 
 Even a scale; of his fists. 
 
 His third will to take lotus -- 
 In broad water mingling with fear, 
 On a bureau left of old men, 
 For he in his mercy whim: 
 And a snot of long for life she needs -- 
 Who doesn't even seem to bone 
 And would not furnish the Fury of pain. 
 
 Ah! little enough, she finds two lips
