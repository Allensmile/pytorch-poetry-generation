I claw a grotesque kiss. 
 In love of friends, house or time, 
 on a outside, camp. 
 And forgetting not 
 the workers for one reason 
 for which all the slain dwell, burdened up 
 from the border, 
 of the gusts 
 and of the birds 
 
 all my heart and my breast 
 in a neighbor's pantomime 
 of speculation 
 no unsettling mystery. 
 No signature, and no 
 cries of sisters. 
 
 My grandfather calls, 
 and my heroine
