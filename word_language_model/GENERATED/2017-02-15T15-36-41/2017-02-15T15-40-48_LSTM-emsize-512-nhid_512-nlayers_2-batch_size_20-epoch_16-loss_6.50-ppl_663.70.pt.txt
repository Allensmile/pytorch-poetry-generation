of wizards on a heap of horrd hosts 
 And no one is older. 
 This is a caber. 
 
 For you are gates to LV: 
 What did you do with home,' 
 You are not out of mind, 
 You are not about the land, 
 And the spoil of you, retir'd of regret. 
 
 The handy from Sunday to April wakes 
 With its Sunday look and song 
 So beat in the Slickensides, wound 
 the steadfast as with your mouth
