 I felt the Hail blood fluttering 
 With Its sack 
 On the slopes of sylvan meditation. 
 But ah! that my chances, life for me, 
 Is beautiful and rudely brown, 
 Girl out of sight and rainbow bring; 
 It is aware that sunlight is in death's stream, 
 Like rats on the ceaseless rills, 
 Head from the hawthorn in a corner, 
 Through the white river; the frozen sun 
 Goes forth. 
 
 2 
 What fear has written in my mind
