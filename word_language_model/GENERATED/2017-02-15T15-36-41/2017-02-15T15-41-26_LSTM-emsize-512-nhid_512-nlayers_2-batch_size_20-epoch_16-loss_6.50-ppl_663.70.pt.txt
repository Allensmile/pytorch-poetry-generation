cousin? old quay red and gray, 
 You will find those days deep but self 
 You know you cry of growing Hand, 
 
 Now where their ships are left and pine 
 To these new guns in Chroma 
 Seeing the dead men and the stars. 
 
 
 
 
 
 After the Assassination of All 
 
 
 Blessings from my "King 
 I gave down out reluctant pomp, 
 In a sight I'm open there, 
 By the name of my day,
