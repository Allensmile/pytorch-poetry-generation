breath 
 to Paul--St. But hanging on my thighs, 
 stillborn, having changed so long away 
 for when the burly light floats 
 to the sea of the world. 
 This is as a hand 
 over the Libya. or have you 
 found in the weight of down 
 into the crystal flag. 
 
 You know about that? 
 My little boy scrambled 
 off with us, slugging 
 his handlebar and body in rags 
 beautiful for his eyes. 
 That love is too
