THING. 

 
 i came on among trees and masks 
 under the willow ringing 
 where are the breakers where they meditate 
 
 the feathers from the telegraph back 
 from the dotted split air, 
 the painter builds his beautiful neck. 
 
 the silent sea had rolling starry wings. 
 
 what bars do they? i turn the way leaves. 
 i want to understand how people step 
 
 across the river's black at last, 
 and elms to flee. 
 
 beautiful
