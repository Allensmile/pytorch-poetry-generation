 These days the same days are dreamed for now 
 bursten-bellied, grim as hortcoming and as wine, 
 While, a man, lays over the rayon cried, 
 Something riding through a century 
 
 Where the students knows the King about it, 
 A Child-crying Troilus or contriving, 
 I see the open ring, 
 The water works its ban in New Land. 
 Whatever means fiend, yer poems, 
 Peace brought itself in hell, peewit;
