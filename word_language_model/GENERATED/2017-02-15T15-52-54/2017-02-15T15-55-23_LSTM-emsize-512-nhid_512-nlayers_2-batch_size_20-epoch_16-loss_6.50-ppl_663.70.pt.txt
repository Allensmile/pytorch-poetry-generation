a male rat white 
 and John - half-way in alley windows beginning 
 to turn stormed like a swarm of water. 
 Shabines, 
 brace raining out, party astray; 
 the whole parts of preparing ice, the stars, and leaves. 
 When we hisses? he stalls 
 above the map, saying turned 
 at its own gnaw, so the night 
 opens the sky, on its hind horn, & 
 
 all that this seems that nothing comes 
 to see when hair drops the swelling ground,
