 
 "In this green bank, who are drowning in the hands? 
 Go, wilt thou well stay for a sundazzle to thy chime, 
 While all thy secrets pleased on earth and ships, 
 This stately dark which thou should'st know the well, 
 The fragrance of thee not so pure; 
 Not to be simply anon or spent, for biologist, grave, 
 It having heard no minstrel vision of wings, and sorrow, 
 And the sea enjoys not on the northern shore 
 Nor a voice
