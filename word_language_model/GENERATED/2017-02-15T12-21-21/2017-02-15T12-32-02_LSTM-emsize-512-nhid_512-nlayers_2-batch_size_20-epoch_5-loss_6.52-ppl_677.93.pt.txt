THE LAST 

 Seems to live with me. remain 
 
 The ghost of himself 
 Has sweeter to the view where zot 
 Would emulate and met him before I drive 
 To clothe a nut or eat a globe said he. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Shall chas'd Echo 
 
 
 for the meticulosity Goods Years half you complain, 
 That will show you the best fortune of years I love? 
 Is it a name in this monument 
 And I swear she pads, an' you'll ask and see 
 The things that London is itself a map 
 To burn such little, and do not remember this. 
 
 
 
 
 
 from Shakespeare
