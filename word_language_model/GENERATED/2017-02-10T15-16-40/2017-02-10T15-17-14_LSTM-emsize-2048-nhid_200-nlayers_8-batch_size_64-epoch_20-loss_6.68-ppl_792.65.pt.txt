 grows tulip, 
 
 no single chestnut need here 
 among our rocket entities 
 
 
 &, i can't hear exactly getting human 
 instants waiting sincfage years behind. 
 bade the girls get onto the road 
 when they toss tense and panes 
 for incessant hills under the hill 
 the distracted path 
 trapped each wheels. 
 it was just any morning, 
 and we reach me in the flesh. 
 as love--when thinks
