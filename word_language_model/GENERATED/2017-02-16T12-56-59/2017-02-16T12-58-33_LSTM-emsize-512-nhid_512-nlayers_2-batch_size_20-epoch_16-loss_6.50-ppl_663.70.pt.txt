 
 But of young men feed their double grief 
 
 Among the liars & Freshen 
 
 The Muse, ploughed by some unequal court; 
 
 Blown into those long dazzling youths 
 
 The cisterns lily thro' the helmets of the East, 
 
 And as the azure snow-mist bore 
 
 At wakefulness; rings with noise from this 
 
 Puddle! Face or dish . . . Yea, . . . ? 
 
 
 V. 
 
 In Palestine, be killed with ace,
