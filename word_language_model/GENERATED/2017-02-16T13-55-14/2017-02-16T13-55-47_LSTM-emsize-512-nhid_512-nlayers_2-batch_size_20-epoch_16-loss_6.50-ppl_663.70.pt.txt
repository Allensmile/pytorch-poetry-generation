 In recommit or strife: 
 Driving some light in its eye, 
 
 "It was all I knew of the child. 
 
 When I got up again, or out on 
 
 Through a chart of paper, I looked back 
 
 XXV 
 
 It was the cicada on its raffia 
 
 to walk through the city's darkness, 
 
 pillar; I drifted in, 
 
 elsewhere being Eden; 
 
 Over all, as full, beyond a dying. 
 
 What is that precious
