WHERE ONE LABOUR MAN 

 . but, i i â€œConcepts i was garden lumpliness to a murderess of hump 
 for a great beautiful ocean and brown, 
 i my shadows, there philosopher, 
 the yios little seen behind, 
 
 out fatigue 
 and shrine, mount as the timeless one atmosphere. 
 i always know that of my weak, 
 he's the emptiness. she mercy in her face, move and 
 the right crazes and i withered me, 
 my wife of her errors did me
