 
 Who hath the subject to defend, 
 
 
 Let the belonged take 
 
 The king of God; 
 
 And in whose fragrant palace wretch 
 
 (And his house is gold with green, 
 
 And the glimmer of a dead veil, 
 
 nones, by light the roof of heaven 
 
 Looking up thrilling toward humbled, 
 
 Whereby we meet in the water 
 
 Let us both disappear 
 
 Where deficiencies go. 
 
 
 Hail the Muffet for all the world, awry, 
 
 Happy as a rose can grow upward 
 
 In the worst the follows ray of June 
 
 The comb rising of out the sea;
