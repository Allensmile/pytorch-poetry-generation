Miasma, A Rock Of The Day Where I Am Reminded 

 Of what is back, and what moves an idea, 
 enduring grows 
 congressmen, & scorn, and the sky-clad. 
 buttonholes, 
 That Fresno the general's face, 
 unrevealed. East populist empty, string and rust, 
 Soft beard, whose elms never lost life 
 And slips on itself with death for words. 
 Once I thought, of childhood, O tool, 
 Of sinister vegetables, and of fame, each 
 To turn one I and for a knight.
