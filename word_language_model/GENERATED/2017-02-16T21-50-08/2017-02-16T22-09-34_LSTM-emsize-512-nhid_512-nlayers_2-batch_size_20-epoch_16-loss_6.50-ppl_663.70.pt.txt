 
 And if the day lets life meet, climb down 
 Through the pine circle, through and out 
 The thousand years of one for little, yet 
 All running about them from the earth 
 That sings about, 
 And wreath. 
 Dropped out of the branch. 
 
 If for the knots thou did give, 
 That all waist-straps, 
 Hard earth he doth I wont, 
 Of some quick fervent face: 
 Their enamel Perswasively ne'er can endite. 
 
 At eve in goodness
