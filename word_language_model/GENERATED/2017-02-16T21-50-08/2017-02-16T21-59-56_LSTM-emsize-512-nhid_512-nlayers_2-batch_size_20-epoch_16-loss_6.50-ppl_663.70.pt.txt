 
 I am leading of a horse. 
 a rainbow web at a corner, 
 like a handle. It's not your blinded 
 done!" Last night my name is the special 
 high rolled of shallow birch on the outside 
 north door 
 one part of bed solid as a small ends of winter 
 across the hood, subway mountains after another. 
 
 There's a Pilgrim. You see the crying 
 move in the morning with a bag of tutelary 
 what will we do
