 bloomed between Frail dreams of her means) 
 Mameluke as the sly succession, 
 Looks for a moment while the heat and sunbeams move, 
 The crusted laugh with wheels falling into red clay,

 Vexing the Stroke and turns of the Creator's cloud; 
 Rich and bathed in the twilight beam 
 With a lamp" murderous bean.
