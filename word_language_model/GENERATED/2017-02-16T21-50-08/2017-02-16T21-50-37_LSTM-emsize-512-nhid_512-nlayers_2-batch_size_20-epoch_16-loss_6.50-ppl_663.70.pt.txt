Down. 

 
 So out of the loud ship, the long line, 
 Used with a somewhat nappy, 
 parallel. apart, a little spark 
 Of moods in kindle action balks 
 In numbers so hard for its desire. 
 
 You would bend out the garden of your naked strings, 
 Clear windows, eighty-three-year-old human quarter, 
 It surely is my dream, my wisdom, 
 And holiness of feeling, have newspapered, 
 For wasted advance. and there are Pan's gilty. 
 Every hour is worth the life
