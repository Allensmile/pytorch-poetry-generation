A Joke, 

 Nor Achaean saddle-bow, 
 But no Coasts reached the moor 
 And makes the bravest man that sees the sky; 
 And now the chest is made of cell; 
 And the Messiah of the first is dead; 
 But he will sleep in the harvest: 
 Man is the end of the runaway word 
 Which ass-cart, its pattern beauty away, 
 And the first sink's Adversarie away, 
 And makes high music on the soil -- 
 This dog that will approach from
