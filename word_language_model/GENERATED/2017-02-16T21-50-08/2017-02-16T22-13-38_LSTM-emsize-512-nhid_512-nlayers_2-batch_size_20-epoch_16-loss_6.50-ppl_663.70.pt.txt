 Hither he pulls a backward form, 
 it is the wound of sex 
 the sparrows could help 
 as their cold Dad does his uncle 
 bred, how he drift; 
 vocal words, too, being bold!" 
 And many Welcome; have our pace, 
 come happy, begging to stroll so clear. 
 What's wrong from care, this attempt to recover 
 But by making playbill truth are diving, pain, 
 harboured, bedspreads a ram. 
 The hounded doom proves as we use, 
 Drugged & There,
