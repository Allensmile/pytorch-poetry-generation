 She eased a crummock. The river massed 
 On self-making creak reminding the fly,

 Who lingers in the telephone: 
 Oh California, that I jealous then? 
 Never more, but joy -- -- sleeping corn and chase, 
 I would hoo-doo you, come together. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Maybe Reader Buried in the Together only with the niente,
