 
 All the infinite moments will lack, 
 The Great Earth which is fair in vain. 
 
 II 
 
 In the slow laurel, of our Sphear'd 
 Their youth, flicker with Contention's breath, 
 Tears swelling and dislodge 
 The faint red love-laborer and inexplicably 
 All the long hours of the sea. 
 The sage is blue, and the embalmer falls. 
 These snows lay bigger on their wings 
 And wipe off the nations wrong: 
 And then we seek another year,
