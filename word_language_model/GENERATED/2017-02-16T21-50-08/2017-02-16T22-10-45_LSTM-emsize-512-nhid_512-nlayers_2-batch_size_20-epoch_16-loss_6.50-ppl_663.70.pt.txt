 
 Or, that darkness of heaven's earnest rear 
 When the gasping drops, bores and swayed 
 The shrieking deal and the feeder twisted 
 Like a weed conceiv'd full of Spears, 
 Shining at the morning-glory below, 
 And the sword of it passes, the pitiless whale, 
 The eyes that hit the sea away: 
 
 Where on some house the people play, 
 I saw the first did haunts 
 That many a bubble there 
 Has slept at that the charm above
