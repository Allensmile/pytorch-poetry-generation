Herd Of Pines Rush Through The Wheat 

 Beside the coffin wind, the parent end. 
 Who is under a Beauty sagaland: 
 A little-known collection into street 
 May spout a devil's brush with little 
 A wreath of blood as the snake played with rain 
 Hanging above death, 
 Gleam and bird and scraps silver 
 
 In them, a joy, an space of thunder 
 All waves, plain light 
 Where fire lies foliage and the grass 
 Like a fuse as flower,
