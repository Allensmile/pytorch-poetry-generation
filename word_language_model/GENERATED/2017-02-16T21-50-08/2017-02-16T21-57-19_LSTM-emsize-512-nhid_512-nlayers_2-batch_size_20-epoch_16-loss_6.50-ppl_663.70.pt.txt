Again. 

 
 How did we know about the hot 
 flag and the garden called our swords. 
 impishly cried a pattern of twisted fire 
 From Drifted his one in hand tells respect 
 then broken up syllables of every miserable; 
 she'll shake them roads away & bring up her ears. 
 
 The homeless, which slit their fingers in their care, 
 The strong women wrapped their unbroken foods 
 And the white skeletons of the wheat swung over and over 
 helpless sailors
