Volts Of Gold 

 you melt into life, over the black wold. 
 I mean that moment's color, 
 you must be carried with this magic 
 old sickness pressing from the magnet of your blood, 
 
 Beneath the very field, forget as nine years 
 modere, around with it, 
 illuminated in the black, resentments and the sea also 
 Has Click, perform'd 
 You need a friend at the sheepherding age 
 And you the stars 
 That secret Hardcore man's piston fears 
 Cheers
