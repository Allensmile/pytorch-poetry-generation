 Starnbergersee in blocks behind the flowers of glass stasis: 
 feeble, chess on ragged plains and flap 
 plagues the arching rocks of the dead lie limbs 
 Thro' dark fields of bodies dropped into the storm, 
 solemn and yawning out on the horizon. 
 Inviting them as it did plain before. 
 
 In baboon and Staunching, despised men 
 Can help us, combo die well good years. 
 Water speaks a certain Change the mark on be:-- 
 This time to become more visible
