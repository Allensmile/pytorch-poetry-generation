Rock 

 
 If you find such a way I have left you, 
 Though it was like that, the next. 
 
 And you, damn death, content fate 
 To fill God's air! 
 You, dear must float with the weary new. 
 
 Do you not feel yourself like this globe, 
 I blame them they will not look at, 
 So do you think I die! 
 And if down your own return have been creeper-- 
 I have never of them laid a wing,
