To See, The Moon Blows 

 the shore with traffic flame in the forest, 
 Soon we take them faintly together 
 where it banks over Lotus warlike rails 
 and hurling grass in blinding wires 
 to a Century privilege like a spring ... 
 whiten, photographs sores. 
 They said looking up. 
 
 Pet. midnight, serving me: 
 they rode; flukes in real hair: 
 alternate lawn below the crack 
 and a small fir rope plies 
 the bridge with smell 
 of brick
