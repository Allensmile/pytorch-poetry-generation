 Men gave it back but that would think of them, 
 I sang extend for the sake to pay. 
 O sites now, - sorry: ! 
 
 
 
 
 
 To Live for the Royal Tale 
 
 
 These are rain--a Love, and wear 
 Fact of compassion like name-- 1930 
 You must call a thing not yet to vote 
 Till all the good merit given, yet shun 
 
 To love and envy, when I am Neglected 
 At yonder source
