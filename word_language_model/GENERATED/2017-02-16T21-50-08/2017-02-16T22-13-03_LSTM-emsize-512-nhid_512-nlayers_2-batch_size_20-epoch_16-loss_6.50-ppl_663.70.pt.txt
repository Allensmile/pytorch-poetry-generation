 I come on 
 aloft like topples 
 inside the neck and smoke of a tunnel 
 down the road will drive 
 
 all the way, into the night icy gates I bend 
 to vessel-vassal weep. 
 Here, how much surface is Bestirs 
 one goes back away, it is last I know so. 
 I am always deaf alive and rolling 
 through a filthy barrenness of grass, and a fish baked. 
 
 They turned me out to watch the Indiscriminate pin
