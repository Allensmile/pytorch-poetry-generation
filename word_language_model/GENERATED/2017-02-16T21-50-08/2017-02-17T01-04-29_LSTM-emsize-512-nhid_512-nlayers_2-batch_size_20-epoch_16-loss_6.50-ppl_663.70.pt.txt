 Everything is but a fruit 
 Too far. The machine 
 is fixed close to the end in the dark 
 Which is utterly long ago. 
 
 A second dream of ocean for an hours 
 A kind of animal that becomes light 
 In a great one or two of men. 
 Across what it must do, 
 
 Ever right but silently 
 happened, or back 
 For silver on a clear night 
 Pleased of us and affect it.
