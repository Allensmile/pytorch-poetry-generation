Charm 

 I hope I love the Knight without an oar, 
 touch them trail in the bedroom, white and sweet, 
 took my worst trunk from the rail 
 to rubble-stone untroubled life 
 rollen with chain in water and violent 
 moonshine, slipping out onto the shore, thinking 
 the sounds of ecstasy could keep 
 part of this or manly change, 
 where rocks are frozen before water 
 where stars come back from them. 
 
 We call in our mouths apartment must doff
