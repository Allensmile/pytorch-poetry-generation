 
 Over the river, the torrents descend 
 And strike my feet. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Hugging the Sound of Other minds 
 
 
 
 There is a brings-- 
 A Small Receave 
 In his slumps palace low-down 
 From which he replies across the street 
 
 
 
 
 
 Hymn among the American Bear in France 
 
 
 For transferred in the morning dark we see 
 The fallen night-sky 
 The ventriloquist papered the frame; 
 Dead whippy
