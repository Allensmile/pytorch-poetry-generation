PUTTIN MONEY OUT 

 I let you holler, yard bring you out 
 And bitches stop fronting, I'm here to put the chronic down 
 Cause I want that, I wanna pound that stick 
 Just don't wanna throw yo'self condom cuz a nigga kick that shit 
 Told my enemies to start school, and proclaimed 
 And, I'm about to get out of my ville, to ya don't play, they didn't lie 
 Don't know that, let me know boo 
 The weight, the criminals son Jae's Villain 
 But I really speak its rocking this flame 
 I hit drank with fresh, and everynight of my eject? 
 I'll slam it, bring it, like I wanna rise back
