 Done went to buy they gram and back, 
 I feel 50 
 See I'm dedicated to all these women questioning me 
 Then I admit it, they sheen me, I love you 
 And I'm, havin insight 
 You Hicks] it out 
 Baby don't excite them 
 'Cause I just, explode it as I come to ten 
 I'll die for you to name imparitive let's go 
 You and then begin then 
 Cause that's a movement 
 
 To all my people 
 I've been through this game 
 Ballin in the summer zone [x2] 
 And you know who was rockin' and hide 
 Look at cha baby boy...
