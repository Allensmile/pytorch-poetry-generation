THE ENEMY SPLIT 

 I use to act some crazy clouds in the mirror 
 I really mean my ancestors be dustin out this quiet tender dear race 
 Niggas hate to hear the backlash then jigged him through Tiddle-Dee-Dum bases 
 
 [Chorus 3X] 
 Treat me somethin 
 I can say I've love Lord I think I won't follow you 
 The gun of a don, I don't mean none of pride, and I'll never violate trusty views 
 Never hesitate to meet my brothers at some harm wonder 
 I'm spittin love and I run swiftly 
 My priority will find a mindstate nigga is bitter and better 
 People retire, but they ain't want some man to see
