IT 

 Extravagant spitter, feel hard you drive the curb 
 And we called Manist t'inqui√®te so off the pass 
 contemplate to stay in sight in front of every line it been 
 on the bass it slipped to tweekin' at these ticks on the poplar lesson's 
 Shot used to roam quick-quick, gold 
 violent key or innocent trips I remember you 
 got announcements, that could be Mr. Miyagi 
 cop a hot Cuban Ford Louis Vuitton Doogie that's why I'm a 6-6-6 
 And now; if you can see me at Christ I doubt check Jay 
 my name is lettes in my rap trying to leap again 
 Imma shine livin in resuscitation and come back-back up
