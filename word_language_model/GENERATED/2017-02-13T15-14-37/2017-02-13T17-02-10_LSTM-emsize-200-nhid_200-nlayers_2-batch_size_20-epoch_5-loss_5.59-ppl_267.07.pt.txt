YOU KNOW? 

 I remember the days on a incline 
 Why I was young Life 
 Tryin' to beast me 
 Because you was now 
 now you feel me? 
 There's too many ways every day yo live in a world of project world 
 I go back to the ground and go buy mine 
 Mike you don't know the times 
 It will be no place I should taken 
 Right now, still giving up an drop some shit 
 I'd like to tell you to candle's hot if you than worse than that long distance 
 So hold up wishin now rock-a-fella, is so your 2007 can in them Huh-ha, 
 Lean to the pier folks hurry
