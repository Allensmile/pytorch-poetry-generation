 An I misdemeanor it cause I'm that black MC fool we know we're 
 Plus we parked one day for if we bang you can 
 But we could bring a sword to feds for the bigger states 
 Family youth can like.. runnin it dead 
 But it's like every day, a five minutes plus a little link 
 When you cross ha, they facin kids, and for Kama ulcer, articulate niggaz and crack balls 
 Don't you know, I know re-coppin', unicycle 
 The Boogie Channel E are tagging as sheep 
 Who's to feed you stage lil'bro where the white diamond is 
 Throw the fight to the left, plus of the night 
 A green flavored bottle,
