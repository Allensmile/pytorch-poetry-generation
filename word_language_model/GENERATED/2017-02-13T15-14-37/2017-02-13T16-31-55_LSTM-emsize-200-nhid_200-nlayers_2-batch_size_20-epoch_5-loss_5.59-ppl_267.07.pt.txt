ME DO ME 

 and try to sneak it, but in this rap world is you Playboy... 
 
 [Outro] 
 I wake up another, lookin for a appetite 
 you don't love me? I'm not a no one 
 I will tell you why I stay murdered in my life 
 you like my flow, that's why I act 'em 
 I never try to defend you but I talk but they don't stop 
 keeps me from the place to deal these cowards 
 my ass is goin through my hood on and then I started 
 I fought for not 
 (Michigan) standing on fire then of it long long 
 and I don't give a fuck who incite
