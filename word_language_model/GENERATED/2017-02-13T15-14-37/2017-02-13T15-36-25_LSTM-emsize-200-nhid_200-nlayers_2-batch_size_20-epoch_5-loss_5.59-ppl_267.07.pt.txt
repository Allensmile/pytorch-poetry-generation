YOU 

 I'm red in the flow, working dirty, cause I wonder why we're playing 
 lambskin timin' through communication full and murder apparatus 
 Bills over here for them boys on the roll and their number five, ain't it? These tapes say it's only good 
 'Cause I'm a do funky cat with a pen Hershey's heater and get it 
 and she don't even know when it come was great 
 
 (Chorus) 
 I know you pay for something good it's nothin but the key to T.C.B. 
 I'm noticing I can meet you and I really want my last breath 
 What's the problem? Ever since my moma's gone end 
 It was never duplicated - white glands
