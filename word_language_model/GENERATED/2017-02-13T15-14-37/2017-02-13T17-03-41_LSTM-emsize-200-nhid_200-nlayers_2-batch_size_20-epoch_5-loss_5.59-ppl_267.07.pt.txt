THAT'S YOUR ALL WORLD GROOVE 

 You can just screw em, we can take our weapons 
 Put our chrome under my wing on your shoulder 
 flee our mouth and raise some rooftop on the... 
 
 Can pump it up, shut it down 
 Went from out the lights and the sky blowin' up 
 Low slum, spittin' shit off in a coffin 
 Lay the business down with a cap to start 
 Cause I'm coming back to say that hue is COURSE all day 
 I love this hood so you an boxcut with life on the right sky lanes) 
 I don't shut this shit, cuz we chapters this some more Ice Age is bliss 
 Working
