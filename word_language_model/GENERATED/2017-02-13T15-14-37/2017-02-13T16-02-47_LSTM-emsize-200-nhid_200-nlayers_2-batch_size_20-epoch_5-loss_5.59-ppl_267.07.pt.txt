ICE BLACK MAGIC 

 front as long as you see me lookin for fun 
 if you watchin fool, I will soon change down on sail 
 I also use so I blast, push up smooth the dangerous [x2] 
 
 I hit you in a jewel 
 floors two shorties hope 
 for my money and diamonds and pearls come 
 I tell 'em I love to say it 
 we comin through and parlay to get this guap hold it 
 its gettin' done 
 respect play for relief 
 we need a target to fight 
 lets stand high 
 
 [CHORUS] 
 Out of 308's control the masses 
 Leaves each and perverts every line of attack
