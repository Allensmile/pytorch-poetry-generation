TAKE FLICKS 

 On a big road stroll the lights you should take mine 
 And what am I raising rocks off this spitting. 
 Yeah he wants to hurt piling organisation to my self burning up the candles set 
 Tell me that you need to overdoze do ya best to do it 
 so you some isis bitch Dro top 
 and you don't stop 'til we got more hullabaloo 
 and says we name you, we don't talk 'bout thugs we don't read it 
 Load you with butt hits, CD zone finished flirtin next month like blocks 
 A cop is fake, who preach Spanish 
 and for them hustlers for their flavor 
 ignited, filthy Sinatra, wit
