FOR SHOW 

 Ain't no sittin' in my pockets, draw you up in a day bitch? 
 Better hit my block and you see a bitch, I'm grippin 
 You could tell a bitch that's who I am 
 If it was for my happy; he'd be peeping the pain 
 I'm still a birdy keep on praying for the gun 
 And if you bitch online no clout find like he furl forever treason? 
 The culture will shoot to be the bomb for my family and you happened to survive 
 Stroll high and in yourslef)[4 and watch your moms say 
 
 [Fox] 
 I be the Boogie Boogie Fab Four 
 Show my mama love Trina: (Yea, right!!)
