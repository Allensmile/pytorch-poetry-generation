*CREAM* CREW FROM THE BROWNSVILLE TEX 

 In rapture, with a grapple gettin whipped I got, trapped like a tanning 
 Don't make me feel, get to miss Heidi 
 
 blindfolds 
 Yo I got a lot to do with the flavor 
 More cinematic key that see the sun like garnish rollers 
 Fuckin with a blessed Pac a.k.a. Al Capone 
 Just to survive in a game like, DO HOLD 
 Now whose talks while you in the bathroom traps and yells 
 (Gucci's) on some sun tips slice like Two g's 
 Just well spit at the mic slugs runnin and (...problem 
 When I have to say you know me ain't once,or please what I see it
