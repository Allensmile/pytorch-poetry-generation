DEAF 

 Cause I won't lie, I'm usin the goal in my dash like a mess that's real, huh 
 See my boyfriend came through, don't ever sleep 
 I don't mind to tamper in far bout all these fake thugs 
 But do you believe me? Niro, is the only way out big dog 
 No lie B, fuck it, she little little lynchin', 
 
 [Chorus: Brooke Valentine] 
 
 [Verse 3] 
 Smoke a dub you Uptown for it Dice satisfies 
 My freestyles are going, got a bunch up and niggas ever open 
 then my dick chosen 
 To pull breath momma...moan like the mob strike to tomorrow 
 Get clapped on (YOW!) put diamonds on their
