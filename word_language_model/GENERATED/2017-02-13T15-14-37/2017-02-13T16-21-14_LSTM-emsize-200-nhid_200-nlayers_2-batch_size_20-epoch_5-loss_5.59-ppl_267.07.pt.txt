HOTELS 

 I usually parlay wit the Ciroc, like a sea to him 
 And please let me go Capi-tan, issues, I spent my time on a dream 
 Cause the block hard as I'm tryin' to be on momma 
 You might catch with me or pimping 
 to get a little taller like Bison on some food 
 And I be battlin' out, shots and make a lot of Master P: 
 Then I carried a fly but I knew 
 I was out there in this mackin zone 
 To fire lost and coldhearted it's too late 
 
 [Pete Rock] 
 Yo, don't get rushed Stalin, 
 And I'm faded, a drinking, fuckin' shhh... 
 Working for them
