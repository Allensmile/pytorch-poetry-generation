GALLON 

 Cause Chinese, exposed for this drug crack fella 
 Man never ever Ignorant, multiply a habit 
 Male Friends outta chorus 
 You may mention you that are yo' breaking in yo face 
 
 [ repeated n the scratches ] 
 I know you see, and now you got anyone together 
 Did you know if you had the recipe to get it with you? 
 This way too not funny" 
 You know this 50/50 world search for the right, at your hs meal's half broke 
 And I wish for her to wait for a campaign 
 Slapped him with a house in the trunk with some breath your Aaron Homes 
 But I'm warrin' then Honeymooners
