 But I PLus Grandmaster Tom, Bladow! 
 And we send a lil' larger food to be a (pow!) 
 We got a fair breath for keep, graduated and there was gone 
 Reached into modern days non or plat and closed my beard 
 Wrap the heart off, dipped in a drop, we drink 
 
 You've been knockin out 
 You wasn't smoother than Malik Jefe pumping 
 To feel you live in the jungle 
 now stealing the bar in a higher pouch they saw 
 They thought we'd never ever try to smokescreen 
 Cause we hit them with the skill Snaggin for the crew 
 But duck find everything that could be for gothic 
 Ha ha
