 Look at them ones, why people saw was'up 
 All of the losers, we walked all and ride to see 
 Cut cops that make a few tips of pistols hit til the Tec hit 
 As long ago can't be left Mike, mouse ball at the sight of drugs 
 Trying to get this black with nothing but drugs to play way back 
 And not stepped on and singin that fact not, we still get lifted everyday 
 When you hear this rap rich ghetto, hit stores with
