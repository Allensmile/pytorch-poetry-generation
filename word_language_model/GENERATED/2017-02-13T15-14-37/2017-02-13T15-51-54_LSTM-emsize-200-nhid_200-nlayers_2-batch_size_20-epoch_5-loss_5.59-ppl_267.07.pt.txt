 Get on Attacks to stereo, hands up if that's to be the nicest 
 Abandoned Roots world is my stomping side 
 Heavy country, and 151 in jerk, hi-hats 
 The sound that you ever seen is apple breaks

 Master the P happens, ya'll best friends 
 (We bout to tell you who you is)

 But my seventh sense gangsta click tell
