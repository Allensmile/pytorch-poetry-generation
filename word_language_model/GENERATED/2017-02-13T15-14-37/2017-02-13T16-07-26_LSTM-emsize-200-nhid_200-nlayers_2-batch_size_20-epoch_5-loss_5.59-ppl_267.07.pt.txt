 You better believe about a outlook line that's legit 
 Little bizack things ain't changed you gotta get in ya 
 And you don't hear them die you ain't tryin' to go to the level 
 Cause they don't know who that mean steel list; I need help being a millionaire 
 Cause we rock good and we get out of our way 
 Just sit to hell for long and came 
 Where the majority is 
 
 [Chorus: Jadakiss] (Bobby Eye] 
 We taking to the river, nothing's not that time 
 You need to chill 'til then 
 Cause we Reign High voltage, you know) 
 Boys gonna change them inventory 
 We fightin' for a Birthright
