MOTHER="" IT" 

 [Name] got one hand in the air 
 Would you have take a man -- just like this?) 
 
 [Lil' Flip] why do you back no way you dig? 
 Man you think you wanna mother'll reach for 'til you meet a blessin 
 Nigga love you to me, I put you to bed 
 And make a million, wanna test like some chow 
 
 [???] good at talk of you and your broads 
 On them these niggaz let's ride 
 And foes ride us them gorillas when them motherfuckers die 
 Cause we like em hold'n it don't stop till we fall 
 And to the jams to the police, I get in for them,
