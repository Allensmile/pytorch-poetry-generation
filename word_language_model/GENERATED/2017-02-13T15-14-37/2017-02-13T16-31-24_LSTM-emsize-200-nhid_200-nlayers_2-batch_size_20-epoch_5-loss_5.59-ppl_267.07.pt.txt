 [Verse Two: Mr Tongue] 
 From the D to the exit to SportsPlus us is too many beaters in Philly 
 It's all about our wrist, who we? just call war 
 Goin for sure we discuss with alike, Midwest out 
 Let's God money and tears, who got zero degree, just to get us up on a couch, cause this is us 
 Shout out of our parents, we don't speak trees 
 Ya cats, they only got one, I'ma shoot
