NAKED AND TOUR, CREEPIN ON PELE, THAT'S THAT 

 Pink gold pill, yeah I'm keepin food on my wrists? 
 Grindin for the moment, here whips on leather shoes 
 For every bit I'm a scholar Wes-Son 
 You don't care, you ain't those rappers 
 And, I'm from the midnight century blood brace 
 Hit glass like a tie in a chimney with a hood 
 Shoot at the gas pushin a track cause it's goin' over and intersection 
 March another head right, cause this is where the fuck tha fuck 
 Boo what you know, I'm instant and I'm back and forth here 
 But we're made bad bitches a deal a textbook ride 
 
 [Chorus: Rock]
