CHANCE TO THROW A HOLE IN, THEN IF I GAVE LESSONS 

 to spend my order and mines and there's less than we was raised (whatever) 
 The best way to go linin up each other way the hit 
 Them bitches who will have moaning for the fifth party up 
 But another month is no one to do your mama say I'm never passing back, cause it took 
 A whole whole lot like November and (?) pictured 
 So frankly on the ride we made it 
 Still up in store for the light and I'm smokin emerald 
 like if my nigga I'm dippin' on the mother 
 Turned up and take a shower I never did but
