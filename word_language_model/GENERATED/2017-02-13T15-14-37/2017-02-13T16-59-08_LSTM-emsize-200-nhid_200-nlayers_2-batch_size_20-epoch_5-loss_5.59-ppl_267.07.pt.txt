THIS NEVER PIMPS? 

 Just eat rhymes to illustrate a nightly day it's just because 
 
 (Chorus) 
 satisfaction from the bottom to the 9-8 
 Turn me to stone 
 I know not all I can 
 Just make a memory of y'all 
 Shoot the cops no more war in microwaves 
 Don't fuck around, hit it and pass it around 
 These brand new, niggas on the prowl they turn it down 
 
 [King Fensta] 
 True, one foot games, Ruthless, and barracudas 
 Water got a mind full of numb and take a strap over 
 Turn em out foul, while I'm living with a fight, and no power 
 You know whos back, I was
