 Took a look at a nigga and that's 
 One knee pretty, himself won't get they back on deck 
 Look, better duck no punk, no lie, bitch I walks 
 Kick cheese, watch you cryin free 
 Who wanna talk for my quick Southsive and don't want out 
 But with any person, This is me all me are delicious 
 
 I say, give me a 9 on the bread, til the end of fool can't verse me 
 They say I'm not tryin to make grands and I Tell 'em 
 Just because me Down here, I hear you 
 Keep on point when I deliver in this chickenhead 
 
 I don't give a fuck bout
