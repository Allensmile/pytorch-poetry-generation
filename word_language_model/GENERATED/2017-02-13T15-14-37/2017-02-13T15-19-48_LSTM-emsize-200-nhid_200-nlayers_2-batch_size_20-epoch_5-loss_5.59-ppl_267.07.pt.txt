IT'S SAFE TO FIND 

 And it ain't down for cents they nothing but blazing in your eyes 
 so much a bitch now you see it was hard Wes, show my point meaning 
 God he don't give a fuck, that's that mean shit he had feeling 
 I used to want to quit waking ta see the amateurs 
 don't do nothin new to Atlanta the waste who 
 and they put a diamond on the air in my honey 
 and get a realer shot to puttin niggaz into a size vent 
 and get a partner, bet Mack doesn't budge they're scared B 
 
 oh 
 I brick castle for my people 
 and muthafucka watch ain't
