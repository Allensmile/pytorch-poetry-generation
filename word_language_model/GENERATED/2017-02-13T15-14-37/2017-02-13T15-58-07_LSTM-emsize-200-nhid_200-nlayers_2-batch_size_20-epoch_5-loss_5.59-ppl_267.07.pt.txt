 Revolver, Liddo 
 The Boogie Down Crew let's ride yeah this is Piru 
 See, they say something 
 thugs smack beats, the mansion you know it is 
 Shotgun box, Mystic Terror overdosin 
 Hillbillie like some Big Tymers 
 
 We reign above seas, thug hard 
 None say InI fly, has inventin daggers 
 Why broke croies-tu and bred like salad 
 It's doomed for our late East Nation and Greek 
 My niggas will still shine for us shit 
 Green beam look at the sober life, for our dogs wit heat 
 Smokin' and armed with killers, they never invested 
 And can't slick get caught, layin' in your
