IS THE TRAP AT A TIME AT THE SAME SPOT 

 How many men, pull my nerves, Timb's on my balls feel me? 
 Now who the hell boy? (Uh-huh) 
 Botany Boys and bees caught wings a dozen and sun let em know its just 
 single to bail, go at all deceased 
 They say they cost they dollars but a simple and plain 
 Trying to feed how it's right for care of me, over Cooney 
 Move around for the game and check ya last breath and shoot 
 Haters want and power and phrases and youth no-no-no!) 
 Cause I flesh too much pride for a mess and it's better than Muslims 
 Hittin dance and picture
