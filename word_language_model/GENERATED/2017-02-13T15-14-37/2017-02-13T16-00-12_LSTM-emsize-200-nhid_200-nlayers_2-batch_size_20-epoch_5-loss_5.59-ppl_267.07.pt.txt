ROCK IS BEST YOU WATCHIN' ME 

 I'm a deadly Luciano, ay OK! 
 It's our time to go for 
 Got a man, sent to fuckin eat in this entity 
 It was stacked like a roam, mayn beat the rounds to grit 
 Bloody manslaughter ways when I approach in your front door 
 Roaches and little crib, we like whatever you are. They said, "Man, bout his heat out of my window 
 
 [Chorus: repeat 6X] 
 See game is a crime but you know that thin end up from the chains, so go (YEAH!) 
 I get stomped and let that motherfuckin' be a buck in me a semi 
 Niggaz got me pissed, cause I'm dictated
