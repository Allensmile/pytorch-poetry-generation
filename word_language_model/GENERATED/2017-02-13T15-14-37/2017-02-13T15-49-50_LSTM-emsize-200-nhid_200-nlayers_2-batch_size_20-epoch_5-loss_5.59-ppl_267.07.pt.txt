TO HOLD YOU CLOSELY 

 in the ground and bring the numbers far as my gente, sick 
 dump, we bring food you need cover 
 the shit is like y'all were PLAYAS! thereafter, from the street cloud 
 but check at the fakes and actuality for the consumer 
 I touch: From my pleasure to you without that plight? 
 brothers are to die away the day it wouldn't apologize 
 even when they made brain time a scream 
 death relayin?! I'm flyin abolished it doesn't hurt that 
 it change so hills{?} don't let a others sell out 
 I'm moving up and I can't stop it 
 Keep a mind and you'll stop me 
 cause I shine
