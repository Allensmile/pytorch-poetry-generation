I YO (BABY) 

 (Brotha Lynch Rick) 
 Catch your cut over X cause your boy got him waking up deceased 
 Yeah, back of the (woah!) habit's on a trip in flat cable 
 My bank account scrape, your bitch a dick up against me 
 Aiyyo I work those, try'nna handle court and dropped this beef blowin, Oakland Doo 
 Waitin for my niggaz to carry me coming out nigga talkin about Rap 
 You stuck in the air side of the map I hit you peeling baby chop 
 On North, North, silver, with Louis bro, I tote buddha 
 I edge, I'm in my place and really 
 
 [Chorus] 
 Though she knows I been servin' cane
