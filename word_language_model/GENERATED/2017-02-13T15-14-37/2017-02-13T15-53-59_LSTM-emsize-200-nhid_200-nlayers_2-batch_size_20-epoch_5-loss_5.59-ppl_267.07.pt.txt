 (Talking) 
 Yeah, yeah, you know who you are 
 Only gettin a planted off just to two swallows 
 wait for the big guns, or the honey 
 And let 'em know I had a brimecell 
 But money was up North rich stat's never had a clue 
 Came at a few infold or good I say 
 Pot haulin hoes 
 Sure to holler, (for what's mine? 
 Hold your eyes down see the heads whose eyes and the homey bang 
 (Motherfuckers just like it) I think I'm hip, check Mel from ya scandalous ass (oh!) 
 I go to see you like a Paybaaaack 
 You hold a mill-ion
