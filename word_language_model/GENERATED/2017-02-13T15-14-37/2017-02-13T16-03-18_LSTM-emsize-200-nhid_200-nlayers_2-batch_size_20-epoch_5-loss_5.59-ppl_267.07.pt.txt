 Five fives, one body or two Jurass three (two) 
 a ya-bet full load while we from a sucker 
 One of the kind for our rock and America...

 If you ever get bond" 
 And got out to say endin', they're doin' not cursin' by 'em and Rod-eo plannin' for money for two six hundred)

 that mine is rugged motherfuckers 
 who think they rap supremacy
