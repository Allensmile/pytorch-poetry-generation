DREAM, FRONT TRACKS 

 Ass different, prophecized, execution slithered gun marks 
 klauen witness theatrical Jellyin' 
 With demons on the mic, ain't nothin else bombin' ya 
 And as I stand, it scares more than that art is existing 
 With death of an mount on, why the strong sword reveal 
 Undermine it so flex an automatic, and thrown that ----&gt; 
 It ain't hot" as shit 
 Grand Chapman say it was hard to switch and return 
 I guess it had to be heroes 
 Athletes songs were born right in front of those peers 
 Earning bids to those who where time lead 
 (The way I see the juras like Mr. Cheeks from the eighties)
