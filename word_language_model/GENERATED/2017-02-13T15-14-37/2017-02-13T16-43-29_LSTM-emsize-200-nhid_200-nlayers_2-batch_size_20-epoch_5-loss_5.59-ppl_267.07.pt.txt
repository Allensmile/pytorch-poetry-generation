 me to the fullest and see who was wicked for the homicidal, 
 You thought I was a fan so excuse the streets iiinn.. 
 And not show but you got to stay ever be missing 
 But we acting extra, all true niggaz be hatin 
 MCer's Mariner grippin on some empty tips 
 And here I'm at least, this is how we get it, y'all

 Excuses, I came here for the souls, forgive your street loss 
 A blink on these hoes, for them snitches that'll cross cards 
 All my niggaz nigga eat shrimp, no bitches lose my minds I'm totin' 
 I was with proper bitches felt bitch half of
