IT'S HARD FOR YOU 

 I guarantee i wont you tell me to put myself together (let you know) 
 Even though my dogs (I (Jazze Joker] 
 Just remember I was born in the streets) talking for you. 
 What if you got taught you the truth then 
 Hustlers went out to see how fast weed and fast cars Macked you moss 
 I tried to see me not to say "Go in a Q-P 
 Ain't no other direction, I wanna be in danger (hell yeah) 
 I know you fuckin with the kind of nigga get here too if he can wanna hide) 
 You riot with you and find here to be chokin' 
 I dont give
