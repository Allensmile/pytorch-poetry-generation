QUATERAS 

 Every day part maulin down for coke 
 More levels, razor in cuss like Van Gogh 
 Only seen pumps and streams of alarm 
 Left here, lifelong individual 
 With them in college and narrow for their mental rights 
 That high LIFE' is ISSS! 
 Flashin psychics for lunch in the gate and they hide to digest em 
 Each awakaning, DeVante creeps and friends 
 Those things can't how their escape 
 [Blueprint] to create, I've been doing time 
 L-E-P, rendered devastated by asshairs and Wyclef eternally 
 A born generation sound real fast 
 How many times will mean it 
 The scurrin' riot razoni guns and melodies, the bootleggers bein' able 
 jealousy was
