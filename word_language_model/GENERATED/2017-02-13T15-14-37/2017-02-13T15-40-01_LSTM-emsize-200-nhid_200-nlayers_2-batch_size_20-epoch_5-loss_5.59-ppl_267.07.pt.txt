HE STOP 

 See you by yourself and seen maggots in my socks 
 Before the Nation came this is Bubba diggy kid's did 
 Get into some mistakes to chop by 50 O'clock with no bite 
 I done, I tell you that I hope you hate me. 
 Cause we why we lookin for probation and changin minds 
 Raps crack pour haze storin voice 
 Smokin vodka, throwin dubs, we bought heat and we haven't sold shit 
 Hold the (high) I got our rides 
 Training in hoopties and satellites gotta sneak for any case? 
 
 [ CHORUS ] 
 Yes yes, yes y'all, but yo this is how you feel, now too will get) 
 Yeah.
