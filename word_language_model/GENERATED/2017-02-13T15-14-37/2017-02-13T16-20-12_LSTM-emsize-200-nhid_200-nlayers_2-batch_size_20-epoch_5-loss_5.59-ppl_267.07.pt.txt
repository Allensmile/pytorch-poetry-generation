 And this is over this loud - god bless the profit, I never been afraid to eat 
 Hurry up out of my number bottle, we gotta deal like you do 
 Until everyday began we got plenty of time to do times 
 Rising the way and oh you moved with the freeway, call my friend 
 Parties at the Yard blood and the moon that crime as hungry in white 
 Yo slow my face, I got my dogs comb up a line 
 
 [Mannie Fresh] 
 [Talking] 
 Yeah it's a big world 
 State of (hiccup) just out of 'nother days, [repeat end wit but for weeks 
 I let you know I was too Hip-Hop!
