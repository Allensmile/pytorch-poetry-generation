 I'm tired of tryin to hear this headlock 
 Get convicted you got the idea in the hood, the name is long 
 Actin silly, I don't stop 
 Cybernatics, I don't live longer than your first thing 
 Cause you don't know really what you ..yo, 
 ??? or maybe I'll return you slow lier 
 My only wish ain't no love, graduate 
 My daddy got rent pray, he know that you gained the one-way, I don't know what to do 
 Remember me, put me on you can't try 
 because my name is commonly Capri man 
 I wish I didn't get out of this game 
 I'm just back with this one and all this solid
