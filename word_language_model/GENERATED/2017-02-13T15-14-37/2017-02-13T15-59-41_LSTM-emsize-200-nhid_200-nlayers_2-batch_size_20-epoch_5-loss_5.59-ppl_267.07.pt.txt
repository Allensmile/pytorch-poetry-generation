 kicks? Yo, visions? Parker Crack get 'em Chea, Ahh yeah waterproof, know about that Yess.. (Alright) 
 Bring your move to my record 
 Givin off a Misses+ to your whole motherfuckin body up to my rookie contributions 
 And every day I place in a safe and he through my track (uh, yeah) 
 Laz I got a different family) What is heaven

 Coolin in the back, I speak our rearview 
 My diamonds like push up out the cut, fatal skin 
 The criticism is what I spot young piled in a room 
 Heaven or Power or never, you will tell us how it
