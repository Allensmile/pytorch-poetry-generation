WU-TANG, SO NIGGAS GOT US KINGS 

 
 [J-Ro] 
 Toronto with a sound crates and rocks is always smokin fat shit 
 No way, either day, I can FUCK YOU 
 I've heard it last, "Who would be my wifey 
 Aiyo, I call, to a boss I spent things the worse right 
 Tell them when I'm busting, and I gets dough 
 I'm the bitch like me, Baby I don't wanna get up inside 
 Cause that's why I wasn't playing too wrong, cause niggaz
