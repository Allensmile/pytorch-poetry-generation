RIDE THE STREET AND DO IT 

 BULLSHIT testing the bucks and desensitize me 
 I'm trynna have that, I'm only on Death Row 
 the Boogie Black, is well at seven Chevy syrup and a {*Gang*} 
 My stash is limit, women and weed and rides 
 Somebody will say they gon' suck my dick 
 You're doing my thing, scramble don't mean I'm clean kicka' 
 that's to be burned is soft, a Two-eleven, doin my concert Gummy bars 
 {*babbles*} and I salir, BITCHES
