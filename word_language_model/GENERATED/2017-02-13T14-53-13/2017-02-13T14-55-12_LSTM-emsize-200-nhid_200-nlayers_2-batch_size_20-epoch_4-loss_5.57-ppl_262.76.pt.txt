YOU SCRATCH CAMOUFLAGING BABY 

 Caught you slippin', you all will fucking ever get out there 
 we rode with Scarecrow, we was at Jim Spade flock 
 
 [Big Pun] 
 Now you gotta do this shit, you made the rich boy get steamed 
 Jumped in, stop savin in 
 You trippin off of a nigga they say homie 
 How could you get rid of it all, and they bad kids 
 I wouldn't follow your girl my way, show me diamond Secret (yeah)
