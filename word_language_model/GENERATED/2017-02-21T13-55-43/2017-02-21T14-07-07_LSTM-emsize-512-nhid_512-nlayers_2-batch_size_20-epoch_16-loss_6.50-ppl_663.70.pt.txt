 A thousand hills, 
 A arched start, 
 Like "Excursion" 
 
 Made of them even as rilled and wak't, 
 It moves or once dukedom 
 On New embryo unwanted 
 And the world of every woman has to know 
 Fishday in darkness, his stone longer, 
 Weaves a forest where; 
 Hand to the tip of a snow-hut 
 In a quiet dream 
 Which is neither long 
 Nor anything soft 
 Nor far lies in its Soul 
 A greedy graves in
