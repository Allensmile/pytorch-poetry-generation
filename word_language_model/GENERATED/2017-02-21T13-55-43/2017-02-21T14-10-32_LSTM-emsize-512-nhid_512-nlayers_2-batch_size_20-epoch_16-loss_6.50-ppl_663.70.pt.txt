The Lovely Bull 

 Bless me, fair H. of thy rosy perfect might, 
 Ah, how I feel the sunlight, 
 Ere I hear thee call the good to care; 
 Love's bright eyes famous as the hairs that draw 
 Of the dead or winds of the dove. 
 
 Under the bank, where are the stars 
 That seem have taught thee to rave again; 
 They mocked thee dreams in the sphere of day, 
 Lo, the world's little quicken its voice 
 Faith prime,
