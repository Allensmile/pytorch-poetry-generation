 And knocks the rough And tremulous blue. 
 
 I hear a mirror's machine open on the ground. 
 Less disbelief KIDS and content 
 Than the sheep. Old sandpaper genocide 
 From among the dresser trees, in sunshine 
 Or the fawn, or perpetual child? 
 
 I have a special look, cold and still, 
 A fantastic head simply lost in the first 
 And sad house runs to other side. 
 Beneath the windows, on the hill, 
 Like deep paths, and hidden shade,
