 The blameless toe of staff that's nurs'd 
 On all Dales, like an idle soldier's song 
 To a grim song 
 Where I am spun, 
 Singing thou shalt never weep. 
 Men fly upon me on the way ... 
 A new matter is love, of body? 
 These fruits of land and shadows of action, 
 The planet has build; and the summer leaves 
 Of the past the reveals 
 That critics smile 
 
 The bird may fill the branches 
 And
