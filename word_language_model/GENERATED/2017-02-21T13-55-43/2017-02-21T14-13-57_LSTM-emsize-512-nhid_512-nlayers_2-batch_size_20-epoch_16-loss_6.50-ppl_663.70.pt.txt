 In a pony calm, 
 The jug is to follow it! 
 morgenleoht 
 Where birds are running upward and sand 
 Within the yearning, as rain divine 
 "May grasp the sea-- and sit Land, 
 And with just as suns slaughtered 
 To stand in many parties 
 Male together 
 
 In small distances, a sift of mist falling 
 Filled the heart of a small sedge 
 Altar, the morning-glory standing down 
 In the corridor of morning, clean in the distance,
