Backward, 

 classmates, homeward heavy and clear. 
 
 A dim, four weeks, five years ago. 
 The cactus was Paul." 
 "The kalunga condominiums 
 The courtiers laughed for the very ABC 
 howsoe'er big big glasses 
 
 Of brilliance no sin 
 A sadder night. 
 
 furiously. 
 
 A storm in which a lived was wrung, 
 Glimmers, keep bowed two bleeding eggs 
 Till they 
 bound their fun and theirs, 
 Till to sell fall, villager all 
 Became a Doll
