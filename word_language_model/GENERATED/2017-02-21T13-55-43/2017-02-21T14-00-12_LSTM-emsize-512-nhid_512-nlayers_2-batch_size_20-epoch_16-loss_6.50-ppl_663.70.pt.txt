The Hills This Hour Brotherhood 

 Found the heart's face to be the sound under the wind, 
 A summer scarf in the redwood forbidden form that wakes 
 Above Later, the static and the long stars creep away 
 And the naked fires thereupon might toll out of their virtues 
 Every hour of time it ended like a chill land 
 When snow blowing through long hurrying stones. 
 It must come, light down upon the grass rising. 
 
 Alas, there is a serpent hidden
