Rivers 

 Like premonitory toys, prophet. hue, 
 A spring chirp in the evening night 
 
 But the sea's stillness waits for the young, 
 Life is not worth a peace for me; none of time, 
 The dead, the rumour in his trump and the strong are almost one. 
 
 Hence have you any teeth of mad earth itself. 
 Soldiers are winds in the water and on a night, 
 By their desires they hear them in, 
 But in their untrodden smothering walls
