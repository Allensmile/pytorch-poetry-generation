 The sweet oak male used to stray 
 Their pamper'd creeping band and hood 
 High from the head of a spoonful dipped 
 On melted mornings, from the cable 
 The cattle cone with guitars, 
 The dreadful dance of a traveller goes; 
 
 
 
 
 
 For the Sun 
 
 
 An ancient light! now song lexicals 
 meadows now lifts with chill and stone, 
 Simple and reverence, 
 whirlpool's and breathing deep, 
 hoard-guard waggling half towers 
 Seasons: palate
