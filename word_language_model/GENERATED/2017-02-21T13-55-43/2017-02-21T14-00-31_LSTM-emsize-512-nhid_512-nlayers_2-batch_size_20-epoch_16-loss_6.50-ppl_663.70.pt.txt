It Has Come. 

 The Search ones are patient with their Pre-war 
 tunes, but a merciful cake that glimmers down 
 To have them do well to survive, 
 Will death be such an Chill they are wasted-- 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Hill 
 
 
 The sun forgets to a valley town 
 Ye despair 
 Body of tears and hair in your dusty chamber, 
 Bringing bullets of heresy. 
 
 Ah, cruel power hold me 
 Out of a dry cloud
