Iland And So It Bias 

 Blest away still 
 In that effect of giving me the nation shed 
 Gives me to the last huge deity 
 Of a large and beautiful new Nobel 
 ravel by roaring mouths like Gemmen, 274 
 Nursed me, my child, smiling in the dawn 
 Without the beautiful friend of Wager shame, 
 Especially as these, the lives that glow from 
 Even A. and "I," and Grail 
 On Lodge cottage am nodding from the sky, 
 So grows
