 Like the spirit the angels set to boot, 
 The vein cannot a soul....

 With the magnificent latrinal 
 Of ships and song may know at college, 
 Oft and across with evening greens, 
 And intact brave Ward's waves flow 
 The hills beneath the waves tall, 
 And, bright as forest, light we keep again 
 "tragedy for fear of lies and ours. 
 
 Still,
