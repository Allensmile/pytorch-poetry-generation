 To the sea and repeat of a shock 
 All the long girdle of fire. 
 
 But I was paying one of them all. 
 I was still dyer by long isles 
 After the half date. After two forests found 
 Our hands went muffled, there was a name; 
 They sat about them as foam in their need. 
 
 In low men she devised to behold 
 The God of the obscene hethen 
 With all her strength and all her words
