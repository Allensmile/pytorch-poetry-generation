Cause? 

 pumping his dishes: his wrath 
 At the Maiden's church he burrs his gun. 
 
 And he who died of vines, and smote his head 
 In the morning! 
 
 He preened the grave with jagged frown, 
 He talked of destiny in hour-- 
 No tire boy lingers with such a Collation 
 About the soul of neighbourhood, 
 To write in such a human tone, 
 That to the banging of his dead blade he had daughters! 
 And his eyes fuck
