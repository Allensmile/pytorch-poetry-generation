Are Little Glow 

 
 palace? 
 
 Three old men and others dance in the night, 
 
 And it 
 knows hard to hear the people call a meanings 
 
 Women knew, is no longer in a kind of heat. 
 
 
 I go over the scrolls to reach about ; 
 
 I shift them out again. I swallow 
 
 My thigh and legs against the Seek. 
 
 Perhaps he could catch without a stain or wail 
 
 Of things
