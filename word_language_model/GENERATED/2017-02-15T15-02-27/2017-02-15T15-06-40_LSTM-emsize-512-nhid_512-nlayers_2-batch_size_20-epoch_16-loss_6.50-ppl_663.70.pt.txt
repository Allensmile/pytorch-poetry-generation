 
 When the men are quiet in their faces, 
 
 What the Baker named in the carven houses 
 
 And the falling logically, as the blast doth flow 
 
 Into a cavern fast as a girdle fall, 
 
 Yet turn for the little tangled snow that parts her fields 
 
 Sings her muffled face like the huge haze otherwhere: 
 
 All the planted islands of the dead are beaten ! 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Preface to Sleep 
 
 
 Send me a face to get, and I had returned. 
 A hundred once gets on right hour 
 too?' 
 Neither fully said 
 A childish body not dead
