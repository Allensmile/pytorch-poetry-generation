Quadruple Child-King 

 Everywhere in the sun eft busy pines 
 adjudg'd, in woods, a summer meadow far 
 Down and over our mountain step, 
 
 Stretching squirrels to shadowy feet Euterpe 
 Where feathers, exchanged to their rich rose, 
 Where the dancers of Darkness blow off. 
 So slurried gates' and white, 
 Rings done--sprees ghosts there, inlaid in coal scars 
 Along the burnish'd labyrinthine the grooms 
 In island intent on the seatbelt at last, 
 We tugs a fury, but something cannot
