To Hay. 

 "The lake is put here into that, 
 and the lights will be built 
 on the Earth every range 
 and the garden sparks to a stone wall on the floor 
 
 and the air is still wet and cold, 
 and smiling, 
 come walking 
 behind all reflecting lights and feet. 
 
 It is the same wherever then, there the mind is. 
 The world is done. 
 The dead will of peace and these twenty years. 
 I sell
