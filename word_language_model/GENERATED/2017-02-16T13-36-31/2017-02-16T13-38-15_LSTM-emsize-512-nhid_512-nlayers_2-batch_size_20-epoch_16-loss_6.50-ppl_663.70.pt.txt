Found A Home 

 By one another, but as many of a chime 
 Came please, like a child's and spirit shut and deep, 
 Fill and barks from his lips as he drifts 
 Down the high hill and runs it lightly toward His chest, 
 And in his dome he hangs alone in the sweetest whirlwinds 
 That I may praise and Branch: Not with him, 
 Quoth to me it is my dread 
 But if I refuse it, and I'll be in some same
