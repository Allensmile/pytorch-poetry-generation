Come, It Would Then Rise 

 away from out a dirt, and all my unwhoa, 
 
 Weep with what virtue, and pride thou art not whole-wheat 
 These, thanks to sorrow, objects and foe; 
 Virtue which recited, to lisp off 
 Believe and transient when the Deep 
 ornate with majestic bliss; 
 Angels and stars are one that waits 
 Like gray engraver since no flame 
 Before them have been faithful too; 
 And I of all the same! 
 It is not true.
