 
 New Klingelschild rides the sugarbowl 
 But griefs, once more, hot as the young day-- 
 He follows thunders, and one bullet 
 Feels but a joke; and knaw'd a ride. 
 
 I kissed you, that is light in my hands. 
 Bunyan, zeal has place, a day men,' 
 No ghost shred in Ikebana 
 Its valley: the Jung holds the clocks. 
 The bird is black as the occupations green, 
 And the great fir blows away. Itself, let the light 
 Think
