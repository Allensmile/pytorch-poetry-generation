Of Me 

 a little, the bridegroom and the ghost 
 They dance about their faces. 
 
 
 They are safe, too, in the oldest room. 
 
 Ah, my birds, that I am grown 
 thru everything or rivers. 
 
 Or else the summer 
 When everyone went. 
 
 Nor, L.A., Firing Thibetan Sector reveals, 
 First Edison lifted fifty miles by, 
 I glanced at the o'clock stick to the carnival wing. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Flying Notes into the Rich
