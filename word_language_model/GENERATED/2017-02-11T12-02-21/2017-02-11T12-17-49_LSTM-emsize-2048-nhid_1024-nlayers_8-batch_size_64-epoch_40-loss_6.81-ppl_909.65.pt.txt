BLOOD MARSH YOU NAME HADDAM, IT STILL NOT SEE GAVE 

 and indians of seasons of pulse of my highways town, 
 feet with the field spreading to his one secure? 
 with murals your palace fills through what by a bed or 
 who been at a future, play the slightest east hog-shouther, 
 like the priest's flower. when i love framed 
 through leap--and ritual in horse 
 that sent 
 but dying doe of panes that 
 gonna approach and, swept in the fields.
