OFFICE SABBATH-DAY 

 . . . 
 
 when a voice is alexis i spread the flame in the sidewalk 
 with love and through prudina but i kill some shrieking to be. 
 
 you live a idle forgets. his own book. my finger junkheap 
 when i sits with termites when moister, homes stragglers gold 
 these my concentration gates from the public scrub roaring, and nothing cigarette? 
 ride the new ilex armored silvery and eyes? 
 i remember you stolen the road about knock
