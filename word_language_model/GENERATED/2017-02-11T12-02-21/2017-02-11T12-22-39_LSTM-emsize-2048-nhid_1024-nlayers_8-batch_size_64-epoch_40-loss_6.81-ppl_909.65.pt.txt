 now she was Cityâ€™s 
 
 she wants laid and like the world 
 to every itself's farms 
 
 bryant there out into 
 
 in an door to clear

 and finding the pajama eye ever was 
 what the lily, the roar, 
 
 as under all city with him 
 unfamiliar peeper or is who 
 
 but of a room. of sliding 
 cry at questions again
