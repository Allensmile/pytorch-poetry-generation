ENDLESS BED, 

 . 
 
 
 when 
 
 indifferent a young head into oak earth where brush, 
 where the barking turns on rest burns ... 
 
 or the grizzled body iris gold and silver accelerate, and space, 
 and who time they make a 'scape stream with the above. 
 Comic through the polished crack, the mid-winter sulfurous 
 to lucy twine, 
 shrink love, embraced have to lift the abiding suck lemur's mimesis-- 
 
 there is invincible, ours, in a young days
