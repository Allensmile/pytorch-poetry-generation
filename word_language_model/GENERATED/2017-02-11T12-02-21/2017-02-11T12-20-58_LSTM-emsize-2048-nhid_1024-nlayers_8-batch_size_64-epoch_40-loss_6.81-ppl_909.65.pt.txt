SINCE . IV. 

 a dream 
 
 not out and they like to pale dollars forever, 
 i started its nose in the hour's whole,--all--all--be he lightness 
 you gaunt egg- rope to the glass of an eyes in greased and vanish discovery and happen. 
 
 beneath the soond of the clown 
 i hear my hands in the stone i told myself in myself. 
 i open the water after a duende and roads, 
 me them with this oval, 
 i don't take flax-dam.
