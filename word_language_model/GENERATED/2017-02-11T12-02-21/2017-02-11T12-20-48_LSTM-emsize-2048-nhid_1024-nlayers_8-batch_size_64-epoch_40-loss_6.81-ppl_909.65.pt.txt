PRIVATE KNOW-HOW THEY FLOODED HOOKING, 

 
 
 when what you see why? 
 perhaps 
 
 neighbours, 
 
 
 a top am born 
 
 on a man a besieging tiger 
 
 belong clean fields of dock 
 
 paradising you are 
 
 
 iii 
 
 we wait is that days 
 only memory's some green weep 
 would dawn bufera shine, 
 while elmslie 
 the train is stumbling horizon back. 
 
 the first earth said calls us her bright green
