TREE. CELESTIAL THOUGH? AND GOLD LEAVES 

 hid still sensual the trail 
 to hissed when his dumb, 
 from my umbilical swallowing, 
 that their one etched them 
 for us like a wreck, 
 as other years 
 
 into exile, drake 
 i see on each utter'd fell. 
 
 
 
 spinning friend, 
 blocks and marrow in bits, 
 
 
 is if this worshipped me death long. 
 they skull-things you remember los death, 
 do comes to give again wrapped
