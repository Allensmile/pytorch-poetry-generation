WANDER--A COLORLESS SOLDIER'S WORLD 

 and insect's is athwart the bells, with the great clever miraculous 
 the mockery of the room was free around them, i smote 
 to the belle foxhole of glass becomes the gate, 
 
 all the chance, his soul on the distance its eaves, 
 the bag of movements born, 
 didn't lean to twist when i roll my hardtack 
 
 yet i lie by sea.not field--travlin on rain 
 
 so as thou done arcade's 
 out unvow'd like love
