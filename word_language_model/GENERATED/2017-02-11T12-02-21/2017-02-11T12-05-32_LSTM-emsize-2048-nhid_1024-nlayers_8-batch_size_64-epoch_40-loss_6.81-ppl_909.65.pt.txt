BRITISH RHYME, TO MAN, 

 . outside spak 
 i. ghosts thou, , 
 variously linda? 
 home-life ida, 
 i reads, but wailing,wailing i can't know perfectly what i 
 best it, blessings where chinese unpacking 
 lucky sips evening. 
 dd whispers in a big long dim, 
 in every holiday bag. 
 but black called starched at the killing. 
 through the house 
 
 the gray xe and just an relationships muscles 
 with a parties full interior 
 
 of con-ka-ree,
