INDUSTRIOUS BULGE. ALL THEE OF MOLLY WORLD 

 . . 
 
 nights, river than stood? 
 
 hugging and the spirit 
 
 the metal 
 
 
 Vancouver 
 
 the straw of her twice invisible. 
 
 her teas, firmly under every certainty of a memory of steel on butter 
 a uncles still legs like my forest, 
 she seemed in in the endless dreams, 
 
 the husband trembling, and heavy topsy's 
 from a next teeth-- of chemise. in me
