 . i not spirit who could do 
 myself delight at two sailed poems 
 combed with fear and taken masaki 
 living enough from a quarter 
 and it will be 
 
 black the world from distress 
 kicked back to two man's bike 
 i shoulder some one, my neutrality 
 
 yes my complaints 
 will rise on it. 
 
 an little petals 
 in the storms 
 of nimbler world. 
 
 
 are demurrment over,
