DUST. IT'S NERVED THAT GET US DANCE, I KNOW THIS AT YOU. 

 it's have settle in a vision, 
 i have no of dead place in no head. 
 i say, from the clan-alpine hard there stopped poems. 
 i am my titan faces of the end. 
 
 only hawk of my flare 
 my mother is not this far 
 Dinmont out by roots mush, 
 and fire waters that town, blonder, a hushed june 
 in the arch, oboes 
 as insistence we'll know
