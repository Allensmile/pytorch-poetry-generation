SCENT IT BODY'S BRANCH 

 . . what i it wets-- de way. why i throw you. 
 i studied my longing, 
 exactly i am not for a masses of earth. 
 
 she wants into the middle of your life 
 belths against the light of a family and bull 
 they think his minders--one hair's out and it their longer sit me. 
 
 without once was me and train in hours 
 that settles blood of a street. heaven. 
 
 
 the heart
