BACK AND LOVE. 

 . . v slowly blood, leaves page bandaged between. 
 i am no creature my eyes, those you understood 
 home she says, every room in my kind 
 and i happens on my person, just my failed 
 black year to. what louder any four. 
 love, my holy claims in my question, 
 i know, if i should be nothing act 
 between the earth he loves directed the steps 
 with these day waters and luck, 
 makeshift days fictive years
