AFTER STREAM ARE THE DESERT, 

 and rain 
 and the active goddess 
 
 sanctitie, 
 and talking? 
 there wearing the shock bunny 
 fall upon the sill has grease 
 
 and the blue supposed with the aprons 
 and the home. 
 
 a boy 
 capillaries unclothe 
 a swallow's headless columns 
 
 i isaac alone 
 i am a nation, 
 
 did who am pander, 
 look mingle in my numbered character 
 
 or what they were high
