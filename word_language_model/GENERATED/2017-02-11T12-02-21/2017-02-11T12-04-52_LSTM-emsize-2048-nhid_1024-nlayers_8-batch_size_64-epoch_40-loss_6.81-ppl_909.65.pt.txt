AND IS DAY A GLASS 

 she cannot picture yourself, 
 a undertow of nonsense 
 
 
 the Uffizi-garish, the money. 
 he is is much 
 from a sea 
 and a name up to 
 
 the breeze was 
 sigh-sound she couldn't 
 no attend 
 without me with a tree. 
 
 turned to believe the hunger 
 
 of your office 
 blah-blah-blah? 
 lover as ball 
 they yours nor laugh. 
 
 it's it 
 and a harmless cold?
