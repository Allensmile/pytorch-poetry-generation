MINUTE 

 . . . 
 out the doctor, the sir is . the great landscape and no kid, 
 we smile his seraphim 
 walk to wind at his vales, 
 working then about us and hours 
 for the teamsters 
 reactions to the dead. 
 there will be hesitations 
 to study we to sew 
 through ourselves, 
 they went to get 
 to the little field 
 for which color-- 
 
 the role 
 bucketed with the past, 
 their vorpal mother
