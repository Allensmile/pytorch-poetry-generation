 . . 
 
 
 where fears since i think, you should not do away. 
 
 who about the nighttime tell Whitney 
 
 as currents of struggle on the south, one fear, 
 
 the grey- the jack-hammers flew up and i kept my one, 
 
 in a first bird to make her falling from his ear 
 
 as in the wheel the barn had entered to listen 
 
 if the night is leaning goes slippering with rain
