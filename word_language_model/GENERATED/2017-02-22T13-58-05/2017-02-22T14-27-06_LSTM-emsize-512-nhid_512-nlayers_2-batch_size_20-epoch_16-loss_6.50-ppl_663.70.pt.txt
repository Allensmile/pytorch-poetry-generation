The Couch'D Run 

 pied and dirty, devices alone. 
 And first day, the signal of their tall cranes 
 With green defiance sullen in sleep, 
 With steps the very greasy brother's locks 
 Within the mighty ghost of eagle watching 
 The lovers all the powerful lucent seats, 
 Moreover the inverted file that drench me round, 
 The tie; of the suns. 
 Two bled off in jump-start curl 
 The steeds and sobs of the young man conventionalize, 
 I, who is very well
