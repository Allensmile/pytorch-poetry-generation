It, 

 The foliage laugh with a clod, 
 The man here I hoped to go over 
 For him just so, 
 As is back a sinner Rheums. 
 Oh Mistress, 
 be I, luned de truth. 
 A day I will wound you all. 
 
 Now I am mine, I am glad of the god 
 Some are the subject that lives 
 For the wisdom on heaven and Slender 
 Besides what to affirm this 
 To the death of the life or all
