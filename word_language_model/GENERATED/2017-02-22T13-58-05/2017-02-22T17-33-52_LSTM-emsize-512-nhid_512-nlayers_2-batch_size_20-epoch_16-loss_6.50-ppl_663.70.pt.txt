 
 One fear is a dark in all voices, 
 'Tis the devotion that does not see." 
 
 And every sleeper is understood, 
 When there is something crystal is a leaf 
 That makes him walk in the soil 
 And make these waves away. 
 -- Now I may capture you you 
 Because I have just learned 
 Where birds are sealed at turous, 
 I shall hear the hollow smoke of world." 
 
 And yet we change bread till you see
