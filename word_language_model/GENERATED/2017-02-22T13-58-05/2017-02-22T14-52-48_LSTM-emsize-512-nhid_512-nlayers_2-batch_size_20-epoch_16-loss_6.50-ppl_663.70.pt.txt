Cloudy Streets, By Which 

 shiny shadows forgives a breakers, 
 contracted from its concrete .... 
 In the mad book of leper. I longed 
 for long time of his American life 
 
 when I grew too old or black I took 
 the new deer we saw the gulls 
 
 could remember, something itself 
 could change, drawing for them 
 in dark hands of days hard and another-- 
 a smoldering Preface of fists, 
 discovered my father was sweating in a circle
