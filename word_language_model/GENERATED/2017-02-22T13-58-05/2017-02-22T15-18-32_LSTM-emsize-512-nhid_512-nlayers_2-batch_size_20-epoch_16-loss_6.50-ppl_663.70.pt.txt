With Aforementioned Breaking 

 
 Childhood is growing and all is born, the same 
 Eyes ripples and our hearts to make loose and lovers live their might; 
 But we die and take bread for the wings and the voices of the sweat of the city, 
 Strong with rage and bowels of glory and of gab he is older in tropic gown, 
 And the old Raven who travels in his breast and rubs him 
 Carrying his fragrant head; that a dove is the Flutt'ring
