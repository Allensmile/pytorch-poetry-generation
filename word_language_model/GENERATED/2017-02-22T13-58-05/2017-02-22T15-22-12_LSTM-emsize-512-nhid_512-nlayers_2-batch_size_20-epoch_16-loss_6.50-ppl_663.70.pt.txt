The Strand. 

 fleeing in abweisen, une azimuths 
 Instruct each, across a desert day-scythes is once a place 
 where we are cut 
 up to the children instead 
 of plackets. What are we, all that come, you sectioned 
 in the brilliant breakers of night's grave, 
 a place that dies just like a spinal hole. 
 
 The birds have filled their customary 
 the Hoover, the leaf shapes Spears! 
 one-joke sans the dwarf and wic; 
 One foot at the ceiling.
