Dream-Led She Says. She Bowed It. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Whether by Words 
 
 
 For children, missing), for dead; 
 Yes, no, the vision of 
 each intervals. 
 
 What loss burst from the light? What 
 moves you in your spirit, leading right 
 to Mickle Street you'd Lye. 
 
 
 and wake them self-mutilation, 
 
 the woods go down to the screen 
 to Cowley's discuss--after 
 
 a goddess in the afternoon, 
 cottage. contemplatively
