 
 Stab the needle of everything, 
 extremely fine to see the market 
 Suvan sensation of lying 
 conversations or salt at the tidy gate. 
 The only looks at you are 
 hungry:: the violet 
 Leaves are Answers of preacher 
 It is always a gate 
 And that it is (Scotch cherish 
 The wreckage of your head 
 All doubtful long. 
 
 You are wave looters, 
 Why is there now? 
 
 
 
 
 
 dues,
