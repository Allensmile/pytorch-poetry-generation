Irish, Mortals' Toys, A Metaphor 

 in turn flowers and ears in full branches, 
 men instead of sex 
 
 as long as a hits many-winter'd The bay is a desiccant 
 some tiny feathers Destined to lyre 
 their bodies motionless in a gesture outside himself 
 to make here their death and lovers, like universe. As now plastic 
 blossoms, clouds of life, slipping back in the twilight. 
 44th watch the salad dance the slack 
 vulnerable prisoner, feasting within our flesh.
