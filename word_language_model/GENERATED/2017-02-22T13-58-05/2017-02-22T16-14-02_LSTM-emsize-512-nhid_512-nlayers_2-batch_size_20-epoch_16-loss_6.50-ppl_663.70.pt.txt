 
 That night I dreamed of the day of one-- the heart 
 
 left in a circle so far away from the womb, until my breath 
 
 and the chorus claw into my body 
 and work it laughs -- paving. Rothko swirling graffiti, shifted 
 red jig to Chicago 
 back up to my world-- 
 
 they make currently forever. 
 
 In the blood I joining small still. 
 
 Many a night in continu'd 
 
 or yesterday, by the difference,
