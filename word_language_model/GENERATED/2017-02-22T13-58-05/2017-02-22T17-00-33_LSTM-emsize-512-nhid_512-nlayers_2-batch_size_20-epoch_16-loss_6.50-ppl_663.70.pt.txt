On Joy-- 

 I'm not so late, ofdeath. 
 
 When I spend the lower place 
 of a house anarchy 
 I am the building 
 of the sun 
 and I am overcast, 
 the porches stare like noons 
 by the blue wood, or sour hat, 
 straightway at the instant 
 men call their life to me 
 
 when I drifted away, 
 they bearing in their light 
 beyond themselves. 
 I'd sit on the window, 
 watch the smell of silver
