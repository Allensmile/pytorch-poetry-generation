Help You? Why Does This Go? 

 You've written the jug to, many times. 
 
 It takes a wide distance through the newsreel 
 In some million years, some things; some tried, 
 A letter is nearest to noise, 
 By its own freedom, where is it so, 
 And Noms needs truth but Horatio 
 Swung in a pot for echoing. 
 
 I've seen some annals of that white 
 lobster heart-faced in their nails, 
 Finally here a bee burned into the window
