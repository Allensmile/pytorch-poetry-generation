 Good Thames, ye fill with steam. 
 One with the other foot is a last corner, 
 Which keeps my mind from God brawl 
 Of weariness of sort, and matinee, 
 And crash and Shame Dustclouds on the pines, 
 Your soul, and vigil there, 
 Seem nothing, long brought to, 
 In fountains to die and sing of hay. 
 Then always led tried-in-battle pupil, way 
 You might weave his mind
