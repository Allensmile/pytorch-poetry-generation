Only 

 
 How much B the living skin 
 
 Or the brow that held checker-board 
 
 Augustine, so the chilly toad 
 Who won the nicht: more eager than that. 
 
 Why wartsmy thou, Let me: No, thou hast been; 
 
 Say all the charms are now no more. 
 
 
 Perhaps, to drink the shopman's silver groan, 
 
 And from the Theatre that cry to beat 
 
 A hidden cry silently; 
 
 Some like one's eggs to look,
