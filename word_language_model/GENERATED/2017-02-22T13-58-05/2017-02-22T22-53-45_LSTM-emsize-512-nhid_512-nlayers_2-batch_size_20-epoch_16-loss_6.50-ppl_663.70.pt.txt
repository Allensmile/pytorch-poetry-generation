In Bed Groined Even Majesty. 

 
 The stretcher-bearers uplifted toward the cycles 
 Of cutting poor. In pitch of flesh, 
 And the chant of thought and all it deserts itself 
 An Kennedy, vanish without a man-- 
 
 It is the long important matter that they have not 
 To be hasty in me, and laughing, watching that it breathed 
 
 With bare wings all bunches and fireplace beneath the fold of my heart 
 Whispering I poke my very fold up my shrine.
