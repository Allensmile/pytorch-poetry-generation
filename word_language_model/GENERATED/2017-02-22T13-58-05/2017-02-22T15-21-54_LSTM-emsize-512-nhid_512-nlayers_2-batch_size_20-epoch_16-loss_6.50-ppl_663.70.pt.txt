Hills. 

 
 matamore 
 In loving me was the strain of psychiatrists 
 And they in Glimpses office. When they were drunk 
 With desire and answere, yet but the slave, 
 Of their own will, had no cousins in vain, 
 And nothing else since this silent hue, 
 Here on the brow beyond these destroyed sounds 
 A cry stallion-feeders, amid their balustrade, 
 Of endless remorse, is good against hope or fools. 
 
 Perhaps this future were we, by copious night's cool,
