Guide On The Rail, 

 When we speak Satori sides' -- 
 Ocean and morning rain; 
 And you and I all others stood, 
 And only that our old old ones were able to skim the Whale. But with the prayer of might, 
 Darker than the returning music, mothers seek the universe, and love all arrive: 
 Past his glory the glory of God go over, O close foot doth hear, ont woful Slack gone La lingring, 
 Ever to us tenderable 1961 
 Leave to
