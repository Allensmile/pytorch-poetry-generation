To Its End 

 that makes no music in our earliest mountain-shade 
 Watch the flood and fingers bring the sun in, 
 hoping to sleep and not Mount or eye or return, 
 But that other presence we could there not love 
 That power one touch with mercy, makes it long 
 chartings to be able to silver God. 
 
 We will be very hours. That very small. 
 The word Didn't, we all will give 
 And Birth, the Devil's news of God
