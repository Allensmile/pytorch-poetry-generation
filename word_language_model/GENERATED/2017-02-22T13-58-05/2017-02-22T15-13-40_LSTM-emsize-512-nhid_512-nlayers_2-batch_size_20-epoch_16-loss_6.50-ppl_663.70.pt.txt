Past: 

 cornland Loon, Troubles 
 What say, vocabularies constant Thunder: 
 What lips of the sloppy flail or breath, 
 Are flutter'd in some melodious suit 
 That quarrel in the dazzling undreamt of song 
 And surely the freedom of virtuous living, 
 irradiant on thy lip, mini-ramp 
 travel-gowned, 'ant for scissored 
 Sleep; but I cannot speken cottage-eaves 
 You Mourns me hail-stone 
 (Certain for onely, 
 And ye may never be offence, 
 But since your pilgrimage. 
 Alvares or Elves,
