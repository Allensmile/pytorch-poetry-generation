At Work 

 to leap and stick thoughts Frankfort. 
 
 So they felt the flowers and gratuitous stories 
 to Ezra. their brighter mother 
 as would please all calling my skill to lie. 
 One bright borrowed sculpture threw up 
 from the sea. Her wound gave back houses. 
 Another time I rose, unborn; my name now without 
 a single shoe of earth and Hearne 
 as if she could smell the water 
 or be done, or something fun could 
 knock up,
