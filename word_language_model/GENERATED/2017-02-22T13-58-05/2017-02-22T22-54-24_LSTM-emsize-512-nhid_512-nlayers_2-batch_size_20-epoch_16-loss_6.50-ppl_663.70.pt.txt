Down On Nature. 

 moon-light cry was good again. 
 In mists there were two in snow like guns and geese -- 
 They've never heard those framed of poetry and children 
 And climbing that solitary summer window, 
 The silver valley of the topmost corpse 
 House or stationery double islands and stones; 
 'Mongst stars, who hold me in circlets and with snow, 
 A snarled blast of golden fish, a dark light. 
 I have come victorious on the wheels of men . .
