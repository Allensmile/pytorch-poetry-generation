It Is Not Said 

 we had to stop. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Felix Returned 
 
 
 Nobody is seen 
 when no one 
 comes to you & what you a 
 can do not lie 
 into gratitude Undivining 
 has nobody so much man 
 a citizen in all 
 that so it trembled 
 & looks 
 at night after steep 
 and into hot water 
 
 changes skin 
 till the day has condemned me to go.
