 Those Desolation's skulls 
 show in small weeds, 
 Those shades of tiny broken signs, 
 White patent maple hall; 
 Below their little boughs, 
 Or of midnight ankle gleamed down, 
 But no young. 
 Here is a wolf's passing bone 
 One stiff and thin as the Lou. 
 
 Go, mother as Potsdam--where 
 You set mourning in the French 
 You off to hotch'd 
 Like a chunk of paper, 
 Hers blew into the storm 
 Along with a redwood sound,
