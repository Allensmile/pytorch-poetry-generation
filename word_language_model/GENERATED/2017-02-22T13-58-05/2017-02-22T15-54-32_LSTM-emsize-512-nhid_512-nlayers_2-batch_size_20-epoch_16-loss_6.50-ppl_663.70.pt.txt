There, To The Coast, 

 The view of the river, should perish either 
 Against the dusty and more likeness of the death? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Intricate Swamp of amplest Accompany the Poems 
 
 
 As I watch her beard: sitting by the fumes 
 There is on spirit that stands on cheering bed 
 On the day, while they burst along the meadows 
 trip-hammers silent as the reeds of old phrases 
 On the sleigh sea soul's afternoon.
