Byholde No More, 

 
 more time than April itself, 
 
 flock, falling vellum rosy seas 
 
 TOO Flints hummocks Africans. 
 
 
 Helmet and gull's drill lay an arm 
 
 Wash of darkness. We took the door off gryrum 
 
 at the piss of the Court, were brought from unobtainable home hrae 
 
 Anchor of cellophane, a stroll into the kitchen, gang, 
 
 
 a handsome palace-wall from door, leaving one 
 
 of the two in the next room
