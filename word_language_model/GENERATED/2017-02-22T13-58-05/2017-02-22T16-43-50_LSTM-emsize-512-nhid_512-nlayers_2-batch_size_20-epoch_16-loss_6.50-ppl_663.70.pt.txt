To Right And Cabala, 

 Keep lak to some thorazine--"Yes nothing is safe, 
 I will say, when I have wearied every street, 
 And still be ashamed hard enough to urge 
 Prevail and understand, 
 No poets, living pigs or fruit or claim 
 To drumsticks knees or blessing with a sneer 
 Not the lack that you cheapest, gentleman will end 
 Because the body was: the same eyes brought, straight 
 To these. The rest was void of quiet! 
 Our butter HurI'd at
