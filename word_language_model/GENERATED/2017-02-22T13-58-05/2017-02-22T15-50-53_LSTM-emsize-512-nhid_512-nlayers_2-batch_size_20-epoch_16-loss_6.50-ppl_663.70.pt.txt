On Earth, 

 the dirty dark ship. To find those remain teeth of patients 
 remember the Leaves, the writings, and love, love and love, 
 Deeper as the cruel dies. 
 
 There are words who are strange and happy, 
 found them the moderne arched long feet 
 gumum to mingle with the colors they have. 
 The chaplain herds on a grouse like water, 
 A lusty god and country, and live. 
 
 
 
 
 
 The fowls of those Women
