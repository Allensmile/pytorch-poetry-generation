 To the gate the oldest mother 
 Said that each Church fell from his sleeping bed, 
 A few months later, then the sights. 
 He was sure he was born 
 Not for a time in time but that, in concentration 
 He sent 
 Up face to the ear; the Duke's 
 watchers laughed him at Republic: 
 So he asked a dog to read 
 All 58 keep old enough 
 To build his reflexes upon eyes--
