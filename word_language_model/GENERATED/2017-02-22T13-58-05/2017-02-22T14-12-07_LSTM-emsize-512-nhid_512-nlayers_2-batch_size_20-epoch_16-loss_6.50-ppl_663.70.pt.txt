Me Again 

 That still the morning. 
 
 cockatoo, From me, agree; 
 I'se not Uterus 
 The raunged with my device, 
 The unrevealed. 
 Yes, on the scouts 
 I hear a magic woman 
 Recycler solitary duty, 
 The solar wheel clouds needs, 
 Grown rare, white air: 
 It is winter and full of art. 
 
 To meals. 
 I recall Hells wood, grease in the bush. 
 So can they make it a better way 
 So line) so near at
