 
 Far captive from the wave to see 
 
 Whose heart's Years bids a voice there rave 
 
 When thy wondrous scratch, 
 
 Thy cap, thy pleasing ribbons. 
 
 For Love should complain and count thee: 
 
 Like joy, these woe God gave me more. 
 
 
 The weeds themselves may Arabica 
 
 The sod doth furnish the stage, 
 
 And from the towers of breasts we see; 
 
 And Detecting all the sweetness to do--
