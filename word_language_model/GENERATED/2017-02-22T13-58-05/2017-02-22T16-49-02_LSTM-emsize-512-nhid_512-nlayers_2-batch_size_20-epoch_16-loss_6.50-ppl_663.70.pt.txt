 Get off in me, love's no care for me. 
 It was about 
 That time would take me with ironworkers 
 A poetess while they crouched 
 When I filled up the worrying house 
 And bring me years up by, 
 
 
 2. 
 
 I thought every word of critics half-longed in East hands... 
 I have said that the levynne for me not knowing 
 turns an egg to the other. 
 And so I'd never find growing moving 
 The idea
