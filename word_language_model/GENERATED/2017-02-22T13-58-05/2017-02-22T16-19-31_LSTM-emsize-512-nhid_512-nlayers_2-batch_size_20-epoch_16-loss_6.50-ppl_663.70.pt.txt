I Am Taking A Buys, 

 
 For your fine face come high again! 
 You are all you change but you are dumb. 
 You cannot curse the music. Though you walked.

 These I less saw twenty matrimony. 
 They didn't care if her dress looked first for forester. 
 Why didn't you trust it? It's the way Wally show, 
 Oh
