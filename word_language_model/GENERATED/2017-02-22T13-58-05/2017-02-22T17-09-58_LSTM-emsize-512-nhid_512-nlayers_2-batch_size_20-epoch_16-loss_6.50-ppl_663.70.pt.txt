Refrigerator, 

 anchorite's hovered in the Lost. 
 Told you 
 That I can't get the sadness, 
 Surely All summer 
 I burst out on my way 
 To the cabin of a glory; 
 It was machete 
 Its arm and a tooth 
 Silently made the germ 
 tidal downward and far 
 She would teach what whistle 
 concerns but that, 
 As the incidents 
 In its white eye was smoke, 
 Came far away, 
 With a thought that she was
