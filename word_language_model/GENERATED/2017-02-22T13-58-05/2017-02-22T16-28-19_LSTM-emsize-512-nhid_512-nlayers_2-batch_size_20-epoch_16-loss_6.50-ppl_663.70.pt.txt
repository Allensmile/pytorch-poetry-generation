 
 At the end of need of Charlotte's stems, 
 
 A stately city, the lamp of Apollo 
 fashioned by offering engine and sedge 
 
 To release his nature. He smiles and rained. 
 
 He tries to produce himself, and cannot deal 
 On all this precious song! 
 
 Yet always is he, 
 As he goes, the last great growth of bone 
 
 Taronga as awkward as any land. 
 
 
 II. It 
 
 Grew cold in her temple
