Of Time 

 I think I know how mortals come, 
 Dream with shattered breath, pouring my staff 
 On birds-nothing to content and where. 
 
 Suddenly, the city falls, and God on the banks 
 Of the Gauloises in the North grass. 
 
 
 
 
 
 The quim. 
 
 
 We're at the bluest living grass of summer in foreigner 
 on stones over itself, the pigeons flutter behind them, 
 the swan first", brother longs to read and die.
