Of Spring 

 or got an oven with the chimneys 
 the delicate bad-news coal, 
 leaves and order big.' 
 
 slope, awhile along the grain 
 towards hearts I walk out 
 like icy water rising 
 in the shade of air. 
 Neareth laughter against me 
 scattered fire 
 hearing the quiet 
 unknown of your 
 years, all 
 the artist 
 I love you.
