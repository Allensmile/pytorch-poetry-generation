 
 For any medium or need, 
 
 Against the air? I 
 
 Should this maker's refus'd linnet 
 
 I had one with all Nanny, 
 
 And in the innocence 
 
 Against the leaden-colour'd 
 
 When I had seen in the box of the springing door. 
 
 
 The tambour in the street-lamps' gown hang faster as delight, 
 
 For those who know where I have never seem'd, 
 
 Recall the earth of heaven or of my farthest love.
