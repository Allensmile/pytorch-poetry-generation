The Wretched Afternoon 

 It is dreary, dead sounds divides me, and I hear on me. 
 Like a stopped sack of grass on the open deck, 
 Wherever the weather used to rise chaos. 
 Over yon tanned ripe land, 
 doorman on Jenny, spray, 
 Stands a Mountain; I Castile 
 consorts, eels. wiste grievances 
 wealdan in the post, and the dress 
 Of log. 
 
 The mind of it takes me deeper than three; 
 Coffee dissolves 
 From every hand 
 Yoram
