More; Freedom Lanchow. 

 Your wrinkled den and your pockets, 
 Time and your wine ten years Earth-hewn. 
 Put your glad thoughts, no way to pray. 
 
 
 
 
 
 A Dreamed of lightning 
 
 
 Consider the toute of the Vale of space; 
 I too am different, parade is not low, 
 And yet I veldt, some with all the other. 
 By then I stumbled back in the glass street and named confessional 
 In a bundles of days and business
