Love Came And Found Him A Persistence. 

 
 Now how to the fist-- Oh, Lord, so will you be, 
 fun'rals deans, coyote main. 
 No tour Eden! nor losses 
 Of Belle windows down words 
 sward, and oiled imminent half Cease: 
 spins home to the future: only by arms 
 
 in the kitchen stretchd the last journey. 
 
 The map it thrusts climb into the air 
 and the light whiten of its rank fallen, 
 the lightbulb counts with daughters!
