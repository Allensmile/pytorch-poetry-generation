Down 

 up on a park and the four Island in New Natural, 
 to the harvest drawn with flame and the rest, blood of the wing and shit and masculine, 
 No. scion of the day of supposed, 
 who circling the first muddy round in The shark. 
 Other soldiers lower like winter winds and berries 
 come over, heading up from America. 
 I make my face undermining 
 Feel by the party? Not better cats; 
 I'll remember one again, possibly or not more
