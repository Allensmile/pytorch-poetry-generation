Of That House, Giveth Worse. 

 Two motions of exact language, all of this fighting. 
 There is no object to yield to her wish. 
 For often it's all the tenderest love 
 When to her they shone in the head as 
 As in their slumber gone the next day 
 With their tears in her sunken breasts with dried lips. 
 It stays in the swan and swim away 
 From naked to ascend, 
 Under the shadowing rocks of Europe men.
