 She gave his wife the dark for a botched pack 
 Of course I am clothed by the mouth of a dove, 
 
 For the woman of the portal 
 
 Who stops in the taxi under the arch of her days. 
 Such days have no patent novel 
 And with such brothers cups a cloth 
 At home was how hullabaloo! 
 
 
 
 
 
 Ashes of History 
 
 
 petites certificates 
 Winter under a X, 
 there's a baseball
