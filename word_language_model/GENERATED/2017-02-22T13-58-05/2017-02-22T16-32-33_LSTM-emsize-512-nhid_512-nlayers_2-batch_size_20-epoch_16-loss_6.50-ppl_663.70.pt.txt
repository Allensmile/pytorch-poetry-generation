The Walls. 

 The way we lie quick to defend your armada 
 
 Where yellow wind are, the roof is wind the goes, 
 In every eye, alone, 
 Two little tons of Listen: the wind drops breaks, 
 And the motes cheeks and legs mount from the mouth. 
 
 And heaven sculpture: the secret of the gutters, 
 Now in the fog, they talk about most, 
 And pain still sleeping in a single road 
 Before the mouth of blood is for a stain.
