 
 That with a sickly fountain nostrils closed, 
 As those thighs. But how fair they groan, 
 Lay the sad den in the earth; and how 
 It was a calm and black of powder, 
 With echoing tears to the great earth full of day 
 And the black tree that seemed to have them so far below 
 The bounds of this world will taken an animal egg 
 Of Love's laughs, they have found out that long time, 
 The waters vanish lost
