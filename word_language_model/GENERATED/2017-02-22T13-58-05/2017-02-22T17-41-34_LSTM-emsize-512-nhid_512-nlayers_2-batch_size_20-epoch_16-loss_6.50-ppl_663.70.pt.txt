I Consented; 

 A statue of sweet household black, 
 Taught me that I should see 
 And in looking midnight home in youth, 
 --And myself who cain't Can flout 
 The constant carborundum-steel, 
 For all the people are by pain: 
 
 Hundreds of living things, and bowers, 
 Sweet district's slender and spleen 
 That must be withered for dumb, 
 Of all the joys I once aspires 
 To win out its team and I 
 Who this Cuckoldom 
 Shall be upon
