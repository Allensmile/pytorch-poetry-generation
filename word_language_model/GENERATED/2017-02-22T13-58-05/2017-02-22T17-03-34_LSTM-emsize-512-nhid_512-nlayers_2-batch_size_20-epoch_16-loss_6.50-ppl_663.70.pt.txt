Answerd. Find It This: Derbied 

 
 If you smile another than a startled days: 
 A minute or brute a dot that's engaged at last, 
 And now we opened over each other some parts of your ride. 
 We were ourselves tapers; doorknockers. it could be time and drink. 
 Horizon, unnaturally aloft with the same slow hand that held it. 
 
 When I shot a little cake off the Ground in its Heliotrope, 
 
 My bones still will, I lost neither hours.
