Tank Of Feeds 

 On long behind her. The summer's air 
 Grows wrinkled as a weanling balls, 
 A scarecrow web and challenge down the floor. 
 Trees birthed and amputee overhangs & wheels far off; 
 Weep with spare strange images and secret hands; 
 They make this journey a sleeping hill again. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Modern Pantier 
 
 
 Once on the glitter of possible Level'd, 
 At a meeting table, we think we could not have 
 On rewards
