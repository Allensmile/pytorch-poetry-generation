All Too Much Of All 

 
 Trinity! yet marble. 
 That I'd be Thy blame -- 
 To seek thy hourly thing? 
 Ah! ere I read 'em there; 
 No green nor rot 
 Can never cease to long-handled 
 Where I myself may die, 
 Which may thou leave thy victorious eye: 
 O Wlsinges how thou wilt die 
 That thou must praise the world's extremity crowned, 
 Had it been pocketed a free shroud! 
 
 Not unsandl'd of leaves! 
 But Scyldings'
