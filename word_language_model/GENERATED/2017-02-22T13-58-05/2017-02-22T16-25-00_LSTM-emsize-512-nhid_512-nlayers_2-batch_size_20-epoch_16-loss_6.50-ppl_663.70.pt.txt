Fain Again, 

 That his bewildered Notre prepares 
 Most words and dormant, roses flank and spread 
 About his head, & rubs the weights of his cloak, 
 The pavement, herself will worship forth, 
 And the dancers dry, furnaced, steep, 
 The written elms, the meat in the iron cave, 
 And shrink down from the Great Branch of dawn and air 
 Gives its dream in tides of summer's winds, 
 tries; HOLY movement, 
 That the glass aye assumed. Then the arras, 
 Shakes
