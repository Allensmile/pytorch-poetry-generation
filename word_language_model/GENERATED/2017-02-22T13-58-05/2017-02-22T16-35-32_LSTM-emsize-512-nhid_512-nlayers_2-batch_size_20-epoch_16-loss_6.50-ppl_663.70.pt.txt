 With counselor and foul Birds and Air, and seamen casts their supple muscles 
 So two laced eyes and faces upon melting seas, 
 And children only England with cares of yore, 
 And stop for symmetries unable to shut me up 
 And sheds shells, riding over, 
 Making it rod. 
 
 Was it not worth pneumonia in me, 
 Laura 's very commonplace too deeply free. 
 
 A little call the nation on me won't hurt you; 
 But digest, Leander poet at
