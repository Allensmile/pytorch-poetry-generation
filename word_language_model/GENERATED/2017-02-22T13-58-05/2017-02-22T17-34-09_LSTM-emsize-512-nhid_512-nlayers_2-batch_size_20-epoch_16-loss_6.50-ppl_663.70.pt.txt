Round The Snows 

 have been replaced with fear 
 and in our seraph-arrival! we trust 
 in the sounds of their caws, so small we meant, 
 still alive when they will find a torn breath, 
 and who will utter the way in our indifference 
 Without music, not knowing how we conflagration-- 
 If once we take our huts and smile. 
 What does it mean? I do not live of God. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Blind Cemetery 
 
 
 The memory
