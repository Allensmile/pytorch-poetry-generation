Wear 

 (blushing, like a Dynamite kan; 
 Some tall young know with no melody 
 And faint weeds sunlight and no shocks for death. 
 
 Muffet raised her in the bosom of thy light, 
 All through the gloom and left-handed, stones. 
 They sat away, and said, "You shall not weep. 
 We go, or break you on the ghastly door, 
 (A feast anew, a little nausea-- 
 Familiar thoughts and hopes to partake your dear; 
 And from that western mountains histories.
