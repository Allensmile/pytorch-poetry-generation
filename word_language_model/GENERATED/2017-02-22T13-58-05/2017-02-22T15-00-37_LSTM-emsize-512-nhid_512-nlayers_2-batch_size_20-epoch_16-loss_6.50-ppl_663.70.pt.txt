Rapturous Eyes, Old Scrawled, 

 and Jesus. From every side, my dog in chirrs 
 It's last chance for all the cause will be 
 and the bells do not spin before feet on their ice 
 and runs out from the ground, under a loud sky. 
 This evening, I ride, the smell of leaves 
 in the palms of a dying god, two young wonders who have the right 
 hidden into the name what 
 They remind me of mine --Dream? too.
