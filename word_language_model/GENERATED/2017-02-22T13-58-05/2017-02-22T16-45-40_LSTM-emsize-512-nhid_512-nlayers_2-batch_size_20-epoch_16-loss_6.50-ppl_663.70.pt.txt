 
 And their hair belov'd 
 
 And the sweep of water 
 
 In the grass & the sea 
 
 I cross the ceremonial cool 
 
 Miles of silver leaves, 
 
 Come Adverb 
 Yon alabaster, vial. 
 
 Let fall your breathing in, 
 
 Find your feast that bows 
 
 A small wind off bleeding cot 
 
 One song dripping from the cup, 
 
 Some different scan: 
 
 You are Pieces of the prison. 
 
 You
