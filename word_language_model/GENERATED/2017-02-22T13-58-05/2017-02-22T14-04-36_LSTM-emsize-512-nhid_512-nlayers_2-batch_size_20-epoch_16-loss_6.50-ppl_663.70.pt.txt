 The painless bodies are spared witherd multitude; 
 
 
 III 
 
 I work to keep a little from them creature, 
 A seed. Not as I myself can; 
 Softly in thy uneasy shadowy horn 
 so thin, too busy, I lost my breeding bowers 
 of See! like clay, like heaving water under water 
 a surface of the breath and heart, O voice, -- 
 not knowing how to walk the flower 
 too big to hear the bronzed hair 
 spilled off
