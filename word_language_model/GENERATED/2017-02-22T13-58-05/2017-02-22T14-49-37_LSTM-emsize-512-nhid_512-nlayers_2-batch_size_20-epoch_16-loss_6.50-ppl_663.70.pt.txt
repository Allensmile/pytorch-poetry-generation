Orrery 

 errant as baskets and Sylvan velvet, sing 
 Often we've lost ourselves for nothing. I call you, you would travel here! 
 
 The Rock before you face the keyboard, 
 watching and water on the railing until it carries a enormous oval, 
 the wind rising above the opening roots. 
 
 You are a light in the shape of foreign suburban FIVE 
 as a young child feels when I was sitting on an sensational ten mile 
 with one sunset's gown against ass--
