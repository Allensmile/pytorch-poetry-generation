You? 

 
 I will hear the kitchen tree as far as good 
 As the spell of the world. Favourable up there is 
 A heap of azure breath that has not safer, sound 
 The wonder that we have given by times and time 
 Our bodies are the blue lake which holds the gate, 
 The cool, ankle-burrs, licence of the sea; 
 The dream of ourselves hold against the sun, the din 
 Seemed out of Gaze down till my lights are shattered
