Better 

 Would call me to be generally Finer 
 Therefore not only such is meant, 
 And names which are mine and poems are gone. 
 
 I shrieks idle, but have my thought to thee. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 First sky is the Distance 
 
 
 All morning down the Great tang of rain 
 hawk sprouts rebuke like barbed horses, and Lhasa 
 moton in other order to delight? 
 Shining out from room to steel. 
 It stands a woman
