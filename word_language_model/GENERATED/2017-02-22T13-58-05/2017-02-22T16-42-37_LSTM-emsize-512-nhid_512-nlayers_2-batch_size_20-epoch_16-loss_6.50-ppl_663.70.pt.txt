Larke 

 The Christian appetite 
 Sings on, still hanging on the grass, 
 Thy fist. and soft winding on the dirt. 
 In sugar 
 The rustling morning immense it and the last one, 
 With a face starting to be stripped like colored summer water itself. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Passing the Note: Now the Heart is permanent 
 
 
 The cruel first is me. 
 Come away, come back red towards the sun 
 Over the mountains in the frozen dusk.
