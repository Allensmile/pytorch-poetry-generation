Staring Down 

 The lamp and the blackbird came from. 
 
 
 
 
 
 The subway, Song 
 
 
 The slow icy sea still slides more 
 And Claire's notes on any lonely view. 
 Pressing on his heart, rolls in Shattuck, quarry. the hedge 
 Like the hammer and fold, to wind, granite men good girls in 
 Green Kabbala. 
 I remember a yellow light sucking until the sun came by. 
 
 IV 
 They are lost in the dust, those day,
