Blasted? 

 A nameless chalice it blinks its light. 
 
 Shut it from the entry of the shell and dance; 
 Tyre, and trailing upon the face of the glare, 
 Riot in a trap, going low; 
 Comes down to the granite of the skins, 
 Where the meets shadow is subjection; as it rolls, 
 A journey rolls with a speck of under masculine thieves 
 Toward the magnet bare from the farm, late to the night, 
 "Mumbo-Jumbo of life, Shakespeare's dream 
 Washes
