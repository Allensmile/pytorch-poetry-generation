Over The Damned Heart... 

 Shadow of a concrete DARK 
 no-death at the death of every fan's us, 
 And art not sung the conception in every change. 
 
 Eastward in sleep, or continuing in verse the sound 
 Of antique meadows hungry, and blind skies 
 That men come for the sweet instructor to Truth, 
 Of Virgin crosses by moss-scallop'd cloud. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Sapphics Pantier 
 
 
 It has been been carried away 
 Not to the fire-lock thorny
