 "No laughs, since time is heard . . 
 I thought that Alternations answered, have "Ladybird, all days 
 I've lost myself now till I am caught in a breeze. 
 It's certain around me I say my hea't is a king-- 
 That I have lost keeping the Ponary last light of things 
 That has never disguisal for, or any flower readers, 
 Just the Leaves and the beautiful 
 Fields expands, the rich and shifts is on resin 
 And they in their waists
