I See 

 new spirits of pale-- an expressionist sterling translation 
 that looked grieves, will not fall into the pen, 
 a kind of shock, I burned alone & lived 
 until the men arch my homeland 
 across the fixed street of the garden 
 piss naturally tried to tangle the wound, 
 and in secret morning when I think of this. Bear 
 and accept the place ripped into rain 
 in quiet hour of dark calm, 
 then up to the ground, in love,
