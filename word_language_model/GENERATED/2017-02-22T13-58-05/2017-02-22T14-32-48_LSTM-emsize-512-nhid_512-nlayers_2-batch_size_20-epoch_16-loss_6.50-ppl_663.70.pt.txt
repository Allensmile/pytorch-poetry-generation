 before I sleep in the back of my place again 
 and where my flesh decision believed 
 and my illness sits at best! 
 Nude UN, Plucked lion trumpeting in Bowflex grease, 
 dollar, wrathful orgasm barking to China bird. And unbelievably Lanes, 
 Grand aura, vomit in negro Acapulco. 
 I am Children who have forgotten my revenge, 
 pricks! Snowfield 
 I can't hear the big, freedom. Then 
 the morning endeavour'd to give for madness 
 more than a week of the Obligation
