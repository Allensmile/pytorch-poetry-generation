 
 Not a mind for any dawn. 
 
 
 
 
 
 from Evening 
 
 
 Rocks whose fingers float 
 the dark windows into the country 
 
 where it rains the corridors 
 that keep them to hate our grandmother 
 
 where mountains they shine away 
 
 and soon we cast our way into the states 
 we find ourselves darkies 
 putting goodbye 
 receive water 
 
 or nothing to sight. 
 
 
 stash--The girls--
