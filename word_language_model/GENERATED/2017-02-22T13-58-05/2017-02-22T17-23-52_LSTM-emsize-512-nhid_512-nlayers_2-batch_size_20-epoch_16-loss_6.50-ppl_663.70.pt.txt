 It is in silence far away from the future. 
 A good much can yell away, this is called to the curve? 
 binding my insides and my knees. 
 
 * 
 
 The neighbors whirr, each other 
 Who stop declared every actually wing 
 When he pulls his head off his shoulder to Skye. 
 No more of the Days are not produced 
 The men crowd in their destroyed cool hands 
 Nor struggle grand-daughter 
 
 the nightmares 
 of others
