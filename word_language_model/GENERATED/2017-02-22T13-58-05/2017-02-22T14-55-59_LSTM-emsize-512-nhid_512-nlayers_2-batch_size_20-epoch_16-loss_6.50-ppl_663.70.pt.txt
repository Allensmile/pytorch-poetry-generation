 Though we all care to teach 
 How far in mind can provoke: 
 There were matter where the whole has slept. 
 
 And how our hopes dwell there together. 
 
 Only in general boys he saith. 
 
 "I never think you should confess 
 Who sleeps in this sunny corpse, 
 And like a construction, in that river 
 And silence over them was gone. 
 
 Until the dawn appears, 
 The ghost of it has begun 
 As to breathe so
