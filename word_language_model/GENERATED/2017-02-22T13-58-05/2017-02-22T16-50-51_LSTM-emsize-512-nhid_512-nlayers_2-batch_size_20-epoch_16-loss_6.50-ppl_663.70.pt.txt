 
 And words not, turn on the steam, 
 
 And besides the ages define 
 
 The hopes of arithmetic? 
 
 As evening shaggy and lucked 
 
 The dark strikes up in a fire, and mark 
 
 Felt the sound in its feet, 
 
 Like a beam gathering transfer 
 
 Thou lend itself a thousand gem 
 
 Through the dark Floyd groaning in rammer, 
 
 He takes his liquid dream; 
 
 Comes dressed as Jebusite, 
 
 Ever
