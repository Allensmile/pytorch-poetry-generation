Against The Clearing Glass 

 
 where there come behind the stock of hunger 
 In private centuries when my own celestial 
 day-- where dawns may stand away 
 in fear of old night by fact Asbestos, 
 Otherwise, lives hits you, drink 
 and your heart cloy at the mouth of a cat 
 watching at the swell and melt 
 the paper, in the streets 
 still putting in spite of your mouth as I put 
 on your elbow large here in an arm
