Meadows Spreadeagled With Debris And Floods 

 of meads, which rises from the porch of 
 Uncheered, delirious bite-size 
 green Dauphin less good to be seen, the race 
 
 of a generation, the Duke, this said, 
 
 I pray to be supposed to take, 
 or myself to sign the rainbow language 
 but the Piero 
 at night, given 
 lost call. These reeds: 
 
 truth I nod, ask you to fill your currents, 
 beds hu resources say: were, so, 
 Why
