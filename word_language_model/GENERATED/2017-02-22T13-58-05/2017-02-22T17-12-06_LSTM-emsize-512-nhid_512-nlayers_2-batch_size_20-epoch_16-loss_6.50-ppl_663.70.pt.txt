 nor EVERYONE breaking out my chrysanthemums. 
 "For Tail, migliore you tell me I 
 know-- of Brine 
 Make you ghost? Then I give her

 when cars were catching on 
 all lay stationed on their ribs, 
 
 until their Tiger lip was cold 
 for diaphragm and, bored again. 
 In moonlight; 
 this could say 
 even in its breast 
 the poet must not propagate
