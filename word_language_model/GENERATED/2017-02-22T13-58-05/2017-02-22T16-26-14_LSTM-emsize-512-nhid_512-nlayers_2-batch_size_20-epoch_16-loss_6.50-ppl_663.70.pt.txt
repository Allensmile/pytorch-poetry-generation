 Much look onto my face, my face adios, 
 Moves me, the earth, the martyr, I endure. 
 
 Where is my truths when Pope has fall'n, 
 I know the hour where as, at last, 
 The long glass tide shines gaze contradiction, 
 
 Now then came home, her heart is bare, 
 Abecedarian like blinking bird of winter 
 And glittering round with white; 
 There's still in pomp that pious won; 
 Which it must cheat and can again! 
 O dear live
