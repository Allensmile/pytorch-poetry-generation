 
 Here is the sword 
 As Morning water a Towred bean. 
 Once like that, by marriage is singular, a birthday kits, 
 Which makes us wizardry, The steps are not even. 
 
 
 As it is on stones before time and the night older. 
 But the total silence of these voodoo's game 
 Hath taken to part from the Burning idiom 
 Into the or gray motes of an eternity 
 A wild summer bridge growing old and bright 
 And represents it
