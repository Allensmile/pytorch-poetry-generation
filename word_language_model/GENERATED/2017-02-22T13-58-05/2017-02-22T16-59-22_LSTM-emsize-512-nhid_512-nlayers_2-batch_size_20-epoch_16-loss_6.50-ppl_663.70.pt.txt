Contrived, 

 
 
 
 
 
 The Cradle 29: vine-snared and Eaters 
 
 
 When I have beheld the whelming balm, 
 And lowly burning sands go on. 
 The silver things that seam, and fill. 
 Then winter harsh moon spotted with detested. 
 To recite the greed unto the heart, 
 The beat of their great treasure gone, 
 The droghte of scheme, 
 The creator of the Ocean, and all the men! 
 
 For once I knew thy wondrous cold and clear.
