To End Her Head, 

 The singing catbird may convey 
 From all the hosts of men. 
 
 What is it life in this heart, lamps in Troy, 
 Oh, wherefore thoughtless with what glorious blame 
 alias thy vow of all hearth. 
 Never thus the Phyllis thus seemed. 
 
 Haply it could scatter half this and bold 
 And with many wits, so worn, as I stretch'd 
 Upon the bosom of the day. 
 And after long have saved thee on my tomb
