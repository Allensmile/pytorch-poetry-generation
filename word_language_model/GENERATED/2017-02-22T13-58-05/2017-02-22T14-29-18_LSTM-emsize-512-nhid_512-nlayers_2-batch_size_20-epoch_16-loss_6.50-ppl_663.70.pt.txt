 Her throat, dear whole men shell, so the hills 
 dance, draw from their walls: a fingertip 
 Long fall above the face of lesbianic

 Longing and deserted into war, 
 But flowers ironside and twine, 
 (For what simplicity are Bares 
 The gentlest Reason, of love 
 haste! with eyes of root for lack of hope.
