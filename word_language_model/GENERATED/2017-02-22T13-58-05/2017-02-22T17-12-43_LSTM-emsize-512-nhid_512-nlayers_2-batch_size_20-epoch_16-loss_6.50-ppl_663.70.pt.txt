Trumph A Bed On 

 Good and yet I understand it. 
 
 * 
 
 Felt it wasn't her snyttrum 
 When he came 
 Without breath 
 When he shook it and sang, 
 Come up to the door and close his door. 
 He swallowed small hands a bit, 
 And when the flames closed embrace him, 
 Hyrcanus swirling like a shred of cedar 
 Below the sand. The orchard hum the plain. 
 No matter what I would not expect but so;
