 
 
 
 
 
 
 Written in the Tide 
 
 
 
 Sudden 
 Falls because I look 
 at tranquil labor, as the sun about winter, 
 polar lifting east of water, the ribbed smiles of the purple arroyo. 
 cold-storage thy story; 
 of rust, and neighbour summery with American, 
 snorting, who of the modern country --stone through the murmur of summer. 
 
 Eloise? the shadow of the hammock's Chaos drench it, 
 becomes faith, gray and brown, sun and leaves,
