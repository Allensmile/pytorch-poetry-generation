To Laugh 

 
 Now flowing with grey wind. 
 
 Who repeats our enemies with such a look 
 That turns through all the bounds again to kiss him, 
 Yes, if you speak about, he feed short ways too late. 
 
 If you stumble underneath the green blue sky 
 To move the roses in your comrades, too; 
 And this I'm sleeping on your left again, 
 There's any of you since you know, 
 And you won't let me drive you back,
