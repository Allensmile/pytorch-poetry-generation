 I float upon the mast ginkgoes, joy. 
 The cold sea air is the sky with the lips of the south 
 As they fall high, ynough sende great now, 
 Heavy and cold. They faint from ragged and upward-rushing 
 It is fly! or carrying all ways 
 To praise the brawling tree they need not within, 
 But the relief and the British express where 
 Are the most shadows in the mountains 
 And moderate traffic running over the problem.)
