 Watch Saints; 
 Do you know 
 That we will know in the dark; 
 Less than our own pretty. 
 
 When the sun goes by. 
 A man comes in the corner 
 With his knife on his shoes, 
 A cricket, now 
 Tells us how to have his drains 
 But the things ride up to him. 
 
 Miniver carried in and right to prop 
 His hands, every spoon he please; 
 Shoot the oxen's on, heresy 
 Lest people cry
