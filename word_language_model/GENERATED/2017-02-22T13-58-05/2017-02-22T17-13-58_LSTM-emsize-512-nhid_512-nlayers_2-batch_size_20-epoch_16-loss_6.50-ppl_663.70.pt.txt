More Tale:--Ae 

 and more of the world so finally got, 
 so choked or twenty 
 shadow- range from chain to head-high. 
 
 Outside a window window 
 
 I will talk myself after lunch 
 and the body gets free 
 To its place in it. 
 How it happens, I do 
 have drank, why, 
 smoke again, turning 
 inside me, like me, 
 and I can act & grow up on small 
 bed late in sight and am gone, 
 snow,
