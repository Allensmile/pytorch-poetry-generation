 Of truth when none. He is made 
 To bear: are Freetown--engineered mean music, 
 
 Pulled me to walk to the sea beside 
 And from melding Old England 
 For her numbers bandied nature 
 But the veins glitter and vibrate ... 
 That was joy that leave but moulded trust, 
 Of night's fruit, in all the crumpled world 
 All day I forming it 
 Sun-light, streaming in the darkness. 
 
 No matter what I dined the hard thing 
 To do
