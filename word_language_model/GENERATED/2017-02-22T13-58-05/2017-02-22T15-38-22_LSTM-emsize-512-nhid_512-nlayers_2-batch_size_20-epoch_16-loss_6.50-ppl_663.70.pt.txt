I Aim Her To Peter; Thee, All These Hosts And Of Love, Of Hope, 

 Take my difficult brother to wince with the pains of poems, true they are with me. 
 
 In a moment all I ask at myself I love them, 
 reading a ridden as many as the despair? 
 
 Would it be conventions or what the former may set off or offer them. 
 
 No but words, and loving me as fadge, am is one: 
 I have found the way
