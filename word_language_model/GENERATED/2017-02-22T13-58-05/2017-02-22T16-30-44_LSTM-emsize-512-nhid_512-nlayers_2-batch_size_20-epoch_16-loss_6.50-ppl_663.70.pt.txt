Yet With The Eggplant, Lips, 

 fugitives, our selves Off-hand -- 
 Carrying through a great cult's stream. 
 In glory a curved, Pleiad's, the door, 
 The seal, the Wilson--you be fluttering in thick breasts,

 Brown as any mailman and tufts, potato 
 Flashing under the banana dead swell the landscape.

 All suddenly unadorned eas upon
