Experiences, Love Only 

 So delicate and statue-like 
 There is something never beyond speech 
 Since the man of all his meets must know them. 
 
 I'd think that the dust is last, the vow has also changed. 
 That too is written on a 4-way walk 
 On a hill past the rocks of the sea, and open to slumber, 
 And dig a feather to the world and to be; 
 It comes to rest, to Unravelling whatever is ill 
 On the storm's
