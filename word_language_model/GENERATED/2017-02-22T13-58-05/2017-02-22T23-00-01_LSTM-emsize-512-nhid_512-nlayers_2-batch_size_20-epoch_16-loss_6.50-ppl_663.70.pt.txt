 My breath squadrons with the hand, 
 the exercise dividing 
 spring Greenville, in Asia, 
 but a well-tam'd sense ... 
 The air once risen, but the wolves 
 are awake. 
 A forest bends 
 to reach to a boy named 
 and won't die. 
 On the wet surface 
 where my eye in step 
 will walk through my veins 
 the night I will last. 
 The dog is coming to, 
 the weather a forest 
 will slick. 
 padded, houses
