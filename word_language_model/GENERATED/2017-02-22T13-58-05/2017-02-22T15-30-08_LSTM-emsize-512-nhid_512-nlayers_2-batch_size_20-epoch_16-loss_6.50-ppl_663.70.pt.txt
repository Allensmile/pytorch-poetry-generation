Throw On Low Cards And Eat 

 Crooked eyes, showing the breeze thoughts, all her thighs. 
 
 But the squires for me is to think of her. 
 I was so hungry it is my sleep and I 
 Should have been stalled here, lying still in the alcove, 
 I should think I could learn with the lines of it, 
 And made fallen, child, and bucking. and that was blessed 
 as engaged to me, since words were burning.
