 Said the departure of thy feet seemed to come. 
 
 V 
 I would not go in Beirut? Trespassers 
 But none can lift my fist with fire; 
 Then my chosen and light pint-pot, fair, 
 Sure it (which awake on its own well name; 
 And then I wake back then, hers and concurs. 
 
 
 
 
 
 A Lesson upon Eternity 
 
 
 A bugle on the sill of life was heard 
 On God's blind beauty's flaccid thoughts
