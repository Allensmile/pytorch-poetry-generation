Be Undone, 

 swallowd up off, over and is saying: 
 Thus the itch is Nos the heat is swept out, 
 And the profundity of the spirit has taken us far away, 
 And the world is cold and dim as poison, and around. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Song: my Lord and the fair woman 
 
 
 The evil is my splendid and shrine, 
 For it was on mine, and when I view her face. 
 Much often, if I could eternalise,
