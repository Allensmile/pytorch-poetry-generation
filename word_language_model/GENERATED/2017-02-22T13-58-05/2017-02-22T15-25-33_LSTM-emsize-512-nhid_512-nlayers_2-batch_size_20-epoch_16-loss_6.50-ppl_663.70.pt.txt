 for all us really proclamation, 
 
 we looked alive. smith:-- strolled, 
 PLEASE loves try? Is this way 
 before a man knew, as he hits 
 the big clothes, really, 
 
 then fills with little darkness 
 and only a dude his mother 
 will have taught a child Strumpets 
 
 Put gaze upon the pistil. 
 
 Now she'd turn the seat we down, 
 and set us down the back door today. 
 Their own voice like a twist of water,
