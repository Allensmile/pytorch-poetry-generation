 When the sheep descends with the castle 
 And the rain. Where are the showers and salt, 
 Stars and their road!' have changed, 
 I know look down; not knowing the word 
 But I have envy that of my poor need. 
 And the other go for you often asleep 
 From the cloud and flower of the high-born song 
 The summer of life, and so I have done. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Song at receipt of Bells
