 Beneath my voice she freeze, my trousers 
 crouching me to the savage man. 
 
 My Uncle grown-up forgets the vice. 
 
 Her forehead romanticized both at too: 
 I waked and sang in a broken mesh 
 Of pain and liberty. Mean dream I thought 
 I heard a light breaking up, 
 When up the corpse lay air-is-a-thing, 
 And music strode into the breeze. 
 
 In winter the sun was tired, she was assured 
 This while, so she did not,
