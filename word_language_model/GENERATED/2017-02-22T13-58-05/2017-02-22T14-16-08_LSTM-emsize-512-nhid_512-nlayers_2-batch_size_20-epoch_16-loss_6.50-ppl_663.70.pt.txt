 All over branches where from its own nest the year 
 Of the great day, a creature without remorse 
 Or is itching at abuelita only the faintest 
 special mistake. 
 
 The need not shut around with its voice, or the stuff is long. 
 The body has gone away from it 
 Like common thoughts at night to run 
 Except the Soon one who hears contagion less or more truths 
 Than any laws will be waiting for it. 
 
 There's lost
