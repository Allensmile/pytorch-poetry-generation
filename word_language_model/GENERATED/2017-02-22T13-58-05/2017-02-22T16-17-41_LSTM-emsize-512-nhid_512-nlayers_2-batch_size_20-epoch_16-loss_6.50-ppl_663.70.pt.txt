 
 But so small, and so I stand green 
 
 Into a silent city, then splintering itself into the grass; 
 
 You sit like a sheaf of cold blades 
 
 Sun-blood in a melody of pain? 
 
 This is the games . . . Nosegay, 
 
 Buy coffee a simple city, a few more reflection in the mouth, 
 
 "What is Bash's reason to thou-art 
 
 
 What about this is Wednesday, the Six among 
 
 The moon, blood
