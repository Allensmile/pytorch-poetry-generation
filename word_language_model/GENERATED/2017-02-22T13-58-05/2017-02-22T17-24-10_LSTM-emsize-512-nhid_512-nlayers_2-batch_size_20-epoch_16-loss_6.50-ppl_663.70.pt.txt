Reason. 

 
 First when a knee had come, parting interpersonal times 
 as we passed out, I thought, hearing the allegory of blood 
 in my cracks in the fields like beans on nape, 
 I swear I were propped against the sulking mesh-like autumn's listening. 
 
 I believe them forget what I pass around for the winter light hides by the window, 
 and I sleep. 
 
 The summer days it rises beyond the ruins of earth meat and likeliest speaks to its people.
