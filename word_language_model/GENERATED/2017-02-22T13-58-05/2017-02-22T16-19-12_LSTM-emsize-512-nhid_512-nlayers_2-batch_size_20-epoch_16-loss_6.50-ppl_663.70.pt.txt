Hair 

 full of poetry? coming in pineapple 
 some white wood, almost stunned decketh 
 
 monkeys face on earth after eggs and swamps 
 of linen, Who'd published 
 Body, weeping as Cribari to rape 
 
 indifferent as Bikini 
 and riot was weighty? 
 by purity 
 
 And the moralist 
 that was known 
 
 and itself 
 (which is all Quarreled 
 
 Strom. chevroned 
 over the range and palms. 
 
 What trellised variations 
 Genryaku! natures, there.
