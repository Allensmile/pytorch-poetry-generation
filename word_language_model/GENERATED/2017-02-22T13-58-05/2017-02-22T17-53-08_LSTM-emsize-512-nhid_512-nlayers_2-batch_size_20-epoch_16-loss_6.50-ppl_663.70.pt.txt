Invade. 

 Surely I learned it again. 
 A dark and sad without life. 
 Would he have it since I was a friend 
 who was he? I'm there. 
 
 You tell me they were nine women, 
 tell me I would work. 
 I don't lie back here, 
 These small twine about, 
 Sunk in furnished terror 
 And foolish birds sing my own old smile. 
 
 They died, they were made of hats, 
 slush of violence spilled along 
 The edges
