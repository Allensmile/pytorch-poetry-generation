 wizens, wouldn't catch the halting people 
 races and scrubbed eyes, communion 
 together. 
 I felt myself sitting through, 
 driving to window wire 
 among Hell cluttered and endlessly 
 below home, dripping into 
 the wind, hours gone I should stand 
 mirrors. A gleam of winter 
 lights a lake, black 
 Toothroad hidden, in the 
 damp rainbow of the 
 Atlantic. 
 Like a mirage that flow 
 into sand stone, chorus 
 swan closing; 
 no through the sky
