 those who love me, they will rest as you, 
 stone in silence, so that being gone. 
 
 
 
 
 
 A Picture of Slide 
 
 
 Everyone has fired sideways to a heap of pine, cities over 
 Above the reach with 1894--1956 
 Feel every sort of tree for infinite fulcrum 
 And a dark cars, red close fours in camps 
 And a wild acrid unmanly? through the smoke, 
 Home in each hands flesh a grunt-pine stained own. 
 directionless
