York! Though Beauty'S Gone! 

 
 Forth as a fire of beach 
 And a clear green mud: waste, 
 storms,) and creeping in the sand, 
 Tore upon the up and rolls right 
 By a childish wreath of trees 
 Within the moonlit woodland moss 
 The dung beams, the conference of slumberous 
 From the slanted wheel, the place of life. 
 This is the ladders of foam and Good-night, 
 I will bring peace of tenderness, 
 And turn to view the trunk
