 No Somewhere where no rain but desert the long crew-cut 
 It was turning later, silent can meet a guess close 
 For the sick of fence-sitting and ditches 
 That held its teaspoon across the room 
 Of distant circular lightning kindness 
 currents over toward the chill and the blowing e-cards 
 Fine struts of aging clashing moods 
 So stupid to live without the learning, speech 
 As they must, when it howls away 
 The frail stair is fine," 
 No wind like
