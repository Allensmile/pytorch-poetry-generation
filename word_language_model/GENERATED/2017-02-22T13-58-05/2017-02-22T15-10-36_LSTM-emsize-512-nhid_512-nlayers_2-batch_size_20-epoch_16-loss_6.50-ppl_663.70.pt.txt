 The supreme tangle on its breast-- 
 No symbol he owned to escape. 
 
 Over the train the cave have brought 
 sere; to glimpse an idiot song 
 In snap of snow and snow. 
 
 Pale, and transparent along the road 
 In that dark room, as though there ever lay 
 A thrill: was it well Abstrusest thighs 
 That in the grave luminosity, columns 
 Kept yet in flowers and utmost wood. 
 Why throw me early for a isle of judge,
