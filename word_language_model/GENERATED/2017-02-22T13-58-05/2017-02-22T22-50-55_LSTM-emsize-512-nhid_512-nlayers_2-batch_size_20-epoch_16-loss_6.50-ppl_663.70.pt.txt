 Teeth every wanderer kneeling among 
 The door while I've got to remind you -- 
 just a thousand tasting, card from another. 
 One comes or bare-armed; I can't resist 
 another moment. 
 And yet my sister and I proud do not threaten 
 With what deep shadow shared the wheat 
 Of heaven afar and, on the self-same stone. 
 
 Old men are this; just the rough trail, 
 The herald of the glimmer, garages, 
 There are forgotten innovated 
 As foam
