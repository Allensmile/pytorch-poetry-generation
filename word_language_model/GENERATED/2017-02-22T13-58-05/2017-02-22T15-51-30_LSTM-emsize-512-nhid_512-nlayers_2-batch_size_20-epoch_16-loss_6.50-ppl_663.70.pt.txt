The Monk And Magazines; 

 all rubbed things, so into, 
 give vacant man an hour now. 
 In the corruptible wallet to listen 
 to the heart. It means to say, not to beg its fear 
 to its silvers and choke like a carpenter's blades. 
 I am the patient of you, a neon ago. 
 
 Not all that parts are certain, To see 
 what thing a state is goal. 
 The water enters my a.m. the war. 
 I only want you.
