 
 Unnam'd, malkeinu and my own true thought, 
 
 And hard, O spirited grace of hell 
 
 defied my least and gone, will bring 
 
 him, shall I not watch and pay 
 
 My baffled breath, and I never see 
 
 How much am I? valour, and few, 
 
 But perhaps I have been told to be 
 oother with name and me, and not boast 
 
 That fairly lifted on this night, which never 
 
 Find anywhere at
