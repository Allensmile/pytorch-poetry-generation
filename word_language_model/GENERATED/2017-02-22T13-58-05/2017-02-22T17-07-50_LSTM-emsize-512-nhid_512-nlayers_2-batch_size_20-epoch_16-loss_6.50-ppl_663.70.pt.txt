The Least Minds, 

 And spent the Christians of the slaves they grow; 
 And spent the day and night before, who tensings, 
 Yea, as the worms of song in heaven shone 
 In the cold light of their long long tapestry 
 Sainted nights, might shake the world athwart 
 The gasping drift of baking wheat, 
 As if they could escape our windows well again. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Yak 
 
 
 They had gone to the secular deep
