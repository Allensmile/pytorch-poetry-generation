What We Purely And Together, 

 
 For that which your arms rest on the world; 
 'Tis both we moved, the gusts in our hearts 
 We dip your hand in mailed on: 
 
 And then, then slowly comes away; 
 The young is echo, and the soul grows small. 
 
 And there will be no more; you are quenches. 
 
 I will not be thought to explain the loss 
 Of the great Congo, 
 For I shall go.
