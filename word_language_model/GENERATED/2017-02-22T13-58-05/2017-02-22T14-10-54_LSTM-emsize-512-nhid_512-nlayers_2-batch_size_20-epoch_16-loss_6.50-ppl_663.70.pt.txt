To Keep 

 
 To tell her beauty's resemblance one-- 
 And the love of Hope to human sleep, 
 Of the properly Ear and hidden paint, 
 To-day the herero flowers, and life, and their gods; 
 Are of their own stout falters. 
 
 As we observe one woman late as she is our own. 
 She is riding near Hymn. Road 
 By apples, glories forgets a meadow; 
 And that she diary 
 Her slender mouth shall shelter you. 
 The whisper will cling
