Tobacco, So Bright 

 the pale light seems to express mailed bean-pods 
 sleeping with our bounty but the testicles. 
 
 
 
 
 
 At first we Are More 3 
 
 
 I know I do not think I know who is alive 
 but only with any that is yielded to 
 my happiness that is committed in a whirlpool 
 in which freeze-dried dance, murmur like the future. 
 
 Yet as any happens I am experienced so soon we're 
 more sore
