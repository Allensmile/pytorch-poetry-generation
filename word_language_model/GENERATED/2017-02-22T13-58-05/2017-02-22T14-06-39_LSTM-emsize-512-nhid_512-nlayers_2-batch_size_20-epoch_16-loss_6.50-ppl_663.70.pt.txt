Days 

 Fewer teeth and a rich shopping labyrinth 
 In whetted, eucalypt, succeeds by 
 A arms--strapped another, when father called nucleolytic 
 Henry (which he kicked up environ'd from his wife's new stage] 
 He is younger, he stays for hill-farms, 
 Enough and granted personal keys 
 To desired exaltation; which measures 
 sense of the nameless 
 dead. 
 
 
 CHORUS 
 
 ealowge, 
 Degenerate fal us: ne Future freonda 
 secga savage Fill'd twenty heav'ns, 
 But quite always machete, Teapots
