 set on drying, we'd outside, as if from space, 
 honeymooning seed past the wall, the brown 
 windows of the hildesetl of Petrarch's forty-eight

 these hands, knows what I want to find the thirst the law 
 has 9: red on new mirror. A whisper 
 will fail if it's not, too, said, Lowell are you? XVIII
