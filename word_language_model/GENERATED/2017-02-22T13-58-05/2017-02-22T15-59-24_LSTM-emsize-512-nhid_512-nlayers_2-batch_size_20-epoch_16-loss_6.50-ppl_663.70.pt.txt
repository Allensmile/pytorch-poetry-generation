Milk. 

 
 After my days he heard a tuft 
 of lace composing the feast to a pig 
 where he came from one foot 
 
 but he breathed me together by the lane 
 in a crotch. While the tracing of a fly. 
 The dormant police, distant doors like billiard overturned orange tin 
 walnut in a glowing jar, and console me 
 in the balcony to straighten him with the strong: 
 
 Raft Do not remember me hide for? Nothing 
 is
