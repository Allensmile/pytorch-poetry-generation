Get The Smaller, 

 listening to the country. God bids you love? 
 
 But once Frame-full New York. 
 Well, it ain't not me to be but a journey. 
 What yo' habit is, what covered or lies, 
 a large affected? rape was a compliment 
 I needed what looked at all was. They took it 
 up, not a single dirt, some hairpins, Shrewsbury 
 tick of cats. A string! 
 Robinson like a dog named sentences 
 to be miles, a slight hawser
