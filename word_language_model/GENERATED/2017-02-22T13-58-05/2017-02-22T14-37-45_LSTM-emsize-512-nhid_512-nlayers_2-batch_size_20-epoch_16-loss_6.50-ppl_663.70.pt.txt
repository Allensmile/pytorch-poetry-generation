To Work Down 

 
 to the coast the comb onto the feet and lights. He gave it 
 To the glass & B. nurse still the rain. 
 
 Inside this land the gulls are off to be felt creaking their faces in fur, 
 Where the Statue of Books, clangs amid screwdriver denial, 
 Coffee and subserved and toothless and plangent, 
 At which a nameless poet, was put away from demons 
 For five successive Angels at the face-picturing, children. 
 Walking back, covered. Avenue
