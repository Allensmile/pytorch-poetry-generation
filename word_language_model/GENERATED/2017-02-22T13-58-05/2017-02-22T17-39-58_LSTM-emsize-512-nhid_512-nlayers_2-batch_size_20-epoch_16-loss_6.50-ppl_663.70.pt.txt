 
 Old moment--the monster baggy water, 
 
 the moon hits the house which is always locked to see you, 
 
 light in the breaking of chariot's comet 
 
 Looks around through chambers where only once the spring was ended, 
 
 spun like the Westward burning in night 
 so when the summer's melting oil of its stone 
 
 pulled as from the car 
 
 we walked the steep valley: the screams 
 
 crosses them over red 
 
 and bells
