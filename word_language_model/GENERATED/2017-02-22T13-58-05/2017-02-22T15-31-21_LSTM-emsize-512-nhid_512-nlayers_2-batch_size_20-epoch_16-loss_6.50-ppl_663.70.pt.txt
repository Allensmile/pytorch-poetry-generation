 
 To a field that might be melting, 
 And had to ride before the sun were golden, 
 Let the deer go out like underground matches 
 On the threshing snow, and they were gone above . . 
 Come out . . . movement: the Adversary 
 Is a falling bird. . . . 
 
 
 
 
 
 Time Strategem 
 
 
 A way Helen, a distant spot 
 Dominion space/time: 
 doan' Quangle lyre? 
 completing thee alive without cello.
