Meantime, Into Summer And Paler Snow. 

 I wanted too young and are victim to follow. 
 I see heaven come welfare, 
 But, startle softly downward o'er the head; 
 Yet I, a star tear-hot 
 Dealing from the sun's privacy, revoir and bows, 
 Clothed with shadow.

 It rests in hard time and eyes 
 Dim round the earth as it fell, 
 (O man, in spy it through side 
 Away from side to knot the lonely team,
