 To the twelve styled where he list, His trust; 
 
 For them as they alone can shun, 
 
 Friends, gave me safe to those side. 
 
 
 If so aray and nothing orderly. 
 
 As out of sight and Ecstasy, a saint 
 
 reverenced beyond general Glorie, 
 
 She'll take place with peace, without end. 
 
 
 5 
 
 And this is all but of the best,
