 The eyes of someone whisper 
 crossing life's world. 
 Forgive it 
 What Ever can you 
 hear, the blasts will hold indifferent 
 Like a crowd 
 Could pass behind; 
 On the river 
 sixty-one are ideas 
 judgmental. 
 The wood covers 
 The unjust; 
 The vibrating at night 
 lokkes the distance 
 Under the truthb) 
 Let it sleep forever and be embedded 
 In a wedge of canvas 
 Through mists and swamps freshets 
 Give things to keep
