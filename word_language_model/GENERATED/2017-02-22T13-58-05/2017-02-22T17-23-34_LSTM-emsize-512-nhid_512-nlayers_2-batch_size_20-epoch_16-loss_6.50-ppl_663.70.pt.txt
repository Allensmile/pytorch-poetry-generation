Aerie And In The Sky! 

 Of no Cell -- no mark of wisdom do love. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Sonnet bric- 
 
 
 The count is rest 
 
 And it's in all of our folly 
 And somehow we are not born! 
 I hear in the August woods 
 My coat is in their speckled needles, 
 Pulling their footprints through at their stove. 
 Like old bills? 
 Weeping in the nouveaux shadows of rain, 
 A heap of hills in
