A Song 

 
 and time Nelly i love you instead of life. 
 
 You needn't care. 
 As I wandered in the window, 
 you had failed to wash amounts, 
 
 while the sun began to watch 
 
 and stood Candy 
 
 They're all yet strung at me with speaking shame 
 
 and became nothing but this there in its 
 
 Suppose you might and I 
 
 will not dismiss you. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Poem for Mr.
