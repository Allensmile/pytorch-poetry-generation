 the walls of the hot sea 
 came a long winter night 
 that rises from Eva fifties 
 spent,' a good perfection 
 of the fern Apart as a pony 
 Plunge. and toppled back to heel 
 to the law of dusk. No bird 
 salamanders like Cupid, gulls sing 
 fire fallen from afar drawn over stones 
 hanging on ice, left from a thousand metal.

 The massacre was shedding friends on a platform 
 gathers their fingers
