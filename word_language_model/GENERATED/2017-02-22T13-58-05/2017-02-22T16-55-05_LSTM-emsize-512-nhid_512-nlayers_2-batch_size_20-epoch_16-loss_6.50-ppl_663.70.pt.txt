 What I Want A Name 
 
 
 My hours are vodka-wrecked Say, 
 seize; frieze, at doing break. 
 I am steep'd on myself, come to them, 
 Or weep out there to need it well. 
 Now I'm Him whose courage you 
 say so that you not-visible-from-the-sky, 
 So Flax so many things 
 for times ago, you sixty-arsed 
 the least of all your Easy journey. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Said, Winkie and hypothetical,
