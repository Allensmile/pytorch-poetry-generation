Of The Moon 

 was sestina and Invalides.... 
 
 And I began a trellis. 
 Two were alums and cycles of repertoire. 
 Red and instrument, 
 wires of the darkness. cigarette turned away. 
 
 A girl came up beyond the house, 
 and said, luminously Cheops. I'd gone 
 there joined picture hypnosis 
 across her collar, looking 
 for a moment on the other side. 
 Five men are strapped out from my door 
 my pocket their topmost palms pursuing the bone
