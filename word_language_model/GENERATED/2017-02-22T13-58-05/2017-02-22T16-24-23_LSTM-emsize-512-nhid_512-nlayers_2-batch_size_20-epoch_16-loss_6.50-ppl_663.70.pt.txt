To Follow How 

 More than what the goods that might have meant; 
 Whilst thou upon thy face, thy spirit's anthem 
 Make colored poles upon thy face, 
 Sitting in the garden, on the side, 
 Whilst musing in some sphere of skies 
 To blast the thunder toewalking its earth; 
 A hundred still chief no more to rest: 
 Still oft the waste serene of life, 
 Ness' rain, and, dim and Images, only wit 
 Hath rotted in the sumptuous next vast spear.
