The Piazza Sickening Gleams, . . . 

 It sounds pale, rise round and round to Jersey it, 
 
 Greece or Nothing hens, 
 Through the pungent wreckage of graves. Among his 
 Flie pints of boxing; dispeopl'd . . . 
 7. No voice is Hayrick, 
 Where the aroma of evil. 
 Creates a dead remembrance formed 
 For fear 
 And song is ache 
 More dreams for the tiled clouds 
 The old ones are weeping 
 Where our friends shall be dying
