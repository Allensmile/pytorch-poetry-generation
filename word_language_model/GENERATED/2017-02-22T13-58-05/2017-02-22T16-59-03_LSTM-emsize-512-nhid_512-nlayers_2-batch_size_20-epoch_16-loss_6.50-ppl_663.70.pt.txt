 When the wind meets snow, where the last 
 Rocks are loosed with the yellow beneath-- 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Your antennae Will Not She Go nor Backward 
 Her Shadow gladness slowly I have had to go 
 suburbs: the streets with sky overhead! 
 Or in her bed, a lucid ash 
 Of son of laughter and a seal'd face. 
 Here and there only follow me, when I knew the brave-- 
 How big the immense future and those days
