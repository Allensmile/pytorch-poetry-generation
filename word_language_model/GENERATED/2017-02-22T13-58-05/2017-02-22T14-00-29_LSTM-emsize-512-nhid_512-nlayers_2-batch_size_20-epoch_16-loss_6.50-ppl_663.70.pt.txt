The Grass 

 stiff in the little void of hell. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 A Slow Night 
 
 
 I empty a rich Sunday, then sat asleep 
 As class seized it off to drink myself in. 
 But one moment when my age fell into the silence 
 I'd never minds. Were my opened shadow 
 In the dying room. Take some neighbor, luxury's 
 blind-sailors throat runs down and passes under. 
 
 A girl in wishing made a trivial ear!
