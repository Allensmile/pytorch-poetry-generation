Of Hammer 

 I nibbled at the great beginning, learn that tea 
 
 might have been to be healed when anyone looming 
 In the same years I loved them still excite 
 
 In still-lifed and "May take all over farthing 
 Or sorry wanting to ask for them, 
 But grateful I shall feel my joy they cry, 
 And I believe the smaller of the things 
 Bound back to my mouth happily never is happily 
 I have found somewhere a distinct world
