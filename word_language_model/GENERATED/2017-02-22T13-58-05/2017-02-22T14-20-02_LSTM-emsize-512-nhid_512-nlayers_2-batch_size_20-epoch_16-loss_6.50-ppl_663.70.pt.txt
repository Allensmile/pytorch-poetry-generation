 And yet these faded fires in despair, 
 God has one another's life a whole delight, 
 And you say nothing again 
 But not even your native grave. 
 
 To Broadway is the kill. 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Ethnic Statue 
 
 
 To 
 the dice 
 Of nameless One. 
 So not for them to try 
 Come away of the mass, 
 headphones, gold bright with heels to burn. 
 
 In an absence of utmost, love 
 John
