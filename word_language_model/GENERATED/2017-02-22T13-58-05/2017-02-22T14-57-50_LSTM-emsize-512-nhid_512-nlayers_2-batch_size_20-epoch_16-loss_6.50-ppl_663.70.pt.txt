Wear 

 on graven silver in weighting theatres 
 
 of nerves bowed pedestal; killing her, her husband's 
 face, lights closed, I strained talking to her tykes, 
 collecting and thirty, but my true conscience 
 
 her infinite lightbulbs and swollen. 
 Go home, listen to the wedding, his friends 
 grow Comrades, in their bosoms, than I can't see 
 them soon. That is always a structure of hill and ink touching window that comes, 
 the pigments of the dead man's eyes around him
