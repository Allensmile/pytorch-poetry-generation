 Within the wave of night, in the hills 
 Of that still desert singing there 
 Were golden among sad enemies, 
 Keeping their surface turn'd with prayer 
 The local history of the year. 
 
 
 
 
 Ill London 
 
 
 Farewell to my task at sworn to frown 
 And kissed me to five hundred hairs 
 Under whose shade the crocus burn its fire: 
 Loud flowers of Paradise is heard 
 Like angels, and the massive stars, 
 The women
