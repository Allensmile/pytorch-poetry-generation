Like A Voluminous, Of Spiegelman 

 Alabanza. Praise the side of an egg 
 backyard longing for some comb walk. 
 The helmet bear another way 
 to bleach Wallace, 
 suck their trunk to their bones. 
 
 Later turning the coupole! 
 It sounds eating in its chains 
 the way a tear, 
 of all who come on with me. 
 The blue flowers all closing 
 are reeket yet 
 like ash grass, a single pit. 
 
 On midnight; today, the sun bee
