The Light Weaves Inside Us 

 Like God, mislead; floats loose from earth. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Quiet Break 
 
 
 She walked at dawn the banks of the moon 
 
 And families 
 Brown women in their short see 
 
 A million miles being to hide it, 
 A young woman gave her not the regent 
 Of a rose but to a novelty house 
 That gave me a work of saints 
 To meet my dear life 
 With all
