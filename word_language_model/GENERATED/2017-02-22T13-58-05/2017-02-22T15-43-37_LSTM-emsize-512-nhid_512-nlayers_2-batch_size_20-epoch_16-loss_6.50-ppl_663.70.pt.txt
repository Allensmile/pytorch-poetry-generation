 
 This solitude "Buzz" 
 A creature in a drab space, 
 A shent, a equilibrium, fell: 
 And dynasts. 
 
 seaweeds still, 
 It is a level of deadly unclean, 
 For sleep its bright unloads 
 Doe not bow on thine lizardlike 
 
 Nor can't be feel; but love to depart. 
 Night stirs bright fabulous cries 
 To the eyes of rolling sun 
 On a Amazon below, that flits up 
 By summer trees. 
 For the delight that whirls around
