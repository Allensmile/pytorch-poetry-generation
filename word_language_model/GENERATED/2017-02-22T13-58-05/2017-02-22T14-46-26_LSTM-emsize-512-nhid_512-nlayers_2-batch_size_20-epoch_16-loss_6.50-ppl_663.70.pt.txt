Unconfin'D 

 With every patience in his mind. 
 Glorie that he makes no constant mark 
 Nor what the man can wish, nor one in this, 
 Beavie of many reckon, 
 And sent in their private solitudes in state 
 Of statues, rich and machines, the eye 
 Of too much knowledge of thought to help. 
 
 Move next to bed, and turn to shoulders, 
 Which makes me run like Bicentennial, 
 Till any pulsing cry, 
 O sweeter than a lover, chemotherapy
