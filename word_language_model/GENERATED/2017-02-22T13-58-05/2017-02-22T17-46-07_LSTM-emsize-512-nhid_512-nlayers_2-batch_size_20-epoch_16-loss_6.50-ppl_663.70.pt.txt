Not Your "Broccoli 

 God reads the world, as if in a City. 
 
 You think that you were the one which you bathes them. 
 The clanking Ga-ne-o-di-o. ran all over the blinds 
 and sent your bags to pick up this: 
 knees.' punchline, and laity those hips wore one resumes, 
 painting wagon then tongues in park can. 
 Time is true because we paid 
 that no one is English. Now the creak 
 make manifold, our conundrum, have where fewer 
 Might
