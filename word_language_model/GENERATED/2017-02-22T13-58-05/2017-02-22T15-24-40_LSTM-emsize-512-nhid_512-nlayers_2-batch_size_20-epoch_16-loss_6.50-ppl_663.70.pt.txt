 
 Over the terrace, we wonder why 
 Sure God in Coercing Save the final king 
 As bent or to the fullness and the world. 
 
 
 III. 
 
 There is a Shipman with red and shoes 
 And a long.--You here in daze of tender. 
 If it will be, it is time and hate 
 And the running mouth of a fault 
 Pontinus, with hands and hands, bless it prospered. 
 All that's but mere hope but evil 
 To shun
