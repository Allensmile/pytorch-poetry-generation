Mouths 

 The plank flies slowly down upon my lap, 
 
 "That's well that at night; can I talk 
 When my mother looked down into the glass 
 Turning the tang of constant key. 
 It had many ways to do an verse to win them, 
 & credit their insane ones 
 to enter icons, 
 Into the secret world. 
 
 
 
 
 
 lobster 
 
 
 Not in the heat, and yet Ros 
 married-until-death--sunders to make triumphant self. More free.
