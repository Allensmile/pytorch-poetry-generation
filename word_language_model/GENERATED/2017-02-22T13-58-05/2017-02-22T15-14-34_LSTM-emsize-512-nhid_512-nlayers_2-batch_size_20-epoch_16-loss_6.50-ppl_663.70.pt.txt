Bound, Long After, 

 Who thought I was at once and more. 
 At that moment come a princess in time, 
 Which other people crests the streets, forget 
 This tomb is one thing you're wrong for me, 
 You are neither you nor ever can. 
 You have no way to do so much, 
 To call where you go nought less. 'Tis all you may, 
 And for you will ever speak. 
 
 Behold I know not what comes. That led you 
 To
