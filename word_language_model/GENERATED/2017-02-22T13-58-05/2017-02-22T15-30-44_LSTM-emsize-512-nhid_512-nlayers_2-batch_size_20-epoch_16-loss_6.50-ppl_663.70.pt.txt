 This is the way that fills thy sleep 
 The world, downs over us, to-day 
 Cold virgins rejoice at golden seasons 
 The glance of the present eve 
 Are children from the swirls of sin, 
 Making thy grief their pleasure boyfriends, 
 Till they have wi' us cleaning by the fangs 
 And triumphant sleep with a dying sound 
 Or my fruit not mine to my flowing eyes, 
 As a line without a mother; 
 How the night it is! The leaves
