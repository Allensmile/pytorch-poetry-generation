 Bibliography of peace for centuries, 
 Where whispers are blind, 
 Strange seasons by the black. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Consolation 
 
 
 I come to drink, to eat. 
 Or in aught, 
 Though I am it allowing 
 To spoil my little love 
 And goes 
 And no soul will Exalt 
 The cold and sycamore, and forcd 
 And little singing mouth of soul.
