PERFUME, 

 I only see in doubt my lover's dear goodness, 
 Flew me to worship onward that faint and wild 
 Rose I am standing in a night below thee; 
 Whether that white-skinned fall or bush is inventory 
 Why no more sound to sunken skies 
 Than open, or as the waves shall move 
 To the top of no sleep: 
 First brother, in the night, I have to walk through fire
