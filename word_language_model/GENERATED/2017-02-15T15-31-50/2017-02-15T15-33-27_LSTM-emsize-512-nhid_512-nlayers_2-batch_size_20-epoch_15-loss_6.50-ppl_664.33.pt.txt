FOR JUMBO MUSIC, 

 Where, next to sulphur others at doors, 
 Mindful of the clash and voices change: 
 That planted, perhaps, shows we 
 know what we have the right 
 We are watching 
 
 havock around and hurry 
 At the corner hoadanO 
 In the Ghost of America 
 Water has fallen out through night's torches 
 
 The heart was perpetually white. 
 
 This is not the beginning. 
 It's
