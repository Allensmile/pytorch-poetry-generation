LITTLE OTHER; 

 
 And it may be clear with the great futile faces. 
 
 
 
 
 
 I shoar: My body 
 
 
 Into November I heard last in my voice 
 Q-Tip like a burned yellow and Summers, 
 My my ass and I lay frog, started to belong to my new farm 
 Where the flowers, vectors; my places woke me and bereft with my soul 
 wisdome with the roar
