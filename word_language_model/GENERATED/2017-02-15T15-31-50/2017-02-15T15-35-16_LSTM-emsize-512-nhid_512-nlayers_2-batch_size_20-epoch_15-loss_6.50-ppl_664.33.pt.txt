FRELY AND FORGET 

 It is strange that this body is drawing here, 
 Like the lightning of a lost bell. Each day 
 The mother dies in her throat of rotten ears, 
 And makes her feel pollens, and very strange. 
 
 She takes a tooth unto her piers across silver stress. 
 She is a land pissing on a day or two. 
 She tells us why we hum them, and he won't care
