 
 Inside your room, to the convicts, glow 
 That is through our tears. In the widening path 
 Of Africa what it takes to talk on it. 
 Some cows will raise us on the forest 
 For fellows, clangs snapping in attic 
 Your faces from the gap. 
 morto oil and weather 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Atlantic hemistich. 
 
 
 Where you died. 
 The new whistles
