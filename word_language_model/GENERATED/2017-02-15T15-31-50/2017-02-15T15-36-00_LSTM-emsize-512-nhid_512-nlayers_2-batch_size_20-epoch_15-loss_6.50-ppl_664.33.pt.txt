 
 That bore rid of my poor lover and love and immortal syllables toward once; 
 
 To Society), Heat and yellow and trodden by the flowers more green, 
 
 Or shadows, it loiter there and make no way; 
 
 Waking with music his pilot dreams of the end! 
 
 
 While the earth sinks into silent and grey 
 
 Now the last grass blazes the skies: it is gone,
