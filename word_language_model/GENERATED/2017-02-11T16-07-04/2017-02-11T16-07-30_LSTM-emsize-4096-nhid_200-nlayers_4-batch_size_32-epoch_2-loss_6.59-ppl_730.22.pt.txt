TWENTY-SECOND 

 for a powerful post, imageless. the milk 
 pair of rinsed down, where warm leaves. 
 they were to be fantastic with lines is easy, 
 kettle follows avenida into cobbled wring-world 
 ringtail blue-grey blackish 
 image-bearer bump at the graznido 
 taking on lifelessness provok't, 
 battle-scenes, iridescent, croons, a hustle, 
 
 and obsess-- we are a small wreck. the bright line steps 
 heart.' your head? i'm slow-pac'd the abandoned slug 
 of the loneliness of an old queue against the self-portrait.
