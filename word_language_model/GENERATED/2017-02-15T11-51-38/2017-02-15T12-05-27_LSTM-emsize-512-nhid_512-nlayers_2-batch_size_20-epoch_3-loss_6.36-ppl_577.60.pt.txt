 The Poem 4 
 
 
 
 They shot from hands and eyes, 
 Each autumn word 
 
 From a child's place; 
 With large imagination 
 What's in the gloom below, 
 Whose limbs have closed the sky, 
 The sun is buried adam's 
 salamanders, it is to be kept, 
 Thy view is filled with new, 
 And sealed with earth above a breath 
 Of thy own long wedding long.
