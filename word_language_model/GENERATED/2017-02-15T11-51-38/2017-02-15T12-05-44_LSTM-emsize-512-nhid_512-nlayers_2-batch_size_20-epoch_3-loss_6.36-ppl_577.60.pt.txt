 The Am On The hamburger, 
 
 
 At the other door, Band. 
 Growing frozen in Dripped garden, true 
 as an 15th of lightning 
 blowing on epigrams 
 in Arms in swamps of ocean 
 before long rock 
 able to be beautiful nervous? 
 scanned me. It's barely 
 but 
 it's a Sing's bell to above, 
 but begins: 
 
 
 
 
 
 A TO Pale ever-hooded, 
 
 
 I think of my myself. 
 So cold, he look'd the same broken 
 at leaving up that wood 
 and lightness; "I didn't fall 
 nor possible;
