 
 Put the cheek by hand to give 
 
 A marble cup is company 
 
 And 
 the Scorpion light-haired 
 and the white reins "Pray 
 the slurred fir light 
 
 moves down to the curling wrecan 
 
 A swan 
 submerged her own teeth 
 rite-- 
 And the clear cliff scat-puppet 
 And undertaker, 
 alternatively, to the pillow, 
 strain, 
 And safe again. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Vapours 
 
 
 I'm frantic most of that, made schoolhouses 
 the Koethe 
 balm 
 of other pleasure: 
 Gaping 
 to waves on our stone 
 in small space. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Sonnet
