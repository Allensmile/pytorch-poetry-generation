INSTEAD 

 About the wall. I wrote dancing 
 The Olympian candles; made us closer, 
 Strange weeks, safe, that's sorry and vain, 
 And we would travel and be within. 
 
 This is the way the body swims 
 Home outside the road and frozen to the east 
 From the wide capes where she sleeps in the dark 
 And restless in the full shade and still mountains 
 Echo unto doors.
