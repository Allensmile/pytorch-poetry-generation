IN PEACE, AND SUCK INCURRED, 

 till we swing loose in swirling snow. 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Ballad of Proserpine 
 
 
 The jet swims out at the floors of the window. 
 No step is ending in the next room 
 but the everybody has him 
 for the art of anything over 
 There is the world which holds dark eye 
 here with its snarl of shriek and thirst. 
 It's matter hard for insists. 
 until I kiss my head,
