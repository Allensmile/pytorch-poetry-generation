I PLEASE, 

 as if when all of you is in my absence 
 i sing time to me? more than we 
 
 forget 
 where i ask to enter whole earth. 
 
 to write now here or on the lawn 
 but leave my who's--oh tongue and deeps 
 taste and ring likewise if i speak 
 
 come i've become the little wind, at the edge of god 
 the volvo, labor me, have i, one night 
 we deign'd to know. on top
