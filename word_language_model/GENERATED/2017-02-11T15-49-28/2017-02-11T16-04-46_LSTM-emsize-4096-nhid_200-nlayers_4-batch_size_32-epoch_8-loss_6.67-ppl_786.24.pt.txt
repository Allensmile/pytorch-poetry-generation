THIS WAY 

 in a storm for all kinds of need that 
 i have lost, and without knowing 
 if i feel in ten minutes and spotlight me, 
 and i die--but at next to be, 
 with another part of this tree that watching, 
 or i asked you to find upstairs 
 as transparent as i knew my nipples were. 
 and effaced it all in enough, 
 somebody knew that much of me label 
 trying to ask or if i moved ahead
