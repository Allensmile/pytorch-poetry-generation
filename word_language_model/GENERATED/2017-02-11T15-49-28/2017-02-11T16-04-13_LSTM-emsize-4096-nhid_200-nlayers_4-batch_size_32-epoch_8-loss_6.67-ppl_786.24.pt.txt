LIFE, 

 suspended around me? put up sense 
 in earth after leaf or if you arrived? 
 how many blooms of shark 
 gazes along the chandelier savor 
 from what it fears and only to generally mine? 
 if you don't know how to find you 
 in between hell or personal eternal face 
 whatever creation wasn't was, 
 let you shorter be righteousness. 
 if this is mountaineer? then your route 
 is to watch an introvert track 
 square that, clouds tugging off
