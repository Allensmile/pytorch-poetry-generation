 of the colony? 
 this love-letter wall-to-wall 
 hometown was the law, 
 
 a foolish hamlet's 
 master chose to defiances 
 but a prescriptive coleridge, 
 gave this aptly heard, 
 
 a raindrop just as white 
 as it reached my heart. 
 
 it was no trouble. 
 it twirled close 
 into the burnt field 
 
 and there broke. 
 
 the hovering 
 tree started out 
 
 that fever had not been 
 a glance 
 
 now then
