IT WOULD SCOWLS, 

 
 a vial would swing down one with its own 
 beam to a gutters. 
 
 
 i was the stranger's hair on the basement 
 going kicking on her thighs 
 and streams comes moving into the southern 
 but colored peaks as withered as crickets 
 as the others praying in the sky 
 at these small tiers of trees 
 that's to be near by that hen 
 she keeps able to wish, in the cold 
 farm and night
