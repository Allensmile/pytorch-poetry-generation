 
 now we came in purge 
 of the paradise of life, 
 
 now 
 in that many hours of many years 
 
 part word sends gods run in places. 
 
 no boats 
 
 no memory there. 
 
 what actually bore, 
 
 under one self 
 
 break thy hand, the sign 
 
 have pleasure been 
 
 which is pin-point 
 
 
 but not dangerous it carries 
 
 light-flutt'ring, and cauter and images 
 
 facing bellows,
