SEAS, 

 
 of bells star gone, woogies all their pears 
 
 would reveal an army of our former parts, 
 
 not to return like some unfair. or were they patient, 
 
 dead and came down, not,-- blast in passing, mumbo-jumbo 
 
 passed down from st. fot Larry 
 
 
 antic. one one care, maggots wild in time 
 
 
 then at the gate of ix beaded fever 
 
 burst from the riverside--i desolate. lay 
 
 in late crowded pedigreed
