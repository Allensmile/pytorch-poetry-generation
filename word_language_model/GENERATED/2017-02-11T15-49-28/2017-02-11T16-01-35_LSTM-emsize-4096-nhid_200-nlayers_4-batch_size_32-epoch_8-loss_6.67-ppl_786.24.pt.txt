NOT GREET ME, THE SEA 

 that looks through the waters 
 as i try to bleed it to and become what i get in out 
 
 now there is us home and their day out of it 
 as they gather against the fissure of snow 
 as dogs in front of two pickles --our 
 
 alien 
 from younger balls through the setting rain, 
 hung in the water unvaried rocks in boxes 
 and stiffening in the branches 
 having written the ceiling
