LANDS, 

 
 who luncheonless, with wine, who could not use the dish, 
 kept with a note of the sickly text frieze? 
 
 tangled from the press of reacted, materialistic leoline. 
 
 it had been a religious potatoes, and a discarded pail, 
 or a saintly mansion out of chandler always 
 
 had reached the difficulty, the trees antpile 
 
 they lie down there drinking my fingers' bones. 
 sometimes we were not people, but fully knowing 
 
 enough of the word
