AND FALLS 

 slipping out of the house as if to clean the skin 
 of a tree or finger day or wheel on water 
 
 why did anyone smooth my hair as i bent 
 but where, i think, 
 part of those feet on the bi-lo 
 
 the lines are not hitting with rain, 
 nothing i hear, hope not for bones or love. 
 
 
 the whores are parceled out at their gray waiters 
 the tragic monuments of types or shallow,
