THE MAY 

 
 that said what's whole, nor shame do assaying 
 with the drug running or its own shingles 
 
 body with the ruddy area, the astronomye. 
 what hides upon the mire, the orb glows in the nave 
 
 of your hand but the loud language with your chain long 
 and your words the bells of tearing the ground 
 
 can the fox come out, догадке bales 
 say if this is to say they loved me-- 
 and not how
