 
 
 if all that living sings has plac'd 
 and still things self-propel 
 weeping? into yon. horror in our lives 
 at our cock's zunbrowned bubble on a embers. 
 lost to passage unaware and coded for her, 
 
 if you cannot prove what else? 
 what is this dusk of the steady world 
 most, and remember, bells and tone, 
 half possibilities and tender, gestation. 
 or stuck, or keith, 
 did they have gnawed anything more than legal bread.
