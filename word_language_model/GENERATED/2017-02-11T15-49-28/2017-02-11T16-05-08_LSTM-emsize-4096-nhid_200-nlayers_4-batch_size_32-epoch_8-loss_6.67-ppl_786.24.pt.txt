ME BACK OLD ENOUGH, 

 have you tell me your designs forgive me? 
 
 strange children not search, but fresh is obnoxious as be 
 and wherefore, dreaming as a stranger passes, let alone 
 a million yearnings farther and more loud, these men, 
 let you, if this domestic method, 
 can you call images of us? let no earth-born voice 
 recite to the gods we shall only know of our soul-- 
 
 as is that the captain the fate allows 
 fifty photos
