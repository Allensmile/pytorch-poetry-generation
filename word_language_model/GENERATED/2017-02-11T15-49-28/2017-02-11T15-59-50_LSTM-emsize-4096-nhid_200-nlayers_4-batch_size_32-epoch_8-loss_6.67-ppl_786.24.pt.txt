THEIR GUNS. 

 first winter i turned away, i was 
 
 the orange spikes. the wing at the avenues 
 pierced up with sides. 
 
 
 everywhere in june outside other agonies. 
 beneath a wood beside a maple mat stairs, 
 light and carpeted window across the yearning, 
 years after the wild green, 
 scattered slowly in the leafy sky, 
 pupa in field and nodding timber 
 in the spruce pools, its handicap? 
 the dark of the lively, boats and stones,
