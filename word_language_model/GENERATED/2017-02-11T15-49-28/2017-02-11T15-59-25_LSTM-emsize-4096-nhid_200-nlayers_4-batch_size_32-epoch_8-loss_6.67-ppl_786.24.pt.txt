TO CALL, 

 habits of delight called my thoughts 
 and my own name then i leave my talk 
 
 four after four years, obtain 
 the roads that transcend one formula they are 
 remind me, eat you, but all best things 
 th'ow us, somehow--mark? thrumming and pen 
 not the sugar for the distant living, 
 well, as i must much pity your edge 
 failure that i therefore wish to spite 
 saying for my sake, i weep against the soul 
 answers
