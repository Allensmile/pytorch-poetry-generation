CANYONS 

 from the mediterranean electrons. 
 
 
 this creek comes back and grows mad, but is christ dropping up arms in the heat of the storm.

 i want to know 
 these men to see them 
 
 they came therein, and i looked 
 
 at that fish calling 
 off their wings 
 
 they had some women. 
 
 i know his light 
 
 but its blank hands 
 
 can break me
