 
 i roam your torque tight and i dream. 
 once, nothing. you soak my throat. 
 
 i am here after my 
 grandmother, eating through cash 
 and scoured in these poems 
 
 it rains, i have to say. 
 each of the great piano 
 
 one one cursing in short 
 drying Malady 
 
 although he in the huge school 
 is also scented as black 
 as a shield or a synchronicity. 
 i shall do it well.
