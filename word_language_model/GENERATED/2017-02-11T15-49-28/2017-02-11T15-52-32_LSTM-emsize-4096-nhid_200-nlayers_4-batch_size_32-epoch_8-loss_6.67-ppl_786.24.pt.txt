CHASMS, 

 
 curled and girdle 
 
 with their halcyon hold 
 
 of a male expanse four o'clock 
 
 held a black face into temples 
 
 and embraces. legend-- mites 
 
 released 
 
 as he took the bracelets 
 
 whose life if he could, 
 
 and pyrotechnics 
 
 ing in the flight of when? 
 
 
 whiskery morning, 
 
 possessed with music, googling throttl'd 
 from the river buildings, 
 
 john younger clothing.
