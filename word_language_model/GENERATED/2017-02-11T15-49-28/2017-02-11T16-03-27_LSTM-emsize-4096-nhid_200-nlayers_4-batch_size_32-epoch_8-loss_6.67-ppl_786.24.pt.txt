CONFIND, 

 
 and the animal sun is either quiet 
 and shadow around, the next consumed 
 
 sunrise and the branch of a stranger. 
 bolingbroke and corn. the 
 
 garden by lichen, 
 
 a voice 
 moves down on 
 bridge 
 a branch of 
 
 cold frost 
 the waves rinses 
 
 
 the world with moaning terror 
 has wreathed my hair 
 wrote in quiet, 
 
 that light, the good months i no longer 
 speak to
