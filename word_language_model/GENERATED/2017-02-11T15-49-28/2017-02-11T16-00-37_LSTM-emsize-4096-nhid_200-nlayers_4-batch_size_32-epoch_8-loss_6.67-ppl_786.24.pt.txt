 as if kings could goe, 
 the good after, and let it lie. 
 
 
 the guilt were not the memory of all that, 
 were all forgotten any corner-store boat 
 on which did draw her jesse, serpent, car-wash, 
 kin of illusion, pride, mad away.while 
 do they know that even as brave as you are young 
 you knew that even by our eternity, 
 not seeing others fit in little distal 
 only in the stone of our shining employ.
