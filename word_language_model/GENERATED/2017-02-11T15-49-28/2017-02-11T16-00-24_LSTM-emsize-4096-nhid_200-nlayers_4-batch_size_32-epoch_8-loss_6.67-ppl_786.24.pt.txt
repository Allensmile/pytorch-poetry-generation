AND BORES 

 
 your hair at the edge of the house -- 
 how can i make you await your existence 
 without getting little any victim nor law 
 like aught with princes for the loss upon 
 be the other to find under his fate from being 
 yon tower sweat-darkened set up in time 
 and if his room scatter your combined joy. 
 
 
 
 in my arms, have you asked long. 
 its triggers are so microphone dull 
 the objects
