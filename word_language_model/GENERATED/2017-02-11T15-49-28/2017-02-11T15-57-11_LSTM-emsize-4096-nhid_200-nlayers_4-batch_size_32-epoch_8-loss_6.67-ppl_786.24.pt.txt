CRATES 

 
 in another poetic place 
 into ideas by ghost to right, 
 instead of being totally kind to us 
 
 dove dead 
 many passionate 
 skeleton passed back 
 
 nothing is always remembering 
 what is rock boxes inside failure 
 in lee's finnell, labor, 
 
 but just a lives when yet we speak 
 the bellman paid eaten. no one could have, 
 & yet at last we sang, 
 were caused to worry we brought us clean, 
 spears
