PAST 

 the middle of the ruin met to speak. 
 
 is it in silence somewhere. 
 it will be good to spill, 
 no longer delicately 
 save that to their breathing, 
 or that the crows have ever dreamed 
 if they're bringing attention 
 soul & hum 
 
 lively like asia on this hill. 
 it is firm, then is getting either 
 and the hawk water is touching them 
 until it dies 
 cannot be slow again.
