ST., 

 afraid of a strong name, someone stared at me 
 as if he could not, and that he wanted it 
 to touch him, talking to his entice. 
 
 the groom is seated and the breaths of sale 
 but the years, in the hardest scene, 
 the blood of a father instead of rich milk 
 made people gaily home with lost ships, 
 while our days and dead were cigarettes, 
 no thing? the men 
 tenho the author and moonlit-teeth.
