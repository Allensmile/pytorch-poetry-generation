 before south and all the ladder go out 
 at brag. thomas after station, 
 on dusty banks of stooped on the clouted chair 
 he murmured from the marsh table's tire to hail 
 or is it safe gnarls from the well overhead, 
 scything sea exhaust like birthed 
 darkest ideas and politics 
 make men wonky by the end of immensity 
 through lightning without space and good name 
 
 rock of a world - hous'd and hears what has dreamed
