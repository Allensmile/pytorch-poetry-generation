 spondee's saver 
 hot. 
 
 have different sun 
 to those devlin 
 armoury. 
 
 why have you dragon-flies me? 
 and now i got a thought to you 
 
 but since i was felt illuminated 
 by burning around them 
 
 in his way 
 
 the broughtst breeze, 
 lunchbox and that time are 
 
 growing close in that shower, 
 inside that surface, 
 
 and everyone pressed down 
 to self-pity. 
 
 some ole love is itself
