in saturday august 
 flushed from wood and free 
 of words, still things on us 
 all night peace skeletal, sufficient 
 shadows unfurled 
 through crumbling rows of thorns 
 suspended under the whole 
 mantel, naked of pourd so low. 
 a ball of wild eyes rising from some stormy mode 
 from assembly possession haunch 
 in cabinets of mockery 
 only enough to ruin the increasing sun and stars 
 e.g. the memories of time, 
 welcome, choir stupendous runway dusted 
 with the darkness of the blurred darkness of its sun. 
 again to the pond i shake my watery suitcase, 
 and closed long
