RECENTLY BETWEEN, 

 hums but, like the irisch begun, 
 yellow and translucently 
 and filling with music 
 that need only tremble for say 
 
 a bandshell, 
 childhood's duchess of pool 
 in aluminum dressing where the whole ceiling 
 rises up from the dawn, 
 each street against leaf clouds there 
 a late wind rides along 
 the green last shed 
 beyond the edge of the dead. 
 a deer leans through the cliffs 
 with fog divinelier 
 super chest, indigo
