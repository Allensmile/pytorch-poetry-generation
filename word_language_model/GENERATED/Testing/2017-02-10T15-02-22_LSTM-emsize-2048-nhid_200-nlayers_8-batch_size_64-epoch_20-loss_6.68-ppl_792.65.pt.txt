 
 
 no one is no day inevitable i've seized in a house 
 on a boy with a set of sweetness and a beares, 
 deep at bugs, on the visit of the cross-ties 
 an immense maple beside crystal bronze brilliant colour 
 
 into the rights o' bones left every shore? 
 we circle the workshops, of old water--never tubes. 
 fledgling, red-lipped rings. people certs and topham, 
 throws, then went down. the crested day 
 takes you ya and tight & sickroom.
