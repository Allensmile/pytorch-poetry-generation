 damselflies, helplessness. i stuck the river wrist with stars. 
 -- when you leave me close the stump of your sunken secret. 
 i hear an visions, dragged under the ground, 
 we are watching me, among our song, 
 o disintegration. wine. here 
 
 
 
 i will hear you catch 
 his own friends 
 around my leg 
 in fresh rings 
 wedding 
 and art to me. 
 
 
 
 i could be this money 
 each night, this case well.
