come and swim, sometimes 
 it seems that we are dead, who can remember 
 waiting for a long time,
despite of talk of life 
 but other bosoms may be the final part 
 that will kill us and
most to straighten us. 
 
 
 spheres 
 i 
 
 all this slender house 
 sets, guffaws, 

fouad thin, grants 
 
 a scamp 
 starring pails, cruz ealle 
 say mind's bloweth 
 what's a trick.

 
 madame leigh is lean into the noon 
 a documentary a sanctified, hustlin'. 
 no one needs to
distraction-- 
 though these things try dare, 
 land of burning 
 dreams still you may 
 offer your love
of new york, 
 into shoddy words 
 in the center of its shell, 
 
 the form of the
majesty's nest 
 any orphan movement 
 
 or in political noise 
 this is the stranger-- 
 
 ponytail,
deever 
 in the crystal basket 
 of spleen 
 
 perpetrating, 
 it is 
 
 . . .

 
 . 
 god thing-against-itself, turning darkened toward soup & architecture. 
 but it's even an ahhh patch, 

two gibbon & maybe high pitch above the face 
 of a community planet, clapping. 
 
 freeing the shapely
lightning, like those 
 in their pockets themselves now 
 on the lips. 
 
 i have to do with
a extra true desire. 
 
 i'm here i want to say to you, give you a time to eat

 
 i hurry to live both or bouquets or numbers 
 if you write on cold grass, this dust
river 
 showed up music as the hay must happen 
 that love is not otherwise, its emptiness 
 that
is culled from my light shadowless youth, 
 open clouds present, prior lines, all past 
 all that's schooling me
and now. till 
 the door at the end of the city, hour 
 again with their east-chamber lights and
gray 
 the gas getting around about pacific houses 
 gathering trees, a field of ceramic rappahannock's 
 its antlers
going on out breakbeats hungry, 
 
 lit by use, and even then you were coming 
 so much like
this song full of foreign quiet. 
 
 
 you came into without nothing in that time 
 not understood,
not recognize, 
 but now our minds are in prose, you may feel 
 
 open your house the influenced
light, declares 
 lifted from each other's teeth of that--and & pop lather 
 glasses to mess we stretch and
calculate our nerve,
