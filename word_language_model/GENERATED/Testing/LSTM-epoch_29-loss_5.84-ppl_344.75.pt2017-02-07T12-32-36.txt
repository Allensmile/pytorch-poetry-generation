hold 
 into the locks the pulled of corn 
 continues to crack, 
 one indistinct thing, 
 set out the minute to lose. 
 
 yesterday they'll stand 
 here near no snow 
 for those who became 
 fish. they could hear, 
 its coteries, a call-- 
 a thing that made it hold, 
 in every moment 
 
 which is also rarely made 
 by any estado 
 or a substance of itself, 
 a sense of praise, which someone elegy 
 some tragic attics, 
 the heavyweight and routes 
 of its own blue cathedrals 
 and strings shine right. 
 
 in houston we sing,
