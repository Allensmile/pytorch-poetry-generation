cold 
 into staying extremely sweetly 
 with forks and untrammeled roses, 
 in haste hollering would excite for me

 beside the smoking bird montana. 
 it was a cave of garbage and albi, 
 
 such of a
murky day when i would 
 wean my heart you never sow. 
 when the waters were put on it

 upon my father's feet, 
 and stiffened his face round like buckeye glass 
 and i watched you last
then, i shall conclude 
 how can i climb upon the floor or rapt, 
 with long calcium idols woven
my bucket 
 and have shaken them away this ghastly agony
