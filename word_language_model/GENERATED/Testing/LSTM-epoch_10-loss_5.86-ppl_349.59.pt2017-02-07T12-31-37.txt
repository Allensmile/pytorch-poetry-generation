 
 you don't matter anything. 
 but when you die, we have 
 
 return, and yet we have met, 
 though we could never part, 
 but what we see is curious, 
 especially that our fathers are here. 
 
 our bodies torn, only 
 just more than the grave. 
 we aren't one another 
 of sympathy, and in that moonlight 
 waiting for to tense the shadow of 
 
 the big blue kitchen of sirens 
 i thought to an alien 
 or death that is what 
 a map which i once wanted all 
 
 
 and i remembered not yet.
