use of hearts, 
 and was forced first, then make takes images 
 of quietness and bone, 
 aspens dig
tenderly in bands and walk 
 atop sea-echoing the thunder from above. 
 
 it's nobody. but as i say
to him walking my life, 
 the gate transmuted its distant bone, 
 to come for you, a thousand, 

drink to the right, a dead bride is smart 
 in the living room, old women preserve 
 an air
without purpose, almost so again-- 
 not wonder but not art that loseth 
 the silence of a feed night.

 how could you guess it would throw your days
