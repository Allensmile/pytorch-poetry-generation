for the large fine poetry, 
 the fire stood close, not a warmth for halves, 
 modest or sad wonder--sometimes more humiliating 
 used to be planning conceav'd of quiet, fresh exactly. 
 no wind. . . et penetrate the shame 
 of an illegal dynamo parasol spreading glass, 
 converging to rise along the street open-- 
 my relatives gavest you, 
 you were all dead. 
 
 i guess better not 
 accounts of losing me-- 
 
 if i want to put my chances in a advance, 
 
 
 give me my size, smell the practice 
 of longing, and even by abhorr'd far. 
 why not?
