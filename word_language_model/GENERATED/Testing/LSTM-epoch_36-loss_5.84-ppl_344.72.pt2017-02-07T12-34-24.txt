for the beauty of every thing. 
 there is three voices in such a protective sum 
 of the earth's heavy distrusts. 
 
 i am the night i buried old god 
 though my life always flowed through the mire. 
 
 he loves in the gulf of a father, 
 until the archer can't let he eat my mouth 
 and think it's oneself, and pride 
 pronoun, benign. doesn't resist me 
 because he walks out of catholic terms, 
 perhaps, that i was born on tree streets 
 of an apple line one sniffing strong arm 
 enough for her gown to sit on my heart.
