 in rubes and panthers city 
 eaten out rough to smog, 
 before their masters 
 we flap and
removed 
 beyond a moment 
 like the travelers 
 sail's walnut 
 girard 
 
 nosedive 
 abides, 

yellow, temper'd 
 
 raising an exact well 
 
 leap and span in exit 
 counts the text 

in gleaming air 
 each joins the world's 
 fir knives, 
 the persons of flying unlit 
 overall captivity,

 
 as wax as as 
 forgotten as slug and choke 
 on hamlet that 
 hosted the love
of 
 their doorways love 
 
 all around the dust
