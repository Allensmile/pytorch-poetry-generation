a special cold sky 
 
 
 
 the light over my dwelling and on the kitchen i saw goodbye

 
 stop rising over the foxes gave the pines in my socks 
 and stretches their scissors, to blood
from the moist earth. 
 i open the door off all that's more 
 than every dream 
 the topiary
my hairy defence by the patterns 
 of my singular soul, or a memory. a man fights at the post
instrument 
 crushed by an other child at his stallion's act. 
 i think of him, if i can.
