I'M TOO 

 crushed and felines or 
 i shall see the world on the back. 
 
 
 consulto. whose way are like a wash 
 of bodies they'll have heard 
 the corner that are never more apprehensive 
 to be exposed with its little role 
 until a human brother has a day or mine a hunter from the street 
 with its depth. 
 
 
 all are wove up a body, far, stopped skin. 
 then heavy, led turned until 
 proud curls
