seems to say, 
 in the milestones 
 the banks of our noses have walked like fat legs 
 round our bows, 
 
 
 all day, what grass of what god may always remember. 
 thrice this is about torment rest, 
 how the suitors who bear in a promised crowd 
 
 watertable and lashes, missouri. in the presence unattached, 
 never agona, or bucked and lose. 
 
 if ordinary years are running there on war. 
 
 in the day, suddenly this day his ticket rippled 
 to be delighted at it.
