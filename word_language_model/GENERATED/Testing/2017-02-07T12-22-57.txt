 i assure them not one of your reasoning 
 i hate white shadows and spiders barefoot 
 weep not
for the day to see pain after the end. 
 
 
 under the bath near walks to a car
again 
 
 yesterday , 
 suggestive of the plaster bars 
 invented easy shapes of snow 
 infuriation of
drought 
 excel far worlds, 
 a basin in the sky. 
 
 to the roar of garden, 
 a
startled caress--like a man, 
 a kind of everything, 
 a woman shakes a finger. 
 although not mounted dayes,

 red sounds burn clear 
 like snow from blackest storms
