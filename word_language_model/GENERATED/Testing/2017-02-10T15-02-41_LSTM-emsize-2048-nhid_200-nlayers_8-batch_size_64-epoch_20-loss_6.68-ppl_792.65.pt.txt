FACE. 

 
 again the humble angry gelatin being born, 
 the flowers is just alight in the sun. 
 divided with ready molds. 
 
 stale dreams from humid brown found, 
 anna lashed in black, blocks, orange 
 and kurt of pode‚Äù 
 
 captains of such small lack 
 an old tattooed savior, 
 heroes and stole, 
 
 ages? there was 
 two more ideas even slow-acting, 
 dance in way--these emerson. 
 parsnips, audibly, breaking wiggle 
 from paper. one night paul
