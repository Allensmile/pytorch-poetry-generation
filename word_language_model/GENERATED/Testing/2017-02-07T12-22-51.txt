 though i must but travel astray 
 bright passions from
the golden door 
 greater than in the fire, 
 was silent in the furrows 
 
 of holly advertisements
in untutored blue, 
 or carcasses of clos'd or woolen extra hair. 
 gat float, hooked to rich fences, 

and rib levels retreating, 
 more gaunt than the sun at dawn 
 sent up your sleep in attic and
eye 
 led me to love your earl's name 
 are let her dream of things 
 grades and wild
dipper and the naked hours 
 the lashes o'er a purer
