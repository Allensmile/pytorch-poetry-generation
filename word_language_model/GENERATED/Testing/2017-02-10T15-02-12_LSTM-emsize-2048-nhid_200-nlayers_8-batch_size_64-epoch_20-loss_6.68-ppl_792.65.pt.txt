 god first and judgment could make. 
 this is north for her map. 
 
 although among knowing they jamim 
 feelings for bounds, the head planet 
 in the amoighty trees. my skin 
 
 ripe-red apple artery blue, 
 the sweet one on the plains stood in above, 
 the late paragraph burn. 
 
 
 the still weathered pill, of reason 
 
 odd human life ache the action of jesus, 
 
 and quiet ghosts of the brain, all that now
