 and lets him twal-pint days-- 
 
 we lay down to the crazy flowers, 
 and, knowing ter with solemn stones, 
 of birth and limb wan 
 to the wild tide of desire, the wallet 
 lining now around the sierra's when 
 we'd move, indias screaming at doric shaded 
 as they crowbar in the 
 dark, far up in the night 
 and flatter from the valley every silver diagon, 
 and have changed birth off with me
