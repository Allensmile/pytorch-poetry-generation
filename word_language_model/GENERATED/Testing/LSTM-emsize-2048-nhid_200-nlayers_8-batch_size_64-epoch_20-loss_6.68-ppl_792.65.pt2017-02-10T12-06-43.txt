 they stay upon the hips, preserved it. 
 to a vat of scissors, 
 at the moon that holds problem from water. 
 
 
 i went down Saddling street on black hollows? 
 
 setting to touch good vit-il et salt. 
 doves was white. 
 
 home--cold, avenue, shuttles hies. 
 
 follow the steps in waists 
 where there comes a grey echoes 
 between parched, boulders trees. 
 i felt the wind forget 
 and gather around your broken thighs
