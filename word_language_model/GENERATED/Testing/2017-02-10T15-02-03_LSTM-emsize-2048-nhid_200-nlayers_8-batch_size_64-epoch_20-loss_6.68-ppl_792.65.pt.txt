 
 
 the mothers was broken south, 
 the tide awake? 
 
 the monuments is wearing up. 
 
 
 rolle skies of feral steam, 
 
 somewhere, suffering and hills 
 
 the property of him who knows 
 
 how forget, envious rose 
 out to their beds of large blossoms & the hardbop 
 
 slap of the placid lake 
 sweet. 
 
 kind of cottage the world 
 
 laid coming past 
 
 while your belly dared,
