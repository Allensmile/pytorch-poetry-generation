the repossess 
 soap, beam and wall. that the story 
 is mellow. the feeling joy, 
 change is never
feeling to matters. 
 
 
 pancakes rushing off the street, snapped again 
 over trees and pieces, 
 each
with a parrot hat as well 
 as an retribution. not beautiful-- mysterious, bud 
 shines in one stroke as
sheep flies cupping 
 
 greats after the time lasts a moment 
 is official dress. 
 
 
 all
this you sat like a table at one week's house, 
 
 and she ordered the waiter at any rate,

 and took a ribbon of vodka through the sea 
 where jack reddens the end alongside his face. 


 i hated god identify. 
 
 a week later 
 when he glowed before me, 
 he. goodbye. 


 o my friends i'm just much of the driveway, 
 gus adamant. the rudder up, 
 cerebral black haw
of secluding 
 of greedy humanity, 
 all besides the world's helps, one knows 
 one must his bride have
alabama, 
 and the children get so shampoo, 
 and thinks of conflagration 
 then we believe, and maenads 


 the conscript chickens from the church 
 the swale behind the speckled 
 we all else, heaves like snow

 
 over some tender vacancy of sight, 
 over some inventory worn, 
 sharp executioner and each diamond 

radio-profile came round us like fire or 
 looking for seven deliverer 
 and no interested it 
 in fucker
in wells, 
 by erotic diseases, yzantines 
 all kinds of filaments and conditions 
 that bought us in t.
newspaper? 
 visibility in the metaphysical night 
 we talked about that time we dropped 
 but churning the gaps
at the brink 
 of of stress square and curious upraised roads 
 we were free shapes hover as million-dollared

 
 buckets and bikes in their windows, 
 flushed against the heads of beauty? 
 let us not forget
those who who get 
 shouting to themselves. 
 the two 
 will the more supercharged 
 to help us
from the way, 
 the winds of their sleep the stars 
 we move accurst-- 
 
 she's the only
truth. 
 they die, 
 they will learn to all. 
 america appears now 
 again. all those years 

they have been to be doing 
 i hear lives 
 soldiers 
 because there are 
 hours, 
 

they do not now 
 get only yet. 
 they are all prancing, 
 i'm wondering why, 
 these are
my dead 
 rose-leaf
