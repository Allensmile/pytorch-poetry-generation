 before she saw the clear drawback of her house, 
 and not a saw forth as before. she gives a vision 
 to all of now and make to spain of banishment 
 yet as it makes her, having always found her, 
 by day she was most exquisite to know 
 what to do with us, she being pleader 
 and determined to guide, the first poison 
 
 still now to centre blowing down, 
 and past those lightnings, days, so now plaids, dyes 
 and strange stories . . . 
 
 in darkness they come, their materializing smiles, 
 the land of light is whiter
