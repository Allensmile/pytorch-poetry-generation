 a wall of stars in a canvas fire 
 where the stripes play to vapours 
 and through the panic you beside 
 the end of you has 
 always under fruit 
 in a place suppose. 
 
 the bells and the violet's 
 blank-faced unwillingness of molecular 
 petticoats? and the lost wind. 
 after the weary trade 
 must hang up in the blue ear. 
 
 it has ai, should make these pairs 
 to this other. 
 
 breasts bears green skies
