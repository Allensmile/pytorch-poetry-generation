SEEDS. WE CAN MAKE THE MAD, WE HAVE RECITED THE MOST AGE AWAY IN THE CAMPI. DROWSE AND FORCE 

 under the sun 
 when the lights grow at its tongue. 
 
 
 vi 
 
 a skullcap from the poplar companion of his hands slips at silence with oysters confound a boat. laughing girls for two he had a twig. 
 
 a warming thing, a shop of black light trespace. 
 and the womb that winds makes no hand shut. 
 one chinese tapering cell?
