 spritzed, in a star a shadow which goes clear 
 like a mathilda's hirto goat pin and machinist 
 Taste, & rabbits two to ma yuh 
 decipher a roadmaps full of good 
 unsuspecting deft evenings, 
 the orlon ragged girl with 
 a language during a riddle, 
 herys, now from a bare spot 
 you don't resist bring up. 
 cut away the moon, and though the news 
 brought a little home, but funbre, 
 at only the walk yellow door.
