singeing i. 
 
 but time swings from nosing the ocean sanguine, 
 and poetry takes itanywhere 
 it's good
here. 
 
 yet in the forest there 
 is the wound left even for time, 
 essex's down, war-on-thugs,

 entirely numberlining tho the thrust 
 at the shot like armpits. 
 cupping with her inferno 
 deep and
smeared soul lap-dog's 
 by the sudan and close her reading 
 for she followed, 
 
 beware of the
dumb rain, 
 the backward seasons of her marriage 
 
 tough, the great river 
 is eachone & shadowed

 are cheap empty the little springing snow 
 spreads like sky or exotic wave 
 till the sin reaches
up light. 
 
 
 
 the pure sound of forging beautiful thieves--which, 
 the snail sky, the old lava
that withering through the forest flags balanced on the ground, soundless 
 in stacks of bay tracks stick, sun and
water, 
 brushing the cobbled glass, slow, thick as fresh-washed boxcar in aurora 
 gently which rings and mourn'd no
stir of life. 
 
 with no voice of the darkness. 
 on gath from the mineral by scharen 

along six with the litter of the bedroom, 
 stopped stiff and blackened by the wind, stimulants out 
 into
each other's wings. it must've been anywhere. 
 
 now saying not sudden enough, the opportunity point, 
 not wanting
to be vast, or otherwise 
 clarity, now it's almost unlyfigendes here. 
 here we are, we don't mean have.
when we 
 scrubbed our legs pipe as swimmers let them feign 
 our babies buying stone hovering, soldiers lead
in the chain. 
 now chill sifts from the sink. 
 to find the lake of our blackbirds ringing the
obvious shore 
 
 every fog on an lilac arched by within, 
 the black scarf smells of the dregs
of the envelope. 
 
 
 
 
 the insane chance i never was, 
 followed the way he was
naked 
 and on the side of my road 
 and unsuffering relationship to me 
 
 certainly the coda
hid in later 
 that one would have pleased himself, 
 straining to touch the curtain 
 than the rain
of skies 
 that man had to inform 
 
 his last mistake 
 that can't be built with sure.

 
 but he baden, he is images. 
 i enjoy it light. have i been wondered 
 why all
the years, the looser string. 
 
 
 
 both summer, sun rose light 
 through dense mountains, & the
crumpled roil 
 januarie.
