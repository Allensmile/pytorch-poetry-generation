a strain of light is cold 
 braving the winter of the night 
 and soon one could last alone, 
 another moment led to dry 
 even to have limitless sag, 
 and make things out, and often, 
 all on with the wreath and bells crying 
 of beautiful hues of frog 
 and so it will ready, 
 yet if that water glows 
 but covers by blushing like wine 
 and one time which dreamlife--why her here, 
 it is inquiring to desire. 
 
 regard not, as with an suns, 
 crowded urinal shelves with a mill, 
 and when the stone speaks is writing.
