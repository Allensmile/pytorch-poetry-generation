 
 i see evening half the year before. 
 the sunlight dies one 
 woman with her ground. 

it occurs to me to know 
 where today, by knowing i lived 
 a cat, phonecalled--thru out, said that
she 
 hadn't too often heard. 
 
 yes. nothing woke her like a single walk. 
 
 like my
body hung into swollen back newly i made anomalies of 
 my own body. 
 there was a man regretted
perhaps the world 
 was too much to you when it was impossible 
 to take on, one of the
god, lay waiting 
 to exercise up against organs
