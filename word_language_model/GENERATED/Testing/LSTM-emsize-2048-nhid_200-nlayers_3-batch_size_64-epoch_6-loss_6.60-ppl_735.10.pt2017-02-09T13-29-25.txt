in your breast-- 
 collision with body-- of hospitals 
 to lead down without framed sirens 
 take body-double, i have flown there 
 since now i'm rubles, the door splashed 
 by the hair in praxis and alhough 
 then the window's leaves woman-kind in, 
 make a one for the rest, careless 
 of each eat'st, drunk with flask and rice, 
 steered and courted the city's blues, 
 ownest thing--a tongue treadle, precipitate 
 those black desire i've ponder and chance for embrace. 
 beware
