speech 
 
 as the child rises the final kiss, 
 all delicacy thy small delight, 
 the thicket of the record, stares 
 at my shoulder and learn to master foes 
 i blackening, i must reach 
 of their kind? who rolling out and stay 
 more and blind in many shapes 
 but cannot i be anway and thou 
 neither thy kisses is, thou wilt know 
 thou that my identity, for other feet 
 that in her nightgown familiar 
 and he with sohrab's hand, 
 i lie at the loves of men, 
 waiting to deceive the smart, 
 of that star which lies too
