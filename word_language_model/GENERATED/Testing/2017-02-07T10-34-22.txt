 
 
 and i defy myself this nervous poem, 
 gertrude of gilded bewildering prizd 
 for its duality.
for apparent 
 courtly human, 
 it has time for damage or relief. 
 
 anticipation on virgin-liberty 
 the
swan, the operative? it is a 
 thursday, as if to vaporize around them-- 
 from new old street. to
see its daughters' 
 twig trousers, dry. then the corner leap 
 the windes, then see on the track 

and buzzing god in the city scatter the drift 
 
 and the front door above the front wall 

that see a sprig or a black laugh and turned.
