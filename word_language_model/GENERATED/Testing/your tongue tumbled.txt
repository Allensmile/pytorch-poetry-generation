your tongue tumbled. 
 and fills my ears with dreams, like a pool 
 
 and a thousand ribs, wet and stall, 
 but i could still once leave it warm. 
 
 you know how it will be born. 
 for the wish it went to happen, 
 to resurrect things 
 to be involved as 
 for the can, to the very loss of joy. 
 
 but a little one 
 is unaware 
 that it is only a football 
 than if it may
