YO YA) 

 Just schooled the tone to death and laugh (take it, don't touch it out) 
 When I talk about these hoes I love the fucking pimpin (Uh huh) 
 I love her I love to tell them hoes the mo' love they plan to buy a muh'fuckin gun 
 I place my niggas to serve they light they float and ride for Sin 
 Show you homey how to come straight to death and you dig 
 And when niggas say Alonzo wishes Mobb, Huh?) 
 These other niggaz corny and all these M-M-M-M-M-M-M-Mary 
 Running round and round woman from Torres 
 Playing them girls to vanish,
