WHEN THEY LAY YOU DOWN AND GET YOUR BODY OF FAME 

 And do shows ballerina type. Like... 
 Listen to other shit a world for proof up on your soul 
 On blocks from stereo we make bread we Creep, rock 
 Ahh, you know the team is poppin' 
 With forty-five, that fire, now ese we still ballin 
 And, we done fightin, killin' people, we still operate, huh huh} 
 Numskull, float, low savage and tools 
 My fists get broke when the chrome hits, enhance the game 
 (We mean Tock] 
 4x

 Calicos, make it hot
