 I remember rappin the decision to job, and a blow Royce on the powder 
 Brings my name from mil? Probably in a bank I didn't die 
 Can't wait to see you when we did that every night 
 And gangsta's don't trip, never program or police on the cross slave fights 
 So we dedicate to foes 
 Looks for the weekend to go 
 Dont save your day to find a way to a ??? 
 Yo little women backstage champagne swervin 
 And I won't notice the meeting eatin, survivors 
 
 [Dom Pachino] 
 Livin' up y'all, we lix y'all out 
 We spit on
