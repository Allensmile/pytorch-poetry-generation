 Motherfuck speach and on the 39 game 
 I was seven four and ten times (thank it again) 
 I leave it at a mekin show I (cause I'm out this bitch) 
 So, watch the fall, cause I could self be given off a leash 
 Holding me a world to grab a six eye view Kaia 
 My world's sniffin, Danny shirts on my back 
 And figure out you can get use your lifeline 
 Me and KRS-One or longevity 
 Just doin' our time by storm lefts 
 Close to those who stand in a swim and bacon in front of the decimal 
 for bullet
