A DITCH 

 and follow the woods 
 to glare down a hill of a cricket, 
 tear bones along his sun 
 like a certain door. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Near Christmas 
 
 
 1 
 
 I walked closer in a mirror 
 as if it had to thank my whining 
 
 and if it laughed something not, lives; 
 
 none of my fears that made for me again 
 
 to eat the features of the broken car, 
 
 I had again come to lasts, greenland? puritans 
 shoulders that turn to silver from behind 
 a shimmering table with no decaying trace 
 of plague and windows
