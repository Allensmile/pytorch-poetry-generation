ANY DOUBT 

 That I could only walk again to being 
 As if one left collaborate for hues and of laws. 
 The sea was scarcely cold and strong; but not too mortar 
 And simply, by the heat it swims them Hamadryad, 
 Then feels it reading by the cherry in the dark, 
 Eyes blown from you from the corners of the world. 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Birth of all carpets 
 
 
 "I am raining and in my blood 
 I see in being the way my voices live? 
 If it would do much work at night 
 Where the dead men are: 
 Truthful 
 Like everything I knew to pass
