A SHELTERED WAY INTO THE SUN 

 & drop you out and leave the tilting flags 
 
 a dozen inches off from the bar 
 where the sun contemplation's 
 with no money 
 and having 
 
 body and wait and all 
 the death in the ground 
 missing lingerer 
 with what scraped it away 
 
 on a computer 6 
 
 Fancy, wild copses 
 Display 
 water leaping 
 like sailors in a black silk west) 
 wrapped in black sand. 
 
 
 6 
 
 There's a 
 deft upon at reach, 
 sauls in time. 
 
 One ledge 
 And suspicion swells 
 the comb of its long 
 new distances.
