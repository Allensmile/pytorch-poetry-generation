& Anne O What 

 Are many immortal movements to build 
 I dare not come to thee, clustered down, 
 With hand delight now dim, but above some ray 
 Of idling fitting my antique Aetna, 
 For if at supper one morn shall made! 
 The first impulse must seem to be 
 And knowledge in the captur'd Unmolded 
 Nor shakes the fleet of seasons, to run, 
 Where in its snowy reach the many unutterable 
 unbuttoner. gathering 
 Toy metallic stony panting voices
