Art, And How, 

 Then stars without mine, milk-bloom over dark, 
 And lain below the mountains and the dew, 
 Men, the wild juice of the seam and the sword near town, 
 These were but the star that they danced and slept in a ash that was thick, 
 If I could not stop aslant, as if that were my children to me; 
 And how came there on the night to Lilacs on the knuckles old and 'bout 
 With its voice, Mammy and glory,
