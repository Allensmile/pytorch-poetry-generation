By The Day, Reloading, Why 

 
 Gives me up, the hosanna? Perhaps 
 
 And I was clay alone, now poised in snow. 
 
 I stand on late wardrobe with onarn/, 
 Stuck forward on a bicycle cogs 
 From the California agilities 
 Moloch ribbons. the lost at Unfortunate Soul 
 I gaze at my friend and look at him! 
 
 Come while it's dying 
 And dipped into a plane 
 I'll hear the whole house come to school, 
 The needless eye
