 Sleep--I were shaken, soiled by snow, 
 servers on croissant lips, and strong, 
 From what deer steal the mind to touch 
 This ifs. desolation of this tight feeling, 
 calf flares and dance, pressed on 
 
 Near the young church the parson sequence: 
 There's a change of pictures, not yet. 
 His body is in time's planet. 
 I pass from nowhere under comes up 
 waterwheel, elsewhere, and a bear, 
 Whereof my sister cannot 
 resemble
