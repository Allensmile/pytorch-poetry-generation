Greaves Of Olden Initial Goings-On 

 On which I was no overcome? 
 no one's and no design 
 who open'd the highways 
 with a broken star 
 
 only breathing the next stone remains. 
 My eyes were heavy sky, though not 
 enough tonight I thought, the distraction is aware of 
 my 
 luck, but it was just ear 
 in the varnished occupation, 
 who was shy, curst the mind 
 bands of labor, like winter glitter 
 slid on the north, wings.
