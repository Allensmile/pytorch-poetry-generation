The Cleansing Door Exceeding 

 rain into a blue mist, -- the fish high,and 
 sew off for the truth. When believe! 
 masoch tiny, generous, Chrysler-scape of silk, 
 Enjoy himself to Fifth Haven, 
 The river is filled with milk and medal; 
 Like joyless benches the rent vortex 
 And frantic shoot the poor poison prophet 
 Bound by since zilch-- was a Winter's tarn 
 To hoo-doo out about in Inwrought 
 While only a sudden, bright and grey 
 Above the Kings sea
