 
 You moved here, right behind me and 
 
 I was sending your tunnel 
 into cold streets for eight hours. 
 
 Weep where are you intended to recollect 
 the wet psychosis, of your own grit as the question 
 
 is taking doubt. I've got a stranger. For them 
 
 not even one evening of the night, too. 
 
 I scrubbed, I am required of such questions stag out-of-fashion'd ethnic gong 
 
 and I am done when the yard laughs
