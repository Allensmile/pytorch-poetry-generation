 
 Hark! once the poppies in white imperishable HAPPINESS 
 
 Why so much live thy spouse in her blue heart! 
 
 blatant Thou shalt each feast has made! 
 
 Give all the things they will, and will be yours, 
 
 unshared. alike or mistress, 
 
 In their feeble dream, fain ever (Dichotomy 
 
 Nor bite they temper of their cause. So there shall be enough, 
 
 When we who shall recover at last, & all we shall not desire.
