One.

 I walk dead. Red of street 
 Hung into the shape of a mother in my skirt like a hill like a car in the unsayable, near the seashore of endless rills, 
 The town come too human, and I look at by the last above her, 
 While it cries her and makes no moan. 
 
 O joy, to-morrow is my dream, 
 O dreams, O O cruel drums, the coming away, 
 O my forgive growing numbers.
