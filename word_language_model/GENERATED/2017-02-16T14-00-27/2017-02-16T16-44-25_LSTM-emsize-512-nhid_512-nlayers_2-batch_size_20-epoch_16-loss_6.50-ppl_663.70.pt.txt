Slates, Mauve. 

 
 
 
 
 
 Sonnets from the Portuguese Mother's head 
 
 
 I have not in Heav'n but the facts 
 That have no learned to return! 
 Though they will never have me near 
 Even the day snapp'd our dust. 
 Every day you are sneaking 
 By the black weather. 
 
 It's sad, late night, 
 And you, anyway, without bread 
 Or assuage 
 That life's pain be you? 
 
 I am a woman costs a question,
