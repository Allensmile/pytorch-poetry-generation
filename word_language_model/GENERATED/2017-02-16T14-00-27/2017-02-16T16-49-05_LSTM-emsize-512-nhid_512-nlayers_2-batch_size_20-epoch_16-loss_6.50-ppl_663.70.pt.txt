Back To Hoowah, 

 and we laugh on. vice-nature, sunglasses, their bluer--with 
 the eternity. 
 
 I know they will understand my mind. 
 I've 
 ripped skiff. So like women, 
 in Perseverating woods, my partners loose 
 by covertness 
 turn to skim an attempt 
 to keep it through or in Sprouting 
 I like would be flushed 
 in pairs 
 
 nothingness-- ther-to 
 reduced to a barrio music 
 in cold entrance 
 for red-helmeted comas 
 of honor Habitation,
