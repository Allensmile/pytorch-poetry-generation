 (a perfect grace of sonorous hours; 
 
 The former redone more than once more 
 more hands that quiver, nor can burn down 
 to point, began to cross normally 
 Since we're pale, dead darkness. 
 I take to work myself 
 from that place where all things are done. 
 
 In fact, I say, Camouflaging this, this weary? 
 word standing in my brain, as the house 
 you lived in it, halfway out 
 still around. 
 
 Only the dock,
