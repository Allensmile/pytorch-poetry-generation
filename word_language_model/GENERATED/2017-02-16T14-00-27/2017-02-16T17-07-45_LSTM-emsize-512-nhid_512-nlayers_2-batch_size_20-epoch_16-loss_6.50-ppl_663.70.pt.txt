Criticizing Day 

 a Day-- can't you know it. 
 
 So deeply we fled just through the full walls, 
 the salt, every season, 
 we know it's several pulpy disguises 
 in the desert still and free 
 
 there are always beasts, the ones of children. 
 
 
 
 
 
 gemendo 
 
 
 Ne refuse me a sunbather the earth,-- 
 Suppose I won't worry a quiet time; 
 entire: it ludicrous, and gives me my report to college, 
 Runs perfect,
