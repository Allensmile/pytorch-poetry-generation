 By which the flint is difficult 
 We can watch the high dust, 
 And their padding is throughout 
 To shadows, as we pass for 
 The first time we were not unlikely 
 To wonder why that it was much. 
 In the beauty in our time, and the sea 
 Has made of the lost body, twelve feet 
 That sewed free passions, lives 
 columns of flowers, thick and shifting 
 Moves bones that live in rivers 
 black-sand and moaning Yaf
