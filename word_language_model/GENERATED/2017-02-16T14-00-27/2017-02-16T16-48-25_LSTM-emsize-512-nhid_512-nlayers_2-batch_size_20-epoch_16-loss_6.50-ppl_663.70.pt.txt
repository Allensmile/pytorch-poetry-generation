 That prying the distant night beneath our shoulders. 
 You will depart into a blind shape. 
 Why should it suffice it? 
 
 Small little boy in search of fine surprise 
 
 The Almighty pleasure of the Tuscan Lord 
 
 That yet--never Suppose she 
 
 Suppose she should consider each other in the soul by God. 
 
 It after all, past city, rayless and strong, and 
 
 Tabard, laundry badge is that, yet no low beam of a crow,
