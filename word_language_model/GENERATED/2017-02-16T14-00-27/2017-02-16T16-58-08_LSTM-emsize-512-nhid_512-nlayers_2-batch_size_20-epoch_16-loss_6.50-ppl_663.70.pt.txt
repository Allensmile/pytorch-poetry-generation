Hours. 

 Cold now, boys, that all will swamps, this moment not 
 That Garlic-stench might not sustain the argument 
 Of constant patience no men can sure--to 
 Unless much rest the world for faith, nearly harder 
 Than existence fully was, or understood, 
 The crazy act, in which it takes a sovereignty 
 For all a female Enlights 
 Whose wisdom grows his people, even felt 
 A self, hearing of that long tides which are 
 Like clippers, on shiny airy fields.
