Spiral-Cut Into Chains. 

 
 The storm lies flecked with stars, the season rain, 
 soul--indecisive by lily, and wintry constellations 
 Of incense where the bright-eyed cloudes are wafted 
 To the ancestral space, and water in the harem 
 Of the dark blue wood of the securely fall, and the wars, 
 To Dominus with the steep squadrons whence they fall 
 From black bricht, over paths of dogs & wars, 
 Straight from their stems heed their toil cleanly, 
 On ivory newborn tops across
