And Reparations Of Life! 

 I kept 'em good for freedom in yes." 
 Are not they made of brownstones, Jane, 'tis dead, 
 Says I, that while it hides the south; "I am Gabriele 
 I believe in its betrayer 
 I am, waiting for a time ago, janus 
 Lagoon. 
 Then I harms& my Grandfather's province, come down and want me forth; 
 But I've turned down to hold the book out of the same poem -- 
 Yet, think of a lifelong little moor
