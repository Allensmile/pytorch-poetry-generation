Naked Aproned Prayers 

 And trenches like hulls of ridges that shine, 
 Now over every shepherd future) in the kitsch; 
 Even the onset; and the rapture shake, 
 Baudelaire, and all that span: kings; 
 That conscience of power, cruel and proud, 
 And all the wintry shrieks of heaven and earth, 
 Mine, is dewy-dark like the Egyptian curve 
 Of solitude, a rope's pig one drop far by, 
 Than yet.
