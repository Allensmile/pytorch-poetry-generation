Heart 

 Diet black, goblin years ago 
 I find a friend once more and anon 
 To feed one away: my arm and rise. 
 
 I pshed his being remains to be 
 But left the boy in bed with his head of something. 
 Its need of fine courage to bloom 
 And suffer what I hate for him 
 Makes my hands by dreams, life, all you life. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Your Wish 
 
 
 My rising dog upon
