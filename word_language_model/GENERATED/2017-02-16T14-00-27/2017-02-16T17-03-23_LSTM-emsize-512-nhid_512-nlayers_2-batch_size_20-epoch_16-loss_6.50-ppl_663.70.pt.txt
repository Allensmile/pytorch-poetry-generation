Myself No More. 

 
 The Casually rags, I trust, 
 That wish musing 
 The sickly?--"A glory flew out of his black 
 In black dust, unlike the bride 
 That dead it seemed being called 
 To turn a refrigerator. 
 soote, at sleepwalking, portrait 
 
 Where truth and race are moving 
 Another actor watered 
 Old age but not dead? 
 
 Great is the source, whose love, isn't great, 
 Far asleep at the door.
