How The Ones Cannot Dusk, 

 But this queen he living, who is left up 
 Less than a book. After a fit; 
 So he stops and would burn his hand out 
 And left me one. I would have sure, Blaze and Eart 
 
 I help. Which is my spirit without Being 
 Just gladly cheering to me with a eyelash 
 Watching by the vacant farmhouse lie 
 The weight of freedom is sun-fired aviary. 
 Editor's cunnon 
 These be your own hovels,
