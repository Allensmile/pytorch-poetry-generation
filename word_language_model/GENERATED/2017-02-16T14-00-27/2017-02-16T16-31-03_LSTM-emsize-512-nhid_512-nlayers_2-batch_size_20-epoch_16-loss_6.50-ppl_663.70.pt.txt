That Unimprisoned 

 In a day or early evening, 
 
 A blade, a settled pulse of light, 
 EXXON; and tinkle like summer bay, 
 The garden clouds itself on the bed. 
 
 From some green October coal a tree; 
 A dropped parka. | one man, 
 To hear it hung the little listless sky, 
 And it 's not in time? Down like a monumental 
 Keeps a change full of the jungle. 
 The frail stare that came through with a ten-foot-tall
