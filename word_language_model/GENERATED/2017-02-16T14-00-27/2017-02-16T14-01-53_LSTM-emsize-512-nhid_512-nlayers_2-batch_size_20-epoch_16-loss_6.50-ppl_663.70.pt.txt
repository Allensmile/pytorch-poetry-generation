On The Ward, 

 because who but that tree comes from 
 the woman, the way she stopped. She washed 
 the hand of her gown in her arms. 
 
 She wanted a cushion unpossessed, Arrogance. 
 Gathers her dress, thick her legs made hair, 
 the Darling that turned her body back back. 
 The collar of Birthday. Riddle 
 is heavy and ugly, that queasy woman, 
 lying down low to the islands, 
 to her near the kitchen table God--for 
 I can love
