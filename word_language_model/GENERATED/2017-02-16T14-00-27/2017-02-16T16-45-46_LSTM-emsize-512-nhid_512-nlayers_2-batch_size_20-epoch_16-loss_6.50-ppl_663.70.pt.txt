 Parable of Gilead 
 
 
 I 
 Wilt thou go to axial 
 Thunder 
 balled-up wheel 
 Girl first reminds me and Heir 
 of the funny birthday thirty thousand years. 
 Ana, ring in the garden 
 
 searwum (Jane) 
 
 My father and mother 
 has a cat 
 who is picking up 
 by the foot of his stomach. 
 
 A deep, new lights; 
 was under the involved in the tokens;
