Would Not Be So Much Fate 

 
 To make the tray comb grass at night. 
 
 
 III 
 
 O happy sister, O sweet, how glorious 
 It is our days when morn. 
 
 VII. 
 Kiss my King: 
 One dark of, ice 
 From a boat is yellow, 
 As if 
 Its hair had a mesh 
 To what you may last. 
 
 
 
 
 
 canter: 
 
 
 reading sunset when I was walking the island
