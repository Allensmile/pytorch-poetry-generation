# pytorch-poetry-generation

PyTorch is an early release beta software (developed by a consortium led by Facebook and NIVIDIA), a “deep learning software that puts Python first.”

So since I luckily received an NVIDIA GTX TitanX (Maxwell) before leaving Hong Kong under the generous NVIDIA academic GPU Grant program, and having last week finally bought a custom-build to house it, and 2 days ago finally got Ubuntu installed with CUDA and CUDNN drivers, and having found that the Tensorflow 0.11 version no longer runs under Python 3.6 Anaconda, I decided to give a PyTorch example a try, specifically Word-level language modeling RNN

I posted results after 10 minutes here:
